<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Huhne (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, financial services should be the big winner from <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce, because the sector does not have the problems of physical delivery, unlike booksellers or grocery supermarkets. A financial service, whether a savings vehicle like a pension or a mutual fund or just a simple bank account, is by its nature ethereal and intangible.</p>
<p class="contents">Many transactions in banking and stockbrokerage are already taking place online. UNICE, the EU employers' organisation, estimates that nearly one-fifth of banking transactions in Europe are now executed through the Internet, direct dial, mobile phone, or digital television, nearly double the proportion in the US. In the Nordic countries of the Union, the overall proportion is more than a third. However, the vast majority of those transactions happen within an EU Member State. Cross-border <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce in financial services is in its infancy and it has not chased prices down to the level of the cheapest Member State. Indeed, the most recent survey suggests that bank charges vary more widely around the average than they did in the mid-80s at the beginning of the single market programme. There is a lot still to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive past last year was designed to encourage cross-border trade by enshrining the country-of-origin principle. This is one of the essential market-opening principles of the internal market. If harmonising rules is too difficult, at least recognise the right of any company to do business anywhere in the Union once authorised by one Member State. The key judgment was that consumers would benefit more from increased competition than they might lose from the greater difficulty of seeking legal redress from a far-flung and delinquent supplier. That is simply because the country-of-origin principle ensures the maximum amount of extra competition and extra competition is ultimately the consumer's best friend.</p>
<p class="contents">True, the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive allows exceptions still subject to national regulation of incoming services, notably insurance in unit trusts. In general, most of the liberally-minded market-opening fraternity were pleased to get it on the statute book. As its full implications have sunk in, some Member States have been quietly attempting to restrict the scope of its application and backpedal on its implications. This is the real significance of the Commission's White Paper on <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and financial services. It is designed to clear up the bits left out of the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive and the report we are debating tonight is designed to support the Commission's resolve to open up the single market; if necessary, by insisting on the provisions of the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive despite the reservations of some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must maintain the liberal thrust of the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive. That means also setting a clear timetable to include both insurance and advertising of unit trusts in the general country-of-origin approach. Insurance services, for example, are particularly suited to <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce provision. It also means basing any guidance from the Commission to Member States about consumer protection on real documented problems, not on imagined ones. Of course, there are real difficulties. The Commission needs to look at these difficulties carefully and attempt to set out a clear road map to allow <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and financial services to flourish. Consumers are concerned about security, particularly with cross-border transactions.</p>
<p class="contents">Soft law provisions, alternative dispute procedures, should be made effective so that they can deal with the vast majority of problematic cases and we have asked for a regular report on that. Some convergence of national rules on consumer contracts is clearly desirable, though this should not be used as an excuse to delay the single market. Some standard features of terrestrial banking, like applying the money-laundering provisions by looking your depositor in the eye to ask where her or his money came from, require fresh thought in an e-depositing world. It is also the case that financial services transactions are rarely entirely online without any offline elements, so we need to work as far as possible to ensure coherence.</p>
<p class="contents">The prize for getting this framework right is very great. E-commerce and the euro can make a reality of cross-border financial services, not just for business but also for savers and the extra competition will, as it always does, bring long-lasting and real benefits. So, I urge the House to stick to the line that we have set in the past in asking for opening up of this market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We started work having the benefit of the full text of the rapporteur, Mr Huhne's report, and so our role was very much to improve on what we felt was already an excellent text.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of the legal Affairs Committee, which was responsible for the E-commerce directive, we feel that the rapporteur's thrust – as he emphasised just now and in relation to the country-of-origin principle – is in line with our own opinion. We would add our voice very strongly to that of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs in encouraging the Commission to move down this line.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pick up a couple of points on our amendments. We are very grateful to the rapporteur for accepting all of the amendments of the Legal Affairs Committee and to the committee for voting them into the final report. We lay particular emphasis on the question of a payment and payment systems. It is quite clear from recent studies across the European Union that one of the things that is deterring consumers from shopping in the electronic age is worry about the security of their payments. This will be absolutely crucial if financial services are to move forward. So we have suggested a number of methods for improving the security of electronic payments. We have encouraged the Commission, particularly, to take a look at emerging forms of electronic payment. While at the moment a very high level of consumer transactions are made by credit cards, we think that new formats will emerge and that the Commission needs to take that into account.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, legislation has to enable contracts to be concluded by means of electronic signatures in financial services transactions. We pointed that out as a specific area to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very good report. I encourage the House to give it its full support when we vote on it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an excellent report and it was a pleasure to work with you. I can already say that tomorrow we shall be fully supporting the line taken by this report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at present two developments running in parallel that are very important for this field. The Internet is growing in importance. Trade over the Internet is growing more and more. And on the other hand we are in the process of completing the internal market for financial services in Europe. Our target is the year 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial services in particular, because they are not material, are pre-eminently suitable to be offered internationally on the Internet. I believe we will in the foreseeable future have a situation where customers buy insurance or banking services over the Internet not from a local bank but across the border in a neighbouring country and that the Internet is an excellent way of making comparisons in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important, however, that we win consumers over for this kind of commerce. It is consumer protection that I am addressing here; competition has already been discussed. But consumers will make <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce in financial services a success only if they have confidence in it, if the contractual or non-contractual provisions are in place to safeguard their rights and to give them appropriate help if they have complaints in cross-border business. I support the Commission’s initiative here of setting up extra-judicial arbitration procedures such as FIN-NET. Only if consumers are convinced that any problems they have in future will be sorted out will they make use of the net in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing was mentioned by the previous speaker: technical systems. Many people are still afraid and have misgivings about using the Internet. I still have myself. I am not going to put my credit card number on the Internet just like that. There are still reservations and inhibitions about that sort of thing. Online and offline commerce are moving closer and closer together and we therefore need to harmonise the legal provisions here, too. I can only back what the previous speaker has said, that we must abide firmly by the country-of-origin principle, that the Commission must stand firm. Parliament will also be making its position known tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In smaller areas, too, however, like the abolition of national marketing and competition rules that stand in the way of the development of the Internet – fortunately, this was included in the report – we need to move forwards in order not to hinder development. I would like to say in conclusion that <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce in this area will take a turn for the better, even if we may have gained a different impression from the stock markets in the last few months, but it will take off, it will continue to develop positively. We need to make Europe fit for global competition, ensuring that in Europe, too, financial services can be offered in this way. I therefore believe that this report shows the way and is a good step forwards, as is the Commission's support for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We know he has worked extremely hard on this report and very closely with others in this Chamber to ensure its success.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly the changing industry of financial services lends itself very well to the new technologies which have emerged and continue to emerge across the world. The ability of consumers, confusing as it can be, to pick such technologies, to choose a variety of financial services within the individual Member States, has been with us now for some little time. But the choice of financial products across borders inside Europe is even more recent an affair. This means that services, rather than physical products – and the rights of consumers to have confidence in the performance of those services – is as vital here as it is for manufactured products. The marketing and advertising of services, the claims and boasts of providers, must be checked against the need to allay the fears of risk to consumers, to safeguard their purchases and exchanges by electronic means. This is why my group has so high a regard for the element of consumer safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The country-of-origin principle is simply the best agreed way of approaching the process of harmonising the standards for attaining an EU-wide application of the guidance for those standards which are to be expected in those nations. At the same time Brussels, too, is clearly more than just an element for consideration by the Commission in this process. The amendments before the House allow for the flexibility required to pursue the exciting new medium of technology, as does the text.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I would like to recognise Mr Herzog's concerns, where he rightly points out in his amendments that we need to keep pace with technological change in order to reduce the possibility of criminality, of fraud and of money laundering. My group believes that so long as consumer interests can be asserted and maintained as an essential element of the provisions of this report, then it is obviously going to be willing to withdraw any amendments that might suggest derogations or deletions to the country- of-origin principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The liberation of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce is the element of any dynamic European economy of the future; the counterbalance that has to be struck and which has to be fully realised is the effects it has on those who would use it as consumers. I commend this report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have one comment to make.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all the scope for national policy. The country-of-origin principle respects national legislation. In addition, it is possible for Member States to deviate from the country-of-origin principle, but only on the basis of well-defined reasons. That is why, in the report, the rapporteur might have provided more extensive reasoning with regard to the effect the principle has on national policy. This would probably have prevented a number of unfortunate, socialist amendments from being tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the report is based on the assumption that more competition can only benefit the consumer. He should know the rules with which the supplier complies. Otherwise, confidence in <span class="italic">e</span>-trade will not grow. That is why the rapporteur might have been more specific in explaining consumer protection at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">If bottlenecks occur, it can become difficult to allow for exceptions because not all Member States will agree that there is a need for these to be made. It is therefore useful to continue to monitor closely whether <span class="italic">e</span>-trade will be satisfactory to suppliers and consumers alike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My colleague Mr Skinner has already indicated that our group will be able to withdraw most of our amendments if we can get clarification on one point that is very important for us and which is also concerned with consumer protection – and the rapporteur has already indicated a willingness to accommodate.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also willing to accept that members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who have a responsibility for financial services in particular, naturally have a slightly different focus than so many members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. As a lawyer specialising in European law I do still often consult the EU Treaties. Perhaps we should no longer do that so often. Because when I turn to Article 50, which is about services that have not been harmonised, I read something about a market location principle, not a country-of-origin principle. We are all aware that these provisions are creating a lot of problems today. That is why Mr Harbour, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, has introduced the proposal to amend the Treaty. If we are lucky, we will be able to do that by 2006 at the earliest. But until then we shall have to come up with something to cope with this problem. I think we have found the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive to be very well balanced in its conception. I was myself shadow rapporteur for my group at the time and I hold fast to the belief that by combining harmonisation, country-of-origin principle and a few exceptions, we have found a very well balanced solution that we should probably try to use in other areas, too. I am not a believer in magic formulas or cure-alls. We are now at last getting the Council’s Common Position on the distance marketing of financial services. We shall all have to put our thinking caps on to find a sensible solution for dealing with the problems that the Member States have also seen. I think we will make it easier for ourselves if we go for pragmatic legislation rather than fight over principles and stay high and dry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The Commission takes heart from the broad support for the Commission's objectives in the field of <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce and financial services – support evidenced by the report of your Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee. I welcome that report as being most balanced and constructive. I draw strength from Parliament's clear commitment to the country-of-origin approach which, if I am not mistaken, has been supported by all who spoke on this subject this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I welcome the report's rejection of any attempt to roll-back the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive in the area of financial services. That is a position very much shared by the Commission and strongly defended during the negotiations on the distance marketing directive which, as Members may or may not know, resulted in a political agreement at last Thursday's Internal Market Council. We will follow that line in future proposals and negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to pick up on a few key points made in the report. They are points which were also raised by various Members in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">On the need for a road map setting out what needs to be done and when, in May the Commission published a financial services policy group report to the Ecofin Council. That contains just such a road map and hopefully brings greater clarity about the way forward. Amongst other things that road map sets out the concrete steps that must now be taken to enable the country-of-origin approach to apply across the board to cover those financial services currently derogated and to be applied to other traditional distance training modes.</p>
<p class="contents">In broad terms, that would involve further convergence in national consumer protection rules, in particular by updating EU legislation which predates the <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce directive.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Commission's guidance, where it is our aim to add transparency to situations under which Article 3(4) might be invoked, I should like to inform Parliament that this exercise was launched in July. We are now in the process of receiving the first replies from Member States. I should like to assure Parliament that it is not the Commission's intention for the guidance to represent a de facto additional derogation to the country-of-origin approach and that the guidance will be reviewed to take account of progress and further harmonisation of consumer protection rules, with the aim that it should become redundant by the 2005 Lisbon deadline for an integrated European market in financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of this point I would particularly like to say to Mr Radwan that earlier this year the Commission helped to put in place a network for the handling of cross-border complaints in financial services which ought to serve to raise still further the level of confidence of consumers who venture onto the Internet. I hope that is to the liking of Mr Radwan.</p>
<p class="contents">May I further welcome Parliament's call for a single payments area in which it would be easy and cheap to transfer money across borders. I should like to recall that in July the Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation to align the costs of cross-border payments with those made at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I can also inform Parliament that with a view to making payments more secure, the Commission in February adopted a communication on the prevention of fraud and counterfeiting of non-cash means of payment, which set out a three-year action plan. This point was also raised by Mr Harbour and I should like to add that the Commission is looking into the possibility of refunds. I will inform Mr Harbour later of the progress in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I take note of Parliament's interesting suggestions that the Commission should seek to negotiate mutual recognition agreements with third countries, at least with those third countries that provide similar levels of prudential supervision and investor protection. The Commission finds that a very valuable suggestion and we should like to consider it further.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I very much welcome the draft report as its stands. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Huhne, for his strong support for the country-of-origin principle. Indeed all speakers this evening have echoed this strong support. I nonetheless express concern about a number of the amendments which were recently tabled by some honourable Members. Several of the amendments, unfortunately, are not acceptable to the Commission. They would shift the balance of this report unfavourably and undermine the strong support which Parliament has shown for the Commission's <span class="italic">e</span>-commerce strategy in the past. That support was so manifest and so vital at the time of the adoption of the electronic commerce directive last year, when Members voted unanimously in favour of the directive and the underlying country-of-origin approach. That is precisely the approach which the Commission, with the support of Parliament, would like to continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
