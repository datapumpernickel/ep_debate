<p class="contents">The GSP is a key instrument to put trade at the service of development by helping stimulate developing country exports to the European Union. The current system will be improved in four principal ways. First, the GSP will be simplified. Second, the product coverage will be expanded. Third, the benefits will be focused on those developing countries that are most in need. Fourth, additional GSP benefits – GSP+ – will be available for the first time to those countries that encourage sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The new GSP scheme is simpler to comprehend. It comes in only three forms: the general arrangement; everything but arms for less-developed countries, which remains unchanged; and a new special arrangement to promote sustainable development and good governance. The graduation process will be clearer, simpler and fairer. Graduation – the exclusion of competitive products from GSP benefits – will not be applied annually any more, but over the three-and-a-half year period of the regulation. This will bring greater stability and much more predictability. The new GSP scheme is a clear example of an integrated approach to trade policy and sustainable development and I am sure will be welcomed by Members here for that reason. The new incentive for sustainable development and governance will support our commitment to core human and labour rights and environmental protection in the framework of our existing trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The reformed GSP will be a more effective tool to foster export diversification and economic growth for countries most in need: for example, vulnerable countries like Honduras; poorly diversified economies like Georgia; small islands like Sri Lanka; and landlocked countries like Mongolia. My aim is to get this simpler, better scheme into force more rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the tsunami, the Commission has been keen to act quickly to provide relief for the countries affected in the Indian Ocean. The new GSP will provide better access for some of the countries worst affected by the tsunami, and we want to accelerate its entry into force on 1 April. The countries that bore the brunt of the tsunami disaster will benefit most from the new scheme. Sri Lanka will receive duty-free access to the EU for almost all its exports, including vital textile and clothing exports. India, Indonesia and Thailand will benefit from reduced duties and wider product coverage, especially on crucial seafood exports.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the Commission is working on simplifying and, where appropriate, relaxing the rules of origin in order to make GSP preferences provide the poorest with more benefit. The Commission will complete the revision of the GSP rules of origin as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to the amendments proposed by Parliament<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Overall, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sánchez Presedo, and the Committee on International Trade, for the excellent work done in a tight timeframe. I welcome the fact that the conclusions in the report adopted by that committee on 22 February are broadly supportive of the Commission proposal. More specifically, the committee has highlighted the need for an evaluation of the functioning and impact of the current GSP scheme. The Commission is currently working on an impact assessment of the GSP on beneficiary countries during the five-year period from 1999 to 2003 and we should deliver a final report to Parliament by the end of the summer. Furthermore, I am also ready to report to the European Parliament annually on the impact assessment of the new GSP.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn to some detailed points. The Commission is ready to accept Amendment 47, tabled by the Committee on International Trade, according to which ‘the Commission shall, in close cooperation with Member States, monitor the imports of [some sensitive tuna] products’.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am not persuaded by the committee’s proposal to lower the graduation threshold for textiles and clothing products. This would exclude India from the GSP for those products. India is one of the countries that bore the brunt of the Indian Ocean tsunami disaster and where 300 million people still live on a dollar a day or less. The time and circumstances are not right to make this change, as it would adversely affect India. In this context, therefore, a decision such as this does not seem justified. Member States are divided on the issue: some wish to decrease this threshold, others support a higher one. The Commission proposal for a 12.5% threshold is a fair compromise between these two positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are proposals that affect the eligibility of specific countries. The committee proposes a specific clause for El Salvador. This would imply granting GSP+ to a country that has not ratified a maximum of two ILO Conventions due to constitutional constraints, but undertakes to ratify and implement them as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I think you will agree that any ad hoc clause which downgrades two ILO Conventions runs counter to the EU policy of promoting core labour standards. On 4 March this year the Council adopted its conclusions on the social dimension of globalisation, which ‘recall its commitment to promote core labour standards and note the importance of the revision of the GSP in this context’. Furthermore, up to now, El Salvador has not shown any movement towards the ratification and implementation of the two missing ILO Conventions – on freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also recommends a revised definition of the GSP+ vulnerability criterion, which would make Pakistan eligible. Let me remind Members of this House of some of the history of this. In the wake of 9/11 we decided to grant the benefits of the GSP drug regime to Pakistan. Following the WTO panel launched by India against the GSP drug regime, additional tariff preferences can only be granted to countries facing specific trade, financial, or development needs. Accordingly, the selection of GSP+ beneficiaries is to be based on clear, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. Any specific clause for Pakistan would represent a <span class="italic">de facto</span> discrimination. It would therefore make us vulnerable to challenge and I do not want to risk triggering another WTO case against the new GSP scheme that would not only affect Pakistan, but every other developing country that was a beneficiary of GSP+.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also bear in mind that Pakistan is one of the largest GSP beneficiaries, whereas GSP+ is targeted at the most vulnerable countries, in particular the smallest ones which represent less than 1% of GSP-covered trade flows. But I would like to stress that Pakistan will not be disadvantaged. It will enjoy favourable treatment in the new scheme, as it will benefit from reduced duties for all its exports to the EU market.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that the new GSP scheme opens good market access opportunities for developing countries. It is simpler, it is more predictable and covers a broader range of products. By ensuring its WTO compatibility, it will provide legal security to our trading partners and on that basis I commend it to this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since 1971, following the Recommendation of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, non-reciprocal preferential treatment has been granted to developing countries, currently benefiting 177 countries, 50 of which are amongst the least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union imports more products covered by the GSP than all the other developed countries put together and three times more than the second largest importer.</p>
<p class="contents">The first GSP regulation of the 21st Century must re-affirm the European Union’s leading role in promoting sustainable development and trade in the world. The Declaration of the Fourth Ministerial Conference of the World Trade Organisation, held in Doha in 2001, recognised that international trade could play a more important role in the promotion of economic development and the reduction of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation is the first to be adopted by the European Union of 25. It provides access to a market larger than the 450 million people who live in it, which may become even larger with the incorporation of two new Member States. It is necessary because of the need to review the special drugs system, taking on board the requirements of the World Trade Organisation’s ruling of April 2004, which must come into effect on 1 July of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur takes a positive view of the Council’s consultation of Parliament within a procedure in which codecision is not yet applied. He believes that the new initiative should have been preceded by a study on the impact of the system on the beneficiary countries and more time for hearing experts, specialist organisations, beneficiary countries and representatives of civil society. That would have allowed the report of the Committee on Development to be linked with those of other parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes that the review of the system in the future should be better organised and more participatory and that Parliament’s role should be enhanced, without changing the balance of powers, although it improves good European governance.</p>
<p class="contents">We support Commissioner Mandelson’s initiative to present a revised proposal to bring the application of the Regulation forward to 1 April so that the countries affected by the tsunami can benefit from it as soon as possible. Even though its method for producing a provisional list for application of GSP + seems appropriate, the truth is that it only includes six countries and leaves out the majority of those that were benefiting from its preferences, and their exclusion is not compensated for by the increase of more than 200 products in the general GSP. For reasons of legal certainty, good administration and legitimate confidence, it appears appropriate to guarantee that the countries not included on the list can continue temporarily to enjoy the advantages they had been receiving, until the end of the present year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that compliance with the requirements for benefiting from the new incentive must conform to the requirements of the rule of law and the case of El Salvador will demonstrate this.</p>
<p class="contents">An end to violence and the pacification of El Salvador have been encouraged and supported through the granting of a preferential system by the Union. Though the current El Salvador Constitution, which has promoted a delicate balance of agreement, does not conform immediately and entirely to the new requirements, though it does fulfil its fundamental objectives, this should not prevent us from seeking formulae such as the one proposed in the report on compliance by equivalence. An excessively restrictive definition of the vulnerability requirement for accessing the special incentive arrangement must also be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes the provision of technical assistance, in order to create the institutional and regulatory capacity necessary to allow the beneficiary countries to increase the level of utilisation of the system, which is currently low.</p>
<p class="contents">From the sectoral point of view, I would like to highlight the acceptance of the compromise amendment, presented with the rapporteur for the Committee on Development, in order to link the timescales for the liberalisation of sugar with those established in the reform of the common organisation of the markets, as well as the amendments in the field of textiles and fisheries products.</p>
<p class="contents">Rules of origin, even when they are not part of the new regulation, are a key aspect and the rapporteur advocates that their form, substance and procedures should be reformed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has dealt with other future aspects, such as the preservation of the basis for calculation, the extension of sensitive products and taking account of the interests of the ACP countries that are not capable of concluding an EPA.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end by pointing out that the new GSP +, by making human development the central nucleus of any development strategy, must become the backbone of the future SGP and I would like to thank you for your attention and thank everybody who has participated in the result of my report for their cooperation.</p>

I can very much identify, and indeed agree, with the different elements he listed. Trade and development cooperation are very closely interwoven.</p>
<p class="contents">The scheme of generalised tariff preferences – the subject of our debate today – is a prime example of this. The amount we spend via this scheme of trade benefits is higher than the total European budget for development cooperation. A review of the system was critical as it was simply being underused and the excessively complex structure did not comply with the rules of the WTO. It follows that a simplification, an improvement, can yield extra benefits, and this is very significant, certainly if the countries in question adhere to the international standards for good governance and working conditions. However, in order to make the system effective, the Commission must review the rules of origin promptly, because that will dictate whether we can actually make it more effective for the countries. It is of great importance for the benefits to be generous and for us not to try to reintroduce protectionism via the backdoor by excluding all kinds of products, as the Commissioner referred to a moment ago. We support the new scheme’s proposal for prompt implementation on 1 April for the countries affected by the tsunami, but we are also arguing in favour of a transitional period for the countries that are not yet ready. It is also a question of trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention the relationship between the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and the Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), about which the European Commission is currently negotiating with the ACP countries. As the Commissioner is aware, the trade agreements are not uncontroversial; they are reported to involve trade liberalisation that is too rapid and too rigorous. It is therefore of the utmost importance that the ACP countries and, above all, those that are not among the least developed countries, should have alternatives if they do not want to join the EPAs. The review in 2008 of the GSP plus could prove to be a sound alternative for this. I would advise the Commissioner to really get down to business in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been said, this system is one of the most important instruments for bringing about economic development in developing countries and, as such, a fairer distribution in the world. It offers trade benefits to the countries that are most in need of them. In addition, the countries that perform well in terms of human rights, good governance, labour legislation and sustainable development, are given even more benefits through what is termed the GSP plus programme, intended as an extra incentive for governments to carry out serious and sustainable work in further stabilising and developing their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing GSP scheme is being reviewed, as was long overdue. To date, very little use has been made of the opportunities which this scheme offers, and that is why attempts have been made to simplify it and to make it more transparent and more objective. That will not be a guarantee that this scheme, or the additional opportunities, will be used more often. We therefore call for reform of the rules of origin and, above all, for adequate technical assistance to help countries examine how they can meet the conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">GSP plus should give governments extra incentives to practise good governance, respect human rights and so on, but the Commission only wants to grant the scheme to countries which already comply with it. In that way, it takes away the incentive for countries which could comply with it in the next ten years, that being the period for which the scheme will run. That is a missed opportunity. The report therefore argues that countries which will comply with the conditions for GSP plus in the next few years will be able to make use of the extra benefits as soon as they meet the criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group backs this report as now amended. The subject matter is complex, and I am pleased to have been able to reach a compromise with the other groups and the different disciplines. I hope that the report will be adopted in this form and that the Council and the Commission can accept the recommendations. The Commission wanted to discuss this report earlier for the benefit of the countries that were hit by the tsunami disaster. I hope that those countries will also actually benefit from this scheme. The good news is that the assessment which we were waiting for has finally been completed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The generalised system of preferences has been an important tool for supporting developing countries by encouraging them to participate in world trade. This openness arises from the EU’s responsibility as the biggest trading bloc in the world, and is in line with the positions adopted by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and the Doha Process.</p>
<p class="contents">Since January, within the scope of the WTO, imports mainly from China have entered the European area unhindered, and perhaps too aggressively. I say ‘perhaps’ because I must take this opportunity to express my disappointment that there are neither guidelines nor effective systems for gauging import levels, despite this being a Commission commitment for 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I applaud the EU’s rapid response to the tragic impact of the tsunami. The present amendment to the rules of origin will further open up the European market to textile exports from developing countries. There is a strong possibility that subjecting the poorest countries in the world to the simultaneous combined effect of the liberalisation of textile exports from China and the insufficiently selective treatment of the major textile powers such as India, within the framework of preferential treatment, will ultimately destroy these economies and regions. I am sorry to hear that Mr Mandelson is not sensitive to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We must examine the perverse phenomenon whereby the strongest countries crush the weakest under the very instrument set up to support their development. It is essential that in Europe, too, the opening up of the textile market to imports from low cost countries should be reciprocated by the countries benefiting and should be accompanied by the gradual adoption of fairer trade rules in social and environmental terms and as regards intellectual property, as proposed by the High Level Group on textiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear: if it is true that European textile rules must be adapted rapidly, it is crucial that we prevent that adaptation from turning into the sudden collapse of the economic and social structure in European textile regions, with dire consequences, particularly in terms of job losses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year, this system accounted for more than EUR 500 billion worth of exports from developing countries to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This report lays down the basic principles for the next ten years. I remain convinced, though, that this proposal for a regulation is too narrow in its interpretation of the objectives that were prescribed by the Commission in the past. After all, provision was made for a more effective system, which better accommodates the needs of the beneficiary countries and, above all, the poorest countries, which really need this system for their trade and development. A commitment was made to offer more clarity, more flexibility and, above all, more transparency, including a procedure for swift reviews, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that those objectives have been fully met. A step is being made in the right direction, but the reform is clearly not far-reaching enough. That is why the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe abstained during the final vote in the Committee on International Trade and tabled another five amendments today. These amendments have deliberately been kept to a minimum. They are reasonable and, above all, intended to put in place more guarantees that the priority objectives will actually be met. Our group would like the system, on the one hand, to benefit the countries that really need it and, on the other, to protect our own industry against unjust or unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are hoping to achieve with our amendments is simply to combat the inappropriate or wrongful use of the system, and so I do indeed hope that the rapporteur and the Members of this House will be able to accommodate our concerns, thus enabling us to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to point out the two most serious of these.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, the majority rejected a number of the NGOs’ amendments – which the Greens supported – with a view to extending the number of countries entitled to aid. The agreement means, unfortunately, that Indonesia and India are excluded, even though they have significantly lower average incomes than many countries covered by the agreement. This means that EU taxes to the tune of more than EUR 200 million per year are now imposed upon the tsunami-hit country of Indonesia. In actual fact, it looks as if the great spirit of self-sacrifice in the EU countries has been converted into old-style EU protectionism. We want this agreement to be extended to all the countries that comply with the sustainable development criteria, irrespective of their size.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is disappointing that we continually have to wait for the Commission when it comes to a badly needed reform of the rules of origin. Will the Commission please tell us when we are to obtain the proposal? Without it, the new GSP rules will not work for the benefit of those for whom they were intended. For example, another country hit by the tsunami, namely Sri Lanka, is affected because its clothes production only constitutes one link in the manufacturing chain. The idea is presumably not that the help we provide should, in reality, harm those who genuinely need the most help of all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So perhaps we are lucky to have Mr Mandelson as the Trade Commissioner; after all, he is rather more competent than the rest of the shower in the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If we go back to first principles, the United Kingdom is the fourth largest economy in the world, the third largest trading nation in the world and the head of a Commonwealth with 30% of the world’s population in it. London is the world’s leading financial centre and English is the common business language of the world. Why then, in view of all these things, have we been represented since 1973 by the EEC, the EC, the EU and no doubt, if the Constitution is adopted, the United States of Europe? Surely it would be better for the United Kingdom to sit at the WTO in its own right. Not only do we have a better relationship with our former colonies than most other European countries, but we are not dominated by the same protectionist imperative as the European Union. That is why Oxfam has awarded the European Union its Double Standards Award for rank hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">We want a British voice. We want real British influence and perhaps then we can give the Third World a real sporting chance.</p>
