<p class="contents">There is all the more reason for concern when the Commission is failing to exercise this responsibility on two fronts: externally, where an oil cartel is obviously playing a part in setting prices that are such a burden to the more vulnerable sections of the European population, and also internally, where another oil cartel is likewise maintaining excessively high prices, since the oil companies’ profits remain over-inflated.</p>

Allergies are the epidemic of today, and have typically spread throughout Europe since the Second World War. Today, one third of children have an allergy and, if we do not do something about it, in time half the European population will suffer from this illness. Foods containing chemicals and the polluted environment are to blame for allergies. Allergic symptoms can, however, be triggered by natural and artificial food additives, spices, pollens and other natural substances.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hungary ragweed is the biggest problem. Unfortunately, the European Union does not currently have an allergy strategy, as the Commission has confirmed at my request. Civil society organisations for allergic illnesses and many millions of European citizens who are affected expect us to act against allergies at European level too, and for us to do something towards prevention, stopping the triggers and ensuring that such illnesses are symptom-free. Action against allergies would also prove that the European Union cares about the health and everyday concerns of its citizens. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In June 2006 the social bureau took away the children of Bulgarian citizen Roumyana Ivanova, residing in the Netherlands. The children are aged four and fourteen. The only meeting with them that was permitted was terminated because the mother spoke in Bulgarian. After this date, the parents haven’t seen their children for a year, in spite of the numerous appeals. Contrary to the law, the children are separated from one another. The girl is at a juvenile detention facility for problem children and the authorities do not give information about the whereabouts of the boy. Even the ambassador is refused a meeting and is not given information.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bulgarian State Agency for Child Protection and other organizations are continuing to send requests for the children to be accepted for raising in Bulgaria pursuant to Article 5, 9 and 20 of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in respect to contact with the parents, fostering and care for them in their homeland. The Dutch authorities have not expressed a position to date. I am convinced that the Bulgarian public, the European public, should not remain uninvolved in the violation of international conventions and should not allow a second Libya case, only this time in the heart of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you, respected colleagues, to please express your categorical opinion on the matter before the Dutch authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is, however, a bridge in Europe which, although it is called Bridge of Friendship, still divides people. It is the only bridge between Bulgaria and Romania along the 350 km river border on the Danube. To cross it both ways costs nearly EUR 17. The fee is illegitimate and hinders both business and the free movement of people. It does not reflect the real costs for maintenance of the bridge. In 2007, EUR 12 million were collected on the Bulgarian side while only EUR 17,000 were invested in the maintenance of the bridge. I am convinced that if the European Court is notified it will rule against this fee. But why should the citizens of Rousse and Giurgiu wait for that?</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to the Bulgarian and the Romanian authorities to respond to the expectations of the citizens by waiving the fee for crossing the bridge between Rousse and Giurgiu.

Recently that country’s parliament passed a very restrictive act on freedom of speech, which may result in even further constriction of the already narrow margin of freedom of speech in Belarus. Its entry into force depends only on the signature of the dictator, Mr Lukashenko, and that is no more than a formality. The highly repressive nature of this act will above all impact on independent journalists and publishers. This is quite clearly a gag on the free media in Belarus, on independent public opinion and on a nascent civil society.</p>

Such actions, however, are passed over with silence when it comes to the country of the former Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs. I could quote a number of other examples.

The union involved in this case is the Communication Workers Union, and it has been admirably flexible in its dealings with Fujitsu management. The single-shift system they proposed to Fujitsu would have saved 60 jobs, yet in the final board decision on 30 June, with no prior indication from the board that a decision would be reached so quickly, alternative proposals were rejected out of hand. I would ask Fujitsu to reconsider the relocation, or at the very least to ensure that the only jobs lost are on a voluntary basis and that those who want to continue to work should be able to do so.</p>

Every year, thousands of men from Europe, the United States, Australia and Korea travel to poor countries in South-East Asia, Africa and Latin America to take part in this sickening form of tourism, and this almost always goes unpunished.

The European Union, too, can no longer turn a bind eye to this, and we must strengthen the role of Europol, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted to be able to tell you that, in this very short time, we have already collected 14 000 signatures. The campaign is of course continuing. I should also like to express my thanks for the broad support it has received, including from Members of this Parliament. Not only members of my own group, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, have signed; I have also seen the names of fellow Members from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and others on the list – which is of course most welcome.</p>

<p class="contents">It was quite clearly shown at that time that the communist regime was a crime against humanity, just like every totalitarian regime. After August 1968 in my homeland we witnessed another 20 years of various forms of communist violence and terror from this organised machinery of evil. Our respect should go to those who did not give in and conducted themselves with honour. Allow me to paraphrase the words of the Slovak priest Anton Srholec, Chairman of the Confederation of Slovak Political Prisoners: ‘We must never cease bearing witness that there are hundreds of thousands of honourable people in Slovakia, who made contributions to the preservation of freedom and human rights. It is thanks to them that we are once again on the side of democracy, freedom and rights’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The town of Khanty-Mansiysk in the Siberian province of Yugra is the site of the Russian summit and of Finno-Ugrian peoples, and in two days’ time it will be the site of the fifth World Congress of Finno-Ugric Peoples. The EU is also providing financial support to the Finno-Ugric peoples for the fight to maintain their identities. The speeches by the EU delegation present and the four heads of state, especially the Hungarian head of state, have emphasised how important it is that endangered peoples should have not only dance groups and choirs but also education in their mother tongue and self-determination.</p>
<p class="contents">This Congress has two messages for the EU. The first is that the Year of Intercultural Dialogue should not only be a year of dialogue between the cultures of the large peoples. The second is that we are facing incomprehensible phenomena when the parliament of a European country wants to vote to decide that its country should be monolingual when there are 75 regional languages in that country. If the EU and Russia consider it important to preserve the cultures and mother tongues of the peoples living in their territory, this should also be the example for the Member States of the EU to follow.

<p class="contents">Although the situation has now lasted several weeks, we do not know what caused the breakdown cited by the satellite operator, Eutel Communications, nor do we know when the breakdown will be put right. We do know, though, who stands to gain from this breakdown and who stands to lose. Millions of existing customers of independent, non-profit television broadcasting in Chinese and English are forced by the Chinese authorities to endure censorship of information from which they could have learned how effectively Chinese forces are dealing with Tibetan terrorists. They will not hear about the strikes, disturbances and problems that are happening during the organisation of the Games.</p>
<p class="contents">We citizens and representatives of the European Union treat China with the respect it indisputably deserves as a great nation that has made an enormous contribution to the whole of mankind’s heritage. It is a pity that in exchange for this respect we are treated extremely negligently by the authorities in Beijing.

There are many reasons given for the increase in oil markets. One is demand; the other is supply and the poor investment in infrastructure in oil for many years. Professionals in the oil industry and market are increasingly raising the issue of the ridiculously low margin requirement for crude oil futures. It lies between 5% and 7%. In other words, if you want to buy 10 million euros’ worth of futures in oil, all you have to do is put down half a million euros as an investment.</p>
<p class="contents">TrimTabs Investment Research, a leading US independent research service, has said that if their margin requirement was raised between 25% and 50%, which is the same as most people who invest in the stock market pay, it would have a significant impact on lowering oil prices. The low margin requirement in the market means that the market is open to manipulation. There is absolutely no question about that. I have no problem with people investing in futures and commodities, but this is a ridiculously low margin.</p>
<p class="contents">We must pursue this issue. The margin must be increased because the global economic effects are absolutely enormous and we must do everything we possibly can to reduce the price of oil globally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Polish President thus recalled the fundamental operating principle of the European Union, to wit, that treaties enter into force only after they have been ratified by all EU Member States. Application of this principle has hitherto been evident, and it was applied following rejection of the Constitutional Treaty by the French and the Dutch. When that happened – despite continuation of the ratification process for that Treaty in many countries – it was recognised that the Constitutional Treaty was nevertheless defunct. Unfortunately, after both the referendum decision in Ireland and the Polish President’s decision, voices were heard in the European Union, including those of some prominent politicians, demanding the ratification of this document by Poland, which is a denial of the essence of European democracy. I would like to protest strongly against these voices and the pressure and particular type of blackmail that they bring to bear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
