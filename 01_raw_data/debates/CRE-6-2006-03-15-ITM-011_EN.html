<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hans Winkler, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this is a debate that will naturally be dominated largely by the Commissioner’s speech. I can imagine that the Members present will be particularly interested in hearing what the Commission has to say. I shall therefore confine myself to just a few remarks on behalf of the Council, as we are convinced that, in applying the new provisions and the EU competition rules, the Commission is showing great responsibility towards achieving the objectives of competition policy in line with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The sector studies that the Commission is already preparing and wishes to carry out in further depth form a crucial basis for this, and the issue of market definition is also significant in this regard. It is important to bear in mind that the medium- and long-term aspects should also be taken into consideration when making decisions on mergers.</p>
<p class="contents">The economy is not static but dynamic, and so enterprises are faced with the daily challenge of arming themselves for the future and remaining competitive. There are more than 23 million enterprises in the EU as a whole; every day sees the establishment of new enterprises and the closure of others.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the debate that we held this morning, it should be pointed out once more that 99% of enterprises are small and medium-sized enterprises, which between them account for 80% of employment. Competitiveness also has a considerable impact on the labour market, therefore, and presupposes effective competition. There must be no distortion of competition in the internal market: that is one of the essential bases for the success of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Completion of the internal market and of economic and monetary union, EU enlargement, and the reduction of the barriers to international trade and to investment will lead to even greater reorganisation of enterprises, including in the form of concentrations. Reorganisation such as this is welcome in so far as it meets the requirements of dynamic competition and is likely to increase the competitiveness of European industry by improving conditions for economic growth and by raising the standard of living in the Community. This is perfectly in line with the Lisbon objectives that have been discussed today.</p>
<p class="contents">The present issue is currently being discussed in the light of the current examples of concentrations in the energy field, in particular. Particularly important to the public and consumers in this regard are trends in prices, which are negatively influenced by a lack of competition, and considerations of job preservation.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers can easily imagine that the only way of preventing unjustified price increases is through sufficient competition. It also holds true, however, that jobs can only be safeguarded in the long term if enterprises are competitive. In this connection, we should actively pursue a pan-European competition policy in the context of the four fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important task of competition policy is ensuring that instances of reorganisation and concentration cannot result in permanent damage to competition. That is why, as you know, Community law comprises provisions regarding concentrations that could distort competition either throughout or in a large part of the common market.</p>
<p class="contents">To reiterate: we are convinced that the Commission will take the right action and proceed responsibly. The rule of law and thus the predictability of decisions is also particularly essential to the success of Europe as a business location. To this end, the work on the more economic-based approach will have to be carried out in even greater depth. If, following an evaluation phase, it becomes clear that the legal framework for mergers needs to be supplemented in this regard, the Council will address this issue, too.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that it is not possible to cast all eventualities in regulatory frameworks; instead, a certain level of abstraction is necessary. The Council Presidency also assumes that, when making its now-imminent decisions, the Commission will exercise its judgment on such issues as market definition and the determination of efficiency with the utmost care. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe. Companies that are successful players in the European market are also well placed to compete globally.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will always look with concern at any attempt by national governments, directly or indirectly, to interfere unduly in the process of cross-border corporate restructuring in Europe. The Treaty enshrines the principle that there should be no unjustified impediment to the fundamental freedoms it establishes – in particular the free movement of capital – or to the right of establishment within it. Fundamental to these rights is the freedom for companies to re-structure, including by change of ownership.</p>
<p class="contents">To deny this possibility to companies as a matter of principle or by failing to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition in the markets – such as energy, telecoms and financial services – would amount to a serious restriction of their ability to adapt to the challenges presented by the integration of markets in the EU, to the rapid advances in technology which many industries are experiencing, and generally to the evolving dynamics of doing business in the Europe of today.</p>
<p class="contents">European industry is rising to these challenges, including by the appearance of an increasing number of cross-border European businesses. Whilst the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition in the Member State concerned, thereby contributing to the realisation of concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice. Take the energy sector as an example. The Green Paper published by the Commission last week was very clear. Sustainable, competitive and secure energy will not be achieved without open and competitive energy markets, based on competition between companies looking to become Europe-wide competitors rather than dominant national players. Open markets will strengthen Europe and allow it to tackle its problems. At the same time, the process of cross-border corporate restructuring enhances the competitiveness of European businesses by equipping it to succeed in global markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Any interference in this process by national governments which is not justified by legitimate interest as provided for in the Treaties, secondary legislation or jurisprudence, risks being seriously damaging to Europe’s prospects of benefiting from the opportunities presented by market integration and globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as you know, has two principal legal instruments at its disposal – the single market rules in the EC Treaty and Article 21 of the EC Merger Regulation – for addressing undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring. It has the duty to enforce these rules accordingly wherever appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">As guardian of the EC Treaty, and as the institution responsible for merger control on competition grounds at the European level, the Commission is determined to guarantee that companies can effectively benefit from the advantages of the EU’s internal market. That is why enforcement of these provisions is, and will remain, one of the Commission’s central priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The promotion of national champions results in national monopolies, which means that there is no competition, and this also means that there is no more competition in the European internal market. This scenario is bad for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">European energy enterprises face the additional problem that, if they are not competing in Europe, they will also no longer be internationally competitive in future. That, too, aggravates the situation in Europe. Incidentally, it also aggravates the situation for all other enterprises, as they have to pay the high energy prices and thus also lose out in terms of international competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I explicitly support the efforts of the Commission and, in particular, the Commissioner on this issue, I believe that the Commission’s options are simply limited. The Commission is trying to present instruments of competition law, but the famous two-thirds rule in mergers law almost always applies in the field of energy, in particular – and, as a result, the Commission’s scope for intervention is minimal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that Commissioner Kroes is considering changing this, but to do so would require unanimity within the Council, and I do not believe that such unanimity will be possible in the present situation. That is why it is vital that the Council, too, concern itself with this problem. Governments can be expected to abide by the spirit as well as the letter of the Treaties and of European law. Ultimately, the fact is that we want to see an internal market in the field of energy enterprises, in particular. That is why I expect the Council to become involved with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one comment on takeovers law: newspaper reports in the past few days have alleged that European takeovers law is promoting this development. I consider that inappropriate. Member States can be expected to transpose takeovers law, but this is a case of relations between enterprises; it has nothing to do with the exertion of political influence. The exertion of political influence is not covered by decisions under takeovers law at European level, and should be avoided and prevented. It is vital that this issue be put openly on the table in the Council and that an appeal be made to all those responsible within the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A dream scenario or a nightmare? I tend to say neither, but simply note that it is rather improbable that would happen.</p>
<p class="contents">The message of my group, nevertheless, is that President Barroso, the Commissioner and their colleagues should not be caught napping in the situation we now find ourselves in, with the mergers, acquisitions and developments we see in the financial markets, energy and other sectors – sectors that are all very important for the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats still believe that the state has a role to play in the economy as a facilitator, as a regulator and as a defender of the public interest. I do not say that we politicians should take the leading role and be the stars at press conferences, but we should play a role in silent diplomacy and in creating the conditions in a dialogue with companies; we should not only commence with what has happened but also anticipate what will happen.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I do not like your approach, Commissioner, which is only negative and seeks to prevent authorities from interfering in what is happening with companies. I think there should be a proactive approach and I shall mention three questions on which we should have a thorough debate in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is industrial policy. I was very happy with some of Commissioner Verheugen’s remarks this morning, which were made more from the perspective of industrial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second – which was also mentioned by Mr Lehne – concerns what is happening in takeovers and the way we organise this. We need a debate there, not only on shareholder democracy, which the<span class="italic"> Financial Times</span> and <span class="italic">The Economist</span> are preaching, but on other aspects too.</p>
<p class="contents">The third is the European approach versus the national approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why I fail to understand the problems being raised, for instance, in relation to bank mergers in Poland; in Italy, we accepted a takeover of<span class="italic"> Banca Nazionale del Lavoro </span>for precisely that reason. I detect a conflict of interest behind these problems, because very often these are companies that are wholly-owned, or at least majority-owned by the State.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a conflict of interest between the immediate political interest and the long-term interest, not only of consumers, but also of the overall efficiency of the European system. This also happened in the case of <span class="italic">Enel</span> and <span class="italic">Suez</span>, where a serious conflict of interest emerged between the need to rationalise our companies in order to equip them to compete on a global level and the need to avoid them being embarrassed in the very short term.</p>

European energy champions would squeeze out even more money from our major industry and consumers, and from us as citizens, and pass it on to the shareholders.

It is a subject that has caused a great deal of controversy in Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 <span class="italic">UniCredito</span> acquired a majority share in <span class="italic">Pekao S.A.</span>, one of the largest Polish banks. It was, as it turned out, a very profitable decision. Seven years on, the value of the shares has increased fourfold. When buying the Polish bank, the Italians had to agree, however, that they would not invest any capital in any company in competition with that bank in Poland. The acquisition of <span class="italic">HVB</span> and, by that token, also of another Polish bank, <span class="italic">BPH</span>, is therefore a clear breach of the privatisation agreement. The Polish authorities are therefore obliged to block this merger and to enforce the terms of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out that this dispute is by no means about the Polish Government seeking to prevent a foreign entity gaining control of a national company, as has been the case recently in France, Spain or Italy. Accusations of protectionism levelled at the Polish Government are therefore completely unfounded in this case. We should also remember that, while the European Commission has control over mergers at a Community level, obligations relating to agreements and the control over banks remain the competencies of national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the European Commission will take these arguments into consideration and that Poland will cease to be on the receiving end of a barrage of threats related to this subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A true market requires, firstly, that capital should be able to circulate freely and be invested where it earns the best return; secondly, it requires companies to have a cross-border dimension and the ability to set up wherever the interests of their competitiveness dictate, through the medium of mergers and acquisitions, which may even be hostile. The market does not tolerate the abuse of a dominant position that prevents free competition. An open market and one that operates smoothly is crucial for European competitiveness in international markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Protectionism causes the opposite effect, as we have seen in recent months; states blocking cross-border takeovers, mergers or acquisitions to protect strategic national interests. Protectionism really serves to defend weak and inefficient companies, or to create national champions artificially. The damage caused is significant for clients unable to obtain goods and services at the best prices, and is a serious matter for a society forced to bear the costs of uncompetitive companies. Moreover, protectionism is inherently incapable of guaranteeing workers safe and sustainable employment prospects. Protectionism means putting Europe into reverse.</p>
<p class="contents">To operate properly, the market must be efficient and avoid distortions. Everyone must play by the rules: we cannot accept unfair competition from those States and companies that, on the one hand, protect themselves, and, on the other, exploit the virtuous openness displayed by others.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we are asking the European Commission to take firm action to ensure freedom of movement for capital and unfettered competition. We are therefore pleased to hear the comments of Mrs Kroes here in Parliament. To have the courage to take that decision means really being a serious European: competitiveness, growth and the well being of citizens, based on an integrated market, are vital to prepare the ground for the birth of the European Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We will have to also perhaps provide for its review – this is included in the text - so that the power of shareholders is not that kind of blind power that, without taking account of any interest, or the State in question, or the industrial strategy in force, or the interests of the employees, could destroy companies that, over the years, have accumulated a know-how and a business strategy that could also contribute towards a European industrial policy.</p>

The first, between <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span> and <span class="italic">Suez</span>, is undesirable, because it creates an energy monopoly in the Belgian gas and electricity sector and further closes off the French market to competitors. The second merger, however, between <span class="italic">Enel</span> and <span class="italic">Suez</span>, could give rise to a diversification of the French and Belgian energy market.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of reciprocity in relations between European countries in the energy sector seems essential for a European energy market that benefits the consumer, and for a common European policy in the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In Italy, ample space has been given to energy companies from other countries by means of privatisation and liberalisation policies. This has also happened in other European countries. France’s breach of the principle of reciprocity in this case cannot be justified by a need to guarantee an autonomous energy sector by means of national champions, but is rather an expression of an excessively nationalistic policy. France already has its national energy champions: it does not need to create any more.</p>
<p class="contents">The merger between <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span> and <span class="italic">Suez</span>, which controls the Belgian company <span class="italic">Electrabel</span>, carries a serious risk of encouraging protectionist trends, not only in the energy sector, but also in other industrial, financial and service sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In other cases, the European Commission has strictly applied its antitrust instruments to prevent the development of dominant positions and retaliation by international competition. This has happened recently in the cases of <span class="italic">ABN-AMRO/Banca Antonveneta</span>, and <span class="italic">BBVA/Banca Nazionale del Lavoro</span>, which now seems to have gone in favour of <span class="italic">BNP Paribas</span>, a French bank.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to be hoped that the Commission employs a similar strictness in ensuring the free movement of capital, because even in these circumstances the principle must apply to everyone, for we cannot allow some countries in Europe to be more equal than others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are seeing takeover bids led by governments − as in Spain – or prevented by governments – as in France. This is all the wrong way round, and is contrary to the spirit of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are hearing political arguments from top politicians of important European countries who have no hesitation in questioning the fundamental principles of the European Union: the free movement of capital and full competition in the markets. These include arguments such as those we have heard over recent days from Ministers who appear to be talking about planning: the most antiquated and failed form of economic planning. They are quite happy to talk about protectionism, about economic patriotism, about nationalism; in short, they are using the worst kinds of populist argument.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of this, we must commit ourselves fully to European construction, which means the free integration of markets, acknowledging that there are asymmetries in those markets. Of course there are asymmetries! We have hardly seen a single example of economic integration in which there have not been asymmetries. But despite that, here we are, we have come this far, and these political positions simply add more problems and difficulties to the problems and difficulties we have already had to face.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about strategic sectors, but equally strategic are communications, transport and finance. Faced with these nationalist temptations, we would call upon the Commission to prioritise the objective and ideal of European integration and, in the face of this populist and isolationist attitude, to dedicate itself to the objective of creating a single market. In short, we are calling upon the Commission to do its duty as guardian of the Treaties and to promote real development and employment policies for all of the European citizens.</p>

<p class="contents">The competition policy is key, but it does not resolve everything in the field of energy, and nor does the internal market policy. To talk about energy is to talk about security and general interests. Energy is vital and it essentially falls within the Member States’ current competences.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently 25 energy markets with great disparities, asymmetries in regulations and operators who work according to differing strategic options and foreign policy commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a homogenised system with harmonised conditions of play. The big operators cannot impose or predetermine these conditions. A European energy market, with European energy services, will not create itself, but will result from the European method, from common commitment and action. Europe needs an agenda and leadership in order to make this possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We Socialists advocate a European energy policy, as laid down, for the first time, in the European Constitution. Rather than resentful words condemning patriotism, we need intelligent action in favour of Europeanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The decision of the French Government to create another energy giant by breaching the principles of the European market will have negative consequences. The merger between the companies of <span class="italic">Suez</span> and <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span> risks setting Member State against Member State just as Europe is about to embark on a 100% liberalisation of the market of this sector. This political initiative flies in the face of all plans for transparency and free competition, replacing, in fact, the right to financial wrangling that ought to be a part of a single market.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, France’s adoption of the directive on takeover bids, which the National Assembly will, after a long silence, take up tomorrow, gives cause for concern. A draft law such as this could obstruct <span class="italic">Suez</span>’s potential capital transactions by granting excessive powers to companies that are subject to a takeover bid. Faced with such an anomaly, we had no choice but to raise the problem responsibly, asking ourselves what kind of energy policy our Europe intends to pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to make clear in this House, Mr President, our fear of a dangerous drift towards a Europe made up of nations that are against the ideals and spirit of the Treaties, and against the spirit and values handed down to us by Alcide De Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer, Robert Schumann and Jean Monnet.</p>
<p class="contents">A Europe that has created for itself a single currency, that seeks to harmonise laws, legislation, statutes and institutions, that has created a central bank and that has established the Schengen area, cannot be reduced to a game in which national interests prevail over community interests, and where policy is fast taking the place of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The prospect of a pan-European industrial context, relaunched by President Barroso with the approval of the Green Paper on Energy, at last gives cause for hope. The Commission’s main objectives in the coming months must be to create open markets that benefit the consumer and to focus on global European policies that protect against national self-interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to takeover bids, in general, we must take account, for example, of the interests of the workers, which are recognised in the Directive on takeover bids, and, secondly, we must take account of public service obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Turmes said earlier, the large multinationals are currently demanding higher sums from their subscribers in certain countries than in countries where that free movement does not exist. Those of us from outlying island regions are wondering who is going to pay the additional cost that will arise for these regions in deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that it is not true that the Directive on takeover bids does not provide for political interventions: Article 4(5) provides for the establishment of exceptional measures in accordance with national circumstances.

<p class="contents">What has the Spanish Socialist Government done in this case? Firstly, it has systematically occupied all of the regulatory bodies and the Competition Court. For the first time in the history of Spanish democracy, the three are presided over by persons of known political affiliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it has blatantly supported a particular takeover bid for Endesa, to the extent that the Council of Ministers approved it contrary to the opinion-report of the Competition Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it has built a wall − repeated today by the Minister for the Economy and the Minister for Industry − to prevent the takeover bid by another Community company.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Prime Minister’s cry of ‘they shall not pass’, the Minister for Industry deployed all of his ‘weapons of mass obstruction’ to the point of changing the rules of the game in the middle of the match − which incidentally had to be rectified during the stage between the Cabinet and the Official State Bulletin − turning Spain into a kind of banana republic in which legal certainty is trampled upon.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to talk about economic patriotism, what Spain needs in order to continue growing and creating employment is more competition rather than more protectionism, more liberalism rather than political interference or haggling, more energy security, which means integration into Europe, rather than continuing to be an island where energy is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission, firstly, to clear up the political doubts surrounding these operations. As soon as the takeover bid took place, I asked the Commissioner to seek a resolution of the issue, because I warned her of the political risks involved in that bid. She did not wish to do so, and that has brought us to where we are today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would ask that the application of the competition rules as they stand be guaranteed. Thirdly, as she has said, I would ask for integration into a common market, which will be the only way to ensure energy sufficiency and cheap energy and into an internal market, which is what we want to see. That is Spanish patriotism and it is also European patriotism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is supposed to guarantee the removal of barriers to internal trade within the single market and to ensure that they are not replaced by other actions by businesses or governments which would distort competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, recent events have shown that in some Member States protectionist and short-sighted activities are being carried out. This applies to the German company <span class="italic">E.ON</span> which is trying to acquire the Spanish company <span class="italic">Endesa</span>, the merger of the French gas giant <span class="italic">Gaz de France</span> with <span class="italic">Suez</span>, the Italian-based, multinational fuel and energy group and the recent blocking by the Polish Government of the merger involving the <span class="italic">Pekao S.A</span>. bank and <span class="italic">BPH</span> bank, which is the product of a merger between the German <span class="italic">HVB Group</span> and the Italian <span class="italic">UniCredito</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">The opposition of the Polish Government has a dubious legal base with respect to Community law and shows Poland in an unfavourable light in relation to foreign investors.

That was the argument put forward by a large founding Member State on the question of whether a takeover of Danone was permissible, even though the company’s turnover and profits are predominantly generated abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The present discussion is astonishing. Everyone is in favour of his country’s enterprises going on a buying spree around Europe and the world – but not in his own country. I did not hear anyone in Spain complaining when the Spanish Telefónica took over the German–British enterprise O2 or when Banco de Santander took over a large British financial services provider. I did not see anyone becoming agitated about France seeking to buy up an Italian bank, or Electricité de France acquiring a stake in Energie Baden-Württemberg AG, or UniCredito in Italy acquiring Hypo-Vereinsbank, even though ABN AMRO encountered problems when it tried to take a similar course of action in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are seeing a great deal of hypocrisy here on the part of Member States and the Council. They are closing their own doors behind them and seeking to do business elsewhere; and thus weakening the European economy. We are labouring under a misapprehension if we believe that the Lisbon objectives can be achieved and we can become stronger by means of national protectionism, when we cannot even withstand the relevant competition in our own area. We need strong enterprises, and also enterprises that go to other countries and introduce more competition there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission faces challenges on two levels. It must examine each case carefully and answer the following questions. Does the fusion benefit consumers? Does it enhance competition? That is the Commission’s real task when it comes to examination, and the answer is often ‘yes’, and occasionally ‘no’. The Commission must take a strict line towards the Council, as confidence that Member States and the Council are thinking in terms of a European approach and of the internal market has suffered greatly in recent years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to other matters, I am impressed by the priority that has been given to the SMEs. The issue has been approached in a way that really represents a great step forward. The Presidency has not only fulfilled an agenda, but has also been very pragmatic in trying to find solutions. We are aware that it is not only Members of Parliament who are interested in the issue but others too, especially the SMEs themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very grateful to all the Members who, in their remarks, gave quite clear backing to the policy of the Commission. I also take into account that not everybody agrees on the policy. However, I sincerely hope that we are all aware that open and competitive markets are key drivers for growth and jobs in Europe. It was rightly mentioned that this is what we promised to deliver in the Lisbon Agenda: more jobs, better jobs and economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">As many of you have recognised, an internal market has enormous potential. We have to let our businesses and industries exploit it to the full. That is what was decided. It includes, by the way, the process of corporate restructuring. That is looking promising and it is not only a matter of looking at the internal market itself, but also of looking at the position of the internal market outside Europe. For we have to be aware that there is a global competitiveness and if we are serious in saying that we want to play that game then we need to be aware that we have to restructure in some circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">While the effects of individual mergers must be assessed on a case-by-case basis in accordance – there is no doubt about this – with the relevant competition rules, mergers between companies based in different Member States are likely to increase competition. This in turn leads to concrete benefits for European consumers in the form of lower prices and wider choice, and that is why the Commission would look with great concern at any unjustified interference in this process by national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the free movement of capital rightly mentioned by a number of Members, the Commission will uphold the single market rules, as you expect us to do. We will be tough against Member States which fail to implement correctly the provisions of the EC sectoral legislation introducing competition into markets such as energy, telecoms, financial services or banking. As regards individual mergers, we will enforce the Merger Regulation in a fair, objective and coherent way. You will recall that under the Merger Regulation the Commission has exclusive competence for controlling, on competition grounds, the effects of mergers with a Community dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I take careful note of the concerns expressed here about specific cases in the energy sector. I have no information at this point so I cannot discuss them. I say once again that we control mergers on competition grounds only, and that is the basis on which the Court reviews our decisions. As you know, Article 21 of the Merger Regulation also gives us a tool for addressing any undue interference by national authorities in relation to corporate restructuring. I would add that I will not hesitate to use this tool wherever it is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the two-thirds rule for mergers touched upon by some Members, will that rule for mergers be amended? The split of competences due to the two-thirds rule may lead to inconsistency in the approach to substantially similar mergers. That is basic. I think this seems particularly inappropriate in the energy sector, where an EU-wide policy on liberalisation is currently being implemented – it is not ready yet but it is currently being implemented – and where different players should be treated in a similar way across Member States. So, no different treatment in one Member State than in another.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is at a very early stage of its thought process. The first step is a consultation with stakeholders in the Member States on the question of whether it is advisable to modify the two-thirds rule. I am aware that we need the backing of the Council and I am aware how difficult that will be. That is a possible instrument and I am in favour of tackling it, but that is not my goal. The goal is to ensure fair and equal treatment, rather than one being more equal than another. So, if there is a possibility of arriving at that policy, from whatever direction, then it will be D-day for this part of my policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has a duty to enforce the rules wherever appropriate. As guardian of the Treaties we will do our job fairly but firmly, as was rightly said by the Austrian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you again for your support; I am grateful for it. We badly need to do our job as quickly as possible, for it is indeed quite hectic in merger country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
