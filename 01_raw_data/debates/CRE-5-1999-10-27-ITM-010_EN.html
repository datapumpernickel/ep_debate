<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gargani (PPE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, I would start by saying that in a letter of 6 July 1999 the Council consulted Parliament pursuant to Article 157, on the proposal for a Council Decision concerning Community participation in the European Audiovisual Observatory. At the sitting of 23 July, the President of Parliament proposed that the Committee, chaired by myself, should examine the subject, and in its meeting of 27 July, the Committee on Culture and Youth appointed me rapporteur. During the meetings of 22 September and 11 and 12 October, the Committee considered the proposal and the draft report, which it adopted unanimously. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Audiovisual Observatory, Mr President, is a very important public service body, which aims to gather and disseminate information on the audiovisual industry: cinema, television, video etc. It was set up under the aegis of Audiovisual Eureka in October 1989 and operates within the framework of a partial agreement which was obtained in the Council of Europe. As a whole, its members include at least 34 European States and the Commission of the European Union. With regard to its network of partners, correspondents and various organisms, its mission cannot be confused – this is an important and fundamental fact, which the Committee discussed at length – with Eurostat’s mission and its tasks in this sector. They are two different things. While the Community body aims for a harmonised, systematic collection of general statistics from various States, with the public and administrations as its main clients, who therefore provide it with work, the observatory has more specific and focused objectives, according to the market and the statistical requirements of firms and professionals. Moreover, its sphere of competence is broader: it extends into the legal sector, to specialist information, and its mandate, which covers the 34 States – and I stress this once again – is broader than that of Eurostat. The two institutions must not be too far opposed, or rather, they must not and cannot be opposed as they are in regular contact, have also established their <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> and have come to an agreement on the way their activities are to be carried out. On the other hand, the Court of Justice’s ruling of 12 May 1998 concerning the legal bases called for a better defined framework with respect to the past because of the previous confusion. </p>
<p class="contents">The new line concerns the preparatory measures of the audiovisual sector. It does not refer to former Article 130(3) regarding industrial development and the decisions on the basis of which a Eureka programme was founded for the audiovisual sector. A category seeking to create an infrastructure of statistical information has been envisaged. This should allow payment of the Community’s contribution to the budget of the European Observatory of Strasbourg for 1999, that is for the current year. The delay has certainly hindered and is still hindering the functioning of the institution. And I think – and moreover, this is the opinion of the entire Committee – that its functioning is important and fundamental for the European Commission and for the 34 Member States which are members and which continue to be active members in the observatory. On the other hand, I believe we will have the chance to cooperate on these issues with the excellent Commissioner, Mrs Reding, and I take this opportunity to greet her and thank her for her willingness on the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, having the honour to chair the Committee on Culture, naturally I also represent its position. As I said at the beginning, the final vote was unanimous and of the three amendments, two were adopted unanimously and one was adopted by a majority. On a personal note, however, I would like to say that I did not agree with the third amendment, in the sense that the decision we are about to adopt and that the Commission has already brought forward should have expired in the original text on the last day of the last month of the fifth year, while the Commission has shortened the time period to three years. I repeat that, personally, I have some doubts because I think that we are making a distinction between Eurostat and the observatory which will maybe not lead to cooperation, although that has been decided on recently. On the other hand, the justified concern which was worrying Mr Perry – he is a signatory of the amendment – that over the next few years Parliament would have to control the expenditure and budget of the observatory, will still be valid when we change the five year period, that is when we give the observatory the chance to plan the valuable functions that it has in a broader and more organised way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to make a comment: debates about cultural policy – a handful of people are present who are, however, by and large like-minded. I believe we have an almighty struggle ahead of us. And because there are so few of us, we must also stick together here. </p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the Observatory. As rapporteur for the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy that was asked for an opinion, I naturally speak in favour of the Community’s participating in the European Audiovisual Observatory. I also concur with the Commission’s proposal that the period of this involvement should be set at five years. As already mentioned, the Observatory counts 34 European countries as members and therefore almost anticipates the forthcoming enlargement of the EU as well. It does not just confine itself to market research and to gathering statistics and does not therefore only juggle with figures. Instead, it offers qualitative analyses and goes so far as to provide legal information. It is, above all, especially important to have information about the resources available to particular branches of industry. </p>
<p class="contents">Information of this kind is of course important when overseeing, evaluating and formulating Community programmes in the audiovisual sector, and it is of decisive importance to industry itself and especially to small and medium-sized businesses. This is where my only criticism comes in. According to my researches, it is, in many Member States, precisely the small and medium-sized businesses which know anything from not enough to nothing at all about the Observatory. And yet it is they which would find using this service of great importance. Respective contacts were challenged and questioned about this matter at various levels, and I am pleased that, at my suggestion, the Commission has made a really good proposal, namely to include a clearly visible link on its home page. I hope that this proposal is also soon translated into action. </p>
<p class="contents">In view of the forthcoming negotiations with the World Trade Organisation, during which the audiovisual sector will also be discussed, it is becoming ever clearer how important it is for reliable information about markets in Europe to be available not only to political decision-makers such as the Community bodies, the governments of the Member States and the social and economic decision-makers of the Member States and regions, but also to researchers, universities and the media. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Perry (PPE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am sure I speak for more or less everybody in the Chamber this afternoon when I say that we believe culture does not get enough money. The question is what do the Members who are not here think?</p>
<p class="contents">What they would all agree is that we must make sure that we get value for the limited amount of money that we have to spend on culture. I really need to be convinced that we are getting value for money out of the audiovisual observatory. That is why I tabled, and supported, Amendment No 3 that was put forward by the Committee on Culture, restricting our commitment to three years. It could be extended, but our commitment is for three years.</p>
<p class="contents">My reasoning is threefold: what substantive evidence do we have that the audiovisual observatory is doing the job that we want? Let me quote Mrs Dührkop Dührkop in her report on this. She said that Parliament’s own audiovisual services had a negative perception of the quality and usefulness of the paid services provided by the observatory. We are running a EUR 6 billion deficit with the United States. Clearly we are getting something wrong and we need to get that put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would say that we are financing statistical services from too many angles. The observatory itself: EUR 215,000; Eurostat: EUR 250,000; Member States’ statistical services: EUR 350,000. That is almost EUR 1 million we are spending on statistics alone. The observatory is used to perform those tasks that Eurostat cannot. We should be asking Eurostat and the Commission if they could sort it out, to give us the information we want so that we can try and get better value for this money. If I can say that in under two minutes, it is not unreasonable to expect the Commission and Eurostat to get their act together in three years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Iivari (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, audiovisual production has an important role in preserving and developing the cultures of European countries and Europe’s cultural diversity. The importance of national cultures is being emphasised with globalisation. The audiovisual sector is one of the most global of cultural sectors. While audiovisual production is big business, the cultural dimension also plays a major part in it. </p>
<p class="contents">Neither must we forget the sector’s impact on employment. The total number of jobs in the cultural sector in Europe is more then three million. A considerable number of these are in the audiovisual sector. Although the sector may be run by large consortiums, we have to remember that its new jobs are created primarily for SMEs. The work of the Audiovisual Observatory is important for these SMEs. We must safeguard the development of SMEs in the audiovisual sector. They mean greater competitiveness and more diversified production for Europe’s audiovisual sector.</p>
<p class="contents">There are actually 34 European states, plus the European Commission, that are members of the observatory. In other words, states that are only now applying for membership of the Union are also included in the collaboration within its framework. The Audiovisual Observatory will improve the operating prerequisites of European companies in this rapidly developing area. The collation and dissemination of information particularly helps SMEs to cooperate and, hence, develop. For that reason, it is important that the operating prerequisites of the observatory are safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that, as a result of a vote taken by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, it is being proposed that financing for the observatory should be safeguarded for just three years, going against the position of the rapporteur, the chairman of the committee, Mr Gargani, among others. I am very happy that Mr Gargani made his opinion clearly known here in this plenary session. It is true that Parliament must be careful with taxpayers’ money. At the same time, however, it must be remembered that savings should not be made in the wrong areas. It is better to support SMEs through services and not, for example, through business aid that distorts competition.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In discussing this motion, we can demonstrate that we also have some aptitude for effecting savings and making matters more efficient. The European Audiovisual Observatory prepares statistics for businesses in the audiovisual industry, work which Eurostat and the various national offices for statistics also attend to, so that there is a certain degree of overlap between these organisations’ work and that of the Observatory. This cannot be rational or expedient, and we should like it to be investigated whether closer cooperation between Eurostat and the various national offices might, in the long term, render the Observatory’s work superfluous. Even if the Community’s contribution only constitutes 12% of the Observatory’s budget, it is money all the same, and we believe that there is money to be saved. But, when the main content of this motion is “only” about reducing the period of support from 5 to 3 years, then there is also time to investigate whether Eurostat and the national offices of statistics can cover the need we have for statistics and statistical information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They cannot do this because, as Emma Bonino reiterated this morning, we are not allowed to carry out that parliamentary activity which is part of the very mandate of a European Member of Parliament. Therefore, Mr President, we have not tabled, or rather we have not been able to table amendments, or participate in the vote on the report. We are sorry about this, because it is an important subject and besides, in Italy, we have had a lot of experience with the European Audiovisual Observatory. It was precisely us radicals who were perhaps the first to independent create an audiovisual monitoring centre that monitors the frequency of appearances, for example political appearances, in various television programmes, news programmes and media. It would be important, and this was the amendment we would have liked to have tabled, for there to be, for example, among the Observatory’s duties, with a view to European integration, which must increasingly become political integration, integration of societies and political behaviour and integration of information at European level, monitoring of the various television channels across Europe for the appearance of parliamentary political activity of national political groups and European politics, which could thus take the observatory as a reference point. President Gargani, this is an idea I am putting to you as, I repeat, I am unable to set it down in a parliamentary act, which we are not allowed to do as things stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Audiovisual Observatory, as has been said, was set up in 1992, under the initial auspices of the Audiovisual Eureka programme. At that time it was laid down – and I quote – that “the aim of the Observatory will be to improve the transfer of information within the audiovisual industry and promote a clearer vision of the market, as well as greater transparency. Specifically the task of the Observatory will consist of collecting and processing information and statistics relating to the audiovisual sector”. Furthermore, in 1997, the European Council commented on the Observatory by saying: “Its services must be directed principally towards the needs of the professionals in the industry”.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, on this basis, Commissioner and Mr President, I wish to ask both the Commission and the Observatory itself to remain faithful to this founding principle. Although it is not the case with the Observatory, there currently exists a tendency towards the easy option. Let me explain: it is a reality that many structures and organisations end up tied to their public funding body, and this situation tends to take them away from their objective, which in this case is public service and assistance for professionals in the audiovisual sector. Many people have not heard of the Observatory.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I believe it to be appropriate, on the one hand, that the Observatory makes a greater effort to attract the interest of professionals, substantially reducing their increasing dependency on the request for their services on the part of the Commission. In that way their resources would be increased through the provision of services to professionals and greater autonomy would be achieved. This requires objectives and efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it would be suitable for the Commission to obtain, from external specialists, a periodic review of the efficiency and acceptance of the Observatory’s services amongst professionals, for example, by means of surveys. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, there is a report about a resolution to enact a Directive from the European Commission requiring Member States to ensure that no telecommunications company of relevance to the market should be able to operate its cable television network through the same legal entity. Another report is about the plan for a comprehensive French draft law concerning the information society which is to govern, among other things, questions about the free use of codings, about confidentiality in data transfers, about copyright protection and about necessary regulatory authorities. A third report concerns the latest judgements of the European Court of Human Rights through which 13 complaints against Turkey were heard and in eleven of which the Court agreed with the appellants and recognised violations of the law concerning free expression. All this amounts to far more than just collating statistical material, and I think it makes it clear why this institution is important. </p>
<p class="contents">This impressively casts some light upon the objectives with which the founding of the Observatory was originally justified, namely those of surveying the market and promoting transparency there, as well as collecting and processing information and statistics concerning the audiovisual sector. Industry and related areas, and also the European Commission, Member States and the European Parliament, have since reaped the benefits of the Observatory’s services in many different ways. It has not, however, had any binding legal basis, and this is now to be created on the basis of Article 130a, paragraph 3 of the EC Treaty and with reference to the fact that, as a provider of information, it is mainly to contribute to strengthening the competitiveness of the audiovisual industry by improving the flow of information. The transparency which is to be produced in this way is an indispensable prerequisite for political action on Europe’s road to the information society, even if this is not perhaps to the liking of those who want to throw open the doors to unbridled market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the fact that the rapporteur has come out in favour of a five-year period of applicability. This view is shared by my Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament know, the observatory is a public institution with the task of collecting economic and legal information from various international sources and to upgrade it by assembling it in an organised and comprehensive way.</p>
<p class="contents">The observatory disseminates such information via periodical publications as has been discussed in the Chamber. These tasks are fulfilled effectively by the observatory and the return on our participation in terms of support for the audiovisual industry and the Union is positive. Moreover, I would like to stress that were Community participation in the observatory to be discontinued, the Commission would be obliged to collect the same information from different sources – in most cases on a commercial basis. This would not only be time-consuming but certainly more expensive than the amounts envisaged for the yearly contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that consultation of the observatory publications, notably the year book and the legal newsletter, Iris, is common practice in the services of the Commission dealing with audiovisual issues. Moreover, the observatory’s advice has been sought on several occasions and in several areas in the context of on-going contacts when specific information was needed. I wish to mention the fields of employment, film financing schemes, international trade statistics, statistical methodologies, market trends and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future the Commission envisages extending the activities carried out by the observatory, notably in two specific areas: implementing a statistical information structure under Eurostat and preparing for the GATT 2000 negotiations. The active participation of the Commission for the next five years in the observatory will allow it to optimise the complementarity of the tasks carried out by Eurostat and the observatory itself. The aim is to create, at the end of a five-year period, a harmonised official EU set of statistics for the audiovisual sector. I would like to stress that the activities of the observatory and Eurostat do not overlap in terms of period covered, geographical scope or output and could be usefully coordinated in order to achieve a clear view of the complex reality in the audiovisual sector. The Commission services are best placed to carry out this task.</p>
<p class="contents">With your understanding, Mr President, I do not intend to go into Parliament’s amendments in detail, but I am happy to tell you that the Commission shares the concern about the need for small and medium-sized enterprises to be successful and so accepts the amendment relating to such enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the other two amendments: the Commission understands Parliament’s concerns but cannot accept the amendments as they are drafted. Nevertheless, the Commission will do its utmost to ensure that the observatory work is widely accessible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
