<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President of the Council – whom I address today in your capacity as President of the Council of Defence Ministers – Commissioner, I believe that the development of our foreign, security and defence policy has generally been extremely encouraging over the past year. Since we are always taking the Commission and the Council to task here, let me say from the outset that I should like to congratulate them today, because the manner in which this week's decisions have gradually implemented the Cologne and Helsinki declarations is the result of some excellent work, for which I wish to compliment all participants.</p>
<p class="contents">Following our painful experiences in the former Yugoslavia, experiences which showed that peacekeeping and civilian crisis management are ineffectual if they are not accompanied by a clear message that they can be enforced by military means if the need arises, the Governments of the fifteen Member States, the Council and the Commission learned their lessons and have now made considerable progress. I hope that the implementation of these decisions will not remain a mere paper exercise but that it will also be reflected in the appropriations in national budgets, which is where the executive power lies in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no use in having a hundred thousand troops if they are all lame and blind. Our troops are rendered lame by the fact that the European Union and its Member States do not possess the necessary transport capacities. They will be blind for as long as we do not have the essential intelligence facilities, such as satellite systems, which would make it possible to deploy these troops as wisely and effectively as circumstances dictate. At the same time, we also agree that the sequence of responses is correct. The use of military force is the last resort. Our main task is to ensure, by means of a judicious policy of prevention and astute civilian crisis management, that it is never necessary to use military force.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I believe that we must also initiate close cooperation between the institutions of the European Union and the Member States. The Community is largely responsible today for civilian crisis management and prevention as well as for all the associated instruments. The European Union has four times as much money in its budget for foreign aid as the United States. Many important aspects of trade policy lie within the purview of the Commission. I believe that, if this interaction between the civilian and military authorities is to work, we must ensure that there is no institutionalised duplication of effort or duality of purpose but that the civilian and military efforts are yoked together.</p>
<p class="contents">In point of fact, before Amsterdam both the European Parliament and the Commission took the view that it would be best to have a Vice-President of the Commission with responsibility for foreign policy who would also assume the role of the High Representative and would have a special obligation to and link with the Council. This did not prove to be politically acceptable, which is why we now have two figures, both of whom perform sterling work in their own way. The problems do not lie with them, but rather in the institutional ramifications, and we must try to keep such problems to an absolute minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">This view, moreover, also relates to the European Parliament. The European Parliament very much wants to be involved in the formulation and pursuit of this policy, as the Treaties prescribe – and perhaps the Treaty of Nice will improve the relevant provisions – and as is laid down in the interinstitutional agreement between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on the budgetary responsibilities of the European Parliament in matters of foreign and security policy. To be precise, civilian crisis management also lies within the budgetary responsibility of the European Parliament and, naturally, of the Council too, whereas defence policy remains a budgetary responsibility of the national parliaments, because the armed forces are not yet European forces but are still subject to their national governments and parliaments. Mobilisation orders are also a national responsibility, because each country takes a sovereign decision as to whether or not it will participate in a joint operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that this division of responsibilities is crystal clear, we must ensure that we create a negotiating level between the European Parliament and the national parliaments, so that we as parliamentarians, through exchanges of information at various levels, are able to monitor the national executives in an appropriate way. Decision making on foreign, security and defence policies is the task of the executive branch. We decide on the money and check whether it is being spent wisely and whether prudent policies are being pursued. I believe that a sound strategy will be developed on this basis. Talks are already taking place between the European Parliament and the national parliaments on this subject with a view to ensuring that the system develops in a rational manner.</p>
<p class="contents">When I speak of organisation, I also mean that the European Union, which makes such strenuous efforts in this field, should be given a corresponding degree of responsibility. I can see that things are not working sufficiently well in Kosovo, for example, and that we shall soon need a coordinator for the coordinators, because so many institutions are involved – not the European institutions but many others – and we must get that under control. I only included this as one small aspect of my report; it is covered by Mrs Lalumière's report, which focuses far more sharply on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">But we know that, in many parts of the world, such as the Middle East or Southern Asia, where the Kashmir conflict is a potential tinderbox, the international community is waiting for the European Union to be able to engage in mediation, so that there will be more shoulders to share the burden of responsibility in this domain. For this reason, we bear a high degree of responsibility for safeguarding peace, both here in Europe and in the world at large. I hope that this new mechanism will gradually enhance our ability to meet that responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, Mr President of the Council, I also believe that in Afghanistan in particular, a country we ought to speak about here, we should play our part in ensuring that firstly a stop can, at long last, be put to the trail of murder which has plagued that country for decades and which a barbarous regime is now pursuing against its own people and secondly in ensuring that the people in Afghanistan are able to live in a rational, peaceful and socially just world. We should try to make our contribution there too.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lalumière (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Minister, Commissioner, in dealing with European Security and Defence Policy this afternoon, we are, as President Brok just said, in a field where we can be optimistic about the construction of Europe. Since the Cologne European Council, at Helsinki and Feira and tomorrow, I hope, at the Nice Council, we have been able to follow the progress of this new policy with pleasure. Things do not often turn out that way, Minister, and we are delighted.</p>
<p class="contents">On 15 June before the Feira Summit, the European Parliament passed a resolution, and tomorrow, on the eve of the Nice Council, it has to vote on a text summarising its position. Obviously I hope a clear majority will support the motion for a resolution. I already know the vote will not be unanimous and that is not surprising, because this is difficult ground where differing political options are expressed on the role of the European Union as opposed to that of its Member States, on the place of the soldier as opposed to the civilian, on the place of the European Union as opposed to NATO and the United States, on the role of the European Union in the world and the choice it has to make between pacifism and non-intervention, on the one hand, and the will to deal with crises, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">These choices sometimes divide us, but now gradually a majority is taking shape. Barring accidents, that majority should support the line taken for a year and a half by the Council of Ministers, the High Representative, Mr Solana, and the Commission, especially in Commissioner Patten’s area of responsibility, in charge of civilian crisis management resources, but associated with that support, which I hope is clear and lucid, there are many questions, sometimes warnings, and I shall consider some of them here.</p>
<p class="contents">First, a brief comment on a crucial issue: the relationship between the new European policy and NATO. We have discussed this at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. The proposed text confirms the decisions of the European Council. This is not about competing with NATO or usurping its responsibility for defending our territory, it is about turning Europe into a credible partner of the United States by establishing a new balance in the Alliance and giving the European Union a margin of autonomy in the event of a crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, you will note that the resolution affirms Parliament’s clear intention to place the security and defence policy squarely on two complementary pillars: civilian crisis management and, should that fail, military crisis management. This concern for balance means Parliament will be monitoring the fair division of financial resources carefully, although we are well aware that the first comes under the Community budget and the second is still covered by national budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we are glad to see the CESDP starting off with a tangible achievement, the Rapid Reaction Force. And we are pleased with the work done so far, especially at the recent Capabilities Commitment Conference. All that has the merit of making this policy credible. This is also the time to take an inventory of the state of our armies and consolidate the will for reform, which I noted recently in Berlin as regards the German army.</p>
<p class="contents">On the institutional reforms you have undertaken, I would like to stress that we want the European Union to have a coherent, clear and effective chain of command. It is not enough to create bodies like the PSC, the Military Committee and the Military Staff; the vertical and horizontal links between the various bodies must also function properly and in real time. We do not feel entirely reassured on this point and in particular we would like to have the crisis powers of the Commission, the Council and the High Representative specified precisely.</p>
<p class="contents">Briefly, Mr President, I would like to mention a major problem for the credibility of this policy – budgetary resources. Of course, savings must be made, but we cannot exclude the need for new resources if we want to fill the gaps found in the inventory, especially in high-tech areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, like Mr Brok, I would like to stress the role of the European Parliament and the parliamentary institutions. There is so much more to say, but I want the Council’s representatives to know that the European Parliament is keen to adopt this unfamiliar culture of security and defence, and we hope the Nice Summit is a great success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular the need for parliamentary scrutiny and democratic accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the ESDP is a major new departure for the European project and therefore needs to have the existing institutional framework clarified. Whether there are legal arguments that existing powers are adequate is not really the issue. It should be clear that the parliamentary dimension should be introduced. No member of a national parliament would consider for a moment having limited and anything but transparent democratic scrutiny of security and defence. Within the limits of operational security even the US Senate and House are closely involved with the operations of the Department of Defence.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of the particular nature of the possible developments of the CESDP, we also believe that Treaty changes will be needed so that such developments can be conducted openly and democratically. Similarly the status of the High Representative must be clarified in relation to the existing triangle and the Commissioner responsible for external relations. Mr President, you will be aware perhaps that my Party in the UK have considerable reservations about the thrust of this policy but I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the Constitutional Affairs Committee for guiding me into producing an opinion that I hope will be acceptable to this distinguished House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was to be quite long, but I shall endeavour not to omit anything crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the publication of the reports by Mrs Lalumière and Mr Brok gives me the opportunity to present you with a preliminary assessment of the major developments that have taken place over the last few months in these areas. First of all, in the field of foreign and security policy, I shall assess the main institutional developments and more specifically issues relating to the European defence system and Mr Alain Richard, Minister for Defence, will speak in greater detail about all the aspects to do with military capabilities. I shall then give a summary of the main results of the CFSP over the last six months. I shall also answer, or I shall try to answer, Mr Brok’s oral question on Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, enhancing the common foreign and security policy. As Mr Brok pointed out a moment ago, the European Union has asserted its position over the last year and this has been backed up by developments that will prove to be extremely important for the future. I feel that the best example of this is the very rapid development of a European defence system. Following the German, Finnish and Portuguese Presidencies, the French Presidency has sought to fulfil the mandate given to it at Feira. Nice will, I think, mark a major stage and achievement in this field, in large part through the creation of permanent structures for a European defence system which should enable the European Union, in the course of 2001, to declare itself operationally capable of managing a crisis. The issue of military capabilities will be dealt with by Mr Richard, in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional aspects are also extremely important, because they will allow the Union to make plans, to take decisions and to act; in other words, to take political control and maintain strategic leadership of a crisis management operation. At Nice, the European Council is due to adopt several decisions, which I shall now discuss. First of all, the creation of permanent political and military structures, a political and security committee, a military committee and a European Union defence staff. The mechanism created as a result of these decisions will be complemented by establishing procedures for crisis management and the establishment of an operations centre in the Secretariat-General. As was laid down at Feira, these new structures will be put in place as soon as possible following the Nice Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue is ongoing arrangements with third countries and NATO. You all know how important these agreements are and we therefore need to establish relationships of trust and cooperation with NATO, with the candidate countries and with allied countries, whilst fully respecting the autonomy of the European Union. These relationships will, in particular, take the form of meetings between the North Atlantic Council and the iPSC and of meetings between the European Union and the fifteen European candidate and/or ally countries. We have also worked on enhancing civilian crisis management capabilities, in order especially to enable the European Union to achieve the objective that it has set for itself in the field of policing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention, in response to the comments made by Mrs Lalumière in her report on the need to improve our research into conflict prevention, that recommendations have been drawn up by the High Representative and by the Commission on improving the coherence and effectiveness of action in this field, and I know that the Swedish Presidency will continue to work towards this goal.</p>
<p class="contents">I also noted, in Mr Brok’s report, a number of questions and remarks on increasing the effectiveness of the European Union’s external action. This is one of the dossiers into which I personally put in a great deal of work. I hoped that we would make progress in this field, because the situation was clearly unsatisfactory. That was also the reason why, at the informal meeting of Ministers of Foreign Affairs at Evian at the beginning of September, I put this issue on the agenda and why we devoted a whole sitting to it, on the basis of Commissioner Patten’s proposals and plans.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made considerable progress since then. On 9 October, the General Affairs Council adopted conclusions on increasing coordination and improving management and the instruments necessary for decision-making. The Council decided to hold an annual debate on these issues and the first such debate will take place after the January or February session. We will then assess the issue of when these new measures are to be first implemented. I would emphasise that this whole process has been carried out with full cooperation and perfect agreement between the Council in general, the High Representative, the Commission, and particularly, Commissioner Patten.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Brok hopes in his report, the Council will have files summarising all of the relationships between the Union and each partner country, in order to gain greater benefit from the Union’s overall effort, to increase its efficiency and to provide better preparation for its discussions on external action. For the first debate, at the beginning of next year, the Commission will draw up a scoreboard, country by country, for the past budgetary year, which will show the current state of commitments, payments, and outstanding amounts for the main programmes funded by the Community budget and by the EDF. In this work, therefore, we have been very aware of the need for the Commission and the Member States to achieve greater complementarity in their aid actions for third countries whilst preserving, of course, the specific competences of the Commission. This applies to the actions of the traditional Member State administrations as well as to the specialist agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I now wish to say a few words about the new instruments established by the Treaty of Amsterdam and about interinstitutional relations, which are both subjects on which, I noted, your reports expressed some concern. Three common strategies have been adopted since May 1999, on Russia, on Ukraine and on the Mediterranean region. The Presidency has now asked the Secretary-General – the High Representative – to draw up a preliminary assessment report on how these common strategies are functioning and on their optimal use. This report is due to be presented at the debate at the beginning of next year that I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like briefly to talk about interinstitutional relations. I am aware of the discussion to which Mr Brok alluded just now, according to which the duties of the High Representative ought to have been allocated to a Vice-President of the Commission. But, as you yourself make the point, Mr Brok, since taking office and in the spirit that the various presidencies have sought to maintain, Mr Solana’s way of working has been fully compliant with the rules and procedures laid down by the Treaty. There has been coordination, no major difficulties have arisen and, to put it in plain terms, things are going well. We have shown on several major problems that we have faced in this period that we have achieved close and constructive cooperation between all the institutions. If we take the events in the Balkans as an example, it can be said that everyone played their role to the full. We are definitely seeing a real policy in this region of south-eastern Europe, which is furthermore beginning to bear fruit.</p>
<p class="contents">I come now to a quick preliminary and, of course, still provisional assessment of the actions undertaken under the French Presidency in order to ensure a higher profile for the European Union in the international arena. I shall therefore quickly look at a few regions and a few events. I shall continue with the Balkans, since I was speaking about that region a moment ago. The situation there has altered radically with the change of power in Belgrade, even if, of course, much remains to be done. We had a genuine European strategy, which consisted of sending at the right time, in other words before the elections, a message to the Serbian people which had been drafted at Evian, announcing that if democracy won the day, European policy would be radically revised.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy did win the day, after all the ups and downs, with which we are all familiar. We have therefore kept our promise and the leaders of today’s Yugoslavia tell us that the message from the European Union played a genuine role in that affair at that time. We are therefore part of that course of events, which was entirely logical. We have undertaken to re-establish relations in all areas with Yugoslavia. This does not mean that we consider all the problems to have been solved. We are fully aware that with regard to Kosovo and Montenegro, with regard to Yugoslavia’s relations with its neighbouring countries and to its obligations to the International Court of Justice, much remains to be done or resolved. What it does mean, however, is that the European Union did consider it to be crucial to commit fully itself to supporting this movement towards democracy until it has completely achieved its objectives, until it is consolidated and can then wholeheartedly commit itself to redefining a new policy for Yugoslavia, particularly with regard to its neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the context that explains why the summit held recently in Zagreb was so important. It had been devised against a different backdrop, in order to send a message to the Serbian people, bypassing their then leaders. The changes that have taken place enabled us to make the Zagreb Summit a first real democratic meeting of the whole European Union and all the representatives of the Western Balkan countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We also applied ourselves to the issue of regional cooperation, an idea that met with a degree of resistance from the countries in the region that do not wish to be locked into a past from which they have broken free, and I think I can say that, as a result of this summit, they understood that there was no contradiction between regional cooperation and their progress and rapprochement in relation to the European Union, largely through the stabilisation and association process which was confirmed and laid down on that occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">This summit, which was an initiative by the French Presidency, also enabled us to restate our commitment to that region, as, shortly before the summit, we had taken the necessary decisions on the major programmes for both the Mediterranean and the Balkan regions. The summit also gave us the opportunity to confirm that the new Balkans programme, which is known as “CARDS”, has been allocated EUR 4.15 billion for the 2000-2006 period. Much then remains to be done, both in terms of consolidating democracy and in terms of regional cooperation, but we now have a framework and a sense of direction and I think that the European Union now knows where it is going in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel and at the same time, the European Union has continued to develop relations with major strategic partners such as Russia. Consequently, an EU-Russia Summit was held on 30 October, under the partnership and cooperation agreement. Our policy is quite clear: we want, on the basis of principles of democracy, human rights, the rule of law and the market economy, to provide the most useful incentives and support for the huge changes undertaken by Russia, for it to become, eventually – and it will take as long as necessary – a great country, which is developing, which is modernising at every level and which is peace-loving, in short, the kind of country that we would be happy to have as our neighbour. All instruments for cooperation with Russia, both Community and national, must be directed towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">An EU-Ukraine Summit also took place, on 15 September, and the fruitful political dialogue that resulted is now being extended to issues of conventional arms exports, security and disarmament, a subject highlighted by the OSCE as being a problem where Ukraine is concerned. It is therefore desirable that this country should be included in this dialogue. I wish to say to Mr Brok, who expressed concern at this, that the issue of more tangible cooperation with Ukraine, under the CFSP for example, will be addressed in the report to be presented at Nice on the arrangements that will enable our partners to contribute to military crisis management led by the European Union. Moreover, Ukraine is making a special effort with regard to this issue as, since 1 July, it has acted on 15 declarations made by the presidency on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been maintaining transatlantic dialogue on the Balkans, in which the whole policy implemented by the European Union has been the subject of constant information passing in both directions between the United States and Europe. We have also maintained dialogue on Russia and on the Middle East peace process, even if my comments apply more to the period preceding the tragic events that have taken place since the end of September than to the most recent events.</p>
<p class="contents">During this period we have also kept the United States fully informed of developments in European security and defence policy, which is essential if this policy is to develop harmoniously, as is the case at the moment. Dialogue under this presidency has not yet finished as a summit is scheduled to take place in Washington on 18 December and in Ottawa the following day.</p>
<p class="contents">We encountered a problem with the Euro-Mediterranean Conference in Marseilles, as many of our Arab partners found it difficult to take part in the meeting in the current climate. Nevertheless, we did hold the meeting and they did eventually take part, with two exceptions. I think that the way in which the work was carried out and the intensity of the debates that were held on this very sensitive issue justified holding the meeting. What was at stake, and this was the reason for insisting on holding the meeting, was the continuation of the Barcelona process, which remains so important, even though it has suffered as a result of the situation in the Middle East. Nevertheless, it remains a powerful concept for the future, a long-term strategic idea that we must not allow to be undermined by the current tragedies, however heartrending they may be. The meeting did, therefore, take place and at this meeting we announced the budgetary appropriations for MEDA II for the period 2000-2006, which come to EUR 5.35 billion. To this figure we can add the loans that the EIB has planned to set aside, making a total of around EUR 13 billion. This demonstrates the substantial reality of the European Union’s commitment to this region.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Middle East, the Presidency remains in constant contact with all the key players, even through the most difficult times. We managed to ensure, for the first time, that Javier Solana was allowed to participate in the Sharm El-Sheikh Summit, held on 17 October. We spoke on behalf of the Fifteen in Marseilles, though this was not the main purpose of the Marseilles meeting, which was to save the framework of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. On 20 November, the European Union once again expressed its views on the situation in the Middle East, in harsher terms which the deteriorating situation on the ground called for. We remain fully committed and we can achieve a number of things in the coming days and weeks. The most urgent issue remains the one you are concerned about, which is first and foremost an end to the violence and for both sides to be able to resume discussions on the basic issues directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Javier Solana is a member of the fact-finding committee that is meeting in New York on Sunday, which we hope will set to work very quickly. I plan to go there myself, on behalf of the presidency, after Nice, in connection with the work to be undertaken by this fact-finding committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency has striven to develop relations between the Union and the other great regional blocs and has held many meetings with Asian countries. There has been the third ASEM Summit, the summit with Japan and the one with China. Previously, a summit was held with India, under the Portuguese Presidency, and a ministerial meeting will be taking place with ASEAN.</p>
<p class="contents">We encountered a small problem with the issue of North Korea, but I wish to state here that we must make a distinction between the issue of establishing diplomatic relations, which may have appeared rather confused at times, but which is not the real underlying issue, since some countries have maintained relations for a long time while others have not. We decided to work on the content of our policy towards North Korea and, on 20 November, we adopted guidelines for that country and the European troika has been able to visit North Korea on the basis of this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Our dialogue with Africa has been very active at all levels, at ministerial level too, particularly with CDAO, but also with SADC. This is moreover the case at this very moment. Dialogue with Latin America has continued both in New York, on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, and on more specific points, such as the support provided by the European Union for the peace process initiated by President Pastrana of Columbia, and for his social, economic and institutional programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not want to conclude this summary without mentioning the Union’s action on what are today known as the great global or cross-sectoral dossiers, particularly in the field of human rights, where work is still necessary to improve the coherence of European policy in international bodies and to involve civil society more closely. We have continued with the effort that was started previously. The second edition of the European Union’s annual report on human rights has been presented to the European Parliament and a human rights forum will be held in Paris on 13 December.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the French Presidency has continued with the policy of promoting and upgrading disarmament and non-proliferation treaties and has played an active role in the conference on the illegal trade in light and small-calibre weapons to be held in 2001. The Presidency has also drafted the second annual report on the implementation of the European code of conduct on arms exports, which has led to real progress and is due to be adopted by the General Affairs Council on 4 December.</p>
<p class="contents">As you see – and I have simplified this presentation considerably – European Union activity in these fields is developing apace and all of our partners throughout the world attach a great deal of importance to this fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish with a few words to the effect that the Council shares the concerns expressed by Mr Brok about Afghanistan. I would remind you that the Union is implementing measures on the basis of a common position of January 2000, which are as follows: a complete ban on arms supplies, pressure to be exerted on all sides, support for the attempts by the international community and individuals within Afghanistan to provide mediation, the fight against drugs and aid for the civil population. The Commission would certainly have something to say about these matters if we had the time, but to put it simply, all the efforts that we are actively making, because it truly is a long-suffering country, will never be effective unless all of the neighbouring countries, or the countries that are involved in some way or another and have some influence in Afghanistan, decide once and for all to stop intervening and interfering.</p>
<p class="contents">Since this has yet to happen, the Taliban regime remains immune to the arguments and pressure applied from abroad. I wish I could say that our pressure and our action are having some effect on the current situation, but unfortunately the Afghan situation appears to remain somehow self-sufficient and resistant to all such action. This is not, however, going to put us off. We must continue with these actions and I know that many Members of this Parliament here today are very aware of this. We shall therefore continue our work in this area. This is a specific point, Mr President but a specific question was asked, and so I wished to provide this type of answer.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Richard,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as I speak to you today, I am aware of taking part in a key turning point in the life of Europe, because this is, I think, the first time that a Minister of Defence has addressed your Parliament. On 24 October, I reviewed the progress of a European defence system with your Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights and Common Security and Defence Policy. I am delighted to continue in this vein by talking to you today about the results of our conference on military commitments of 20 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, first of all, to express my agreement with the wording of your resolution of 21 November on the European security and defence policy. You claim that this policy does not aim to compete with the North Atlantic Alliance, which remains today the foundation of the collective defence of its members, or to establish a permanent European army. The Presidency and, I believe, all our governments share this view.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim is to gain the capability, by 2003, of coordinating our armies to fulfil the Petersberg tasks, should the Council decide to launch a military operation on behalf of the Union. In the vital area of military capability, at Helsinki, our States set themselves the overall target of being in a position, by 2003, to deploy within 60 days and to sustain for at least one year, forces of up to the size of an army corps, in other words, 60 000 soldiers. These forces should be self-sufficient in military terms and should have the necessary capabilities for command, control, intelligence, and for other support units, as well as air and naval backup. Our Member States also decided, again at the Helsinki Council, a year ago, to rapidly establish collective targets for strategic capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fifteen have successfully achieved the difficult task of making these objectives a reality in military and technical terms. I wish to emphasise the quality of the completely new work that has been carried out by our States’ military experts, under the auspices of the interim military body, which was only created in March. I would also like to highlight the genuineness and effectiveness of the cooperation with the North Atlantic Alliance, which enabled us to have a fruitful exchange on the development of these new capabilities. As a result, we now have detailed military planning documents, which have just been adopted by the General Affairs Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have the catalogue of capabilities, a 300-page document which scrupulously lists all the military capabilities that are known to be needed by our Union in order to guarantee that all of the Petersberg tasks can be fulfilled. I would remind you of the wide range of tasks that this covers: humanitarian aid, the evacuation of nationals, conflict prevention and also the separation by force of the warring parties. We now have this catalogue of capabilities, which has been adopted by the whole Union. We also now have a catalogue of forces that records the voluntary contributions of each Member State. These contributions, which were confirmed by the Fifteen at the conference on 20 November, form a pool of more than 100 000 men, around 400 combat aircraft and 100 naval vessels. These contributions therefore enable us, in terms of quantity, to fully meet the overall target set by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two specific points relating to these numbers. I could, of course, add many other facts and figures, but I would like to be concise. These numbers relate to a mechanism that is designed to be maintained for a European Union operation for at least one year, which means that each country will have, in line with the contribution that it has stated, a reserve force that will enable it to provide the necessary relief forces. Furthermore, although I mentioned the figure of 100 000 soldiers, this does not mean that we are seeking to exceed the target set in Helsinki, but that we will have a reserve of qualified forces and forces with various areas of expertise, which will enable us to guarantee that the figure of 60 000 personnel in the Council’s target would be reached whatever operational conditions they may be required to work in.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish, briefly, to comment on these figures in order to emphasise that if the European Union has taken the decision to provide itself with military capabilities, it cannot carry out this decision on an unrealistic basis. These capabilities must be sound and credible, because, as everyone here can imagine, and as I can attest from personal experience, when a democratic political authority faced with a situation of violence to which it cannot fail to react decides to use force, it cannot afford to take a gamble. It must have complete confidence in the credibility of its forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The catalogue that I have just discussed was not the only result of this conference of commitment. We also reached agreement on continuing work to improve the quality of these forces. The Member States committed themselves to implementing medium- and long-term tasks to improve both their operational and strategic capabilities. We gave a particular commitment, under the current reforms of our armed forces, referred to just now by Mrs Lalumière, to continuing to increase our own capabilities and to coordinating existing projects, implementing national or multinational solutions to improve the performance of our forces. What we need to do above all is to increase the speed of deployment, the ability to keep forces on the ground and the power of coordination, which together make up what we call the interoperability of European forces. We must improve our strategic capabilities, especially strategic mobility, in order to rapidly move forces into the field. We must also provide further support for the senior officers to command and control the forces and improve the resources for training them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we wish to improve some of the European forces’ operational capabilities. In particular, we have identified research and combat rescue, defence instruments against ground-to-ground missiles, high-precision weapons and logistical support. These incorporate most of the suggestions made in your resolution of 21 November.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make another comment on this overall project to improve European capabilities. Some people have suggested that this illustrates the shortcomings and weaknesses of the European people. I shall simply say, however, that these shortcomings and weaknesses have existed for a long time and that until now, no one in politics has shown any concern about this, at least at European level. The action that we have set in motion has given Europeans the opportunity to shoulder their responsibilities, to look towards the future, potentially to use their forces to promote democratic political aims and to adopt resolutions on subjects that have remained unresolved for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">A new dynamic has therefore been launched on the basis of an action demonstrating political will on the part of our Member States. This will be credible only if it lasts and that is why we have adopted a follow-up and assessment mechanism that will be adopted by the Nice Council. This mechanism will enable us to gauge our progress. It is underpinned, of course, by the independence of the European Union’s decision making and by the acknowledgement of the voluntary and political nature of the commitments that have been given. It will therefore enable us to compare the commitments given by Member States with their later decisions and I think that this will encourage or inspire governments to take the appropriate decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">As you see, Europeans are bent on undertaking a sustained effort in order to give credibility to a European defence system. This will require the rapid implementation of the decisions that are taken. Our fifteen nations have set themselves the target of making this Force operational, I repeat, by 2003. Our desire is that the permanent bodies be put in place as quickly as possible after the Nice Council. In 2001, and this task will fall to our friends in the Swedish Presidency, the system will have to be made operational, especially the European Union’s defence staff. This will quickly have to establish its own facilities and proper working procedures. By 2003, when the bodies that have been established are in a position to fulfil their duties, the European Union will gradually become capable of accomplishing some of the Petersberg tasks. These are a few remarks, which have had, out of necessity, to be concise and as a result, incomplete in order to adhere to the rules of your Parliament, on the assessment that can be made today of the real achievements in the field of military capabilities, which have already been adopted or are about to be adopted, by the Nice European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to take a few words to describe the profound political significance, which has been approved by the majority of public opinion in our countries, of this new task that will provide Europe with a tool for political influence that it has, until now, lacked. This achievement is the result of a clear political will on the part of our governments, which is in stark contrast to the many disappointments that we have seen since the beginning of European integration. For this I wish to thank my fellow Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Ministers for Defence, who have enabled this substantial progress to be made and I must, of course, thank the European Parliament for the interest it has shown in this new major project. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When you examine the past century, in the first half of it we had two world wars – the worst in the history of the world – millions of dead. Yet those same people in those same countries created European Union in that same century, and the principles that go to the heart of European Union, when applied anywhere in the world, will bring peace. When we speak about conflict resolution why, instead of sending soldiers, do you not send this philosophy and why do you not consider setting up in the European Commission a section on peace and reconciliation and a Commissioner for peace and reconciliation, given the massive and fundamental experience of European Union and conflict resolution?</p>

He has done more than most as a personalised version of conflict resolution in a part of the world which I know well and has been properly commended globally for his efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, he is right in what he says about the contribution which the European Union has made to conflict resolution. A Japanese-American political scientist wrote a book with the unhappy title of “The End of History" in 1989. As we know, we have actually witnessed a good deal of history since 1989, but one point on which he was absolutely correct was that we saw in 1989 the end of a particularly shaming, and all too long, period in European history. We all know that the genesis of the European Union, the main objective of the founding fathers was to prevent Europe tearing itself apart in yet another civil war. That has been not the least of the achievements of the last few years, as we have consolidated liberal democracy throughout our continent, which is the great task that the French Presidency will steer us towards accomplishing in Nice. We are now faced with the problem of ensuring that when we talk about consolidation of liberal democracy in Europe, we mean the whole of continental Europe, because that is what enlargement and the enlargement process is all about. That is why the enlargement process is not just a strategic issue – not just an economic issue for us, but a moral issue as well – an issue very close to what the honourable gentleman was talking about when he referred to conflict resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not come to talk about that and I should respond to my honourable friend, Mr Brok, and the honourable lady, Mrs Lalumière, and thank them for their excellent reports. They and the motions for resolutions building upon them provide us with some extremely ambitious guidelines for our future work. I am gratified that they are on the whole very supportive of the external action of the European Union, as it has been developed by the Council, the Commission and, since his arrival just over a year ago, my colleague, Javier Solana. I very much agree with the content of those resolutions and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">It would not be sensible to try and address tonight all the points raised in those reports and resolutions, nor is now the moment to try and circumnavigate the globe in a discussion of our foreign policy. I would like instead to make just a few remarks on some of the key elements of the ESDP and the common foreign and security policy, which are highlighted in the two reports.</p>
<p class="contents">As the ministers have pointed out in their excellent speeches, recent weeks have seen important developments in strengthening Europe’s contribution to its own security. I do not want to go over the ground they have covered nor, as I have made clear very frequently, are the military aspects something for the European Commission. They are not – repeat not – matters for the European Commission. The only expertise I could possibly bring to the debate is that of the former commander-in-chief of the garrison in Hong Kong. This is rightly a matter for Member States. It is rightly a matter for ministers to decide. It is not a matter for European Commissioners.</p>
<p class="contents">I find some of the coverage that the creation of this force has received in the country I know best quite extraordinary. It is said that it undermines NATO, but NATO has, of course, made it perfectly clear that it supports what European ministers are trying to do. We are told that the United States is opposed. One newspaper in Britain on Sunday declared in a headline, “US to pull out of NATO if EU force goes ahead”, but the United States administration strongly supports the initiative. It has said so repeatedly. Every time a member of the American administration points out how much they support what Europe is trying to do, someone pops up in the media of the country I know best to say they do not really understand what is in their own best interest. Every time it happens someone else is trooped out, usually from some previous administration or some ancient period in our transatlantic relations, to say that things have changed and this would really be damaging to the relationship between Europe and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">What is absolutely clear is this: first of all, what would really damage the relationship between the European Union and the United States is if we were not to go ahead with what we have now proposed – if we were not to make a success of what we have set our hands to. Secondly, there is one other thing which we need to be clear about. No one is suggesting that the United States intends or wants to reduce its strategic commitment to Europe. What people do realise increasingly is there is going to be, and it is understandable, growing reluctance on the part of American public opinion to commit American lives to coping with the consequences of bloody, little European tragedies.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in the United States during the debates on “Larry King Live” and everywhere else during the run-up to the bombing of Yugoslavia during the Kosovo crisis. That is exactly what the tenor of all those discussions and all those debates was then. There is plenty of evidence, as I have said, that if we do not do more for ourselves, it will have very damaging consequences for our relationship with the United States. In the recent history of Bosnia, we saw a situation in which some of our soldiers were very often put in intolerable positions, not just militarily but morally as well. The recent history of Kosovo underlines the importance of Europe doing more for itself. Now we are trying to do that, and frankly it is both fatuous and malicious to suggest that this is the creation of a European army or an attempt to kick the Americans out of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with what my honourable friend Mr Brok has said in his overall conclusions on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. We have come a long way since the decision in Maastricht in 1991 to take the step from political cooperation towards a common foreign policy. Much remains to be done to develop a strong CFSP. There is need for further reinforcement of coherence and effectiveness in the external activities of the European Union cutting across the pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience over the past few years has made clear that European Union external action is more than just a juxtaposition of declaratory politics and technical cooperation. We need to integrate three strands into a coherent whole, Community policies, CFSP, including ESDP, and national action by Member States. There needs to be a sensible and sensitive partnership in the external field between the institutions of the Union, including the European Parliament, and a very close coordination with Member States. Our challenge is to ensure that the world’s largest trading group and provider of development aid also makes its presence felt politically. We have a real contribution to make and we must not be afraid of doing it.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Community, this means reforming our external assistance, improving our internal procedures and creating a framework within which we can mobilise the whole range of Community instruments in support of our agreed external objectives. We are not seeking new competences. We do not need new competences, but we want to exercise the powers we already have under the Treaty more effectively and I have every sympathy for the European Parliament’s desire to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Védrine pointed out in his remarks the priority which we have given to reforming our external actions and to delivering our programmes more effectively and more wisely. I have spoken a number of times to Parliament on that subject and I do not wish to do so again at any length today. However, we have made progress and that has been largely thanks to the leadership we have received from the French Presidency. We have worked extremely effectively together in trying to ensure that Europe’s taxpayers are able to see the sort of programmes delivered which they have every right to see and that the beneficiaries in countries all around the world get the assistance they require as rapidly as possible, supporting the most high value projects.</p>
<p class="contents">I note the call in the honourable gentleman’s report for common strategies on Africa, Latin America and the Western Balkans. Dwelling for a moment on the Western Balkans, I find it difficult to accept that we need a common strategy on the Western Balkans, we actually have a rather good strategy on the Western Balkans. It was reflected in the report which Javier Solana and I made to the Council earlier this year. The challenge for us now is sticking to that strategy, ensuring we can make that strategy work, ensuring that, in holding out the prospect of a closer relationship with the European family, we can help those countries make the economic and political changes and reforms required in order to secure their stability and long-term prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the honourable lady, Madame Lalumière, for highlighting the report on conflict prevention, which the Commission is preparing together with the High Representative for the Nice European Council. The Commission intends to follow up on this joint report with a communication next spring on the integration of conflict prevention across the board in the programming of our external assistance programmes. On crisis management, the Commission adopted on 27 September a draft decision on the establishment of a Community mechanism for coordination of civil protection interventions in emergency situations. This draft decision is now before the Council and I very much hope that it will be shortly adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft regulation establishing a rapid reaction facility, which should be adopted by the end of the year, will allow the Commission under one budget line and one legal base to carry out a number of actions simultaneously so as to respond quickly to a crisis with a wide range of instruments. I just want to repeat one thing about it, we are talking about a rapid reaction facility. That is what the Commission is asking for. The Commission is not involved with the creation of the rapid reaction force. Again, I refer to the sometimes not entirely balanced and objective media in my own country, who seem to have some difficulty in comprehending that distinction. It is an administrative measure that we want, an administrative measure to allow the occasionally slow Commission to react faster in a crisis. Even with our laborious procedures in the Commission, we do not need a force of 60,000 soldiers to accomplish our objectives. We do need the support of Parliament in helping us get these draft regulations approved as rapidly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the minister, I will just say a word in response to the honourable gentleman, Mr Brok, on Afghanistan. We are concerned, as the minister said he was, at the recent upsurge in fighting in the northeast of Afghanistan, concerned at the resultant worsening of the humanitarian situation of the population, many thousands of whom have had to flee their homes in order to avoid the conflict. The European Union through its common position on Afghanistan of 14 January earlier this year is committed among other things to the objective of bringing about a sustainable peace in Afghanistan. In this it supports the central role of the United Nations through its special envoy, Mr Vendrell, in trying to bring the parties of the conflict together in an effort to establish a broad-based government for the country. The European Union also encouraged other peace efforts, including those of the six plus two group, the initiatives of the former king and the Organisation of the Islamic Conference, in their efforts to intercede to bring about peace in Afghanistan. At the same time, the European Union continues to urge countries concerned to stop the involvement of their military, paramilitary and secret service personnel in Afghanistan and cease provision of all other military support to parties in the Afghan conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the provision of aid, the Commission largely through its humanitarian aid office, ECHO, has made a number of specific interventions this year aimed at alleviating both the effects of the catastrophic drought in the country by supporting, through provision of funds for food security and winterisation kits, the population's displaced by the fighting in the northeast of the country. So far this year, these commitments and those in preparation have totalled more than EUR 14 million. Member States also made individual contributions in addition to those sums.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, can I underline what others have already said. We have come an extraordinary long way in a remarkably short time. People who occasionally accuse the European Union of sclerosis, of not being able to take initiatives, of not being able to show vision, of not being able to move forward and respond to the problems of the modern world, should perhaps look at the progress that has been made in the last months in a very short period towards the creation of a CFSP which has its own integrity and very substantial potential value. It is a remarkable contribution. I hope we in the Commission will be able to make a contribution to the sensible discussion of conflict prevention. Our other major contribution is to show that we can manage the jobs that we have already been given, a lot more competently in the future than we have managed in the past.</p>

I shall confine myself to saying here, addressing Mrs Lalumière, that our group will be approving her excellent report tomorrow. But let me concentrate for now on the situation in Afghanistan. I was there in June and I witnessed both the plight of the refugees and the fanaticism of the Taliban fighters with whom I spoke.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the fall of Talokan in September, which led to our Parliament's first resolution and has triggered today's debate, the situation has continued to worsen, especially in humanitarian terms. The Talokan offensive cut off the only route of supply to the Panchir Valley and the Shomali Plains, where Commander Massood's forces are concentrated, as also a large proportion of the uprooted people and refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, there is no military solution in this area, as has been said, and I therefore took note of the statements the Presidency of the Council made a short while ago, when it committed itself to apply all the necessary pressure on the neighbouring countries, and in particular Pakistan, to persuade them to stop interfering here and to seek a political settlement. But what we really must look at, I repeat, is the humanitarian situation, which is becoming increasingly precarious. Today there are more than 30 000 families, of whom half have no shelter, who are living in complete deprivation in the Shomali Plains, in the Panchir Valley and in the northern region where communications with Tajikistan remain very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifty percent means 15 000 families. The temperature in the region just now is between minus 3 and minus 6 degrees and the only provisions these families have received over the past month is one sack of wheat. So it is extremely urgent to provide humanitarian aid. I think that has already been called for. A food depot should be set up in Dushanbe. I think we should consider establishing an air bridge, as we managed to do in other times and other places. It is a matter of the very survival of the people there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, I intend to concentrate on Mrs Lalumière’s report in my intervention. On behalf of the entire PSE Group, I would like to express my admiration for the outstanding report by Catherine Lalumière, our highly esteemed fellow Member. My group supports her position and we are grateful for the well-balanced text, which brings out the right points. As you will all be aware, there is to be a new approach to the common foreign and security policy; in which the civilian component will be deemed to be at least as important as the military component. The setting up of the rapid reaction force seems to be coming on apace, for which we extend our compliments. The Member States have made promises that do justice to previously articulated ambitions. Now it is matter of forging an effective and efficient European unit from this, under a clear and unambiguous command. That will be the real test for the European Union in my view. A new dimension is being added to the common foreign and security policy. This makes effective parliamentary control an absolute necessity. Do the Council and the Commission go along with the proposals in the Lalumière report on that score?</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other remarks we would like to make. The developments I have described will give fresh impetus to the European arms industry, and it certainly needs it. But we want to avoid pressure on exports, which is why we want to improve the rules on arms exports, and we will support an amendment to this end. My group recognises that there will be discussion of the various facets, but is seeking new methods via restructuring in the first instance. We do not rule out the possibility of increasing defence expenditure, but that will have to be assessed on its own merits, also in line with other priorities, for example in the social and economic field.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we are much taken with the emphasis the report places on the civilian component of the common foreign and security policy. The impression is sometimes given that the future of the CFSP stands or falls with the establishment of an autonomous military capacity. Is this appropriate? Not if the press is anything to go by at any rate. The rapid reaction force is intended to implement the Petersberg tasks. However, we must not exaggerate the importance of this. Although I do not agree with the cynics who say that it will provide Europe with a pointless toy, it is true that the rapid reaction force will not be immediately deployable in many situations. We regard it as an instrument that can be deployed alongside others, or better still, as one that can be deployed after other instruments, where possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Conflict prevention is to be preferred over military crisis management. The EU is better equipped than NATO, for example, for such peaceful conflict prevention tasks. We want to strengthen this capacity. We are sometimes sceptical about the European Union’s efforts in this respect. We have developed a kind of fixation with the military instrument. It appears easier to get results using this method. Lip service is often paid to the second part of the Helsinki Decisions, in our view. Such criticism is often responded to with a reference to the headline goals for police deployment or the rapid reaction facility that is now being launched by the Commission. We support these steps but more must be done to strengthen the civilian aspects of the European security policy. We want scenarios and coherent planning. What instruments will we need and when? The key to the European Union is its civilian basis and that is what we want to see clearly brought out in the Union’s foreign policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Impatient citizens complain that the wheels of European bureaucracy turn infinitely slowly. However, things have happened amazingly quickly within the field of European security policy since the decision to set up a joint European rapid reaction force was taken in December 1999 in Helsinki. These are welcome developments. We need to show ourselves and the countries around us that Europe has the strength and the will in future to prevent tragedies such as that in the Balkans. Naturally, the EU must take increased responsibility for conflict-prevention measures, crisis management, peacekeeping operations etc in the immediate vicinity of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party entirely support Mr Brok’s report. We also back Mrs Lalumière’s report in the main. We nonetheless think that the importance of not developing structures which overlap with those of NATO cannot be emphasised enough. It therefore seems a little unnecessary to regulate in great detail how, for example, European forces in space are to be organised. It is important to safeguard the transatlantic link and the United States’s continued commitment to Europe. The EU ought not to develop its own defence involving permanent troops.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, things are developing quickly. In the course of the week, country after country has reported on how many soldiers, aircraft, submarines etc it can contribute to make the rapid reaction force operational. Judging from the debate in a number of Member States, many people are clearly rather bewildered by the debate. Commissioner Patten gave a first-hand account of the debate in Great Britain. In another country close to my heart, the debate has been quite heated. In Sweden, a somewhat sluggish debate about neutrality is taking place, a concept which most of us perceive as a hangover from the days of the Cold War and as not being relevant today. Those of us in the European Parliament, who represent the people of Europe, nonetheless have an additional responsibility to lead this debate and to discuss, and conduct a critical examination of, defence and security policy in the form in which it is developing. This means that, as MEPs, we need structures to enable us to obtain information about the decisions made and to enable us to engage in debate, to participate and to hold people to account. However, citizens too must, as far as possible, be given access to information and documents. This is crucial if the policy in question is to win people’s confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer’s so-called Solana decision was criticised vociferously in this Chamber. The decision meant that all documents relating to foreign and security policy were to be automatically exempt from public scrutiny. That is unacceptable, of course. It is also why we have asked the Court of Justice to examine this decision. The same ideas about the greatest possible transparency were expressed in Mr Cashman’s report which we adopted with a broad majority two weeks ago in Strasbourg. I am therefore hoping for broad support for the Liberal amendments which deal specifically with the issues of transparency and public access to documentation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to express my group’s considerable concern about the ever worsening situation in Afghanistan and urge the Commission and the Council to do all they can to increase their efforts to achieve a peaceful solution and to support the civilian population, especially now before the winter sets in. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first section I am referring to is the one on conflict prevention and crisis management. I am delighted that this constitutes such an important part of her report because it is based on the analysis – which, if I am honest, has been made by the Greens before now, and on more than one occasion – that the European Union’s strength resides in its ability to prevent conflicts, and that we will only have to be able to seek recourse to military means – sadly – as a last resort. I think the Stability Pact for the Balkans is a good example of this. As I see it, it sets an example of how things <span class="italic">should </span>be done in the European Union, and it demonstrates that by taking various measures, for example in the field of democracy, support for the free press, and in the field of education, conflict prevention policy can help us to keep the lid on the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What I am hoping, and I would like to echo the sentiments of Mr Wiersma in this respect, is that what the report has to say on conflict prevention is not just paying lip service but will actually be translated into concrete goals, in which money and political will are to be invested. Otherwise we will be even worse off, i.e. by promising great things but not living up to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The second section I would like to come back to is the military section. This contains two points of criticism put forward by my group, which, to our satisfaction, have ended up in Mrs Lalumière’s report. The first point concerns the role of the European Parliament, which is something several other speakers have already touched on. It is still completely unclear in the current proposals as to what that role should be. As I see it, the European Parliament should be directly involved in drawing up the much-needed strategic concept in the future, and also, if it comes to it, in the decision on whether to deploy the European peacekeeping force. I have a very specific question for Mr Richard on that score. Reports are constantly appearing in the Dutch press to the effect that there is a secret protocol appended to the Saint Malo Agreement – which his country concluded with England early this year – in which both countries, France and England, say, and promise each other that the European Parliament will never have any authority over any aspect of the security policy. I would like to hear what Mr Richard has to say to this and ask him what he thinks Parliament’s role ought to be if there is no such secret protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point of criticism, which is also included in the report by Mrs Lalumière, concerns the lack of any strategic concept. Quite simply: where, when and how is this European intervention force expected to take action in the future? It is a complete mystery to me. I was therefore slightly perplexed, if I am honest, last week, when Mr Solana’s answer to the question as to whether we have a strategic concept or not, was a straightforward ‘yes’. He said: ‘yes, we do have a strategic concept, now all we need is the troops’. I would like to ask Mr Richard if he agrees with Mr Solana on that point. Is there a strategic concept? And if there is one, could he show me where it is written down as I would very much like to read it.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, one point of criticism, which is not, I am sorry to say, included in Mrs Lalumière’s report, is the financial aspect. I think Parliament’s message must be crystal-clear: we support this development but it will entail making cutbacks in the current standing armies, so as to allow for investment in new methods which we too consider to be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my part, I shall confine myself to what Mr Brok's report terms a cornerstone of the CFSP, ensuring peace and freedom, and conflict prevention. Let me just give one example – one which is extremely topical and most significant in terms of how we must change our policy – namely the Middle East. Here Mr Brok rightly deplores, and I quote, "the persistent inability of the Union to play a constructive role", and in this case the responsibility does not lie with the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just returned from a visit to Israel and Palestine last week, where I led a delegation from my group. I can tell you that the Palestinians have great expectations of Europe. If you fly a European flag on your car, you can go anywhere, even into the most miserable refugee camp. We must not disappoint these expectations. What do they expect of us? Basically, three things that are within our reach, provided we ourselves and each of our governments show a degree of political courage.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing they expect is for us to call for international observers to be sent out to protect the people concerned. Let us simply repeat what Mrs Mary Robinson said to the UN Commissioner for human rights: not more, but not less. What we saw in the hospital in Gaza, for instance, was truly horrific. That has to stop. If you have any doubts, I would advise you to read an interview published in the major Israeli daily <span class="italic">Haretz</span> on 20 November this year, which reveals the unbelievable orders given to Israeli marksmen facing Palestinians over the age of 12. It gives some idea of the terrible toll of these two months of intifada: 270 dead, most of them Palestinian, and nearly 10 000 wounded, many of them crippled for life.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should dare to call on the Israeli Government to put a halt to its military escalation, which can only set back any hope of peace. I am saying that not in a spirit of hostility but out of a sense of responsibility, in the well-considered interest of both Israel and the entire Mediterranean basin. Of course we must strongly condemn all attacks against Israeli civilians, like the terrible attack on a school bus. We did so immediately, on the spot. But it is not by bombarding Gaza, after plunging it into darkness to impress its people more, or by bombing the villages of the Bethlehem region fifteen times, villages we also visited, that one can hope to escape this spiral of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should call for new peace negotiations to begin, based on the same principles that we uphold in all the other parts of the world, namely the requirement of respect for international law and the Geneva Conventions, the requirement of respect for the United Nations resolutions. In this case, that means an end to the occupation, including that of East Jerusalem, the dismantling of the settlements and recognition of the refugee problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the constant violation of these fundamental rights, despite seven years of negotiations, and the resulting exasperation that lie at the core of this popular revolt. So it is these problems that we must resolve if we are to see a return to peace, to a lasting peace. For the rest, many Israelis agree and opinions polls show that over and above any voting intentions, an absolute majority of them accept the idea of a global peace agreement with the Palestinians, including the dismantling of the settlements. As an association of soldiers' mothers stated, we did not take our children out of Lebanon just so that they could die for the settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that Europe must decide to act now. If it does so along the lines I have described, Europe will not only live up to the expectations of the Palestinian people but will also underpin the current of opinion within Israel in favour of a just peace and give itself a worthy and respectable image in the world. Then, and only then, will it have a chance to overcome its impotence in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no lack of reliable information on the nature of the present Iraqi regime. The flood of reports is still growing by the day. Nevertheless, the ‘Republic of Fear’, as Saddam’s reign of terror was appropriately dubbed many years ago, is still greatly underestimated by many western politicians, also within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this erroneous assessment could have disastrous consequences, because according to what he says, the Gulf War is far from over in Sadism Hussain's eyes. Hence his relentless efforts to build up an arsenal of extremely sinister weapons of mass destruction. After all, who is there to prevent him from doing so? He has kept UN inspection teams out for quite some time now. Incidentally, this brutal Iraqi autocrat is advocating a massive Arab attack on the State of Israel, indeed worse still, a full-blown Jihad, a Holy War.</p>
<p class="contents">What, in all fairness, could be more obvious than the need to firmly contain the potential threat posed by Saddam? In point of fact, how do the Council and the Commission view the situation at the present time? One would appear to be justified in fearing that there is no question of our establishing a European CFSP to deal with this crucial danger to world peace. At all events, the consequences of a failed sanctions regime against Baghdad are incalculable.</p>
<p class="contents">Owing to misplaced pleas for the suffering of the Iraqi people – as if we really believe that Saddam lacks the financial means to alleviate this – the tyrant of the Tigris is gradually being given more room to manoeuvre on the international scene. To what end? To wreak death and destruction in his own country and beyond.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, it is high time that the UN set up an International Tribunal to conduct a thorough investigation into, and try, all the crimes perpetrated by Saddam’s ‘Republic of Fear’. An initiative to this effect would certainly lend credibility to the CFSP of the European Union. Hence our enthusiastic support for Amendment No 1 of the Brok report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among the performances that surely give us no cause for pride are our rather embarrassing uncoordinated attempts to act as a mediator in the Middle East conflict. I believe that we Europeans bear a special responsibility for peace in the Middle East, a responsibility which we do not exercise and which is evidently beyond our capabilities. The one-sided apportionment of blame which we have been hearing in this House, the condemnations of one side or the other in this conflict and the discrepancies in the voting patterns of the EU Member States at the United Nations on 21 October of this year – which one of the rapporteurs quite rightly criticised, by the way – have further reduced the Union's chances of assuming a productive and responsible role in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not talking here about different interpretations of the causes of the conflict by the individual EU Member States and by various politicians, which is something the political leaders might finally come to recognise. The only thing we are talking about is supporting a peace process and gaining the trust of the parties to this conflict. Both a viable Palestinian state and Israel's legitimate security requirements must be recognised by all members of the Union, otherwise we shall never adopt a common position on the peace efforts, and Europe will lose every ounce of credibility as a mediator alongside the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East conflict could therefore become the acid test of the efficiency of European Middle East policy. If we as Europeans cannot play a responsible role in the resolution of this conflict, independently of the United States, we must assume that we shall not be trusted to act as a mediator in any other regional conflicts either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, as the French Minister for Defence pointed out, there has been progress in the field of defence policy. I believe that the establishment in record time of the interim committees in the Council, the Member States’ ability to commit their contributions to the creation of the rapid reaction force and the very presence of Mr Richard in the work of Parliament – in its Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and in Parliament itself – are all to be welcomed and deserve our consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight very clearly the progress made by the French Presidency in the field of common foreign and security policy and in the field of defence policy, and I wish to say this particularly because, in the previous debate on the European Council in Nice, certain reservations were expressed on the progress made in general during this presidency. Nevertheless, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I believe that we should not be deceived, because the French Presidency will fundamentally be judged, not on the achievements with regard to common foreign and security policy, nor with regard to defence policy, but on the results of the European Council in Nice, which are truly essential to the promotion of our project.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like Mr Patten this afternoon, am not going to comment on the whole of the European Union’s external action, but I would just like to concentrate on three points which I believe deserve to be highlighted. Firstly, the debate which has taken place as a result of the words of the German Foreign Minister at the Humboldt University, as a result of President Chirac’s speech in Berlin, the speech by the British Prime Minister in Prague, and the articles by the Italian Prime Minister and by the Swedish Foreign Minister that appeared recently in the press. All of these stressed the intergovernmental aspect, rather than the Community aspect, of the CFSP. Mr Giddens, the ideologue of what has come to be called the ‘third way’, said that the Commission is going through a political decline and that the centre of gravity should be shifted towards other bodies, that is, towards the Council. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, to us, action undertaken by the Commission and the interinstitutional balance are fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, despite what the previous speaker said, I do not know whether it would be possible or desirable for the European Union to do any more than it is currently doing in relation to the conflict and escalation of violence which has taken place in the Middle East, especially now, when the United States is going through a transitional period. I imagine that the 43rd President of the United States will soon be named, but I think that this would be a good time for the European Union to double its efforts and assert its presence in a conflict which is so close by.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to comment on Latin America. I wonder – I will ask Mr Patten this question when the time comes – whether the directives for negotiation which the European Union and the Commission are currently debating with Chile and Mercosur, adopted in light of the Seattle Summit, should be revised, given the failings of that summit, and whether it would be discriminatory to conclude these agreements on the condition that a new round of the WTO should take place. I believe that this really is a discriminatory condition, which should now be adapted in light of the new circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to end by saying that interinstitutional balance is very important to us, that the Commission should be given the role that it deserves, and that the internal dimension which is being consolidated in the European Union should correspond to its external activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, I should like to concentrate on the Lalumière report, because it documents the progress that has undoubtedly been achieved in the domain of European defence and security policy and sets that progress in a balanced and democratic framework. It is balanced, because the report makes it quite clear that we need three things: the first is an analysis of the various risk factors in and around Europe, the second is prevention, and the third is civilian crisis management. Only if all of that is to no avail do we need military crisis management. It will not always be possible to take these steps one after the other in chronological order, but we need the entire package, and the fact is that only all of these factors together will make a coherent, balanced defence and security policy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The report, however, also brings a democratic framework into play, and I should like to lay particular emphasis on that here. Minister, I should like to say a special word of thanks to you for having been with us in committee and for being here today. However, your personal commitment must not be seen as a substitute for democratic legitimisation of the European security and defence policy. Defence policy, the question of defence spending, is a national matter and must be determined and overseen by the national parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, a European level of security policy, and the European Parliament acts as a budgetary authority for security expenditure at that level. We need cooperation between the national and European levels, and we also need democratic supervision. I realise, Minister, that you are sceptical and that you have just said 'No' again, as you did in Paris on a previous occasion, but this Parliament still believes in these principles, irrespective of party allegiance, and we shall go on campaigning for their acceptance. Allow me one final plea: enhance European defence policy by giving it a parliamentary democratic dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The decision taken at the Helsinki summit to establish a rapid reaction force has been interpreted in different ways by the Member States. In Finland and Sweden they speak about crisis management, which in these countries chiefly means a traditional peacekeeping operation. Mrs Lalumière’s report reflects the thinking of many NATO countries, according to which a rapid reaction force would very quickly develop into a fully-fledged army capable of warfare. It would have at its disposal, among other things, heavy transport aircraft, aircraft carriers, cruise missiles, and in-flight refuelling for long-distance bombing missions. The Finnish people have not been told anything about this. In my opinion, Europe’s military identity should have been established in the context of NATO, then the EU could just stick to the task of crisis management. I cannot approve of the EU becoming a military alliance and a military superpower. Now that the development of the EU’s military dimension has begun, it is wise to aim for a situation where the Union should be internally differentiated in this area also. The NATO countries could form a defence organisation within the framework of the Union that would function as a strong European pillar of NATO. In this way other EU Member States could keep to their traditional peacekeeping activities.</p>

Yet the Union would be unrivalled in that domain if only it would improve the existing instruments and especially its present potential for civilian conflict prevention and apply them coherently. The unfortunate fact is that the trauma of Kosovo was followed by a hectic flurry of activity which was channelled in an entirely wrong direction. Concentration on purely reactive crisis management has thrown the common foreign and security policy totally out of synch. No government would take responsibility for sending its country's troops into a region on an open-ended assignment without clear political objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are no clear political objectives, and there is still effectively no common foreign and security policy. National interests continue to prevail, especially when diplomatic activity is on the agenda. We have just seen the examples in The Hague. We have the example of the Middle East conflict. It is absurd to detach European foreign policy from the institutions responsible for most of the instruments that are essential to its pursuit. These are not my own words; they were spoken by Commissioner Patten, and he is perfectly correct. It is equally absurd to concentrate the bulk of the available financial resources on military equipment. If we perceive European foreign policy as nothing more than a support instrument for European arms-manufacturing consortia, we have completely misunderstood its function. It can only recover credibility if the civilian approach is its supreme guiding principle, if the instruments at its disposal are used in pursuit of effective prevention and if those instruments receive a level of funding that maintains their credibility. Neglect of this wide range of instruments of non-military conflict prevention would turn out to be a mistake in the long run, and in that respect I am dissatisfied with the Council's statements to the effect that we have already taken decisions, but that things will move in this general direction. This is by no means certain, because it is also apparent that these decisions are based entirely on the reactive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Civilian conflict prevention, and I stress the word 'prevention', cannot be a mere appendage of military intervention. It will not be fully effective until we have overcome the trauma of Kosovo and Srebrenica, until we return to a policy of active prevention and begin to deploy our available resources long before the alarm bells start ringing and until we are fully committed to defusing potential crises and eliminating possible causes of escalation. This means that curbing arms exports to unstable regions must be the first aim for the Council to pursue, that trade policies must be fair, that assistance must be given to encourage the sustainable development of countries in volatile regions and, above all, that the democratic forces in civil society must be supported. The promotion of regional cooperation is another valuable instrument. The EU has only one problem in this domain, namely the fact that it has yet to arouse public interest in this sort of action, even though such measures are considerably more sustainable and effective than military intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These resolutions, together with the interventions of the presidents of the foreign and defence ministers and Mr Patten, leave us in no doubt whatsoever as to the extent of the militarisation and aggression of the European Union. Both motions passionately support the creation of a terrifying military machine, spearheaded by a rapid reaction force of 50 000 to 60 000 men or, as Mr Richard has just told us, 100,000 men, with air and sea support and even aircraft carriers being mobilised.</p>
<p class="contents">The stated aim, which I admit with a cynicism which makes me shudder, is for the European Union to be able to intervene militarily on the territory of third countries, in order to prevent and manage crises which threaten European values and interests, without so much as a resolution by the UN Security Council, given that all that is required is the approval of its Secretary-General. And just to be on the safe side, both motions explain away the criminal objectives of the famous CFSP by proposing that all countries in the European Union have professional, i.e. mercenary armies which will, of course, carry out their orders without question and without hesitation. This, they tell us, will enable operations such as the criminal bombing of Yugoslavia and the continuing occupation of Kosovo to be carried out more successfully and at the initiative of the European Union, which will back up and complement ΝΑΤΟ.</p>
<p class="contents">What about Mr Brok's contention that the aim of the CFSP is to deal with massive attack from the Soviet bloc. Obviously, no-one has told him that, unfortunately for mankind, there is no longer any such bloc. One thing is clear and that is that nothing has changed since 1990; as far as our rapporteurs and those at the helm of the European Union are concerned, the enemy is still those who refuse to bow down to the new imperialist order, those who fight it, the grass-roots movement which is beginning to react – as is only natural – against the barbaric foreign, economic and social policy of the European Union, which provokes hatred between peoples, and leads to war, unemployment and impoverishment. This is the enemy which your CFSP has in its sights.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Oostlander (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, I intend to concentrate on Mrs Lalumière’s report, for which I have the greatest respect, because I feel that as a report, it takes a very practical approach to issues concerning our security and that of others around us. But firstly I would like to comment on a number of statements that other speakers have just made. They have spoken most impressively and sympathetically about the order in which steps should be taken, i.e. first preventive action, using as many peaceful methods as possible, and only then, military methods. On hearing this you say: ‘yes, of course that is quite right’, but this appeal would in fact suggest that the European Union and the European Member States have been far too quick to seize their weapons in the past, in different contexts. History has taught us that, sadly, this often happened far too late and that if it had happened earlier, hundreds of thousands of lives might have been spared. So I do not actually think this assertion is correct. Again, I readily support any efforts to take preventive action in order to avoid war and all kinds of violence, but, of course, we must not twist the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Mr President, that if you were to ask the public for their opinion, you would find that they think we deal with foreign policy and security here in the European Parliament, and that this is also where the centre of gravity of our decision-making power lies, which is not the case. The trouble is that the Council of fifteen Ministers takes the decisions on these matters, and it all proceeds rather slowly, and then Parliament gets the blame. I am therefore delighted that we are now making progress. We also have the French Defence Minister in our midst, which must make it an historic occasion. What he said in his speech was an inspiration to us all. We have been able to see that progress is being made of course. We also warmly applaud the efforts undertaken by Mr Patten – whom we hold in very high esteem, as we do Mr Solana – because something is being done at last.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Mrs Lalumière also makes an extremely practical comment in her report where she says that it would be an excellent idea for Mr Solana to effect coordination between the Member States, and for Commissioner Patten to generate more initiative from the Commission’s side. Ideally, these two should be fused into one person. I have been known to comment in the past that they should at least be regarded as identical twins, but the fusion idea would be far better still within the context of the Commission. I feel Mrs Lalumière outlines some outstanding possibilities. If we take a leaf out of her book, perhaps we will be able to ensure that all our resources are deployed in a more effective manner, both those used in preventive actions and those used in military actions, if necessary within the Petersberg framework, as well as the action that follows military action, such as that required in Kosovo at the present time. We need police officers out there, but also people who can keep the wheels of administration turning, and who can take over the role of mayor somewhere, for example. These are all officials whom I think could be dealt with extremely well as part of Mr Patten’s portfolio, along with his rapid reaction facility. That is an extremely important element because the European Commission has a great deal of authority over it, which means that we as a Parliament can exercise a great deal of control. So I am certainly inclined to make it a very important priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, then there is the budget, of course, and the question as to how it should be apportioned. There are some sound comments on this in the report, and I believe that we should follow Mrs Lalumière’s example and give preference to financing it via the Community budget, then it will be apportioned fairly from the outset and we will also have control over it. Speaking of control, of course the European Parliament must take on more and more tasks from the Western European Union and its assembly. I think that would be a good move. I also think that we are being prudent and realistic for the present, in our assessment that when it comes to the practical deployment of troops, the national parliaments are set to retain a large capability for a very long time, and perhaps for ever, and that we therefore need a forum where we can come together with the national parliaments for that reason. It is not a control body we need but a forum, and I would gladly give it my blessing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regard that as unacceptable. In the early part of 1990, when it was foreseeable that the Warsaw Treaty would collapse, the Government of the German Democratic Republic which I headed adopted a new military doctrine based on freedom from nuclear weapons, on international security partnership and on gradual disarmament. Non-use of force was our principle. The end of the confrontation between the two blocs had rendered NATO superfluous. Yet instead of dissolving itself, NATO is mutating from a defensive into an offensive power and alliance and is spreading its radius of action ever further eastward. The arguments advanced today for the creation of an EU intervention force resemble those that have been put forward for the continuing existence of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">This move is not primarily designed to pacify trouble spots but rather to permit the use of military means to safeguard access to markets, raw materials and spheres of interest. I am in favour of the EU continuing to make peacekeeping the hallmark of its foreign and security policy and to detach itself from the apron strings of the United States. This, however, depends on a completely different set of conditions. First of all, the war that was fought against Yugoslavia in defiance of international law and the results of that war, such as the new tensions in southern Serbia, show that military force must not become a political instrument again. Secondly, NATO should be gradually winding down rather than engaging in eastward enlargement. Thirdly, a nuclear-free corridor, such as Olaf Palme once suggested, should be created from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Fourthly, the OSCE must be strengthened and endowed with enough resources for the prevention and resolution of conflicts in accordance with the fundamental principles of its security policy and not through the creation of storm troops. Fifthly, the United Nations should be asked to convene a world peace summit, at which lessons can be drawn from the wars of the twentieth century so that the peoples of this earth will be offered the prospect of a peaceful twenty-first century. Europe could set an example here, and the creation of an intervention force is surely the wrong signal for it to send. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However we have concerns in particular about the nature of common European security and defence policy. I say this in spite of the mass of apparent reassurances on this subject that have miraculously been generated in the past few days. If the proposed European capabilities were indeed designed to reinforce NATO or the options for the alliance, we would have few difficulties. But this is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is bent on establishing an autonomous capability in pursuit of European political integration. Mr Richard says he does not want to compete with NATO but he does want to compete with America in the security policy arena. Among other ambitions, Mr Brok proposes that the European Union should set its military operational sights on a zone of instability in Asia, from Afghanistan to the China sea. He mentioned Kashmir – I find this alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lalumière report wants EU military operations to be funded from the Community budget and even those not participating would be expected to pay up as well. There is a proposal to turn to Russia for long-range air transport and yesterday the Russians suggested common intelligence-gathering with the European Union. There are some here who would prefer Russia rather than America as a strategic partner. Mrs Lalumière and Mr Brok want EU defence policy to be under the control of a Vice-President of the Commission, who would assume the CFSP responsibilities of the Secretary-General of the Council. Under this scheme the Commission would run defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all barmy stuff. The Commission should concentrate on its civil external assistance programmes, military matters should be left to the nations on an intergovernmental basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let NATO first decide how it would deal with a crisis and then, if required, Europeans, having developed greater capability, could indeed assume responsibility for a particular task, as agreed in NATO four years ago. Let us not pretend that the present proposals have this in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Could I congratulate Mrs Lalumière on her report. Clearly we have made huge leap forwards on European defence cooperation in the last 12 months or so, but there are certain things we need to bear in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a key factor must be to maintain the consistency of the European Union's external policy. Unless Pillars 1, 2 and 3 are working towards the common goal, any other mechanism we set up is bound for failure. So we must always hold that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while attention has inevitably been focused in recent weeks on the military dimension, we must not lose sight of the need for civilian conflict prevention and one cannot be at the expense of the other, otherwise you are actually pulling in opposite ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, while I welcome the Rapid Reaction Force, we have to be clear from Europe's perspective, as we only get one chance to get this right. It is not a question of not being halfway in or halfway out, there has to be a clear commitment by all the Member States involved to making this work. We should not therefore try to force this to do anything it is not intended to. NATO of course is the arm of collective defence of Europe and the West. The Rapid Reaction Force's job is peacekeeping and peacemaking and the Petersberg tasks. To do that we have to have the capability.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment we are grossly short of that capability and ultimately Member States have to consider their defence expenditure plans, which are dramatically different from one country to another.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like ultimately to see us move towards greater convergence of defence expenditure. We also need proper coordination. No duplication, not only with NATO, but no duplication within EU Member States. We should be working together and coordinating. We should move towards greater European procurement policy, so we have a more efficient defence industry delivering better value for money. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, Mrs Lalumière’s report contains a whole programme setting out how the EU is to become a military superpower within the fairly near future. It is perhaps hard to see why, bearing in mind that Europe has no enemies and is not threatened by any military power.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report is mainly concerned with military offensives outside the EU’s own territory. As a superpower, the EU is to be able to intervene anywhere in the world where the EU’s interests or values are threatened. In this way, the EU is to be an equivalent of the United States in the area of military intervention, too. I am convinced that this policy would be greeted with distrust by the people of Europe if they only knew about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the very comprehensive report does not say a word about the non-aligned States or about neutrality as such. The farthest it goes in that direction is a scornful reference in paragraph 5 of the explanatory statement to ‘neutral’ countries (in inverted commas). The non-aligned countries must protest loudly and clearly against wordings of that kind and against the report as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I concur with his arguments about enlargement. He notes that the accession negotiations involving twelve new Member States have proved to be the most effective instrument for stabilising the Mediterranean area, together with Central and Eastern Europe. The priority now is to do all we can to strengthen the conditions for freedom and peace in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brok’s report also discusses the post of High Representative for the CFSP. I think that the present ‘relationship’ is unsustainable in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">It is an exciting debate we are having this evening. I welcome the unanimity and frankness with which, as MEPs, we are now discussing the Lalumière report on the European Union’s security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If they are to be credible, I believe it is important for the Members of the Council to say the same thing in Brussels and the EU as they do in their own countries. In <span class="italic">my</span> country, Sweden, there is a Foreign Minister who demands that there should be a UN mandate for EU operations. The debate in Sweden is very much about the extent to which Sweden, as a Member of the EU, is a neutral country. Astounding, but true.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is extremely important for those ambitions which the EU is now expressing to be backed by practical resources. Otherwise, they are in danger of becoming nothing but empty words.</p>

As it takes shape, the CFSP will experience numerous ups and downs; however, it will help realise our dream of a political Europe. Even those who speculate as to the benefits of certain decisions, such as the decision to create a so-called Euro-army, cannot fail to see the important political dimension of this decision and its effect on the cohesion of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, the peaceful resolution of any conflict must be our creed. If it is to retain its political attraction, the CFSP needs to be determined on the basis of the Member States of the European Union, not on the basis of isolationist or exclusionist rationales, but as a strong driving force behind the cohesion of the European Union. Antagonism and compromise are facts of life. However, the European Parliament must act within the bounds of government compromise and balance on the one hand, and the realistic utopia of European unification on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">There are issues such as technology, research etc. which are in dire need of a convergence strategy – this applies to the defence industry, information technology, space technologies and research. And, as it strengthens its democratic institutions, Europe also needs to consolidate its economic and social power and cohesion, its strategic potential to act as a force of peace and its technological edge. It is about time Europe had its own Cape Canaveral, its own ΝΑSΑ and its own Silicon Valley. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to put on record my appreciation of the first Minister of Defence to address the European Parliament. It is indeed an historic occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important things that was emphasised here this evening was said by Commissioner Patten earlier on in the evening, when he emphasised that we are talking about military facility and not an EU army. I do not think that we can underline that sufficiently. Even some of our literature that has been circulated with reports on our discussions here tonight, talks about rapid reaction forces instead of a rapid reaction facility, for example. I think if we could clearly understand that, then a lot of the concerns might indeed evaporate. What a pity, I say to my colleagues Van Orden and others, because my colleagues just across the pond, the Irish Sea, have so much to offer in this area: the tradition, the experience and the practice. Maybe when the election is over we will get a more balanced debate. They have so much to offer. I am just disappointed with the line they are taking on it. I will say no more.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very proud however of the Irish agreement and the Irish contribution. As a small nation that has been traditionally "neutral", I am delighted we are in there at the table and doing what we can, given the mandate of the Irish people. There is no nation in Europe that is philosophically neutral. There are some nations that are militarily neutral and there is a difference. Ireland has never been philosophically neutral. We have a very strong view on the atrocities and the lack of human rights in some parts of the world and we are not slow to state that. We have a very strong view of what we can contribute in peacekeeping and in peace-enforcing, and I hope we will always be able to contribute to that. We will never be philosophically neutral nor should that ever be confused with military neutrality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last few weeks the media have focused, as we in Parliament are doing today, on issues concerning European foreign and defence policy. I am referring to the creation of a rapid reaction force and the transfer of WEU powers to the European Union. It could be said that the public debate on these issues has broadened. In addition to the diversity of opinions, I feel that there is a prevailing awareness that Europe is at an historic moment which requires its role in the international system to be clarified. The perception of the importance attached by the European public to the common foreign and security policy is, in fact, borne out by the recent findings of Eurobarometer.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we all agree that priority should be given to conflict prevention and to the devastating effects of other types of disaster, the European Union will only be taken seriously if it also provides itself with military support capabilities for humanitarian interventions. The progress that we are making in this field must, however, make us extremely thorough. Greater clarification and definition are needed at every stage of the creation of common instruments for military defence, from the methods of participation to command, and in the responsibilities that should be given to the various countries. We must ensure that this whole process is democratically monitored. The European Parliament, working together with the national parliaments, is, in my opinion, the most appropriate body for this task. I would like the Minister to comment on this point, if he can. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to start by expressing my satisfaction at the fact that my amendment, which seeks to highlight the total failure of the United Nations drug control programme in Afghanistan, was adopted in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, and that it is now part of the text which is to be put to the vote tomorrow. Millions of dollars were promised and then given to the Taliban to enable them to remove, to pull up their opium crops: they pocketed the money and then promptly more than doubled their drugs production. The fault lies with the person who appropriated the funds, who should not have been so naive – and in this regard I am sorry to say that the programme and the agency were headed by an Italian – but also with the Taliban for their irresponsibility, and it is therefore right to condemn them, as the resolution indeed does. However, I wonder whether it would not have been possible to be harder and harsher in our criticism and even threaten to impose sanctions on the country which gives the regime the greatest support, support without which the Taliban regime would crumble, namely Pakistan. Why is Pakistan supporting the Taliban? For various reasons, not least in order to unleash them on Kashmir once they have conquered the whole of Afghanistan, so that they will create anti-Indian hostility there once again. Well then, in my opinion, it is extremely important to break this vicious circle, and we can only hope that the resolution will contribute to doing so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to focus on two matters. The Union’s management of civil crises has not progressed; the conflicts are by nature social, economic, intellectual, ecological and ethnic. In all of these, preventive civil crisis management is a better approach than the military option. My fear is that a rapid armed reaction force will be used more and more often instead of civil crisis management, and more and more rapidly. The European flag is not to be promoted by means of a tank but by social equality, and therein lies a difference of principle. I suggest that we organise as effective a rapid reaction civil crisis management centre as has now been planned. Then we will be acting in accordance with priorities and our own philosophy.</p>
<p class="contents">My other fear is the involvement of states in NATO that do not wish to be involved. There is one solution that might make the situation easier here: involving Russia in crisis management. It is likely that Russia will often be either party to or otherwise connected with the crises we will one day have to face. It is also known that President Putin does not take a categorically negative view of these crisis management forces, which I think means there are opportunities for cooperation, and when we know what type of crises we are dealing with, this for me would be an additional factor in achieving a balance in the process as a whole. It would also make it easier for the nations of Europe to understand the whole issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly pleased that the Irish Government is fully committed to this initiative and has pledged that 850 members of our defence forces will participate.</p>
<p class="contents">Like my Fine Gael colleague, Mrs Doyle, I recognise that this does not represent the creation of a European army and before shrill voices are raised in my own country, which there will be, against Irish involvement, I would point out that participation is voluntary and on a case by case basis. Let me say this and let me respond to the comments of my other colleague Mr Van Orden. I believe that this latest venture is a very important first step to remedy the deficiencies in EU defence capabilities, which were so cruelly exposed in Bosnia-Herzegovina and also Kosovo. I believe that the lessons we learn in this latest development will serve us well in the future as we come to terms with the need to establish a European defence policy and capability, which in my view is as much an essential component of European integration as is the single currency. This experience will provide us with the opportunity to develop our own policies in such a way, despite Mr Van Orden's fears, that we do not unnecessarily antagonise our US allies or cause stresses and strains within NATO itself.</p>
<p class="contents">EU policy must always be based on the partnership approach which seeks to share NATO assets, particularly planning and intelligence as well as hardware, rather than duplicate the structures of NATO, particularly when we share common objectives. I believe this experience will serve the EU well when we come to develop our own defence policy, and I sincerely hope that that will come sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would just add a few words to the comments on Afghanistan and say that the Council is determined to provide humanitarian aid on the ground so long as operational conditions allow it.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall then make a few remarks on, obviously, only a few aspects of the very comprehensive debate we have just held on the reports by Mr Brok and Mrs Lalumière, the broad lines of which, I believe, were largely endorsed. This, of course, encourages the governments in the work they are doing and will, I think, support the Nice Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the question of the position of defence capabilities within the European Union's spectrum of political and practical instruments. As many speakers have said, among the means at the European Union's disposal, military means must be used only by last resort. Obviously I must emphasise this principle, which is the one the governments uphold. But what does "by last resort" mean? It means when everything else has failed and that is the only option. We saw this happen in Europe two years ago, and in Kosovo a year and a half ago. All the political and diplomatic efforts, all the economic pressure, could not prevent the outbreak of violence in the heart of Europe and the unacceptable challenge that posed to all our European values. So armed force is certainly a last resort. But if we want it to prevent the unacceptable, it must be reliable and credible.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the European Union has the specific ability to combine these various instruments and that what we must do, if this policy progresses and becomes consolidated, is to develop a genuine European culture of conflict prevention and management. We have learned from past experience and are still learning, especially in the Balkans, that thanks to their historical experience, with all the many conflicts, thanks to their understanding of the subtle and at times tough nature of confrontations between communities, the Europeans can develop a savoir-faire and methods of conflict management that are worthy of it and worthy of respect.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of duplication, let me point out that the resources, the military assets the nations have freely accepted to provide for this joint force, are the same capabilities most of these nations make available to the Atlantic Alliance. There is no duplication of forces. They are the same forces, with the same level of preparation and readiness that most of our nations have – of course I belong to one of the nations that is not a member of the Alliance. But in regard to all those nations that are members of the Atlantic Alliance, there is no duplication in their defence effort between forces to provide support for the Alliance's activities and forces that could be made available to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of the concept: this concept was adopted in 1992. It relates to the Petersberg tasks. They are enshrined in an agreement between European governments, which provides lines of conduct that are, in my view, well-tried and very broadly endorsed by European public opinion. Any action that had to be taken would obviously have to be decided by the governments on a basis of consensus, and as several speakers said, if we emphasise in the declarations that we are not talking about a European army, that means that clearly there is no authority superior to the nations that could force them to commit their forces to any operation whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">So Europe is not about to form a new alliance as some people, who are not, I believe, fully informed, have suggested. It will operate on the basis of national decisions taken in the framework of intergovernmental cooperation under the control of the national parliaments, in respect for the Petersberg tasks and in compliance, as we have also said in our declarations, with the principles of the United Nations Charter. I believe that the European security and defence policy will move in the direction of providing an additional capability, practical support for the role of the United Nations, which is to resolve conflicts, including cases where the belligerents have to be kept apart.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my reply to a comment made by one speaker to the effect that the United Kingdom and France concluded an agreement in Saint Malo that would restrict the European Parliament's rights. That is not what it was about. The agreement reached in Saint Malo, which was primarily an agreement between the fifteen nations, was that if they wanted Europe to have a practical, effective capacity for action in the defence field, this could only be achieved on an intergovernmental basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that for a period of 50 years we hesitated or failed to give the European Union the minimum capability it needed so as not just to be an impotent witness to crises or outbreaks of violence. Today the only option we have is intergovernmental action. That suits all our democratic nations because it preserves their ultimate right to decide on the use of force. De facto, therefore, it is true that parliamentary control is largely the result of the nations choosing the intergovernmental option.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also note, by the way, that the positions adopted by the Council do not, and will not, include any EU budgetary commitment to finance military action of whatever kind. Does that mean there can be no dialogue between the Council, representing the governments, and the European Parliament on defence and security? I think this debate, which everyone has welcomed, is a first demonstration that the opposite is true. I believe we will see a positive dialogue developing.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? Because if we remain consistent with the decisions that have been taken, we will see a gradual rise in the European Union's level of responsibility, credibility and influence in crisis management. We will stop being a mere commentator. As a result, public opinion and our parliaments, including this one, will begin to give deeper political thought to the issues involved in resolving crises by a whole range of means, of which armed force is but one component. And the nature of the principles and thoughts set out in the reports by Mr Brok and Mrs Lalumière already show and indeed foreshadow how useful these debates could be.</p>
<p class="contents">There will still be other forms of rapprochement to invent with the national parliaments, but at any rate one thing that is within our reach and that represents a turning point I believe we can all welcome, is the fact that the fifteen nations which make up this Union, which have already built a political reality that has a positive effect on the international balance of power, these fifteen nations have chosen to acquire the means to act jointly in cases where violence challenges our values. They are doing so because they believe in our common values. I see that as good news.</p>
