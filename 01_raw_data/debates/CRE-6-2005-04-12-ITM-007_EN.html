<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the Millennium Declaration adopted by world leaders in 2000 represents an unprecedented declaration of solidarity. It is evidence that there is real determination to achieve the Millennium Development Goal targets, which would lift 500 million people out of extreme poverty, would save 30 million children who would otherwise die before their fifth birthday, and would save more than 2 million mothers who would otherwise not have survived pregnancy and childbirth. Hundreds of millions of women and girls would be educated, and millions would have access to clean water and sanitation. The world has the technologies, the policies and the financial resources to deliver the promise and vision of the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">On aid, MDG8 highlights the need for substantial increases in ODA. Only four Member States have already reached the 0.7% target. Others have set timetables. Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Portugal, meanwhile, are all far off target. At the current rate, Germany will not reach its target until 2087. Italy, one of the world’s wealthiest countries and a G-8 member, gives only a miserly 0.17% of its GNI in aid. There has to be close monitoring of annual intermediate targets by EU finance ministers and foreign ministers. I should like to ask the Commissioner to respond to that part of our resolution. The financial perspective suggests that further squeezing of development spending by other categories, as well as within the external relations category, threatens the likelihood of us contributing as we should to meeting the MDG targets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must continue to work to improve the quality and effectiveness of our aid using the MDGs as the tool to guide our policies. Member States should collaborate and coordinate in a coherent way more than they do currently with the Commission, in order to tackle how aid can be best used to serve and fulfil the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">On unsustainable debt, most EU Member States are committed to cancelling the bilateral debts of the world’s poorest countries. Again, I am afraid that Italy must be singled out and named and shamed as a country continuing to make progress at a snail’s pace on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On trade, I totally agree and concur with the opinion presented by the Committee on International Trade, which covers a number of our concerns as far as the European Union’s role as the world’s biggest trading bloc is concerned: our role in dealing with access to markets, building capacity and other aspects of trade and trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union negotiates in a way that sometimes calls into question whether there is a clear enough understanding of the pro-development objectives that are referred to on so many occasions. This is true of both the WTO negotiations and the EPA negotiations where I can confirm that, as far as ACP countries are concerned, there is the sense of a need to feel that closer consultation has occurred and that there is greater understanding by DG Trade of the development aspects to which they give such high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">On the common agricultural policy, Member States must urgently tackle the practices that depress world prices, distort poor-country markets and undermine earning opportunities for their farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the amendments on trade and agriculture policies, which we will vote on later, are in all cases inappropriate and, in a number of cases, propose totally unrealistic options.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Parliament should reject Amendments 10 to 16, which reflect unacceptable conservative views on essential aspects of MDG targets. The supply of condoms for the treatment of sexually-transmitted diseases and access to safe and legal abortion must remain as clear priorities if the over-arching goal of poverty eradication is to be achieved. Five hundred and thirty thousand women died in pregnancy or childbirth last year. There were more than 3 million stillborn births. Four million infants did not survive their first year of life. We should support the real need to facilitate access to responsive post-abortion procedures. There is also a need to facilitate access to high-quality and safe services to the fullest extent provided and allowed for by the laws in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As the WHO reported only yesterday, 78 000 deaths occur as a result of unsafe abortions. Millions of women in desperate need resort to unsafe induced abortion. I would contradict those people who believe that any woman takes the decision to terminate a pregnancy lightly, and say very firmly that it is not and never would be the case. She has the right to choose good-quality responsive abortion and post-abortion care under the law. A woman has the right to choose.</p>

I would like to congratulate Mrs Kinnock and the Committee on Development on this report, which ought to stimulate discussion and negotiation on the measures required to achieve the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report, Mrs Kinnock, rightly emphasises the importance of the governments adopting strategies for achieving the Millennium Development Goals. It also stresses that the European Union’s development policies, the main objective of which must be the reduction of poverty, must be anchored in the Millennium Declaration and the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s MDG Synthesis Report outlines the progress that has been made in this regard. The European Union has on a number of occasions underlined that the review of the Millennium Goals at the United Nations summit in September 2005 will be crucial for accelerating progress towards the achievement of the MDGs. With a view to the European Union’s contribution to the summit, in November 2004 the Council invited the Commission to prepare specific ambitious proposals for action to be taken, in particular for development financing, the coherence of development policies and the priority to be given to Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will today be adopting a number of communications constituting its response to the Council’s invitation. This global political package summarises the EU’s contribution to development and identifies the measures to be taken to accelerate the achievement of the MDGs.</p>
<p class="contents">In many respects, your report and our communications share the same concerns and the same recommendations. I would like to mention a few of your report’s conclusions which we believe are very important and which are key points in the package of communications we will be presenting.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, as you underline, it is essential that we continue increasing development aid. The Commission is proposing new intermediate targets for 2010 in this regard; additional new sources of financing must be considered alongside the public aid budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the attention you pay to the coherence of development policies; it is in fact essential that we look at how policies other than aid can help in achieving the Millennium Goals. The communication on the coherence of development policies identifies no fewer than 11 priority areas where the challenge of achieving synergy with the development policy objectives is considered particularly relevant, in trade, for example – that goes without saying – in research, the environment, agriculture, fishing, to name but a few. Major synergies are possible with these different competences.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of your report’s recommendations are included in the EU Synthesis Report on the Millennium Goals, for example – as you rightly mention – the special attention that must be paid to the education of girls, to the necessity of meeting the needs of the most vulnerable groups, especially children, orphans, young women and the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the challenges Africa has to face, it is essential that the development partners give that continent priority. The European Union must do more, and wants to, to enable Africa to achieve the Millennium Goals. Africa must be the focus of our attention and it is vital that aid resources for Sub-Saharan Africa be increased. The European Union must ensure that a major proportion of the additional public development aid is directed towards Africa. Our proposals in the matter of coherence must also apply first and foremost to the African continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in addition to all our existing programmes, especially under the Cotonou Agreement, the Commission is proposing new commitments in fields with an obvious multiplier effect. I am thinking of governance, interconnection and equity.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for the New York summit are quickening apace. I also want to thank you for your contribution and I hope to continue working with you to ensure that Europe’s position is equal to the challenge of achieving the Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mrs Kinnock, I would like to say a few words about the communications which I shall shortly be submitting to the College of Commissioners. The process of preparation for the September summit has shown the progress made in many poor countries and the importance of the efforts made by the international community, and by the European Union in particular, for achieving the Millennium Goals. All the reports, the Secretary-General’s report, the Millennium Project report written under the direction of Professor Sachs, also show that the goals that were set for 2015 can still be achieved if we want to. As you said, however, this will require major investment by the developing countries as much as, obviously, by the donor countries. As the poor countries’ largest international donor and largest trading partner, the European Union therefore has a particular responsibility towards our own citizens, who expect us to set an example at international level, because it is an imperative of human solidarity, but one which is also in our own interests. If we want a more stable and a safer world, we must invest more massively in development. The EU also has a responsibility towards partners who often see Europe as a model: consider the African Union, for example, which has taken the European Union a benchmark. I believe the proposals I will be presenting this afternoon are equal to this challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">Those proposals have three main parts: first of all, development finance and aid effectiveness; secondly, policy coherence and, thirdly, priority for Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">On financing – and this will answer your question – the European Union has stuck to its commitments, and in 2006 its aid effort will probably exceed the joint target of 0.39% of the Member States’ gross national income. Obviously, this effort will have to continue, and I am proposing that the Member States set themselves a new individual intermediate target of at least 0.51% in 2010, corresponding to a collective effort of 0.56%. That would allow us to achieve the rate of 0.7% in 2015; that rate was set by the United Nations a long time ago and the Millennium Project experts believe it is necessary in order to achieve the MDGs. In terms of annual aid, that would be an increase of no less than EUR 20 billion per year in 2010, with EU aid rising from EUR 46 billion in 2006 to 66 billion in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, new sources of finance must also be encouraged. I forgot to say that I am going to suggest that the new Member States reach 0.17% in 2010; the difference is because they have much further to go; that should allow us to reach 0.7% in 2015. Additionally, then, new sources of finance must be encouraged, but that should on no account be a pretext for delaying or reducing the EU’s commitments for 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is improving aid effectiveness, another important task. The last few years have seen substantial progress in the management of Community aid. At EU level, the main challenge today is to implement the commitments given by the EU for better policy coordination, complementarity on the ground and procedural harmonisation. Europe must be much more than the mere sum of our States’ individual budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is the use of budget aid – to which I want to give priority – although aid effectiveness would gain much from it. It is not just a question of money, however. The real challenge is to contain globalisation by exercising a solidarity that will lay the foundations for a world social contract; that will involve not only an increase in public development aid but also global public policies that will allow the benefits of globalisation to be shared out more equitably.</p>
<p class="contents">Likewise, I am quite pleased to say that the Commission has for the first time agreed to talk about coherence and to identify, in competences other than development aid, no fewer than 11 areas that are development-related and may give it added value. I believe this is important. It is the first time the College has taken up this challenge and I think it is worth pointing that out.</p>
<p class="contents">The third component of our proposals is the priority given to Africa. There are three reasons for this. Sub-Saharan Africa is the most backward region. Europe is a weighty partner and Africa is a geopolitical partner that will assume increasing importance. The United States and China have already understood this, which explains their growing interest in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose stepping up our action in areas that have an obvious multiplier effect. There are three lines of approach here. Firstly, in the area of governance, we must support the implementation of the reforms emerging from the African peer review mechanism. We must also provide refinancing for the peace facility, to support the African Union and sub-regional organisations in conflict-prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">I would describe this first line as the political line, in the general sense of the term. The second line is the economic line. Infrastructures and network interconnections must be supported on the basis of the African Union’s and NEPAD’s strategies to facilitate South-South trade. I am in fact thinking here of really getting the large Trans-African networks off the ground as we had to do in Europe with the large Trans-European networks. We must make the construction and implementation of these large Trans-African networks a definite priority objective. That is the economic line. I am thinking of all the infrastructures, of everything associated with communications, of technology transfer, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The third line is the social line. It is obviously the politics of equity. The European Union must develop incentives and support the African countries in their efforts to promote social cohesion, employment and environmental protection. I am thinking more specifically of education, health and culture. During my hearing, I said that culture was a far more important vector of development than people think and I would like to make the most of it.</p>
<p class="contents">This set of communications seeks to unite the Member States around a European vision that would give the EU the influence, credibility and visibility it needs in order to make an effective contribution to the September 2005 summit. At present, I am touring the capitals to mobilise the national parliaments and the Member States on this question.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in September these three communications will result in the complete redefinition of development policy, as I said, in the form of a new development policy statement, which I intend to translate into a common European development strategy. I see absolutely no reason why we cannot do for development what we have succeeded in doing for the common security strategy. I would also like to come up with a real plan of campaign for Africa based on the three lines of approach I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Mr President, Mrs Kinnock, honourable Members, is the reply I wanted to give you. I hope I have been complete. If there are other questions or if I have inadvertently failed to answer any of your questions, do not hesitate to ask me. I am of course at your disposal to answer them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Central to these goals is the elimination of poverty. The rapporteur is right to emphasise three areas where the European Union should really do better: delivering on promises, closer policy coordination, and the more efficient deployment of resources. I am pleased that the Commissioner afforded ample consideration to this in his speech. Indeed, the pledge to set aside 0.7% of the GDP for development aid is as yet being met by only five Member States. Both policy coordination and our assistance to developing countries in developing their local and regional economies lack credibility if we, at the same time, sabotage these via our agricultural and trade policy. I am pleased that this is a major consideration for the Commissioner. Thirdly, as regards the efficient deployment of resources, we can achieve much more if we work more efficiently and make more use of the possible ‘quick wins’, such as the distribution of mosquito nets in the fight against malaria.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to stress a few items of importance, which are also covered in the report. As regards the importance of education for girls, it cannot be emphasised enough that girls and women often suffer disproportionately from hunger and other problems, of which the lack of access to education is certainly one. Moreover, research shows that the education of girls has a positive bearing on the whole of society, including the fight against poverty as such.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important to diversify the cultivation of products and attain a firm foothold for small and medium-sized enterprises, with a view to creating a stable economy. Thirdly, there is the need for what is termed special and differential treatment of poor countries, which will also be an important consideration for the WTO. Fourthly, the availability of, and access to, basic health care, on which any health policy depends. Finally, there is a need for the reinforcement of capacities on all fronts.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, there is much to be done and fortunately, Europe does do a great deal. As the largest donor, Europe faces a huge challenge, as the Commissioner already stated, if it is to be the largest player in terms of vision, coherence and decisiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we apply this to Africa, we have to conclude that the situation is tragic in all these respects, because instead of bringing those goals towards 2015 closer, we are moving further away from them. At this rate, we will not achieve them in 100 years. This creates an image of incompetence on the part of world leadership, especially where Africa is concerned. That there is no need for this is clear from Mr Geoffrey Sachs’ recent report. Given sufficient funding, sound priorities in place and a sufficiently campaign-based focus, malaria could, for example, be eradicated, children – particularly girls – could go to school, and poverty could be halved.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has already said, the UN Summit in September will offer the opportunity to clinch millennium deals. That is why it is, of course, extremely important that the Commission and the Council should translate the agreements reached at that Summit into European objectives for the EU. As the Commissioner said, we can do this by means of funding at Member State level, but also by this House and the Council giving multi-annual funding sufficient priority, and this being reflected in the percentage for social expenditure of the millennium goals, including, in particular, this 20% for basic education and basic health care. The current figures – 2% for education, 6% for health care, also in the European Development Fund figures – are alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge not only the Commission and the Council, but also Parliament, to really take these requirements on board, so that we can avoid a confrontation and can together back this initiative all the way. We are prepared to give the Commission leeway in the implementation, provided that the agreements are uncompromising; above all, they need to be laid down clearly and effectively, because the current levels of 2% and 6% are really unacceptable. We would have to wait for another 100 years, and that we refuse to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is important that the Commission and Parliament should coordinate their positions and present a united vision.</p>
<p class="contents">As you say, the European Union is the largest donor, with 55% of world public aid. We therefore need to keep ourselves in first position and keeping promises is something that is rather well regarded in politics. I have noted the step-by-step increases you propose; the targets are both praiseworthy and achievable – Mrs Kinnock spelled them out, so I will not repeat them. An overall 0.7 is achievable, and with the stages you mention we will rise to 0.51 in 2010 and reach 0.7 in 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to point out that the EUR 20 billion a year increase you mentioned is more or less the equivalent of one and a half European Development Funds a year, whereas the European Development Fund is a five-year programme. A great deal of money could therefore be paid out if we want to make that kind of effort.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would like to draw your attention very quickly to four small points: first, the absolute necessity of policy coordination, which you illustrated with your 11 areas, also applies for agricultural subsidies if we are not going to ruin with one hand what we are giving with the other; the same is true between European countries if we are to avoid the healthy emulation that is sometimes found on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, our partners must assume some responsibility; this of course involves a governance requirement and a requirement for budget aid to be verified, which seems to be another good method, and finally, as you stressed, Mr Michel, the accompaniment of large regional projects, in particular for large Trans-African networks. We already have the possibility of using the balance of the EDF to finance some of these large networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the control of public money. It is essential that the way taxpayers’ money is used should be entirely visible. If we want to be able to ask for even more, we must have identifiable and demonstrable objectives for our friends in the European countries who are giving public money for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the place of the private sector. We will achieve nothing without political security, without legal security, without infrastructures and without a market. Public aid is no substitute for development involving the private sector. Let us therefore be exemplary donors, but let us be lucid partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The common agricultural policy, which is not very accurate in the allocation of funds, has made things difficult in Europe and in many developing countries, especially in ACP countries. On the one hand, Europe should guarantee that the common agricultural policy is not being used to increase the benefits of large producers while small producers are in a very complicated situation. On the other hand, it should be guaranteed that product subsidies by the EU will not be an obstacle for the developing and ACP countries. Theoretically, the EU could help to eradicate poverty and famine in the world if it changed its agricultural policy. Better conditions in the developing countries should mean benefits for Europe and for the whole world. But before that, we also need to eradicate the very clear discrimination in the EU, which favours the big producers while small ones and thousands of farmers have to leave agriculture every year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to overturn the rules of international trade, rejecting the imposition of trade agreements and indiscriminate liberalisation and, instead, support fair trade and a culture based on rights – the right of access to education, water, food and healthcare. Today is the start of the Global Week of Action to deliver those rights and control international trade, and there are people here in Parliament, today, who are emphasising that need.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the first time that the United Nations and the international community have attempted to launch a programme to eradicate poverty. However, there have been 15 years of broken promises, while the aim of devoting 0.7% of the GDP of more developed countries to the poor nations is still a remote one. Mrs Kinnock is right when she says that the policy of Italy – my country – is shameful; I share her view, although I believe that the UK’s involvement in the Iraq war is also shameful.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the Member States must not fail in their moral responsibilities and obligations. Alternative sources of finance must be discussed. We must prevent spurious accounting, avoid expenditure on security being classed as development spending and stop budget figures being inflated by debt cancellation measures. The debt must be cancelled.</p>
<p class="contents">True development cooperation can be achieved by equipping those countries with the infrastructure and tools needed for them to organise their own economic and social development.

An attempt is being made to close the yawning gaps that currently exist between the living conditions of the people inhabiting this planet. This can also be regarded as a practical test of our understanding of the word ‘neighbour’, in relation to both individuals and nations. Speaking in this House and at this point in time, I feel obliged to mention the Holy Father John Paul II, whose memory this House honoured yesterday, as this issue was one of particular concern to him, and he appealed to the consciences of people all over the world. The history of humanity shows us that the Millennium Development Goals, which as we know were adopted in the Jubilee Year 2000, are indeed worthy of their name, as we should not forget that the fight against poverty has been waged on Earth for millennia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Millennium Goals must be implemented effectively and as rapidly as possible. I should therefore like to thank Mrs Kinnock for the effort she has put into drafting a report setting out the European Union’s role in achieving these goals. At the same time, however, I am unable to consent to pro-abortion measures masquerading under the name of reproductive health rights being termed progress, as is the case in paragraph 15.</p>
<p class="contents">The short speaking time available to me makes it impossible for me to examine this issue in full, even though it is of enormous significance. I should, however, like to share some thoughts on the matter with you. It is sometimes said that people are poor because they are stupid, and it is also said that they are stupid because they are poor. This vicious circle of helplessness must be broken, and aid must be given to poor countries and regions in the form of large-scale investment in education. It is true that primary education is mentioned in the second of the Millennium Goals, but in my opinion this falls a long way short of what is needed. Good secondary schools and universities must be built in these countries and regions. I would particularly like to stress that the schools and universities must be situated in the countries and regions in question, in order to ensure that these nations produce educated people who wish to help their fellow citizens. We must therefore pay close attention to the needs of local communities, instead of attempting to bestow happiness in line with someone else’s ideas, however noble they may be. Otherwise we will be building houses on sand, and our actions will amount to giving people fish rather than teaching them how to fish for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to touch upon one more issue, namely that appropriate funding is needed to solve these problems properly. This will involve a great deal of money, but no more than the richer countries, which include the European Union, can afford. The funding currently available is by no means adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to alert the House to the fact that quite considerable funding could be obtained for this universal cause by introducing a tax on foreign exchange transactions, or in other words a Tobin tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to actually achieve this, we will need to look beyond the present report’s unilateral measures, and, above all, to admit that massive development aid of the past 30 years has in the final analysis, all things considered, had very little impact.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, what destroyed the favourable infrastructural and trade position in black Africa in the sixties was general corruption, ethnic conflicts and the devastating ideological hair-splitting on the part of the ruling elites. Why is it, for example, that Zimbabwe, in a matter of a few decades, has been transformed from the granary and storehouse of the whole of southern Africa into a land ravaged by terrible starvation? We should therefore have the courage to spell out the two major obstacles to lasting development of the poor countries; they are corruption and bad governance, and they are hardly our fault. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that development is a global concept for the all-round promotion of the welfare and dignity of human beings, but the means for achieving that can be summed up in one word: solidarity. It is therefore remarkable that the European Union provides more than 50% of world development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, however, does not promote respect for cultural diversity and different traditions in its external relations, even though they are the key to European integration. Financial aid conceals issues of geopolitical power and cultural influence, and the European Union sometimes buys the votes of the developing countries in the United Nations General Assembly. If we are to take joint decisions, we must listen to and respect every one, and even more so when we are looking to define positions affecting fundamental cultural and moral values. The nations of the UN who are mentioned in the Preamble to the Charter are entitled to have their dignity and their traditions respected regardless of their economic level. So far as human rights are concerned, they must be strengthened by giving them a sound ethical basis, otherwise they will remain weak and without foundations. We must reaffirm that human rights are not created or granted by anyone but that they are inherent in human nature.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution on which we are being asked to vote shows the gap between how the wealth that the family represents is understood in the developing countries and in the European Union. Would we not be very much open to criticism if we were to use such important issues as the achievement of the Millennium Goals for our own ends?

As regards our chances of achieving these objectives, we are in a very, very sad state, and Mrs Kinnock’s report shows what changes in policy are needed if we are to achieve them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something about debt relief policy as well as about the report that we will be voting on tomorrow. It may have escaped a number of Members of this House that, when discussing debt relief policy, it has to be said that two thirds of the developing countries spend more on servicing their debts than they do on social services. That this has an effect on the achievement of – or failure to achieve – the Development Goals hardly needs to be said.</p>
<p class="contents">What this means is that there is a need for change in many policy areas, but also for a doubling of the aid we currently give, and for the resultant amount to be sustained for at least 10 years – hence the commendation for those Member States that have already reached the 0.7% mark.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kinnock’s report stresses the need for the 0.7% mark for bilateral development cooperation to be achieved. I regret that this cannot be the occasion for ‘naming and shaming’, but Mrs Kinnock’s explanatory statement lists the states that are a long way from reaching the 0.7% mark: Austria, Germany, Greece, Italy and Portugal. I would ask the Commission to perhaps produce a timetable for all the Member States or bring pressure to bear on them to get them to achieve this target. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the subject of the implementation of the Millennium Development Goals, it is proposed that the aid given to developing countries should be doubled for a period of at least a decade, that all debts should be written off until 2015, and that new additional sources of aid should be sought, by introducing new taxes for EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, very little talk of aid efficiency. By not imposing conditions such as the efficiency of the utilisation of loans given, positive tendencies for social and economic development, and requirements for the implementation of democracy and human rights, developing states will not be encouraged to accept responsibility for the social and economic development of their countries and will not feel accountable to their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">When talking about aid for developing countries we ought to rethink the European Union's aid policy and offer measures by not only confining ourselves to the Millennium Goals, but by looking for ways of encouraging economic growth in developing countries, in particular investment, and especially in small and medium-sized businesses, thereby giving developing countries the opportunity to rise to a more developed level and a developed state level. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we must also look at other sources of funding.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the proposals put forward, which genuinely has potential, is to introduce a levy on aviation fuel. Aviation fuel is one of the major contributors to the greenhouse effect. Such a levy would both provide money for the poor – assuming the money is used for this, of course – and would at the same time be in harmony with the Kyoto Protocol. Quite a few governments have, to put it mildly, been hesitant to adopt this proposal, and I include my own Danish Government here. I very much hope, however, that the European Parliament will push ahead with this development.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me simply to mention another proposed source, namely the enormous amounts spent on our agricultural subsidies that are destroying things for the developing countries. At the very least, the damaging export subsidy should, in any case, be phased out as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Millennium Development Goals are first and foremost a moral issue. The huge differences in standards of living that exist in today’s world are becoming evermore absurd. We have both the knowledge and the resources to eradicate poverty now, and there is no excuse for not stepping up our efforts. I welcome this report which contains a series of constructive proposals that I hope will influence the Commission’s work during the next few months. Certainly, the Millennium Development Goals are not easy to achieve. Increased efforts are needed not only in the industrialised countries but also on the part of the recipients. We must bring about a fairer trade system. Corruption is a major problem and must be combated vigorously. We need more money, but we also need more effective aid. The lack of coordination of donors’ contributions is a major problem. In the same way, the lack of dialogue so far within the EU about who is to do what among the Member States and in the Commission is a great problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The content is also crucial, of course. Allow me just to mention one area that is too often neglected within development cooperation. I am thinking of the management of natural resources. The poor majority in rural areas are completely dependent upon what is produced by the countryside. A development in which forests, pasture land, soil for cultivation and fresh water resources are decimated and reduced in quality is therefore extremely serious. A major analysis of this development, known as the millennium assessment,<span class="italic"> </span>was presented last week and makes for depressing reading. The destruction of basic natural resources is generally accelerating throughout the world and constitutes a major obstacle to achieving the Millennium Development Goals. I assume that significantly more attention will be given to this aspect of development cooperation in the Commission’s forthcoming work.</p>

I do not think that anyone stands to benefit more from promoting world trade than do the developing countries. If sub-Saharan Africa were to increase its share in world trade by 1%, its revenue from exports would increase by 60 billion. Following the ‘everything but arms’ campaign, the European Union, being the world’s largest trade bloc, should be able to make it clear that it is being serious about this by setting a date by which all export subsidies for agricultural products must be cancelled. Surely it is no longer acceptable to be given a daily subsidy of USD 2 for every cow, while half of the world population has to survive on less than that. If we abolished these unfair agricultural subsidies, it would add to the EU’s credibility in this policy area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very happy to introduce the opinion of the Committee on International Trade, which was passed unanimously and adopted <span class="italic">en bloc</span> by the Committee on Development. That demonstrates the growing consensus that while trade clearly has a role in poverty eradication, the current trends and institutions of trade policy will need urgent reform if they are genuinely to lead to poverty eradication and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Our opinion notes the recent report by UNCTAD and others that demonstrates that unfettered and extensive trade liberalisation does not necessarily translate into significant poverty eradication, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. I quote from the UNCTAD 2004 report on least-developed countries, which says: ‘The emerging post-liberal trends do not indicate that substantial and sustained poverty reduction will occur. On balance, future poverty reduction seems to have worsened’. So our first point in this opinion is to ask the Commission and Council to note that analysis and to modify trade policy accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first place they could apply that reformed trade policy is on the EU proposals for economic partnership agreements, because again increasing evidence suggests that if economic partnership agreements are to become genuine instruments of development, they have to offer non-reciprocal market access for as long as developing countries require it. I welcome recent statements from my own government in the UK that appear to guarantee poorest countries as much time as they need before acquiring that reciprocity. I urge the Council to adopt that position but warn that it will not be credible unless Article 24 of the GATT is revised accordingly as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally we call on the Council and Commission to address the almost forgotten issue of commodity prices, which is strangely absent from the WTO agenda. According to Oxfam, developing countries would have earned USD 243 billion more in 2002 if the real prices of ten key commodities had remained at their 1980 levels. That is almost five times the world’s annual aid budget. We desperately need urgent action on this issue if we are to have any chance of meeting the MDG goals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think most of what has been said will be reflected in the communications which I will be asking the Commission to adopt, most probably in a few minutes’ time, and which I outlined to you a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the other remarks that have been made will be debated and, I hope, decided, in the development policy statement I announced, which is being opened for very wide discussion, consultation and debate today and should therefore be ready when we reconvene in September.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight one fundamental topic: market liberalisation; the last speaker raised this question, and as a liberal I am sure I will surprise you here. I, too, think that market liberalisation can only be beneficial if there is a State capable of enforcing the rules. I believe that in the 1990s we were wrong to think that total market liberalisation, even where there was no State, would spontaneously create wealth for distribution. I am in broad agreement with the limits you place on market liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be more debates of this kind over the next few weeks and months. However, I would like to take the opportunity now to ask you whether the time for action has not now come. There have been plenty of studies, consultations and findings. We can of course continue to reflect, to debate concepts, categories and principles: all that is very important; but I would like my policy to be above all a policy of implementation, of getting things done. I am therefore appealing to you – speakers have made a number of specific proposals today: if you have definite ideas about how our development policy can be implemented effectively, I am obviously interested to hear them.</p>
<p class="contents">Without in any way disputing the validity of some of the rules governing development, I have to say to you that when some of those rules are given a strictly technocratic application, they make the achievement of certain goals virtually impossible. That is a question I would like to be able to debate with you from time to time. In any case, I promise I will place a number of proposals before you in the next few weeks to try to be more effective. Ensuring that there is coherence between different policies is in fact one way of being more effective. Well-managed budgetary aid, sectorally oriented, for example, may obviously make us more effective; better coordination, greater harmonisation between national rules, is obviously another way of being more effective. Those are just a few examples. Mr President, honourable Members, thank you for all these comments and considerations. I promise to make best use of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
