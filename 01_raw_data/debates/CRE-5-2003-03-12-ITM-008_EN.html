It was also incorporated into the Regulation for the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality of opportunities is an objective in all the programmes and actions cofinanced by the Funds. Despite these very clear objectives and their compulsory nature, we have observed that, apart from the European Social Fund, they are not being met, even when they are included in a programme that is due to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund is the only programme in the field of employment, vocational training and career development that is meeting this objective with specific programmes intended to achieve equal opportunities; but other important areas, such as infrastructures, transport, the environment, local and urban development, rural development, research, etc., do not feature equality amongst their objectives. Although the European Social Fund focuses on promoting employment, major actions still need to be undertaken, such as reducing segregation in the labour market and pay inequalities, and promoting the role of women in the fields of information and communication technologies, entrepreneurship, new employment opportunities and the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask the Commission to adopt more specific and more effective measures to remedy these shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that there is a clear lack of will in the Member States to promote the objective of equality in the Structural Funds. It is true that progress has been made on compiling statistics broken down by gender, which gives us a truer picture of the situation, but monitoring indicators for the programmes have not improved in relation to previous programming.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are responsible for programming and we ask them to make more of an effort to support specific policies and actions to achieve the objective of equal opportunities, by selecting projects that meet this aim. The Member States could also develop infrastructures, such as nurseries, and day centres for the elderly or the disabled; normally these obligations are taken on by the women in the family and, with the appropriate infrastructures, we could ensure that women are better integrated into working life, promote the reorganisation of working time and arrangements for returning to work after long absences and do more to raise awareness of the need for an equal division of tasks between women and men in families.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention must be paid to women who find it harder to achieve equality of opportunity, such as women with disabilities, immigrants and heads of families. Greater integration of women into decision-making bodies would undoubtedly facilitate this task. Training and awareness-raising in the field of equal opportunities should not only target these women, however, but society as a whole. Let us take the opportunities provided by the Treaty and the Structural Funds Regulation to make progress in equal opportunities with projects that fulfil these objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">The mid-term evaluation that will be undertaken this year, half-way through the programme, must analyse the extent to which account has been taken of this objective: the nature and the size of the appropriations earmarked for these practical actions in the field of equal opportunities to undertake the necessary changes, for the second programming period. Account must also be taken of the importance of these actions in the candidate countries, which will become Members of the EU in just over a year and which have administrative and economic restructuring difficulties that particularly affect women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate Mrs Avilés Perea – and this is not just a courtesy – because this debate here today really is an important debate, given that the Structural Funds are a very specific application of policy and allow us to measure whether or not it has had any substantive results. Naturally the Structural Funds are also subject to the dual approach to gender equality, by which I mean mainstreaming and specific practices and specific programmes open only to women, what we call positive action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, as several speakers have said, that this objective is not always achieved. The Structural Funds regulation is an important tool, but it needs to be applied correctly in practice. There are four stages: the conception or planning of the programme, its application, monitoring and evaluation. If the parties involved in these four processes fail to demonstrate the awareness and commitment needed in specific polices, there are no results.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish Government recently held a seminar for all its ministers. The ministerial council was given a seminar on mainstreaming, at which planning requirements in all the individual political areas were explained. What we have to realise is that political awareness raising is needed among Structural Fund programmes planners, be they at ministerial level or at regional or local level. We do not see that everywhere. I think that there is a serious political deficit in the evaluations carried out. That is my first point.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to stage two, which is application, and stage three, which is monitoring. The administration – all levels of the administration – play a very important part here, and this refers back to what was said during the debate. The administration in every country, with a few exceptions, is staffed overwhelmingly in the upper echelons by men, with only a few countries arranging awareness raising and training for administrative officials. This means that the special level of awareness needed to help promote objectives, even at this stage, is lacking at the application and monitoring levels. That brings me to the fourth stage, which is evaluation. This is where firms of consultants come in and external offices carry out evaluations. They are instructed to carry out a separate evaluation of the impact of policies and programmes on women in very few instances.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Commission was quite right to present a communication in December 2002 on gender mainstreaming in the Structural Funds for 2000 to 2006; it could not have done so at a better time. This gives us an initial opportunity, in the first two years’ implementation of the new Community Support Framework, to see if and to what extent Member States have taken account of the gender dimension at the planning stage. We have initial records; we do not have statistics because, as you know, most programmes started up in the last 18 months. What we can see, taking account of subsidiarity in the planning of the Structural Funds, is that a number of good practices and important indicators have been introduced, but only by certain Member States. These indicators include the number of women which have set up their own company, the ratio between the number of programmes for women and other programmes, the percentage of women trained in the information society, which local employment programmes take account of the gender dimension, the percentage of women taking part in training programmes overall and a whole series of indicators which only certain countries use. It is not the rule and I think it would be a good idea if your committee and the members of parliament in each country were to lobby their governments, because we do not have indicators for all the individual programmes and that is what we need.</p>
<p class="contents">This communication has come along at exactly the right time, because it gives us the opportunity to consider revising the Structural Funds and changing the distribution of funding and the distribution of the new reserve, in order to take account of how well these programmes perform from the mainstreaming perspective. This interim review will give us ample opportunity, together with the records of what has been happening in the Member States, to see how we can lobby for funds to be redistributed and channelled to specific policies for women.</p>
<p class="contents">To be more specific, we need to award extra marks to programmes approved for funding which include the gender dimension. We need special actions to promote these gender equality-related programmes and promotion generally has an exponential effect because it raises awareness among programme planners.</p>
<p class="contents">A third important point is the need for more training for senior administrative officials and politicians. More efficient planning depends on training in political parties, governments, local authorities and administrations; naturally, this training for actual programme planners can be funded from the Social Fund without any problem.</p>
<p class="contents">My fourth point has to do with preparing the enlargement countries. What we are trying to do from the outset, at least as far as my fund is concerned, is to ensure that there is a senior official in the departments set up in the candidate countries for the Social Fund who is trained and instructed in Brussels from the outset, so that Social Fund planning takes account of mainstreaming right from the start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the fact that obligations in the field of equal opportunities have been transposed into the regulations on the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period, their implementation is still weak in operations cofinanced by the Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Social Fund still plays a vital role in implementing this objective, in comparison with other funds, because most programmes cover the fields of employment and social affairs. We are forced to admit that much still remains to do in reducing segregation in the labour market and wage inequalities. The gaps are many and various: the low level of women’s participation in information and communication technologies, the low level of entrepreneurship amongst women and their lack of representation in the decision-making process. This is just to mention a few of the shortcomings and to show that the Commission must act to remedy them.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is appropriate, not to say crucial, that the Commission establishes guidelines ensuring that the issue of equal opportunities is taken into account in all of the Structural Funds’ spheres of action. Member States clearly cannot remain uninvolved. It should be stated, as a matter of fact, that despite the importance of the political commitment they have given, Member States have failed appropriately to honour this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States must be more consistent in developing measures for the systematic integration of equal opportunities into all stages of programming and implementation of actions and in periodically submitting a report to the Commission on the progress they have made. Statistics broken down by gender must be drawn up to monitor and evaluate programmes, and raising the awareness and training of candidates and of the various parties involved, from drafting stage to implementation, is also essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It is reasonable to give the responsible authorities the right to reject proposals or to propose their revision and to apply penalties in the event that projects do not comply with the requirements to integrate equal opportunities. A final remark to emphasise that this year the interim evaluation of the Structural Funds for the 2000-2006 period will take place. In this context, the Commission and the Member States must take the opportunity to undertake the necessary modifications so as to increase the degree of implementation of the objective of equal opportunities for men and women for the remaining programming period. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same commitment applies to the Equal, Interreg III, Urban II and Leader Plus Community initiatives. However, as we have already heard from the previous speakers, the implementation of the objectives to be pursued to achieve equality between men and women in these programmes leaves a great deal to be desired in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has undertaken to present a mid-term review of the Structural Funds by the end of the year. I believe that this own-initiative report by Mrs Avilés Perea could provide a good foundation for that and I would like to briefly mention a few more of our aspirations and identify some of the shortcomings here.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of things that need to be improved as regards the allocation of funds. There needs to be balanced participation by men and women in the bodies responsible for decision-making, selection and monitoring at local, regional and national level. Information needs to be provided to applicants and project management staff on how equality of opportunities can be effectively incorporated into draft measures. One of the important things here is for Structural Fund plans and programmes to include financing programmes which identify funding available for individual measures and actions to improve equality of opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">This would both emphasise and guarantee that equal opportunities are being taken seriously and are really to be implemented in these programmes. The difficulties, resulting from structural weaknesses, involved in reconciling professional and family life still represent a problem. If equal opportunities are not systematically incorporated into all stages of programme planning and implementation, they will continue to be scandalously neglected in the future as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Fund needs to be used far more intensively as an instrument for remedying the inequitable treatment of women in the labour market. Women's demands for equal pay for equal work go back a very long way, but they have still not been met. We need to promote women in the areas of information technology and entrepreneurship. There is also a failure to develop adequate new forms of employment. Although the Member States have formally committed themselves to equal opportunities, implementation of them still falls short in many areas, despite legislation to promote equality of opportunities. So the question that arises once again is this: what is the point of having excellent legislation if failure to comply with it has virtually no consequences?</p>

In terms of equality policy, we have unfortunately begun far too late to focus upon money rather than upon mere words. When we do indeed focus upon money, we shall be able to attach some real figures to inequality. In this area, the EU’s Structural Funds are its handiest tools for redistributing resources, firstly between the regions and secondly between population groups. They must therefore be seen as key tools for achieving one of the Community's overarching goals: equality between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">As both Mrs Avilés Perea’s report and analyses by quite a few women’s organisations show, however, the gender dimension has not, as Commissioner Diamantopoulou<span class="bold"> </span>pointed out,<span class="bold"> </span>been anything like adequately incorporated. The fact that this has not happened is one issue. Another issue is that, when we address one of the major challenges for the EU – namely enlargement – we shall be faced with still greater challenges in the area of equality. We are now to have an array of new Member States with traditions and histories different from our own and, therefore, with views of the concept of equality different from that which we have in the existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Communist regimes considered the oppression of women as something peculiar to capitalist societies, and sexual equality was therefore officially introduced. This meant that women were to go out to work and to take part in political life. In return, nurseries were set up, maternity leave was introduced and abortion was legalised in a number of countries. It worked in the sense that the proportion of women in the labour market was high in relation to what it was in the existing EU countries. The other side of the coin, however, was that, in many cases, women experienced their work as nothing more than a mere duty, and not as a right, and there was no question at all of equal wages and therefore, of course, no question of equality either.</p>
<p class="contents">It can now be seen that, with the transition to a market economy, unemployment has hit women hard, and unemployment is something women will often associate with accession to the EU. The EU must therefore make an extra effort to convince women that the EU is something other than a crude market economy. It is in this area, moreover, that the Structural Funds have a central role to play, specifically through their representatives in the different countries knowing how to practise mainstreaming and how to involve women in projects, for otherwise there will be no projects beneficial to women, precisely because the latter are not in the first place well disposed towards the market economy and the EU and because they have the historical background I have already described. In this context, I hope that Commissioner Diamantopoulou<span class="bold"> </span>will follow up on what she has already said along the lines of our being alert to this issue and that she will also intervene if it proves that there has been no proper mainstreaming. I am, moreover, completely convinced that all of us who are here this evening will happily help her. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I was reflecting upon what I should say in these two consecutive debates, it occurred to me how concentrating upon women’s issues induces a degree of political weariness. There is no lack of men who maintain that progress is being made but, rather than agree with their view, I just get weary sometimes.</p>
<p class="contents">In the fifth century, what was then an elitist male Church in Europe decreed at one of its Councils that women had souls. In 1993, the UN conference in Vienna decided that women’s rights are also human rights. In other words, there are more than 1 500 years between these two decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Women I meet throughout the Member States are also extremely weary. They are weary of participating in projects that do not lead anywhere. I usually urge them to find out what the situation is in terms of options offered by, specifically, the Structural Funds. In her report, Mrs Avilés Perea indicates the difficulties arising from the individual nations’ unwillingness to see an equality dimension in the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Swedish Parliament, my party has, for quite a few years, called upon the Swedish Government to provide us with assessments, especially in a gender perspective. Our calls have fallen upon deaf ears. I genuinely hope, therefore, that the Commission and Parliament – and the Swedish Liberals where Sweden is concerned – can cooperate in bringing this about.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, is a change in traditional male thinking to be effected in board rooms, for example? Boards often talk about competence, but no one has ever really succeeded in defining what is meant by competence and what type of competence is genuinely needed in a modern society. On this issue, I really do support the Swedish Minister for Equality who, with her recent pledge to use legislation to introduce quotas if we cannot get more women onto company boards, has hopefully also promised a new approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I said in the previous debate that we needed gender-based structural transformation. That is what I am backing. It is so rare for us to have debates on equality here in plenary. In this context, I cannot forbear to mention the Convention – one that now wishes to introduce a Christian basis, but no equality between the sexes. That is why I was thinking of the fifth century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome this report and I am pleased that the committee has taken the initiative to prepare before the mid-term review, so that amendments can be made at that stage.</p>
<p class="contents">As we all know, when operated effectively Structural Funds play a key role in helping the regions and the people in most need, reviving deprived communities and helping to combat social exclusion. It stands to reason that women and gender equality are central elements of this.</p>
<p class="contents">My constituency in Wales includes some of Europe's poorest communities. Wales is a beneficiary of Objective I funding and has probably had a very similar experience to other areas of Europe. Good work has been done. The European Equality Partnership in Wales has developed systems to try to integrate mainstreaming and fully consider gender and other equality issues in the programming. But people working on the ground still report frustrations. There is a lack of understanding by those running programmes of the economic importance of equal opportunities and the positive effects for the whole community. Good practice is sometimes undermined by the pressure to comply with spending deadlines. Technical assistance is lacking for people trying to implement equality measures. For us in Wales, in particular, there is a worrying under-spend in the gender-specific measures. That is something we need to investigate.</p>
<p class="contents">All this shows the importance of monitoring systems which will enable us to compare what is really on the ground in different countries. We now have the mid-term review, which is an opportunity to deal with the issues raised in Mrs Avilés Perea's report, a chance to move the equality agenda forward. For that to happen, the training and support mechanisms need to be in place to ensure implementation as well as efficient monitoring and sanctions for non-compliance. Involving women and equality organisations in the evaluation is extremely important. Much depends on their commitment, hard work and vigilance, which the Member States would do well to try to match. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have seen that, despite the Member States’ commitment to incorporate the objective of mainstreaming equal opportunities in the Community Support Frameworks, this commitment has not been honoured. There is a lack of specialised monitoring mechanisms, adequate information, adequate quantitative and qualitative indicators and adequate preparation and training of officials in charge, as the Commissioner mentioned. The previous speakers referred to all these shortcomings and the opportunities lost for promoting equality and creating infrastructures which will have a direct and positive impact on women’s lives.</p>
<p class="contents">My point is that there is no public debate on this issue in the Member States; no debate about their obligations, about the need for evaluation and about the need for a policy change. It is very significant that this debate is being held at the same time as the mid-term review and we must continue and extend it to the Member States; we must help to broaden this debate, including in the new Member States and we must give them to understand that the Structural Funds and the new structural policy will give them an important tool with which to meet the challenges they face. We must also work with them to ensure that the new structural policy includes appropriate policies to plug the current gaps and an understanding and awareness of the need for the decisions made in the Member States to be put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore want to focus on the lessons we should learn from the Avilés Perea report, from what the Commissioner has said and also, I believe, from the Gröner report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I think it is important to say that these two initiative reports aim to be a tool and a stimulus for the subsequent steps that the Commission, Parliament and the Member States have to achieve, because they focus on the tools that we should have available both at the planning stage and at the stage of assessing the impact that the policies we issue have on the actual, real lives of our citizens, especially women.</p>
<p class="contents">From this perspective, I think there are some important, positive examples: the indicators defined in the European employment strategy and the impact assessment carried out by the Commission can be a splendid benchmark for doing the same thing in other policy areas too, for instance in the assessment of Structural Fund programmes, and I am pleased to have heard the Commissioner say this evening that these will be the points taken into consideration in the mid-term review.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary, therefore, to develop the tools of statistics, the presence of women in decision-making positions and committees, and impact assessment indicators. To these I believe another tool will be added, which we are developing as a guideline in the Committee on Women’s Rights: budget structure from a gender perspective. I think this will be an important package that we can work on together, in order to have some effect on the implementation of these policies at all levels – national, regional and local – in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, I think, provide greater information on the tools available, emphasise the positive things that have been done – even if we are not completely happy because there is still a lot to do – but we must not become dejected that we do not have any tools at our disposal: the tools are there, so let us try and use them! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tens of billions of euros from the Structural Funds are left over, half of which the national governments should have contributed. While there was an undertaking that 15% of the Structural Funds would be destined for women’s projects and equal opportunities, the end result is just 6%. Let us be honest however; we are talking here about 6% of the money spent and not 6% of the amount budgeted. In reality therefore it is just a fraction of the original amount. The Commission always takes refuge behind the fact that it does not know which of the proposed programmes are specifically for women and washes its hands of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Having regard to the great surplus we must therefore reverse the roles. If the Member States do not submit any programmes in which 15% goes to women’s programmes, we will unfortunately feel compelled to ask the Commission to reject these proposals. This must likewise apply in the wake of enlargement, because the need for Structural Funds in the new Member States can be expected to be so great that the gender dimension there will be subject to extremely harsh treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is no longer a true reflection, however, of the situation in the Member States. Even with the existence of a regulation dating back to 1999, which sets equality of opportunity as a key objective of actions under the Structural Funds, it is nevertheless true that, with the exception of the European Social Fund, this concept has still not been incorporated by the administrations, either of the fifteen countries of the Union or of the ten enlargement countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, however, an extremely important weapon in the Commission’s armoury for ensuring that positive actions to benefit women are implemented. At both the drafting stage in each country – as the Commissioner said – of projects to be funded by the Structural Funds, and at the stage of their being studied by the Commission, and even in the implementing report, the gender perspective must be integrated and evaluated. Greater participation by women in the teams that draw up and study projects to be funded and in drawing up indicators that enable effects and results in this field to be measured are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore support Mrs Avilés Perea’s report and hope that in the interim evaluation of the implementation of Funds earmarked for 2003 will show evidence of the results of the equality policy and that the programming for 2004-2006 is improved, with a view to achieving the following aim: the Structural Funds must be a powerful weapon for improving equal opportunities for women in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We ourselves present the biggest obstacle. It is because of our attitudes and approaches that we are still a very long way from a genuinely equal society. The lack of equality is of course due not only to our attitudes but also to the influence of the structures on which society is based.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now discussing one such structure, namely that formed by the European Social Fund and the Structural Funds. Cohesion policy, the European Social Fund and the Structural Funds are very important in terms of developing cooperation within the EU. It is only if everyone feels they are participating that it will be possible for European cooperation to be fully successful. What will of course be crucial to the work on equality in a number of areas is whether these tools promote increased equality or cement existing structures and attitudes.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality has been a priority objective of the Structural Funds since 1994. The fact that more has not happened in almost ten years is, of course, worthy of note. Progress has been made, but this is insufficient. Employment is of crucial importance to the work on equality. Work opportunities and the ability to be self-supporting will determine whether it will be possible to achieve an equal society. There is also a strong link with education. The work must therefore be designed to ensure that women derive as much benefit as men from what the Structural Funds have to offer. The equality perspective must be incorporated into all the work being done on programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that there should be bodies committed to equality at all levels of society and that these bodies should comprise as many women as men. It is possible to exert strong pressure upon the ways in which the Community funds in question are used. If the equality perspective is insufficiently clear or if the bodies that are to manage the funds do not have an equal representation of women and men, the applications should be declined. If it is possible for the Structural Funds to be characterised by this attitude, I am sure that matters will look different the next time we debate these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
