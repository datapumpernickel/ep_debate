<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maij-Weggen (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, when the Commission issued its communication on relations between Indonesia and the European Union a year ago, Indonesia seemed to be on the way to a true democracy under the Wahid government, which had newly taken office. A year on, the picture looks far less optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The road to democracy, to respect for human rights, to a sound administrative and legal system, to the eradication of corruption, seems to be a long road beset with obstacles. Here is a great deal of opposition to the Wahid government and the process appears to have come to a standstill. This opposition to the democratically elected government comes from various quarters, from military circles, from the supporters of the corrupt Suharto regime, from groups of fanatical Muslims, and from armed militia circles.</p>
<p class="contents">The President is also still under fire over the Bulog and Brunei affair. However, it is important that the Vice-President and the President of Parliament have declared their loyalty to the President. The problem the government is struggling with is seen most clearly in the regions that were used as migration destinations owing to over-population, and that were also misused as conquered land.</p>
<p class="contents">Worst of all is the situation in Irian Jaya and the Moluccas. It is incomprehensible, in this respect, that the Laskar Jihad was given the chance this spring to go to the Moluccas in their thousands, in order to stoke up the conflicts there again. This has left the Moluccas with thousands of dead and several hundred thousands of refugees. People are very afraid at present – and that includes the 50 000 Moluccan citizens in the Netherlands – that the situation will escalate further around Christmas. We have received reports to the effect that the Laskar Jihad is preparing to launch a new offensive, in West-Irian among other places, but also in small countries such as Gorom and Lusalaut. People are being killed because they are Christians. People are being locked up in churches and forced to convert to Islam. There are even reports that the Laskar Jihad has banned all Christian church bells from ringing at Christmas. What we are seeing is religious terror. As rapporteur I find that intolerable and I would therefore ask the Commissioner what the European Union can do with respect to the Wahid government in order to prevent further bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Irian Jaya. The violence is escalating there too. More people died this weekend. Last week, hundreds of students were picked up and four of them were returned to their parents as corpses. There are still some Papuan leaders under lock and key too.</p>
<p class="contents">We expressly wanted to respect the territorial integrity of Indonesia in our resolution, but surely that cannot mean the people of Irian Jaya having to renounce their own culture and identity? That sort of violence only stirs up feelings of hatred. I would like to lend my voice to the warning issued by the United States government to the effect that the violence must stop. The EU ought to take the same line.</p>
<p class="contents">Peace is very far from being restored in Timor and Aceh. In Timor, the militias block the return of the refugees and relief workers are besieged. And the murder of the Dutch journalist Thoenes has not been investigated yet. Three more relief workers died in Aceh last week and fifteen died at the beginning of December.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these regional problems are the worst in Indonesia at the moment. As such, the plans to give these regions more autonomy are to be welcomed, as are the undertakings to leave more revenue from raw materials to the regions. As far as the overall approach in Indonesia is concerned, things are in fact heading in the right direction. But it is precisely these problems in the regions that are still very much apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the role of the European Union be? Indonesia is one of the most important countries in the ASEAN area. It is important for the whole area for Indonesia to be a stable, democratic constitutional state with good relations within and outside ASEAN. The European Union must support the democratic and socio-economic developments, but not unquestioningly. We must attach conditions to our aid and support. We must see signs of progress in the democratisation process, the human rights situation must improve, the violators of human rights must be tried, corruption must be tackled and the power of the army must be further reduced. Should this fail to happen then aid will have to be suspended if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">There should also be far more coordination of aid at European level. The EU embassy in Jakarta could assume a coordinating role. We also ask the European Commission to follow this policy line in our resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with all due respect for the sovereignty of Indonesia, if violence erupts again in the Moluccas and on Irian Jaya around Christmas, then international action should not be ruled out in our view. I have in mind sending UN observers to the crisis areas, where action is urgently needed, but also humanitarian relief action if necessary. The murder really must stop. Certainly that committed by army units, militias and militant Muslims. Otherwise, what is the difference between the Wahid government and the old Suharto regime?</p>
<p class="contents">We are very concerned and expect the European Commission to respond to these developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Political stability and respect for human rights and the constitutional state are key to economic recovery following the Asia crisis. They are also pre-requisite to closer cooperation between the European Union and Indonesia.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I will restrict what I have to say to three points. We are concerned about the high degree of corruption and nepotism in the Indonesian economy. Too many members of former ruling families still wield power. This is a major obstacle to economic recovery and social stability in the region and therefore needs to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is essential for the private banking sector in Indonesia to be restructured. The agency for the restructuring of the Indonesian banks, the so-called Ibra, has so far been unable to allow the merchant banks to resume their loans service. What is more, the Ibra has considerable financial interests in various enterprises. It is even the sole shareholder in a few companies. These enterprises ought to be privatised. At the same time, this would create new opportunities for much-needed foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, economic relations with Indonesia are now based on the ASEAN agreement. So far, the ASEAN countries have made little progress as regards economic integration, even though the establishment of a free-trade zone between the members has been mooted for years now. My committee has therefore asked to conclude a bilateral cooperation agreement between the European Union and Indonesia. I will take this opportunity to ask Commissioner Patten to investigate this possibility, along with his colleague Mr Lamy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thus the terms of the Commission’s communication at the beginning of the year are justified, even if it is marked by a certain euphoria surely resulting from those changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal challenges facing Indonesia are, however, enormous and complex, as revealed by more recent events. There is the explosive situation in Irian Jaya, exacerbated by the use of repressive methods; there is also the difficult situation in Aceh and the Moluccas; in addition there is the dramatic situation experienced by refugees in the camps in West Timor – and the lack of measures that could change it – where the militias still act with impunity; and all this is tied up with the pressure from the former Suharto regime and the significant capacity for manoeuvring of military groups clearly identified with it and openly linked with integrationist and nationalist movements.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts can only concern us, and therefore the initial optimism that was so clear in the Commission’s communication should be reconsidered and tempered to some extent. There is no doubt that cooperation with Indonesia should be strengthened, and it should be directed into support for the authorities of this country in fields such as improvements in administration, the fight against fraud and corruption, the judicial system, environmental protection and improvements, or humanitarian aid for the displaced and refugees. But the level of this cooperation must take into account the effective progress the country may make in solving regional problems and the methods used for solving them, its respect for human rights, and also the country’s collaboration in the positive development of the Timor Lorosae independence process, particularly in solving the problems faced by the West Timor refugees and in prosecuting and sentencing militia members who have behaved criminally and only recently murdered three United Nations workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the report by our colleague, Mrs Maij-Weggen, who in fact knows the situation well, satisfactorily addresses these aspects and therefore deserves our full approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The democratisation process in Indonesia deserves due recognition and therefore support. One of the clearest expressions of this process, but also of the contradictions that make it so fragile, was what happened in East Timor. When the right to self-determination had been accepted, in the time between the popular vote and the recognition of the result, armed militias supported by Indonesian troops executed a detailed plan to destroy public infrastructure and thousands of homes, ruin crops and farming implements, and persecute the population, which, in terror, took refuge in the mountains and in West Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of a delegation from this Parliament, I was one of the international observers of the ballot and witnessed the Timorese people’s amazing thirst for freedom, but I also had the impression that as soon as we had gone nothing would be left standing. There are still contradictions like this in Indonesia, whether in the Moluccas, Aceh or Irian Jaya, and they are still manifest in East Timor too. The prosecution of those who committed crimes in East Timor and are now in Indonesian territory has yet to take place. It is unacceptable that they should escape justice because of a recently enacted law. More than one hundred thousand refugees remain in West Timor, virtual human shields for the originators and perpetrators of crimes in East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in these refugee camps earlier this year. In them are those who committed crimes and those who witnessed them. The justice which is not being done and the refugee camps which are becoming permanent are areas for confrontation between the old and the new powers in Indonesia and reveal the fragility of the democratisation process. Only this week, top UNTAET officials were at serious risk when they left the Indonesian parliament building in Jakarta after meeting the country’s president. We can support the democratisation process, as we have been doing; what we cannot do is take the place of the protagonists in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The revolution in the country and the way in which it took place, remain the basis for cautious optimism. But the excellent report by Mrs Maij-Weggen also underlines the fact that Indonesia’s problems have increased rather than decreased. The country is not unique in that respect. After all, these problems are characteristic of a country that is having to undergo a multifaceted transition. It must develop a new identity with a better balance between the centre and peripheral areas. On the economic front, the market must throw off the shackles of far-reaching state interference and attract new investment. The poverty issue is extremely pressing. A hybrid society must be turned into a transparent one. Corruption must be tackled. The EU could lend a hand there, by talking to European companies. Old structures must be dismantled so that Indonesia can at last get a grip on itself. Many current problems are down to a lack of democratic control, for example over those parts of the army that resist change and loss of privilege. In many places, violence prevails over dialogue. What gives most cause for concern is the situation in the Moluccas, where Jihad fighters are left to their own devices in a manner which is insupportable. The government in Jakarta should do far more to get a grip on the situation on the ground, and the EU must continue to bring the necessary pressure to bear, partly as an expression of the increased responsibility that the European Union must take for the region. If these efforts should fall short of the mark, then we cannot afford to rule out the possibility of the international community becoming more actively involved. When a country starts functioning as a constitutional state again, it must also settle old scores. This process is moving very slowly. The old structures resist the due process of justice. This is hardly surprising given that they have been accessories to crimes in many cases. We ask, and demand, that the culprits be tracked down and tried, be they the Suharto family or the murderers of the Dutch journalist Sander Thoenes. Relations between Indonesia and the EU can only improve further if we know that our allies really hold sway there, and that the constitutional state is functioning properly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Military influence may have been reduced but is still far too great. Corruption is still rampant. Ongoing violence on the Moluccas, in Aceh and in Irian Jaya is causing great suffering among the people. President Wahid and Vice-President Sukarnoputri have been unable to demonstrate a great deal of governmental power so far. It is very important for Europe to support the economic and democratic developments in Indonesia. But as Mrs Maij-Weggen has already said, this assistance comes at a price. It must benefit the poorest sections of the population. The violation of human rights must stop, the proceeds from corruption must be traced, and above all, wealth must be far better distributed. It is very difficult to hold this immense realm together. Fortunately, the time when a handful of Dutchmen were able to do so is now past. But poor administration, where the military are left to wreak havoc undisturbed, feeds the desire for independence. The origin of the conflict on the Moluccas mainly lies in Suharto’s ill-considered migration policy, which disturbed the population balance. The situation on these islands is still alarming. Only if an impartial army steps in will there be a chance of peace. The international community must bring maximum pressure to bear on Jakarta in order to put an end to the violence on the Moluccas. More humanitarian aid must be delivered. The same applies to ECHO, which, I might add, is doing a first-rate job out there.</p>
<p class="contents">Irian Jaya is also suffering the effects of migration policy. Here too the local people are frustrated by the immigration of Muslims and the hard line taken by the military. It is of paramount importance that those guilty of human rights violations are not allowed to get away with it. I concur with those of my colleagues who are demanding an immediate judicial inquiry into the murder of Sander Thoenes.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Maij-Weggen has written an outstanding report and I would therefore conclude that Europe must do all it can to support the country on its way to democracy, but at the end of the day, it is up to the Indonesians themselves to erase the traces of the Suharto regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, tomorrow, we shall have the presentation of the Sakharov Prize. A year ago, this prize was, in fact, conferred on President Xanana Gusmão. At that time, we honoured the efforts, the courage and the example of the Timorese people. In February this year, the Commission embarked on a new political initiative with regard to Indonesia, to which we also gave our approval here. In my view, I am sad to say, I think we were all a little hasty. I am sad to say this because I too would have liked things to have turned out well in Indonesia. I too would have liked to see the benefit of the doubt that we hastened to give reciprocated. But, unfortunately, this year has shown that it was not to be. As Mrs Maij-Weggen pointed out here in her introductory statement – which I emphatically support, together with the force of her report – the situation in Indonesia is deteriorating. We must learn from this lesson by sending Indonesia clearer and unambiguous signals, not contradictory ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe Indonesia is a great country, but it is at a crossroads, and it depends on the efforts of the international community and the European Union whether, at this crossroads, it will swing for good towards democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law, or whether the disorder will increase. To this end, we must learn to choose priorities: we cannot mix environmental issues, social policy issues or economic policy issues all at the same level as the key problem of respect for democracy and human rights, which clearly has to be a political priority in our relationship with Indonesia. I also say we must give a clear signal, because we cannot have a two-speed policy: sometimes we seem to criticise but then we seem to do nothing. We must learn from this year’s experience, which has been a beneficial experience, and give a very powerful signal indicating the change that we want for Indonesia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the rapporteur, Mrs Maij-Weggen, makes crystal-clear what the real political problems are in Indonesia. She is quite forthright in naming the opposing forces of the essential and exacting process of reform. She rightly refers to them in her report as still being very powerful. However, following the latest reports from the Indonesian archipelago, we are compelled to ask whether the situation does not in fact look more serious, more precarious still for President Wahid and his brothers-in-arms, than the report would suggest. Yesterday, an insider summed up the situation in the Indonesian archipelago with the following sentence: ‘the reformation is stagnating and the restoration minus the Suharto family promotes stagnation.’ Stagnation of the reformation in no way implies that the way to a democratic constitutional state – and I quote the rapporteur – ‘is truly leading nowhere’. Hence now is the time for the European Union to carefully support, as far as it is able, the democratic forces, which are neither numerous nor strong.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the historical burden that sits on the shoulders of two present-day Indonesian regions, the Moluccas and Irian Jaya, Indonesian and western understanding for this distressing historical millstone alone would relieve a great deal of political tension and suffering. This is most definitely a task for the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that winged its way to me from Indonesia offers a ray of hope. Despite these uncertain times, a growing number of people within the Christian churches out there are calling for people to do some soul-searching. They want people to stop working to secure the interests of their own groups and show sympathy towards their fellow human beings, including Muslims, out of the love of Christ, which offers hope of reconciliation to the entire, and sometimes sorely afflicted, archipelago. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know she has great experience of Indonesia and, in particular, the Indonesian Moluccan community living in Holland. The position we have to take regarding the territorial integrity of Indonesia is simple: we have to abide by international law and by the United Nations Resolution 2504 of December 1969. That resolution categorically affirms that Irian Jaya is part of Indonesia. It is something that all our countries have agreed to, have signed up to, and have a responsibility to support. It was a recognition by the global community of the legality of the vote in Irian Jaya to become a permanent part of Indonesia and reaffirm United Nations Declaration 1514 of 1960 which prohibits any act aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of a country.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Irian Jaya is totally different, legally and constitutionally, from the situation that pertained to East Timor. Parliament should not confuse the two. Irian Jaya is an integral part of Indonesia historically. East Timor never was. The rule of law must therefore prevail. Yes, of course we must ensure that Indonesia maintains its progress in the prosecution of those members of the security forces accused of human rights violations. In this case we must wield the carrot and the stick. Any outside intervention other than support for democratisation and the rule of law can only be seen as counterproductive and inflammatory to all parties. There will be no winners if we take an imperial stance on this issue. I use that word advisedly.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can do in the European Parliament and the EU is to ask the new democratic Indonesian Government not to over-react. Over-reaction will play into the hands of the separatists, turning terrorists into martyrs and heroes. The other activity we can undertake immediately is to give massive support to good governance projects in Indonesia: support in terms of manpower, money, NGO activity, setting standards and criteria so that the devolved administrative arrangement now agreed by President Wahid can be underpinned by creating lasting democratic and civil society institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to help Indonesia we must act now with money and deeds, not merely words. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it is essential, when stating the route to cooperation with Indonesia, to be vigilant about the application of values and the establishment of the rule of law. This Commission proposal has come at a crucial moment, since Indonesia is at a crossroads in a serious economic crisis, and our help in encouraging the establishment of the rule of law and in encouraging support for those interested in setting up a democracy and making Indonesia a strong country but one that respects human dignity, is fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, I should like to make two proposals and one request to the Commission. The first proposal is that Parliament sends a delegation specifically to visit the refugee camps, not only in West Timor but everywhere, because according to the Maij-Weggen report there are about a million refugees. It is important that we should not confine ourselves to approving the report but that we should follow it up. Secondly, it is important that the Indonesian authorities allow non-governmental organisations free passage to get medical and humanitarian aid to the inhabitants of Indonesia and to the Timorese who are in a situation of such human misery that these organisations should not be denied access. It is absolutely essential that humanitarian principles are adhered to and respected. Lastly, I should like to ask the Commission, through Mr Patten, to be vigilant in enforcing these principles, because, although I support the idea that the European Union should encourage cooperation with Indonesia, this should not be at any cost, and I therefore call for detailed monitoring of the allocation of this aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation has improved and we must encourage President Wahid, but there are still horrendous problems. The government is weak and constantly under attack, the military resists civilian control, the economy is fragile and, above all else, human rights are poor. That is why we must link development aid to progress in human rights abuses.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure, also, that the murderers of the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> journalist, Sander Thoenes, are brought to justice; and the murderers of the three humanitarian aid workers and one torture victim killed only last week by Indonesian security forces in Aceh are brought to justice, also the perpetrators of past crimes.

It is a very comprehensive report and particularly useful in updating us on developments since the adoption of the Commission's communication last February.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then time has certainly not stood still in Indonesia. I sometimes reflect on what a great American friend of mine, who was once ambassador in Indonesia, said: he thought that of all the most important countries in the world Indonesia was one about which we knew all too little. I think the report is extremely valuable in shedding light on what has been happening. So I am grateful to her and the committee for the motion for a resolution. In particular I am pleased that the points made generally seem to be supportive of the action of the European Union and in particular of the action of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The key message of the Commission's communication was the need to recognise that Indonesia was undergoing a difficult period of transition in which the forces of reform needed our support. That support is to be provided through an enhanced political and economic dialogue, as well as enhanced targeted development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication was written in a positive spirit, reflecting the new dawn in our relationship. It is fair to say – I suspect in the presence of the Indonesian Ambassador – that Indonesia recognised and welcomed that.</p>
<p class="contents">Almost a year later it is useful to consider whether our proposals and analysis are still valid, given recent political developments in Indonesia. In particular this last year has seen growing and worrying unrest, instability and human rights abuses in the regions and, in particular, in Aceh, Irian Jaya and the Moluccas, where the Commission recently adopted a decision for a further EUR 2m from ECHO to help the displaced persons in both provinces.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is far from stable in all three areas. Only this weekend, as a number of honourable Members have reminded us, three local employees of a Danish non-governmental organisation were murdered in Aceh. I strongly condemn these murders. They are a reminder of the extremely dangerous conditions faced by all aid workers in many parts of Indonesia. I want to pay tribute to their bravery and dedication. I know that the House would want to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council have reconfirmed their support for the territorial integrity of Indonesia. I am glad that Parliament is doing likewise. However, at the same time we have also underlined the Indonesian Government's responsibility to maintain law and order and to protect human rights in its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a challenging task for the democratic government of President Wahid, not least to combat what he has called the dark forces of the past that are trying to play out a national struggle for power on distant battlefields. It is essential that he rises to that challenge. At the same time he needs to meet the genuine aspirations at local and regional level for a fair share in economic growth and greater autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">A special case is the still unresolved question of West Timor. Clearly it is unacceptable that tens of thousands of East Timorese refugees are still held hostage at the mercy of armed bandits who, in the name of Indonesian patriotism, try to get away without punishment for their criminal past. The government of Indonesia has undertaken some steps, but much more needs to be done and much faster. I listened with interest to the proposal made by the honourable Member towards the end of our discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The extraordinary transition of Indonesia is far from over: democracy is still young and very fragile. Only two years ago Indonesia was still ruled by a military-backed authoritarian leader. The massive economic collapse in the wake of the 1997 Asian financial crisis has aggravated social tensions and ethnic conflict. It is clear that Indonesia's difficulties will not be solved overnight. The key challenges are still those which we identified in the communication. First, the consolidation of the rule of law, including civilian supremacy over the military and the combating of corruption; second, the implementation of regional autonomy in a way that reduces the incentives for separatism; and, third, economic restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does the future hold for our relations with Indonesia? Above all we must continue to express our support for the necessary but fragile democratisation and reforms and we must ensure, as we did throughout the crisis, that our markets remain open.</p>
<p class="contents">An honourable lady earlier in the debate referred to our relationship with Indonesia as part of our relationship with ASEAN. I must say that what is noticeable in our relationship with Indonesia is the extent to which that country has profited from our generalised system of preferences. It was the fourth greatest beneficiary in 1998. While EU exports dropped in 1997 and 1998 and have only stabilised since, European Union imports from Indonesia have surged significantly providing Indonesia with a trade surplus which has cushioned them against the crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">How should we engage Indonesia in the coming years? The main mechanisms for doing so have been outlined in the communication: more and more open dialogue both political and economic. The senior-official meetings launched this year will continue with our second consultative forum in early 2001. We also want to see enhanced contacts with the forces of reform and the reorientation of our development cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">On this last point I am pleased to inform Parliament that the Commission has launched a new programme under the title of "good governance" which tries to help overcome structural weaknesses in the management of public affairs. Furthermore a country strategy paper, outlining our long-term development strategy, will be discussed with our Indonesian partners in 2001. Like Parliament, the Commission has also identified corruption as a continuing problem. The support we are currently giving to the office of the attorney-general in Jakarta is intended to help him in his attempts to combat corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word: I believe that there is reason for cautious optimism as regards our long-term relationship with Indonesia, but we – that is the European Union with all our institutions – need to keep up our support. Indonesia matters hugely to us. It matters because of its size – the world's fourth largest country in terms of population; it matters because of its economic scale; it matters because of its regional role; it matters because of its environmental impact.</p>
<p class="contents">In between a previous colonial occupation and taking this post with the European Commission, I wrote a book and made some television programmes about Asia and I remember visiting Indonesia shortly after the riots there in 1998 and interviewing the then President Habibie. I remember having the distinct feeling that this great country was poised somewhere on the high wire between riot and reform and that we would be very lucky if the democratic process produced a government such as the one that has been produced today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our task to help that government across the wire to the other side of the chasm. If it does not make that journey successfully, the consequences for all of us, the consequences in particular for the region and the consequences for Indonesia, would be dire: either the largest Islamic democracy in the world and one of the most successful democracies in Asia, or very considerable problems for the whole region. It is important that Parliament continues to show an interest. It is important that Parliament continues to press the European Union as whole to give a helping hand to Indonesia, but it is particularly important that the government of Indonesia – the president and his followers – take the brave but essential decisions that are required to ensure that Indonesia can go forward respecting civil liberties, guaranteeing and consolidating democracy and giving the people of Indonesia a prosperous and stable future.</p>
