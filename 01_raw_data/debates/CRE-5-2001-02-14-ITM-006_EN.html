I would like to make two points. When we talk about the special things Europe is doing and why hopefully in the future we may be a model for the world, we must be able to support our facts with figures. How do we measure this success? We have very traditional instruments: GDP or the unemployment rate which, according to research carried out by the Munich-based institute, the IFO, has fallen from 8.1% to 7.6%. We also have the external value of the euro. But there are many other indicators we have hitherto not taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I would particularly like to express my support for paragraphs 24 to 29 of this report, which redefine quality of life and quality of employment. That would help our debate a great deal. What has also been lacking hitherto is introduced by Amendments No 13 and 17, namely the environmental aspect, which also seems to be a special concern of the Swedish Presidency. It is an area where there is still much to be done. To Mr Friedrich, who spoke of the danger of knowing too much, I would say that we are rather in danger of knowing too little.</p>
<p class="contents">This particularly concerns Parliament, which brings me to my second point: access to information in the follow-up to the post-Lisbon debate. It is undignified for preparatory documents on Summit meetings to be slipped surreptitiously into Parliament, and often not before they have first been made available to the press. There is nothing unifying in this; it is simply divisive. With the partitioning off that is being practised, especially when Parliament is involved, the Council is doing itself a disservice. It is simply promoting the delegitimisation of holders of political office. Why are we in Parliament no longer trusted? Let the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, or the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, or the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy in. Give one of the chairmen of our committees, Christa Randzio-Plath for instance, the chance, give Parliament the chance, to work with you on equal terms. What are you afraid of? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This not only raises a problem of cohesion – since it is not just a matter of compensating the less favoured areas – but also the problem of how to manage European development in the future, so as to promote the spread of development, and hence of employment, from the most favoured to the least favoured zones.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I call upon the Commission to combine its economic perspectives with identification of the territorial benefits to be had from the plan for European area development. I urge the Commission and the Union to pursue this ‘good’ full employment we want for Europe – ‘good’ in the sense of being capable of respecting environmental and social obligations – applying the method used up to now to drive forward the formation of the single market, with enlargement regarded as a valid part of this approach. Enlargement should not be seen just as a supplementary cost for the Union but as an opportunity to create wider market opportunities, where the method pursued so far can be developed, both by progressively liberalising the old markets – and I strongly welcome the invitation, which I believe we should extend to ourselves and to Parliament, to adopt new directives on procurement quickly, for example, and open up a huge market currently closed to European competition – and by preventing the new markets from creating a new monopoly situation as may happen in the case of telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">For this purpose – both to liberalise the old markets and to prevent monopoly situations being created in the new markets – information can be very important and a bold strategy, helping the citizens participate in the process, can certainly be useful here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was already addressed by some Members of the Green Group this morning. What should be done in the Stockholm meeting is that the governments' presence there should give the Commission a mandate to take the results of the Gothenburg Summit and to prepare benchmarking and concrete targets for the 2002 spring meeting during the Spanish presidency. Only if sustainable development becomes as important in benchmarking as economic and social values can we advance.</p>
<p class="contents">I will take the opportunity to address the liberalisation aspect where there has not been a lot of reflection hitherto in Europe. We need a new merger control and a new competition policy. We have abolished monopolies, but we will have the same operators appearing as oligopolies in Europe if we are not prepared to have a different merger control and competition policy. We need the biodiversity of a lot of small and medium-sized actors and not a monoculture of eight or ten major electricity companies which will employ blackmail on policy-makers as they did before in the monopolistic structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In its report, the Commission now highlights what it considers to be ‘good results’ achieved with regard to the liberalisation of the telecommunications networks, the creation of a legislative framework for electronic commerce and the definition of the European Company Statute. At the same time, the Commission regrets what it considers to be delays in the regulation of public contracts and the liberalisation of the markets in gas, electricity, transport and postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the Commission is insisting on the need to move ahead even more rapidly with the total liberalisation of the most varied sectors, including public services, and on more rapid progress in the capitals market, including the regulation of financial services. The Commission’s aim is to boost pension funds and other types of funds, but this will lead to greater attacks on social security and other essential public services, specifically in the areas of health, education and communications.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, in the social sphere, despite the statements of intent, fundamental decisions on protecting workers’ rights are being delayed, as happened here only yesterday when we discussed industrial restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, statements are being made once again about the need to create a more flexible labour market, which is more mobile and able to adapt. I understand this to mean more precarious employment, with fewer workers’ rights, although it is acknowledged that unemployment is still too high and that poverty and social exclusion are unacceptable at the beginning of the new millennium. These policies therefore need to be amended, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen. What is required is not to touch them up to make them look better in one way or another but to make far-reaching change to the policy in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(SV) </span>I believe it is a mistake for us to draw up long, extensive and contradictory documents such as the llmann report, which risk not being taken seriously. I also believe it to be a mistake to allow issues of work, growth and competitiveness to be reduced to statistical number crunching. It is clear that we need indicators in order to make assessments and comparisons, but to use them to excess in this way just makes one think ‘Gosplan’.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, absent Representative of the Council and Commissioners, one does not need to be a politician to see the way powerlessness is spreading and divisions are widening in society. We have major groups of poor, working people and we have a terrible proportion of long-term unemployed, benefit-dependent and marginalised individuals and families in Europe. At the same time the EU still has difficulty matching the US with regard to job creation, research and development and population growth. I believe the hunt for new indicators and more figures on employment simply delays the necessary renewal and liberalisation of European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon process requires a move from words to action. One of 10 years will soon have passed. Therefore, I am asking today for concrete targets from the presidency ahead of the European Council in Stockholm. It is no longer a matter of directions and timetables such as we heard about this morning. What decisions will you produce in the next six months to achieve increased competitiveness in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Swedes have an excellent opportunity to show some leadership. Rather sceptical though it has been, the Social Democratic government has, for all that, continued with the successful liberalisation programme set out by the right of centre government at the beginning of the 1990s. Thanks to a forward-looking policy which included opening up markets, Swedish industry in both the old and the new economies shows significant success. With this in mind, the presidency could establish a modern agenda to enable the EU to live up to its proud aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the Council and the Commission have today addressed demographic development in the EU. In this regard, I wonder when the Commission will be taking initiatives to stimulate increased labour immigration to EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, I listened to State Secretary Ekström, who is responsible for the European Council in Stockholm. She introduced important elements into the discussion on growth, including the significance of trade. This is excellent, as it is vital for both growth and solidarity. Therefore, I wonder if the Commission and the Council can report on how work on increased trade and reduced tariffs can progress under the Swedish Presidency. In this context, it would be interesting to hear whether the Council is still of the opinion that the question of the Tobin Tax is a national debate which has no place in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication, the Commission takes up the need for simplification of regulations in the EU. Bearing in mind the vote we had today on the awful Miller report and the old Bus and Coach Directive, I hope this was the last time we need concern ourselves with such issues. It is fine to write that simplification of regulations is desired, but the Commission must also show that it is able to act on this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that economic growth is naturally linked to employment and social security. A good economy is a prerequisite for welfare. However it is not politicians and more statistics which create social security, but it is only with the help of a good economy and successful companies that the EU can create cohesion and social security in a new age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Enlargement will mean a large increase in population and geographical area, but also a dangerous increase in regional disparities. Statistics are misleading, and a region that now has a per capita income of 70% of the Community average will not have improved its situation when after enlargement this percentage rises by 10 or 15 points.</p>
<p class="contents">Income is one element defining regional development, but it must not be the only one. For the new programming period we must have new indicators that reflect the growing complexity of our societies and our regions’ economies: the unemployment rate, especially one referring to young women and the long-term unemployed; a region’s dependence on sectors in crisis, such as steel-making or fisheries; a low level of worker qualification; a lack of occupational training or education; limited economic diversification; the demographic situation; poor penetration of new technologies; or poor integration of women in society in the least developed regions, which is a reason for their backwardness.</p>
<p class="contents">Cohesion must not be restricted to the Structural Funds. All Union policies have to respond to this aim, helping improve competitiveness in the most backward regions and helping create more jobs and more skilled ones.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union will have to act in those areas where a stimulus that does not entail a large outlay is needed. A stimulus that leads to regeneration and an increase in competitiveness and productivity. The Commission should have a greater capacity to intervene and an overall view, and Community initiatives should be better-funded, in my opinion, in the next period. Similarly, again in my own opinion, we should rethink how many of them there should be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Universal service must be defined in relation to the new technological environment. Current developments, particularly in information and communication technology, tending towards digital technology, have an irrevocable catalysing force. It is up to the authorities to meet the challenge by enabling every citizen, whatever their situation, to benefit on a fair basis according to their needs from an identical quality of service. That is where the advantage of a universal service lies.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, technological developments make it possible to view universal service in an offensive and proactive manner rather than in a defensive backward-looking fashion, as a limited set of often mediocre public services, which people carefully avoid using, unless really driven to it.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the prospects offered in the medium term by the generalised use within Europe of new ‘smart card’ type identity papers lead to a redefinition and readjustment of universal service, polarised on two vectors of change: a service level agreement and a rich content. We should like to see the real possibility of developing in this direction so that this universal service may contribute to balanced realisation of what was set as a strategic objective at the extraordinary European Council meeting in Lisbon in March 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not because we do not share general ideas on the broad economic policy guidelines but because here, under the pretext of liberalisation, it is trying to lead us along paths which, instead of increasing the well-being of our societies, will only deepen the social inequalities in our supposedly more advanced societies.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report under discussion there are enough generic references to the United States model and phrases that have become the canon of right-wing economics that they cannot be accepted uncritically by those of us who try to keep a balance between broad economic objectives and building fairer societies.</p>
<p class="contents">This progressive attitude cannot be reconciled with statements made in this report. Not only the ones I have just mentioned, but also others such as the statement on labour market reform, where it says, and I quote: “it is high time for labour market reforms that promote mobility and make it worthwhile for the unemployed to take up job offers”. This – and I say this with all due respect for Mr Gasòliba i Böhm – is treating the unemployed as if they were so many parasites.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to achieving a balance between economic objectives, competitiveness and cohesion and social justice is not in this supposed liberalisation but in designing and putting into practice policies that make our economic systems more effective, extracting from other economies – copying if necessary – things that can enable us to move forward in both directions.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want models like that of the United States, which will lead us to greater imbalances and social injustices or resounding disasters, such as the liberalisation of the electricity sector in California. While you are at it, why not copy the American Treasury’s policies and abandon the European Central Bank performance model, which has caused us so much harm in the past?</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur mentioned in passing this morning that there were European countries with models of interest. Of course there are. But why is this not highlighted? Because it is of no interest, or rather, it is of no interest to those who speak of liberalisation at all costs without thinking about the consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, it is not justified, in my opinion, to hold this discussion here at Parliament’s instigation whilst there was no document from the Commission available at the time to back it up. If a summit on socio-economic problems is arranged in Stockholm and if this is done year after year, as was decided in Lisbon, then I expect each time – and I hope that the Swedish Presidency will take a decision in this respect – to see a framework document from the Commission which can be debated beforehand in Parliament. We have now done just that, but on our own initiative. Accordingly, the report that is before us is calling for an interinstitutional agreement to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns social protection. I would like to echo the view of a number of our fellow MEPs, namely that the topic of social protection is new. It has taken ten years finally to grant the topic political status. This has now been done. But this is, of course, a very apprehensive start. If we begin by prescribing indicators, then this is a good start, but it cannot, of course, be the final step. The final step should be a process similar to that which we have followed for employment. Indeed, we should end up drafting guidelines. I hope that Stockholm too will take matters one step further.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point pertains to employment. It is true that the number of unemployed across Europe is still high, and I am always surprised when it is suggested that we should most definitely encourage the influx of immigrants. Some say that they should fill the jobs which require the highest qualifications, whilst others believe they should fill those functions which require the lowest qualifications. First and foremost, our own unemployed should be trained, and the lowest qualified functions should be reassessed in such a way as to ensure that our own people at least accept this work in the first place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They highlight some of the qualitative goals which ought to be turned into binding decisions at the Spring European Council. Amongst these I would like to stress the importance of certain initiatives relating to sectors central to the Lisbon and Feira Council guidelines, but where progress is still much too slow, as President Prodi recognised in his speech yesterday. The most important is coordination of research and development policies. While the European Commission has set up some highly significant European initiatives and projects in this area, there is still a lack of effective coordination of national programmes and public and private projects developed by each country. This leads to a situation where meagre national financial resources are often spent on duplication or wasted investment, and where there is a failure to adopt certain shared priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission whether or not it intends to give effective impetus to the implementation of the open method of coordination, adopted by the Lisbon Council. It can work if the Commission uses its knowledge of existing national programmes and projects to become the promoter and monitor of open methods of cooperation between certain Member States on specific priorities, thus testing national governments’ willingness to cooperate and converge to build a European Research Area.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the introduction in the Union – also based on some experiments in open coordination – of a system of lifelong learning and training. We are right to call, in Mr Bullmann’s report too, for a combination of flexibility, mobility and security in employment policy, to prevent the emergence of insecurity and marginalisation of both young people and women and older workers as well. Now, I do not know of any kind of security that can operate in a labour market characterised by flexibility and mobility, apart from the security that comes from employability, a process of lifelong learning and training guarantees. Setting up a system like that to benefit as many working men and women as possible will overcome the resistance developing in various sectors, because the temporary nature of jobs – and that is a very real factor in our labour market – deters companies from investing in human resources.</p>
<p class="contents">All this means mobilising major resources and great individual determination, which can only happen if effective cooperation is established between the European Union and the national States, on the one hand, and between businesses and workers, on the other. That is also a way to create the necessary conditions for the Spring Council to be a significant event …</p>

<p class="contents">I would first of all like to congratulate Mr Gasòliba i Böhm on his sterling report. He has succeeded in listing our ambitions one by one in a readily understood manner. It is our wish to become the world’s most competitive and most dynamic knowledge-based economy, according to our leaders in Lisbon. Upon which they went home, and everything carried on as before.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still having to put up with stifling bureaucracy. Attempts to liberalise and introduce simpler rules for small and medium-sized businesses never come to anything on account of short-sighted national interests. I sometimes dream about this, but I always wake up screaming. In order to streamline legislation, we should not only scrutinise our activities here, but also examine how a directive emerges from the national transposition processes. A simple and clear-cut customs act suddenly appears to be backed by legislation which fills three thick volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am of the opinion that the <span class="italic">fiche d'impact</span> should be given the kiss of life. It should not amount to pure guesswork but to an actual business test. A test of how a certain piece of legislation will be received in industry. The problem Europe has – and I trust I can be so outspoken after eleven years in this Parliament – is that I am always duly impressed with the rhetoric, but never by the action that follows.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to quote the liberalisation of the postal services as a case in point. Not only Parliament, but also the Council, which had explicitly welcomed the liberalisation in Lisbon with open arms, have taken a step back rather than forward. If we compare this situation in Europe with that in the United States, we are still in complete deadlock in certain areas. It is not yet the case – not by a long chalk – that Europe can lead the world economy now that US leadership has temporarily lapsed.</p>

Its success is, of course, the single currency; its failure is that we have still been unable to mop up unemployment and achieve full employment. What we wonder is why, despite our success with the one, we cannot achieve the same degree of success with the other. In this sense, I should like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mr Bullmann, both on the professionalism of his work and on his enthusiasm for the resolutions of the European Council in Lisbon, which try to build a bridge from our success in the monetary sector towards similar success in the real sector, the real economy.</p>
<p class="contents">If you define Europe not by its political borders but by its economic borders; in other words, if you include eastern Europe, Russia and North Africa, then you will see that we have the largest market in the world, with the highest per capita income and the largest concentration of educated workers. Not even in Latin America or Asia or the whole of America do these three factors exist side by side. On this basis, we can work miracles, and from this point of view, the Lisbon objectives are commensurate with our abilities. The problem is: are our policies for implementing the objectives equally commensurate?</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that, when it comes to implementation, we are overly impressed by the huge success of the process of nominal convergence. However, I am not convinced that we are making proper use of our experience in the real economy. Mutual monitoring, the famous peer pressure which we now want to transfer to the real economy, was not the only factor. We must not forget the other factors, i.e. the simple, purely quantitatively defined objective of reducing inflation. We must not forget that, in the case of the euro, there was a clear time limit: either you boarded the train, or the train left without you. We must not forget that the aim of squeezing inflation took absolute priority and, in my personal estimate, even worked to the detriment of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">If we really want to transfer this method to the real economy, we should apply the wisdom of one quantitative target and one simple tool. You do not need a great deal of wisdom in order to determine what they are. The target is full employment and the method is to increase the quantity and quality of investments. This combination has the additional advantage of indirectly resolving – <span class="italic">en passant</span>, as they say in chess – the second major objective of technological progress. We should have had the courage to give these targets the same absolute priority as we gave legal stability. I am not sure if we have the courage to do so now. We have, of course, made some progress by quantifying the indicators, but typically here too, there are no detailed, analytical indicators; the Commission has not proposed analytical indicators, Commissioner, on investments, public, private, infrastructure, on so many things we should like to promote. And the rapporteur's ambitious efforts notwithstanding, I should like to point out that increasing the number of quantitative indicators does not lead us into dead-end street, because we may find ourselves in a position where, to quote the Bible, someone one day says to the Commission: Μartha, Μartha, thou art careful, and troubled about many things·</p>

<p class="contents">At present, United States statistics represent a target for us to achieve, in terms of both employment and, to some extent, development and economic growth, taking into account, of course, our totally different society and community, something that should not be forgotten. I too believe that the goals of full employment, respect for a social market economy and rapid progress towards liberalisation in many sectors are objectives we can and must set ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also think account needs to be taken of two things in Europe: the first is that the situations are completely different, and we are trying to solve problems that have already been solved there, and comparing different situations by applying the same rules does not seem to be …</p>

<p class="contents">I consider the reports before us today to be good ones insofar as they seek to consolidate growth in Europe. They are based on the idea that such growth must be supported by structural reform. We share this point of view, on condition that such structural reform is appropriate to one objective which is also our chief objective, as our committee chair, Mrs Randzio-Plath, stated: social reform must also lead to greater social integration. No economic policy without this objective is possible. We hope that Stockholm, too, will provide an opportunity to reaffirm that the strategy of full employment is now perhaps one that is feasible in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, we find that Mr Gasòliba i Böhm’s report occasionally expresses a rather liberal approach. Liberalisation is not tolerable unless it is progressive, unless it goes hand in hand with a regulatory process. Nor can it be carried out safely without supporting the European Union’s objectives in terms of social and territorial cohesion. From this point of view, we should like to see considerable progress in drawing up a framework directive on general interest services.</p>
<p class="contents">We would urge those that advocate excessive liberalisation and a fast track timetable for liberalising the electricity and gas sector to be very careful with regard to the postal and rail sectors, for these form the basis of social and territorial cohesion in our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But, with all due respect to you, Mr President-in-Office, in view of the fact that Sweden constantly promotes equal opportunities, I would have liked Secretary of State Ekström to be here.

<p class="contents">On the Bullmann report: The Lisbon Council resolved to turn the EU into the world’s most competitive area by the year 2010. Was that just an idle boast? Yet, with four million new jobs in four years, mostly highly qualified and ICT jobs, the signs are good. A new dynamic with more flexible labour markets has emerged, but not everybody is keeping pace. There are big difference between the regions, with high levels of employment and room for manoeuvre for enterprises in some regions but, in others, increasing unemployment causing people to leave their homes on economic grounds. But we want economic and social cohesion in the Community and active labour market policies, which are reflected in the four pillars of the Luxembourg process. The priority is clear: the promotion of innovative SMEs. We have what it takes to shape the future and create jobs, but we need to dismantle bureaucratic, legal and tax obstacles and facilitate access to risk capital. By implementing the directives in the NAPS, the employment rate within the EU can be raised to 70%. Quantum leaps need to be made in education and training. Priority should be given to the upward revaluation of vocational training, the implementation of a concept of life-long learning, better framework conditions for cross-border activities, the promotion of mobility through joint training programmes for young people and pan-European recognition of qualifications. The Hughes procedure brought together the findings of the Bullmann report in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Cocilovo report in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. Although the details may be assessed somewhat differently, this final report merits our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These principles for Europe’s aim to be a word leader in terms of economic development and growth are necessary in parallel with the development of an ambitious social dimension; this is the whole point. This balance is crucial not only to our success in implementing our strategies but also to the EU achieving increased public support and understanding, especially prior to expansion.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand we have right-wing liberals maintaining that the EU is only necessary for deregulating and opening the markets, creating free trade, etc, while the battle against unemployment and the development of social welfare are exclusively national issues. This implies that some would like to be able to undermine the influence of labour law and the employee and tear up welfare policy, etc without the EU’s interfering. On the other hand, certain GUE politicians are now entering this current debate and attacking the Bullmann report for focusing too much on deregulation and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore pleased that we have still established widespread agreement, excluding the outer fringes to the right and to the left, among those who realise that development of a social dimension is actually a crucial element of a successful economic policy. However, this does not necessarily mean that the EU should take over the Member States’ powers to legislate, although the open coordination method naturally does not exclude legislating. The most important thing is that we develop common aims. These must address both deregulation and liberalisation to a certain extent, as well as common aims for dealing with the problems of unemployment and social exclusion. Few have taken up this aspect. But do not forget how vital this is to expansion, as the content of the Bullmann report will then be even more crucial. The new Member States have an extra need for parallel development within the areas of growth, welfare, social rights and influence for ordinary citizens and employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I approve Mr Bullmann’s report, which was based on the employment guidelines first formulated in 1997 at the Employment Conference in Luxembourg. I congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work. He is correct when he says that, in the future, more qualitative indicators need to be established which, for instance, take account of the variety of jobs and the minimum consultation rights of workers in their organisation, or environmentally-friendly technologies. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is right to call for this method of combating youth unemployment. The draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Cocilovo, expressed this excellently. Economic realism is necessary in all the targets we set ourselves within the framework of employment policy. As the European People’s Party, we will not be pursuing any pipe dreams. The transformation of our society into a service and knowledge-based society is making great strides forward. That is why all our demands are targeted at life-long learning and at restructuring the education systems along the right lines.</p>
<p class="contents">We often raise our employment plans in official addresses; they feature in many papers, in European directives, in national action plans, where they are wonderfully expressed. But paper is patient. What matters now is that these plans are put into practice. As its contribution to achieving the goal of implementing the proposals that have been made, the European People’s Party will assess the Spring Summit. We do not need a literature Summit. I am convinced that Stockholm will not be a literature Summit, as action, not proclamations, is now called for! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to thank the rapporteurs and the many speakers for their contributions to the debate. I shall try to make a few comments. The debate has been full of ideas and very varied, and a number of aspects have been aired.</p>
<p class="contents">First, I should stress a point that I think is fundamental, which is that Lisbon has not, of course, changed its goals, i.e., full employment and the modernisation of our society, not forgetting respect for our social system and strong cohesion. When we analyse the employment figures, it is quite clear what results have been achieved. We can mention public investment, as some of you have done. But for us the important thing is the global strategy. When we analyse the global strategy – and this is the content of the synthesis report – the emphasis is on the need to make progress in the various areas simultaneously in order to achieve the goals we set in Lisbon. For instance, the broad economic policy guidelines for 2000 are already making substantial changes to their historical structure in order to include in the various policies those measures arising out of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, Lisbon is based on the idea, which all or most of you have highlighted, of a society with a dynamic and cohesive economy as I have just mentioned. This means advances in innovation, education, training, liberalisation, and also adequate regulation, and of course the whole system of social protection. Neither these instruments nor these policies can exist by themselves; they are all linked together. It is not a matter of balance between the various policies: it is more a synergy between different policies, which in the end should enable us to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p class="contents">If we analyse the report, it is clearly demonstrated that we have advanced since then. I do not think we should be as negative as some of you have been, saying, “Nothing has been done.” I think a lot has been done, in terms of liberalisation or in terms of economic results. It is also true that not many other things have been done, and therefore in our report we define certain priorities that we consider fundamental for the immediate future.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point I think is of interest, which was raised throughout the debate, especially in the first part this morning. It is the role of indicators with regard to the goals we are seeking. It is true that indicators should not be seen as some kind of inventory, of position-taking on specific policies. It is true that indicators are not goals in themselves, but are tools that should enable us to make progress and interpret reality more globally and accurately. Contrary to what some of you have said, it is important to have indicators what in themselves tell us the reality of our situation. There is no doubt at all that comparison with other models is useful. What doubt is there that comparing certain rates of technological penetration in the European Union and the United States, for instance, will give us a measure of where we are with regard to the most advanced country in these matters? Making a partial comparison – only on certain things and not on the whole model – between the two economies may give rise to interpretations that are not always correct. In any case, when we are talking of comparative indicators there is always a difficulty, which is that we often do not have sufficiently homogeneous indicators for the realities we are comparing to be revealed through these figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the morning you also debated whether the number of indicators was excessive. It is true that cutting the number of indicators would make the report more visible; in terms of public opinion it would make it possible to send out clearer and more direct messages. But it is also true that a smaller number of indicators would make it much more difficult to interpret the reality we are trying to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that having 28 indicators classified under the four basic Lisbon goals is the least number required to provide a good understanding of where we are at this moment. As I said earlier, however, we designed the indicators as a working tool. This does not necessarily have to be a permanent tool, since real life and a better understanding of it will make us revise the indicators continuously, possibly changing some of them during this process which we began in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">A subject I think is of interest, which some of you have raised, is to what extent we can achieve greater participation by Parliament in all this debate through an institutional agreement. I believe that right now we already have enough instruments, at least for relations between the Commission and Parliament, to be able to make progress in our joint work. In any case, the institutional agreement should also include the Council. I should like to stress one point: participation by both Parliament and public opinion in the debate on Europe is always open. The Commission has taken the initiative, for instance, with the economic interviews held once a year, the basic aim of which is to analyse the European economic situation specifically in this global world and in comparison with the context in those countries that serve as a reference for our situation. This subject is always open to Parliament, and naturally we hope you will cooperate this year as you have in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I also find of interest is the scope of the synthesis report. I have seen at least two references that seem to be of interest: Why do we not speak of sustainable development? What is happening with the enlargement of the European Union? Would it not be appropriate to mention both subjects?</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, sustainable development will be the goal in Gothenburg; for that reason there is only one clear reference to it in the current report, when it indicates that the economic and social dimensions of Lisbon will have to be completed by integrating the environmental dimension, which will contribute to a European Union strategy for sustainable development. This, then, will be an open possibility after Gothenburg and will certainly figure in future debates.</p>
<p class="contents">A different problem is that of enlargement, which is also clearly referred to: the European Union economy must not only take this essential element into account, but our whole design must also be based on the consideration that the Union will enlarge in a relatively short time. The European Union must take this element as a point of reference, but the applicant countries should also involve themselves in the Lisbon strategy by adopting its objectives as far as possible. This text, practically in the same words I have just used, is included in our synthesis report.</p>
<p class="contents">In speaking of Lisbon we are also speaking of the new method of coordination, the method of open coordination. It is true that this is an interesting method, which makes it possible to identify good practices and gradually develop a joint focus on topics of interest; the method, however, should not replace existing Community instruments of a regulatory or quasi-regulatory nature, or the guidelines that already exist in areas such as economic policy or employment.</p>
<p class="contents">One point I should like to highlight is that of structural reforms. We certainly included some specific references to structural reforms. We consider that these have a highly diverse content, and among them is the concept of liberalising our economies. This should certainly make us more competitive and will benefit users and make it possible to improve the quality of services of general interest. But it is clear that a liberalisation process will only be efficient and not cause problems if it is carried out in a legal framework with adequate control as regards regulation. We must not think of liberalisation processes that do not fit into a global framework. This regulatory process will doubtless be a fundamental topic in forthcoming debates, and the references to public interest services that have been made this afternoon come into this framework</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I found interesting in today’s debate is the extent to which an excess of bureaucratic posts is having a negative impact on the European development process. I shall just say that this is a point which the Commission is concerned about; at times we have even worked on an indicator for bureaucratic posts. It is obviously a difficult subject and it is being piloted by Eurostat, where a working party intends to define elements of precisely this nature which will provide us with more detail as to whether the concerns of a part of our society about the excess of bureaucratic posts reflects the reality of the situation or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the end of my comments now, I must say that at the moment, it may be worth stressing that the synthesis report process is a global process that requires coherence between macroeconomic stability, a subject we consider fundamental, employment, reforms and social cohesion. Within this concept of social cohesion, we must take a broad approach and keep a broad outlook; it must not confine itself exclusively to individual topics but must also address regional topics, as some of you have proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to highlight the progress that has been made in general terms, but it is rather more complex to point out how these advances in each of our countries, or in each of our regions, can be compared with the others.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, and I think this point is fundamental, the reforms we are putting into motion will make sense insofar as we are able to increase economic productivity and efficiency. Introducing elements of the new economy in the European Union will be the key to our future development. Growth yes, growth with social cohesion, growth that will enable us to face the future in terms of technological challenge; in the end, these are the Lisbon goals and these are the goals we have tried to include in our report.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks for your contributions and your participation in this debate. We shall try to take into consideration all those elements that have arisen today, which will certainly be useful for our debate in Stockholm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
