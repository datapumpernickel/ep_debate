<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Damião (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by congratulating the Commission and by saying that this initiative can be criticised only for its lateness and for the modesty of its ambition. Nevertheless, it has the merit of focusing on the groups of workers currently at greatest risk and also of including sectors that it would have been quite unjustifiable to exclude, such as the shipbuilding and aeronautical industries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission rightly affirms the need to expand protection for workers who are subject to risks of asbestos and also the need to increase the effectiveness of monitoring and prevention, especially in the civil construction industry, for certain tasks, such as the repair and removal of materials containing various types of asbestos.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and its rapporteur, Mr Meyer, on the proposals he has presented us with and which the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs made the effort to include, despite the limited prospect of their becoming law. We also feel that this is, in fact, a public health issue, which should be looked at on the basis of Article 174, in another context. I should like to draw your attention to the efforts made by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and to emphasise that my colleagues have helped to ensure that this report is today a more ambitious, more wide-ranging report, which also makes greater demands for the follow-up process. We hope that the Commission and the Council will take account of these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the proposals are new limits, a new organisation to oversee risk prevention and a greater effort by all parties involved, specifically by employers, who are asked to provide more training, and who are asked not to shirk their responsibilities by hiring workers without proper contracts, or who are subcontracted. There must be guarantees that workplaces subject to risks of asbestos are properly protected and that every precaution is taken to prevent the diseases that can result, which are serious diseases and as a rule carcinogenic, with a high mortality rate, which must be eradicated. In order to eradicate these diseases, the Member States, the public authorities, must also be required to accept other responsibilities; specifically, when local authorities, civil protection services, and site inspectors are consulted, before demolition or maintenance work, hiring workers or opening a work-site begins, they must verify whether or not the legislation of the Member States and Community guidelines in this field is being complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the rigorous evaluation we needed in order to make a legislative proposal that can, once and for all, put an end to certain arguments, which have more to do with vested interests than with what should be guiding us, which must respect the primacy of people’s integrity at work and in society. This being the case, we would like the Commission to provide this Parliament with epidemiological studies that clearly show the consequences of each asbestos fibre for the health of workers, which groups are at risk, to supply statistics that will enable a reliable study to be conducted and also to prevent some countries in the Union, six to be specific, from maintaining higher limits than those now being proposed. Enlargement will, furthermore, lead to discrepancies between the preventive practices of the various countries in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Compensation for accidents and diseases is another issue that we would like the Commission to look into. Compensation paid to victims, specifically to fatal victims, is lower than that paid out for road accidents, which we do not find acceptable. We also think that the Commission, regardless of the fact that the Member States clearly bear full responsibility in this area, must steer this debate in such a way that companies that cause their workers, by means of concealing the truth, to contract these diseases are punished and that the compensation paid out is, in light of all the criteria, acceptable and socially fair.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also take advantage of this range of packages – which it presented to Parliament in good time – to review the legal and conceptual criteria of hygiene and safety. There are striking differences between the organisation that is proposed for this directive and the directive on building sites and others and, we hope, therefore, that the Commission supports this revision in order to establish best legislative practice in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meanwhile, many victims who have inhaled asbestos dust have died from it. Long after it was known how destructive asbestos is in people, this relatively cheap material was still used in different countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Even now that its use will end in 2005 at the latest, we will still be contending with its harmful legacy for a long time. In the next 30 years, half a million people will become disabled and die prematurely in western Europe alone, because the illness often does not become apparent until long after infection. The demand for damages, other forms of compensation, disability pension and widows’ and orphans’ pensions is only right and proper.</p>
<p class="contents">Asbestos is used in buildings, appliances and vehicles in numerous locations, and it must be disposed of expertly. In the Eastern states that wish to join the European Union, the problem is even greater, partly because, in the countryside, houses there are built using roofs and facades that are entirely made of asbestos sheets of Russian origin.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has, in 15 additional amendments, mainly attempted to draw attention to people who have never worked with asbestos themselves, but who can become infected, such as family members, residents of dwellings that contain asbestos or people in the vicinity of asbestos-removal activities. We must assume that every building from the asbestos era contains asbestos unless, on the basis of independent evidence, it is proven otherwise beyond any doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals which I support are also aimed at making registers for all Member States and candidate countries compulsory, together with inspections of authorised scrapyards and a restriction on the transport of disposed asbestos to a distance of 500 km. In addition, the European Commission is invited to make proposals before the end of 2003 for the compensation and protection of victims who are not exposed to asbestos through their work, also in those cases in which the source of contamination is unknown or the company responsible no longer exists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pérez Álvarez (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should first like to thank Mrs Damião very much for her work on such a sensitive aspect of health in the workplace. Discussion on improvements in the labour market and on a better quality of work within the culture in which stable work was an underlying principle of labour law usually focuses more on what is now termed health in the workplace and used to be referred to as health and safety in the workplace. There is a tendency to overlook a fundamental issue. Work always entails a risk. No situation is free from risk. Worse, that risk is sometimes hidden, not immediately obvious, does not strike us at once, and is difficult to detect.</p>
<p class="contents">This, I believe, is the situation in which those who work with asbestos find themselves. Working with asbestos can be dangerous. It can result in very serious illnesses such as lung fibrosis, pleural fibrosis or mesothelioma. A number of doubts and unanswered questions still surround the use of this substance. These concern for example the effect of inhaling small doses on the risk of cancer, the limits below which one can be certain that cancer will not arise and the carcinogenic properties of various types of amphibolic asbestos or chrysothile asbestos. Then there are the many jobs in which asbestos is or has been used, jobs undertaken by small and medium-sized enterprises with inadequate personal safety equipment. Further, the equipment is often incomplete or is incorrectly used. I refer to jobs such as maintenance, repair, overhaul or refurbishment of buildings, and also to the repair or scrapping of vessels, motor vehicles or industrial equipment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another equally significant uncertainty relates to the length of time it takes for the disease to manifest itself. This has a bearing on establishing responsibility for it, and on the need for preliminary or regular medical examinations for workers at risk from asbestos. As was stated previously, preventive measures are also needed for those who happen to live in the vicinity and may be indirectly affected. I have to say in this regard that we do not agree at all with the rapporteur that the directive should cover more than the protection of workers. I should like to be very clear. I mean all types of workers at risk of contracting asbestos-related diseases. This is because in our view a different legal basis is called for.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe either that the onus of proof should be reversed automatically in cases where the cause of the pathology is in doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we do totally agree with the rapporteur on the need to change the culture on risk prevention in the workplace in general and on prevention of risks related to asbestos in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree on the need to raise awareness at all levels that is, at state level and amongst employers and workers. We also agree that more training and information would be useful and indeed necessary. In short, we do feel it is time for a change of culture. I appeal to the Commissioner on this. The change should be set in train and promoted by the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree too on the importance of social dialogue as a way of achieving an effective policy on health in the workplace. We would also encourage administrations to collaborate amongst themselves. We would possibly ascribe less importance to a third interlocutor, namely the state. This is because the state clearly has a great many other concerns, and a large number of new regulations are not what is needed in this case, unless new risks become apparent. Action at a non-regulatory level will prove much more important. In conclusion Commissioner, I feel the Commission could make a significant contribution in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thorning-Schmidt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, we all know that asbestos is one of the biggest threats of all to the health of workers in the EU. It is estimated, as a previous speaker has also said, that getting on for half a million deaths over the next 35 years will be directly linked to the serious illnesses caused by asbestos. The history of asbestos and the debate we have had about it show, in my view, how incredibly important it is that we take the precautionary principle seriously. For many years, asbestos was used without a thought for the harmful effects it might have and, as a precise consequence of this, the asbestos problem will dog us for many years to come. The proposal tabled by the Commission will ensure better protection of workers who are in danger of being exposed to asbestos in the course of their work, and it is on the whole a really sound proposal. The proposal reduces the limit value for the number of asbestos particles to which workers may be exposed. In view, however, of the danger presented by asbestos, it is good that the rapporteur try to have the limit value reduced further. What is crucial is that the employer be obliged to provide a relevant training programme for everyone at risk of being exposed to asbestos in the course of their work. Workers must be clear about how to protect themselves and others. In accordance with the Commission’s proposal, common guidelines concerning the content of the training programme must be set up, and these must be as precise and exhaustive as possible. I should like today to call upon the Member States to go still further and set up proper, formal training schemes for working with asbestos.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also comment on the ban on asbestos. The 1999 directive bans chrysotile, which is the last type of asbestos it is permitted to use. The total ban on all use and marketing of asbestos is to be implemented in all the Member States from January 2005. I learn, however, that it is apparently uncertain whether the ban also applies to the export of asbestos to countries outside the EU. If the ban is indeed uncertain, the problem should be tackled. It would be ethically quite wrong if the EU were to export asbestos for use in third countries. It would be contrary to all the principles on the basis of which we normally proceed. I do not know how we are to approach the matter legally. I will adopt a political approach to the matter, and I should like to take the opportunity to ask the Commissioner to give an account today of the Commission’s interpretation of this problem. Is it uncertain whether the 1999 directive does in fact ban exports to countries outside the EU? It would be interesting to be given an answer to that question. I also wish finally to say a big thank-you to the rapporteur, who has done an incredible amount of work to get this report up and running. I am entirely in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every year 4,500 people die in the UK from these diseases according to the trade unions, and studies predict, as Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said, that in excess of between 250,000 and 500,000 will die cross Western Europe in the next 35 years. The evidence is there. The facts are clear, based on scientific studies. Exposure to asbestos can maim and kill and asbestos workers have to be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Manufacturing of asbestos has been banned in almost all Member States, but there are still millions of tonnes of asbestos left in Europe's buildings, industrial plants, railway carriages that were built in the 1950s and the 1960s, etc. I agree with the report that the presence of asbestos has to be presumed in a building if it has not been proved otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">Workers will continue to be exposed for many years because of demolition, removal, refurbishment and maintenance still having to take place. That is why I sought further tightening of exposure levels in committee by proposing an amendment, which was accepted by committee, which would effectively halve the exposure allowed. Instead of the eight-hour exposure limit, it was opting for a four-hour exposure limit. It would also reflect the current working patterns within an industry because shifts are a lot less than they are in other sections of the industry. An eight-hour reference period will allow higher levels of exposure over a shorter period like one to two hours, which to my mind is unacceptable. I would like to see this limit for all workers who are exposed to asbestos, with the exception of people working in asbestos cement. I genuinely believe that is a separate case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important we do not have different exposure limits, however, depending on the type of work, as Amendment No 21 has, but this will be dealt with in conciliation. I urge you to vote for Amendment No 21 and for the last six words of Amendment No 42. My understanding is that if Amendment No 21 is accepted then we can vote for the last sentence of Amendment No 42 which deals with asbestos cement, but we need clarification on that from the President.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to vote for this excellent report. It is one example of an EU directive where there is compelling scientific and medical evidence that it is needed to save lives across the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, this will be a constant process, and so it should be. I will return to this point in a moment. Prevention is what is desperately needed in activities of this kind, and we are all too aware of this. In the past, I too handled asbestos when making and connecting pipes and tubing. In retrospect, I probably consumed incredible amounts of fibres, and I am unsure of the end result, but I must stress at this point that it was in the context of DIY. And this is exactly where the problem lies for, at the moment, we can ascertain quite clearly that, although we are drafting decisions on behalf of workers, we are doing too little for all kinds of related factors: subcontracting has been mentioned, DIY is a factor, and there is the problem of people living in the vicinity of asbestos. I would therefore call on the Commission, possibly via the Environment Commissioner, to lay down additional legislation which we could use. I will overlook for a moment all the other elements which demonstrate the importance of this legislation, including these half million people, for everyone has mentioned them. I would like to return to what Mrs Lynne mentioned a moment ago, namely the aspects relating to asbestos cement and air-placed asbestos. These have, in fact, been mentioned by Mrs Smet in the past. I have noted that what is important here is the handling of asbestos, air-placed asbestos or asbestos cement, the processes they undergo and the amount of fibres released per cubic centimetre. This must be measured, and certain substances should not be excluded for no apparent reason. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find it gratifying that, by means of its proposal, the Commission is now tightening up on the arrangements for protecting workers against the dangers of exposure to asbestos, which is of course a particularly dangerous substance, and I am therefore also able fully to support all the other features of the amendments designed to tighten matters up. As Mrs Thorning-Schmidt pointed out, there is still an unsolved problem in connection with the legislation on asbestos. This was highlighted at the meeting of the Employment and Social Policy Council of Ministers on 7 March 2002. The problem is that the ban, which is to be introduced in the EU from 2005, does not apply to the production of asbestos for third countries. I know that quite a few countries, including Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Finland, wanted the ban to be incorporated into the directive, but unfortunately there was only a minority at the meeting of the Employment and Social Policy Council of Ministers who endorsed that approach. I also know that the Commission has been reluctant to incorporate a direct ban into the directive itself on the grounds that to do so would not be to follow the normal procedure and might therefore cause legal problems. That is at any event what I have heard. If this is the case, I would urge the Commission to find another solution so that we can also obtain a ban on the production of asbestos for sale to third countries. When our own workers are required to take special precautions, the EU cannot of course defend exports to third countries which do not have the same resources to take their own precautions. It is, to put it bluntly, immoral, and I quite simply do not understand those Member States who cannot appreciate this. The EU should naturally cease such production. Moreover, workers involved in production for third countries would be exposed to asbestos whether the product were sold within or outside the EU. The EU is already notorious for its ambivalent rules in relation to third countries. A change to this directive so that it also includes a ban on production for, and exports to, third countries could be a good way to begin changing this state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This material is a danger not only to workers who are exposed to it, but also to public health in general. The Commission proposal, which is to be praised, and which seeks to amend this directive for the third time, has come about because of the need to strengthen existing orders so as to safeguard the health and safety of workers, especially in sectors where the risks of exposure are today acknowledged to be more dangerous. The proposal also seeks to ensure greater clarity in the definition of various types of fibre, because many doubts still remain about these and about the risks inherent in the minimum dose of exposure.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Elisa Damião, has adopted a balanced position on a sensitive and highly technical issue, on which I congratulate her. We can only welcome the emphasis she gives to prevention and to reducing exposure by workers to the minimum, particularly in activities involving the renovation, maintenance, upgrading or demolition of buildings. However, the measures envisaged for limit-values for exposure appear to be excessive where transite is concerned, since this is a substance that contains only 10% of fibres and, consequently, involves a lower degree of risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Professional training provided by employers, improving financing methods for small and medium-sized enterprises and self-employed workers, is another much-needed measure and is to be applauded, as is the preservation of registers and medical case-notes for a period of 40 years. Amending this directive not only provides greater protection and safety for workers, but also avoids imposing unnecessary conditions on employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although further scientific research is necessary to completely clear up the remaining doubts regarding the risks of asbestos exposure to human health, the number of victims of asbestos-related diseases in Europe is such that the majority of the Member States have implemented the ban on the marketing and use of products containing asbestos. The problem is now also responding to the shift of asbestos-related risks from one sector to another: from the traditional risks in the production sector – which, although significant, are controllable – to the risks in the sectors in which asbestos has to be handled because removal, maintenance, repair, or demolition work is carried out. The latter are potentially high, predictable risks, with regard to which it is becoming essential to base proposals squarely on the precautionary principle when setting exposure limits.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the risks posed by asbestos extend beyond the workers directly exposed to it. Others, such as the families of workers and persons living near work sites, may also be at risk, albeit to a much lesser extent, namely the families of workers and persons living near work sites. Although Italy is fortunate in that its legislation is more advanced than the proposed rules, it is important that we support the rapporteur now and adopt the report, for we need to make it absolutely clear that standards of safety at the workplace cannot be lowered. We must never forget that a high level of competitiveness is based partly on high quality social conditions and that quality of work is an important production factor.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, over and above the general political considerations mentioned, which, as we socialists see it, cannot be ignored, we must remember that the internationalisation of the economic and social costs of occupational diseases, both those already diagnosed and those still to be so, as well as accidents at work, should convince everybody beyond any doubt that high standards of health and safety in the workplace are, in addition to being a right of the workers, also beneficial to the companies themselves and to the economy in general.</p>

Yet this committee knows better. It thinks that the precautionary principle should apply. The only way to protect workers is a policy of zero risk.</p>
<p class="contents">To demonstrate the absurdity of this stance, you should note that a human being on average breathes in 20,000 white asbestos fibres a day; up to 2 million exist in the lungs of healthy individuals, and they are all from natural sources. In fact, although occupational exposure to massive levels of white asbestos may pose some risk, as indeed does exposure to any dust at high levels, even the UK's own risk-averse Health and Safety Executive concedes that there is a negligible risk from exposure to products made from white asbestos. Yet the inclusion of white asbestos in this directive is estimated by none other than our own Trade Union Council to cost GBP 80 billion for the UK alone and up to GBP 500 billion throughout Europe, without possibly saving a single life. At the very least, therefore, this Parliament should pause for thought and refer this legislation back to a committee for a full evaluation of its costs and consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the information was classified, and the factory was only closed after the Communist system had collapsed. There now remains a huge job of cleaning up to be done. Moreover, former employees are in constant anxiety about whether they will be affected by cancer in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, there are three flaws in this otherwise excellent report. First of all, it is proposed that national registers be set up of companies suited to the task of removing asbestos. It would be much better if such companies were to be issued with certificates of competence that could be referred to when contracts were tendered for. Registers are bureaucratic and difficult to manage.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is certainly possible to require a reverse burden of proof in the case of suspected asbestos-related illness in the form of asbestosis and mesothelioma but, however, quite <span class="italic">im</span>possible when it comes to what may be a link between asbestos and bronchial cancer or cancer of the digestive system. Once, perhaps, many years have elapsed following exposure to asbestos, it is not possible to weigh up the role of asbestos against that of smoking and other factors which may have contributed to the illness. On the other hand, the link with asbestosis and mesothelioma is very strong.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I shudder, as a doctor, at the thought of the EU’s beginning to lay down criteria for diagnosing illnesses. We have a worldwide system of diagnosis drawn up by the World Health Organisation, and the World Health Organisation ought also therefore to be responsible for assessing this system. If the EU is to establish diagnostic criteria, we are entering the area of health care, and the EU would then quite simply lack the power to decide on legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not very responsible. The said conclusions, which underestimate a risk as significant as exposure to asbestos, are clearly to be given as much consideration as the grounds for applying the precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The original Community legislation prioritised this protection within the context of the manufacture and processing of asbestos. This legislation has borne fruit, but a total ban on production has not yet been implemented in certain countries. Today, the question of the upkeep and maintenance of asbestos found by chance during building works requires a new framework for intervention and new legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This amendment was necessary but the goals of the directive thus amended are not yet truly equal to the seriousness of the problem. Mrs Damião’s report, which has genuinely tried to give workers greater protection, is absolutely remarkable. However, I would like to highlight two points. First, the problem of derogations: the proposal for a directive does not meet our expectations on this point, so we shall vote for Amendment No 21, which we consider to be a minimum; second, the question of responsibility: as shown by the latest judgments passed recently by the French courts, the wording of the text must allow the broadest possible responsibilities to be envisaged as the concepts of project managers or site managers are not specific enough to be completely effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a clear warning to all those who do not wish to support all the minimum specifications proposed here, and who would therefore be willing to take responsibility for the significant health risks that would affect many workers in Europe. This underestimation of the risks of exposure to asbestos and failure to apply the precautionary principle, a procedure which may well be costly but is less costly than human life, could lead to considerable responsibilities for employers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is precisely because asbestos is one of the most hazardous materials to work with that the most harmful types of it have been banned in almost every country in the world. All the same, we occasionally have to contend with difficulties, and indeed with the dangers being minimised, even on a worldwide scale, as for example at present in the WTO with Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">From 2005, there will be a ban in Europe on the use and marketing of all types of asbestos. That notwithstanding, Commissioner, we see your initiative for reform as necessary, as reform was overdue on specific points and aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore do not understand the position of the PPE-DE Group as just put forward by Mr Pérez Álvarez. Of course it is sensible to extend protection to users and residents as well as workers. We all know schools, sports facilities, and even European Union buildings, that have had to be closed due to contamination with asbestos and then laboriously and expensively renovated.</p>
<p class="contents">One important new essential is prevention, that is, education about the dangers of asbestos, and the greater responsibility of employers – not only the major employers, but also the small ones, including subcontractors, with atypical employment relationships of course included. That too I see as being necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should set an example in the development and use of alternative materials. That, rather than the export of asbestos to the rest of the world, is where our future lies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by welcoming and thanking Mr de Miguel, State Secretary for European Affairs of the Spanish presidency. I would like to thank him for his understanding. We ran out of time, but sometimes things are very difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to congratulate Mrs Damião on her excellent report on such a sensitive and technically difficult dossier as asbestos.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to complement the prohibition of marketing in the use of asbestos and products containing it, it is necessary to amend and update the provisions of the existing directive in order to focus the preventive measures on today's most exposed workers, namely those carrying out repairs, demolition and maintenance activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the House on the quality of its amendments. I very much understand why you so much insist on the need to increase the levels of protection, not only for workers but also for the general population and the environment. Unfortunately, this is not possible within the scope of Article 137 of the Treaty, which is the basis of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to reply to the Members' proposals through my comments and my justification for rejection or approval of the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 11, 17, 18, 19, 22, 31, 32, 34 and 39, since they improve on the quality of the text and/or clarify its meaning. Although I can agree to the ideas behind Amendments Nos 2, 4, 7, 8, 9, 12, 13 and 14, the Commission cannot accept them for reasons of legal coherence and legislative technique.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has to reject Amendment No 16 and the second part of Amendment No 25, because the employers' responsibility is clearly established in the framework of Directive 89/391 and any further qualification would introduce legal uncertainties as regards where this responsibility lies.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the limit value, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 21 and 42, because they would introduce two different limit values, implying different protection levels for workers carrying out different activities. In addition, the expression of the limit values as a time-weighted average in a period of four hours instead of eight hours has to be rejected because it would create confusion when compared to the same values in international standards which use a reference period of eight hours. Amendments Nos 5, 10, 27, 38 and 40 cannot be accepted by the Commission because Article 137, on which the proposal for a directive is based, does not allow for the recognition of and financial compensation for occupational diseases and concerns only the protection of workers. In any case the compensation issue is a subject of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 30, 33, 35, 36 and 37. Amendment No 29 cannot be accepted since Directive 89/391 imposes an obligation on the employer to provide adequate training for workers and not merely to make training available.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 41, cannot be followed by the Commission because it would introduce, in the case of activities involving sporadic and low-intensity exposures, unnecessary additional bureaucratic burden on enterprises and national administrations without any additional benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission considers that Amendments Nos 3, 6, the second part of Amendment No 23, Amendments Nos 24, 26 and 28 are already contained in substance in the different articles of the proposal and therefore cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Before summing up, there is a real political question: will this directive as it stands now prohibit any export to third countries after 2005? The answer, unfortunately, is clear: no, it cannot. It is one of the main issues of discussion between the Commission and the Council. A total ban could be the answer but, in that case – and the Commission has no objections to this approach – you must admit that it is a very complicated problem because in the case of a total ban we must take into account not only the problems of demolition or maintenance – and the workers who are exposed to these activities – but also the fact that there is a list of different products which contain very small amounts of asbestos which is not dangerous, and we must see how we can solve this very complicated internal market problem.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a question about the exclusion of asbestos cement. As my colleague, who is an expert on this issue, tells me there is a real problem with this product so we cannot exclude it. At least it is not something less dangerous than the others which we exclude.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to sum up, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 1, 11, 17, 18, 19, 22, 31, 32, 34 and 39. It can accept in part Amendments Nos 20, 23 and 25. It rejects Amendments Nos 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 21, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 40, 41 and 42.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a very interesting debate and there is no need for me to refer to the substance of the directive because everybody agrees that this is one of the most important directives concerning health and safety in our legislation.</p>

It concerns the date and time by which questions should have been submitted in order to receive an answer. I am simply saying that such a difference of opinion exists. I am not making a value judgment, just stating facts. Parliament’s deadline is 1 p.m. on 26 April. Council’s is 1 p.m. on 25 April.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is that in any case the last ten of the series of questions to be put to the Council would not have been answered orally, because they are at the end. That being so, the Council may decide to provide a written answer, further to the President’s letter. This is what would have happened anyway. Alternatively, the questions may be transferred to the next part-session. That would be the worst scenario as far as Parliament is concerned. I trust Parliament and the Council will come to an understanding and the questions will be answered. Let us show some optimism for once.</p>

<p class="contents">This particular case concerns deadlines for questions to be submitted. As you already stated, our opinions differ. Nonetheless, the time available to the Council, though it is the minimum required, is always very limited when it comes to drafting replies and having them approved by the Member States. I cannot provide any replies in Parliament unless they are approved by the Council in advance.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, on this occasion normal working time was disrupted by the Easter celebrations. All the institutions shut down for several days. The Council would like to ensure that there is no repetition of situations such as the one we are confronted with today. We would therefore appreciate it if both institutions could come to an agreement. It should then be able to avoid similar situations in the future, especially when holiday periods intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">At a stage when our Presidency is making an unprecedented effort to achieve interinstitutional understanding – I must stress that there has been nothing like this in the past – I really do not want this matter to be blown up out of all proportion. There is no need to make a mountain out of a molehill. There simply has not been enough time. There have not been enough hours in the day to produce replies, and there has not been time either to have the replies approved by the Council and by Council delegations.</p>
<p class="contents">I suggest we provide written replies. These questions would anyway have been replied to in writing. Let me remind you that it is almost 6 p.m. We were already half an hour late starting, so we will not even be able to reply to all the questions agreed to, let alone the additional ones.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out, because I feel it is relevant, that the question Mr De Rossa has particularly in mind relates to Palestine. You will recall that an important debate on the situation in the Middle East took place in the House yesterday afternoon. There was no reason why Mr De Rossa could not have put his name forward and asked his question yesterday. Both the High Representative and I were present on behalf of the Council, and we would have been delighted to answer it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall give you the floor so you can express your opinion briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of my experience over the years, I do not think the first thirty questions could have been replied to in one and a half hours, even if that time had been available. Consequently they would in any case have been dealt with in writing. If they do receive written replies, that will be the end of the matter. If they do not, Parliament will invoke the necessary measures to ensure they receive oral replies during the next part-session. I do however have a lot of faith in interinstitutional dialogue and in precedents where agreements have been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not take up the points made by Mr de Miguel, because I do not wish to start a debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr De Rossa, do you wish to raise a point of order? Regarding Palestine, I can tell you straight away that usually, when an issue is debated during a part-session, questions on that issue are withdrawn from Question Time. That decision is taken by the President of Parliament in consultation with his Office. In this case, the President took the decision to retain these questions. This does fall within the President’s competence, and as President of this sitting, I abide by his decision. You have the floor, Mr De Rossa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
