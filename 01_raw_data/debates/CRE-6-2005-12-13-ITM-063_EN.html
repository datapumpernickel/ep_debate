<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Henrik Dam Kristensen (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I was very pleased to be rapporteur for this report. Consumer protection and consumer policy in general are important issues, and I am also pleased that the European Parliament is involved in putting them high on the political agenda. A large proportion of the work that goes on in the EU at the moment is of course about getting the internal market to operate more smoothly when it comes to both goods and services. It is ultimately for consumers that companies produce goods and services, so it is quite crucial to competition in the internal market that consumers make demands of such goods and services. In order for them to do so, it is essential, firstly, that consumers know what demands they can make of companies and that they be used to being percipient and critical when they shop. Secondly, it is important for consumers to have the right channels available to them for making these demands.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, it is crucial that we turn our attention to the new Member States. Just as there are big differences from one old Member State to another, we cannot, of course, lump the ten new Member States together. There is, however, no doubt that what might be called consumer culture tends generally to be weaker in many of the new Member States than in many of the old ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are often not especially demanding with regard to the quality of the products and services they buy, and institutionalised procedures for complaining about defects in, or problems with, products or services either do not exist or exist to only a limited degree. If we are to change this situation, it is essential that we try to strengthen consumer culture. There are several places where intervention is possible. I believe that one of the most important things to do is to direct our attention to the consumer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of the old Member States, independent consumer organisations play a central role in placing consumer issues on the political agenda and in helping and representing consumers in disputes with businesses. The consumer organisations are, unfortunately, often very weak in the new Member States, and they therefore rarely constitute the necessary counterbalance to businesses and governments. One major problem in this context is the consumer organisations’ lack of financial resources. Only in a few countries does the ministry responsible make resources available and, in those cases in which financial resources do exist, the amounts are often very small. Over and above government funding, another possibility is EU funding for projects through the Commission. The conditions for winning a tender or obtaining support from the Commission are, however, very strict and, at least in a number of cases, it is difficult for the consumer organisations to meet the Commission’s requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">A second problem is that the political influence of consumer organisations is often quite limited. This can be explained in a number of ways. Firstly, many organisations have difficulty securing enough support from the public, due both to their weak economic situation and to the public’s relatively low awareness of consumer issues. Secondly, there are often not very many formal channels through which the NGOs can influence the political decision-making process. Moreover, there are great differences as to how consumer organisations in the new Member States are structured. Often, there exist many small consumer organisations, competing against each other instead of pulling together. It is very difficult for the organisations to convey their views with sufficient force in the decision-making process and, thus, in the public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, there is the problem that most consumer organisation employees work as volunteers. Undoubtedly, they are enthusiastic, but they are difficult to hold onto in the long term. These are problems that we must sort out if the internal market and consumer protection are to operate at their best. Responsibility for solving these problems is not located unambiguously in the one place. The governments of the new Member States have a responsibility for taking consumer issues far more seriously than they do at present and, at the same time, for providing the necessary support to consumer organisations. It should be understood, however, that a high level of consumer protection and an efficient market economy are not mutually exclusive but are, on the contrary, dependent on one another.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission and the other EU Member States have an outright political responsibility for giving priority to these issues, especially in the new Member States. It is a responsibility for taking the lead and ensuring that consumers become more aware of their rights and role as consumers in the internal market. Last but not least, the consumer organisations in the new Member States also have a responsibility themselves. I would therefore hope that we might have a constructive debate on the report. I think that we have a good opportunity for strengthening the consumer organisations in the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Usually I am the last on the list in these late debates, so I know exactly what we are talking about!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by thanking and congratulating Mr Kristensen and Parliament for this initiative. It is very important to identify the special situation regarding new Member States and consumer protection. Even though a lot has been done already, and I will talk about that later, a lot still needs to be done. We have come a long way, but extra effort is still needed. I know that some of you have already heard me speaking to the Intergroup, but I shall echo what I said here with one word: how? How are we going to do all the things you are suggesting? Most of them I agree with, and we are going to try and see how we can adopt in practical terms, but the problem is that to do all those things we will need adequate funds, and that is a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true we have reached a very high level of legislation. This is a fact. But there will always be room for improvement. As you know, we have the review of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> very soon, but at the same time we have reached the point where we need to enforce, to implement. This is usually done through training, education, capacity-building – largely through consumer organisations. This is even truer for new Member States. The question is how this is to be done without sufficient funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a more demanding situation now. We now have 25 Member States, soon to be 27, and not 15 Member States. Yet at the same time, in practice, we will have fewer funds than we had for the EU-15. Based on last week’s latest proposal on the budget, if we fund the European Food Safety Authority and the European Centre for Disease Control, as envisaged in the programme, there will be no money left for anything else. New Member States or old Member States, new initiatives or old initiatives, we will not have any funds left. Therefore, we will have to re-evaluate our priorities and limit the areas in which we are going to work to make sure that we make an impact with the limited funds we will have.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that we have a lot to do in the new Member States, but we have gone a long way. There are very interesting suggestions in the report. We will try to find the best ways to apply them. However, I can tell you that we have already achieved a lot: we offer training courses especially for consumer organisation staff in new Member States. More than 60% of the trainees come from new Member States. We give priority to calls for specific projects. EU co-financing is higher and the criteria are more favourable for the new Member States. We have already had information campaigns in Poland this year and will have them in the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Slovenia next year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to European consumer centres, which are very important institutions – you have supported the idea many times – we already have them in seven out of the ten new Member States and next year will be establishing them in Hungary, Slovenia and Slovakia. We will continue in the meantime to work on finding the means to make operational some of the calls in Mr Kristensen’s report. To do our job properly, we will need to have the right data and information. We will need to have objective criteria to be able to evaluate and assess the situation in each Member State and, in particular, in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to say that we have limits: not just financial limits, but also competence limits. What we do complements but does not substitute for national responsibility and national initiatives. Many aspects, such as the financing of the day-to-day operations of national consumer organisations, are the responsibility of national governments. That is the main reason why I always emphasise in my meetings with the ministers responsible for consumer protection that consumer policy has to become a priority. I believe that Members of the European Parliament can also play a very important role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by making two points. Firstly, I can assure you that in the consumer strategy we will bring forward in 2006 there will be a more detailed, elaborate proposal that we will develop and present to Parliament. It will give a greater focus on new Member States, taking into account as many of the suggestions in the report as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to announce to the House something that you may find interesting. We have circulated a questionnaire. We are building a country profile for all Member States in the consumer protection area, containing all the data on the situation, and this will be published on the website. This will make it more transparent, so that both consumer organisations, Members of Parliament and anybody interested will be able to see. If there is anything incorrect, I would be very happy to know, because most of the information will be given to us by the Member States. But at least it will be the first step towards being able to compare the situation between the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I will stop there. I apologise if I have spoken for too long. I will now listen with great interest to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumer protection and the internal market are intrinsically linked. According to the analysis carried out by my colleagues in the CPP, the new Member States came under pressure during the accession negotiations to make their consumer protection laws more modern and in some areas more stringent than those of the old, and in particular the founding Member States. It also came through in our discussions in committee that politicians on both sides were unaware of this. It is clear to all, however, that the crucial difference lies in the level of consumer culture between old and new Member States. The citizens as customers are unaware of their rights and do not assert themselves sufficiently in this regard. Given that over the past 40 or 50 years they have not been used to fighting for their rights, the provision of information about such rights and assistance in claiming them, both in and out of court, are the key elements of the implementation of consumer protection, as the Kristensen report emphasises.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, citizens in the new Member States are also easy prey to unscrupulous business practices, even from the old Member States, in which such practices are not permitted and where there is in fact a more highly developed consumer culture, for example the restriction of users' rights in the case of goods covered by intellectual property protection, attempts to distribute untested goods from non-EU countries, and so on. In the report, we urge the Commission to establish measurable quality indicators for the purpose of benchmarking, because we feel that in order to ensure high quality it is extremely important – and this is not only true of the new Member States – to establish publicly objective standards.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the fact that consumer organisations differ from those in the old Member States and that there is a need to enable them to allow for the work of volunteers ...</p>

This is the goal we must set ourselves, and this is why the idea of a consumer culture is exactly the right place to start in order to demonstrate the need for us to ensure a high level of awareness of consumer rights in all Member States, in order for citizens to be able to demand these rights, which is a prerequisite for achieving this high level of protection in reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will allow Parliament to send an important political message to the Commission, as well as to the Member States, to industry and to the public. Consumer protection organisations and consumer rights belong to the European Union’s key fundamental values. I am delighted that the fruits of many years of work in the 15 old Member States, which are now taken for granted in these countries, are also to be reaped by the 10 new Member States, in line with the principles of partnership and solidarity. At the same time, however, the old Member States could learn a lot from the new Member States in this field. I would also call on the old Member States to ensure that consumer protection continues to be given its due priority. Budgetary cuts, such as those planned in Thuringia, for example, send out the wrong message. We should be doing exactly the opposite, and ensuring that the voice of consumers is heard more clearly during our decision-making processes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must not forget the specific conditions in the new Member States when formulating European consumer policy. The report contains comprehensive descriptions of the situation and standing of consumer organisations in these countries. Their consumer organisations are only just starting to gain a foothold in the internal market, and they are plagued by a constant lack of money and expertise. It is therefore crucially important for the various groups and institutions providing funding and training, with the aim of ensuring that strong and independent consumer organisations can be set up, to join forces. At the same time, we should not forget that consumer organisations in many new Member States are financially dependent on the state, which means that we can hardly expect them to be independent. It is for this reason that the proposal to simplify EU funding and to make it more flexible is entirely justified. In addition to funding, further important fields of action include the training of staff, the establishment of umbrella organisations and the setting up of twinning projects and other projects, such as those involving the provision of advice. Measures of this nature will help to strengthen consumer organisations, and consequently to raise public awareness and to promote a consumer culture.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude with one last comment to the House, regarding the provision of information to consumer organisations and the maintenance of contacts with these latter. As a new Member of the House, and as a member of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I have to admit that I am only just starting to make contact with consumer organisations in my own country and work with them. These organisations often have no access to up-to-date information or to the Internet, which makes it a great deal more difficult for us to keep in touch. I therefore believe that it would be a very good idea to publish monthly magazines targeted at the new Member States and containing analyses of current EU consumer policy. This is in fact one of the proposals made by the rapporteur in his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report could be an action plan standard for new Member States. At the same time, I obviously agree with Commissioner Kyprianou that the resources available to us are not sufficient, and I am deeply convinced that our most important task is to include consumer protection issues in the compulsory curriculum for very young children (I also say this as the mother of three children). Therefore I congratulate Mr Kristensen and ask the Commissioner to treat the issue of consumer protection as part of the development process of the internal market in new Member States, as the internal market cannot operate in a balanced manner if consumers in Scandinavian and Eastern European countries cannot exercise their rights to the same extent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a Member representing Slovakia, I would like to thank the rapporteur for a fine and consistent report, and also for his cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the report, I would like to mention the satisfactory results achieved by the new Member States in transposing and effectively applying Community legislation in practice. A good example of this would be the swift implementation of a directive dealing with certain aspects of the sale of consumer goods and related guarantees. On the basis of this directive, sellers in the new Member States provide consumers with a minimum two-year guarantee for the goods sold since accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To my surprise, sellers in Belgium and France, for instance, provide no such guarantee, and consumers are not informed of their rights. The reason for this situation is a lengthy delay in the implementation of this directive in certain EU-15 countries. Some of them have implemented it only after a ruling from the European Court of Justice, and awareness of it is still poor among sellers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The key point of this report is its emphasis on the financing of consumer organisations. Despite lack of funding, consumer organisations in the new Member States make considerable efforts, mainly through volunteers, to improve consumer culture. They contribute greatly to the education of young people in schools and encourage them to form good consumer habits. For instance, the Consumer Diary is an excellent activity that is helping young Europeans understand their consumer rights and obligations. I am convinced that only professional organisations of a high standard focusing on the protection of consumer rights and supported by sufficient funding will be able to bring about the development of a European consumer culture without borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a basic policy that consumer protection is an integral part of the internal market and we cannot have completion of the internal market without consumer confidence and consumer protection. Therefore, I emphasise to those Member States that usually need more encouragement that this is also an investment, not just a human rights obligation that we owe to our citizens. We also make an investment in the growth of the economy by investing in consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation in the consumer organisation area is problematic in many new Member States. Some Member States have too many organisations – about 100 – while others have too few. Therefore, without interfering with the right of assembly or with private rights, we need to encourage stronger organisations, maybe federations, but this is something on which we can only advise; we cannot enforce it. That applies to financing too. The responsibility for most of the financing of the operational costs of the consumer organisations lies with the national governments. We can encourage, we can suggest, we can try to convince, but it has to be decided by the national governments. The European Consumer Centres, which play a great role, can carry out that function. I am happy that, by next year, all the new Member States will have their own European Consumer Centres.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the issue of volunteer work is very important for the consumer organisations. In our calculations, when we award projects, we take volunteer work into consideration as part of the contribution in kind. In that way, we help the organisations cover their part of the contribution to their financing through this volunteer work, which is a great help to the consumer organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">On training, we can train the trainers. We can train the permanent staff of organisations who have to train the volunteers. As regards logistical – and especially language – problems, we do not have enough specialised people who can train in all the languages. So we train the consumer organisation staff who then can train volunteer workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mr Kristensen’s suggestion that we have to remind ourselves that the new Member States have no derogation on joining the eurozone and adopting the euro. If this is an obligation for new Member States, we might as well work with them and their citizens so that they can properly prepare, and in a timely fashion, for the adoption of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to education, I agree. We have the Consumer Diary, as you know, which is distributed in schools. It was very well received. I have figures from the new Member States. Of course, there is still room for improvement next year. I encouraged the Ministers for Education to increase the number of diaries that will be distributed to schools and students. Hopefully, we will soon be introducing the concept of a Masters Degree in consumer protection, which will be an incentive for young people to study this specialised area.</p>
