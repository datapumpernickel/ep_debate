The composition of the House due to vote on this report tomorrow will not be the same as that of the House that will vote on final adoption of the 2005 budget in December, assuming that stage is reached. I trust that at least my colleagues on the Committee on Budgets and I will be able to vote in December along with our new colleagues from the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all colleagues and officials for the spirit of cooperation they have demonstrated towards me thus far.</p>
<p class="contents">An innovative step forward has been taken with regard to modernising the budgetary procedure. Further to the debate on stock taking and the change to activity based budgeting, the European Parliament is doing away with the former budgetary guidelines. These are replaced by a resolution on the Annual Policy Strategy Report. One objective is to render the legislative procedures more appropriate. It is also hoped to influence the drafting of the Commission’s preliminary draft budget. We therefore urge the Commission to take account of our political and budgetary priorities when negotiating with the various Directorates-General.</p>
<p class="contents">We set out to draft a shorter resolution this year. Unfortunately, I fear we have failed in our endeavour, as we did in previous years. Nonetheless, I am delighted with my colleagues’ contributions. I should like to take this opportunity of emphasising that the opinions of the other parliamentary committees will be taken into account at first reading of the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this draft 2005 budget is characterised from the outset by a special feature. I refer to the budgetary restriction affecting categories 3, 4, and 5. This budgetary limit will affect many programmes and will call for a particular effort to improve the distribution of appropriations between ongoing functions and new priorities. We believe that the new needs will require additional resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning agriculture, we call on the Commission to make a statement on the pilot projects and on the initiatives launched in the 2004 budget. With regard to the Structural Funds, we point to the improved implementation of appropriations in 2003, despite retaining a very high RAL. Your rapporteur intends to set the final figure for appropriations by reference to Member States’ forecasts.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to internal policies, the European Parliament is concerned about meeting the mid-term objectives set at Lisbon. We therefore request that budgetary resources be focused on the key actions in 2005. Special attention will be paid to small- and medium-sized enterprises, as they are the drivers of growth and employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is also concerned about implementation of communication and information policy. The new Financial Regulation must not hinder the development of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">This budget’s main aim will be the consolidation of the European area of freedom, security and justice. It will pay particular attention to the common immigration policy and to speeding up implementation of the integrated Schengen and VIS Project systems. Substantial budgetary resources will be required in both cases. Parliament must deal quickly with these priorities, however, if it is to be seen to respond to concerns expressed by European citizens. We shall stand shoulder to shoulder with you on this, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall also respond appropriately to the challenge posed by terrorism, particularly in the wake of the terrible attacks perpetrated in Madrid on 11 March. All our efforts to ensure no such outrage can ever take place in Europe again will be dedicated to the victims.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we shall endorse the pilot project for aid to the victims of terrorism. We shall also support strengthening Europol and Eurojust. In addition, we are in favour of your directive on compensation for victims of crime. We shall support similar initiatives brought before the House also. To summarise, in the case of the fight against terrorism, the House will go beyond supporting the Council and the Commission. It will actually try to take the lead.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external affairs, Parliament will become ever more involved in the reconstruction of Iraq and the consolidation of democracy in Afghanistan. The traditional priority areas for the House will not be neglected either.</p>
<p class="contents">New additions for this year are the neighbourhood policy, the creation of a European diplomatic service and of a European external action service. The general principle applied throughout will be that new external needs must be financed with new resources so as not to detract from our traditional priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we have taken note of the 700 posts you request from us, Commissioner. We very much hope that you will in any case try to arrange some redeployment.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall conclude by saying that we will be very vigilant as far as the various agencies are concerned. We shall ask them to provide a mid-term programme. The Commission should be able to include this in the draft preliminary budget in May on the development of these agencies.</p>

The Commission will adopt the preliminary draft for the 2005 budget within the next few weeks. At the first reading by the Council in July, under the Dutch Presidency, 25 Member States will be represented, and the MEPs from 25 Member States will take part in the first parliamentary reading in October.</p>
<p class="contents">The budget of 2005 will thus be presented to a host of new faces, not least within the Commission. There can, however, be no doubt that the budget will be dominated by enlargement, and this is also emphasised by the general rapporteur, Mr Garriga Polledo, in his report. May I offer you my very sincere thanks for your report, Mr Garriga Polledo, particularly since you were under pressure to produce it within a very short time because of the postponement of the communication from the Commission on the policy strategy for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the aims of the 2005 budget is to implement the agreements contained in the Treaty of Accession. In concrete terms, this means that direct payments to farmers are to be entered in the budget for the first time. It also means an increase in the financial commitments from the Structural Funds, as agreed in Copenhagen. The Structural Funds are the main instrument with which the European Union gives financial assistance to the new Member States in order to narrow the prosperity gap, and they should remain the principal instrument of cohesion policy in the future too.</p>
<p class="contents">At the consultation before the first reading of the budget for 2005, I shall report to you on the latest progress in the programming of the Structural Funds for the new Member States. The political priority attaching to enlargement is also reflected in administrative expenditure: the Commission will, as stated in the communication of 2002 and reiterated a few moments ago by your general rapporteur, apply for the next batch of additional posts for enlargement. This will involve the establishment of 700 new posts, about half of which will be assigned to the language services.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as administrative expenditure is concerned, special efforts and particularly close cooperation will be required from all the institutions if we are to operate within the ceiling which is set in the financial plans and which has turned out to be lower than previously calculated because of the reduction in the appropriation for exchange losses. Mr Kuckelkorn, of course, has dealt with that very thoroughly, and may I extend my thanks to you too, Mr Kuckelkorn, for your report. Lastly, for the priority task of enlargement, the Commission is also proposing an increase in pre-accession aid to Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania, as decided by the Council with the support of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lending new dynamism to economic growth in Europe is a task for the Member States and the Union, a task that will help to shape the next few years. Enlargement itself will generate economic impetus. Additional efforts are, however, needed to tap the full potential of the enlarged single market. These efforts receive financial backing from the EU budget, not only through the Structural Funds but also, for example, with the funds allocated to the trans-European networks, and provision has been made for an increase in these funds next year. The funds earmarked for measures such as the creation of a chemicals-testing agency are essential expenditure if we are to ensure that the new approach to chemicals policy, which involves testing old substances for their impact on the environment and public health, does not become a bureaucratic impediment to the chemical industry but should actually speed up the innovation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The dreadful events of 11 September 2001 and the savage terrorist acts in Madrid have clearly emphasised the danger emanating from terrorism. In the European Union we need more cooperation, more effective cooperation, in order to protect our citizens from such dangers. The measures envisaged in this domain are another priority for the 2005 budget, and I note that all the institutions are in agreement on this point too.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal security of the European Union and its role in the field of foreign policy are inseparable. As far as the foreign-policy budget is concerned, we face another significant challenge in 2005. The adjustment entry is lower than the rate of inflation. This means in practice that the budget for the common foreign policy will be reduced in real terms. This is in stark contrast to all the political pronouncements as well as being glaringly inconsistent with the spirit of the draft constitution, which we hope will be adopted within the next few weeks. There is simply no escaping the fact that the ceiling on the foreign-policy budget was set too low. This mistake must not be repeated in the next round of financial planning.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we must safeguard the appropriations for the main priorities, such as combating poverty and honouring our commitments in Afghanistan and in the Balkans too, commitments to which Mr Garriga Polledo also referred in his speech. For next year we need a contingency reserve again to enable us to make funds available for Iraq. Let us hope, and let us all play our part in ensuring, that next year’s Iraq agenda really can be devoted to reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">2005 is the sixth year of the Financial Perspective that is now in force. When a planning period nears its end, the room for manoeuvre becomes increasingly limited as more and more funds are tied up in advance by decisions made in previous years. Next year will be particularly tight, because the adjustments, as I mentioned, have turned out to be smaller than originally envisaged. For 2005 the current financial plans provide for EUR 119 billion in commitment appropriations and EUR 114 billion in payment appropriations, which corresponds to 1.09% of gross national income. The cost of implementing decisions of previous years – those taken in the framework of Agenda 2000, the Accession Treaty, the multiannual programmes, the roadmaps or even the agricultural reform package, the full impact of which will be felt next year as its cost rises to about EUR 1 billion – swallows the bulk of the funds within each of the ceilings.</p>
<p class="contents">There will be a need for close and fruitful cooperation among all participants if we are to reach a timely agreement on the budget for 2005. As in past years, the Commission will cooperate closely with the rapporteurs and the Parliamentary Committee on Budgets and with the Council’s Economic and Financial Committee under the Dutch Presidency. On a personal level too, I shall naturally make it a point of honour to cooperate very closely and effectively, as in the preceding years, so that we can draw up and adopt a budget that will help significantly to achieve the aims of the enlarged Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must also make the Commission aware once again of the long-standing position of the Committee on External Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. I am glad Mr Garriga Polledo has also endorsed this position, inasmuch as we cannot continue financing new priorities to the detriment of other parts of the world such as TACIS, the Mediterranean, Latin America and Asia. This is simply not possible, Commissioner. I have in mind new commitments such as those made to Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to run briefly through the priorities of the Committee on External Affairs. These are to combat poverty and promote human rights. The committee also shares the priorities of the European security strategy, namely combating terrorism, the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and preventing organised crime and regional conflict, as well as dealing with failing states.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted with some concern the adjustments needed to bring the 2005 Budget into line with the requirements of the Financial Perspective. Commissioner, I trust the offer of cooperation you just extended to the Committee on Budgets and to the Presidency-in-Office of the Council can also be extended to the Committee on External Affairs, as we are all working together in the interests of effective and visible European external action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We had three main priorities in our committee. One of them has been fully adopted in the report and that is Lisbon. Lisbon is the solution for better competitiveness, better employment and a better economy. We need to put even more emphasis on this than we have in the past. For Lisbon to succeed, we also need to name the social partners. This will involve a very small sum, but it is really extremely important. It would be good if that were still to be brought up for debate in some way or other in the resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">It has, therefore, become necessary for the Commission, in the preliminary draft budget, to anticipate some of the consequences of this enlargement, providing for sufficient funds, for example, for intervention measures for certain products, such as butter or beef, in the event that the new Member States cannot bring their prices into line quickly or, for example, veterinary funds to combat animal diseases, which could increase following the disappearance of the current borders.</p>

I shall now continue where I left off by emphasising that these future prospects depend on systematic pursuit of the reform efforts and on the implementation of decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call for due consideration in the 2005 budget of at least the main areas of action of the common fisheries policy. Firstly, we need better staffing of the relevant services if the aims of the CFP reforms are to be achieved. Secondly, we need the provision of a solid financial basis for the planned creation of the regional advisory bodies, and, thirdly, we need a solid financial basis for the establishment of the Community Fisheries Control Agency. Fourthly, we need sufficient resources for the new fisheries agreements as well as for EU participation in international fisheries organisations and, fifthly, we need adequate funding to compensate the coastal regions hit by the effects of recovery plans and emergency measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Our decision to reform the CFP made good sense. In the budget for 2005, the aim must now be to build a robust and sustainable financial substructure that will finally enable the fishing industry to become profitable again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe it is essential that policies that have been codecided should really be entered in the budget without sacrificing other European policies; this will require a higher income than proposed. I will, however, stress that more funding needs to be budgeted for the Lisbon objectives. At the half-way stage we have not reached our targets. It is therefore imperative that budget resources be concentrated on employment, innovation and social cohesion policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We must in that way ensure that the social partners take part in modernisation talks. All the budget lines allowing progress to be made with the Union’s economic governance must also be funded. We are agreed in recognising the essential part played by small firms in modernising employment. They play a recognised part in the creation and preservation of jobs. We must continue to help them by improving their environment, however. It must be made easier to support non-governmental organisations in the social sector and we shall have to find a way to put an end to their financial insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with our rapporteur that information and communication are areas to which the Commission needs to give greater priority and on which it must take action. Not only must these budget lines be funded, but more especially the Commission must fully realise what its role is in this information policy because all policies must come back to and finish with the citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the European Community, more women are victims of violence within the family than are victims of terrorism. For this reason, we call for 2006 to be declared the European Year against Violence. We want the Beijing +10 review to be used as a means of fleshing out the Beijing Platform for Action, and we want the results of the World Conference on Women to be implemented by a European Conference, for example, which would develop additional strategies. We also call for a European Gender Institute, which would compile reliable data as a basis for our political decisions. We expect the Commission to apply gender mainstreaming in all areas of political activity, and the 2005 budget, the first in the greater European Union, should provide us with the main indicators of its application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report does this House credit. Allow me to pick out a few points from the report for brief comment. I should certainly like to express my astonishment that the Commission has apparently agreed with the Council – or so the documentation seems to suggest – on a cut of EUR 100 million in the special programme for the removal of bottlenecks in the framework of the trans-European networks. I find that procedurally and politically unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">On the procedural side, the Commission is not the budgetary authority. Budgetary authority is vested in other institutions, and our Parliament is one of them. The Commission’s task is to take account of the will of the budgetary authority. With regard to the substance of this apparent agreement, it is evident, particularly in my own region, that we are not prepared for enlargement as far as the transport infrastructure is concerned and that there is an urgent need for funding here. It is therefore unacceptable that an important project proposed by the Commission under parliamentary pressure should now be ditched.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that clearly and may I also say that the Commission should rethink its political approach to the adoption of preparatory measures in connection with its visa policy, the Schengen information system and its refugee policy. Various directorates-general have adopted very different political approaches in this matter, and the Commission is surely duty-bound to pursue a coherent overall approach. What various parts of the Commission are putting out at this time cannot be accepted and is, in some cases, self-contradictory.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, allow me to refer to the establishment of new posts. Let me forewarn you clearly that we shall be examining very carefully whether 700 posts are really needed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be a matter for the next Parliament to bring the process to a conclusion. In this respect it is an unusual budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unusual in that it is heavily influenced by the particular context in which it is being prepared. On the one hand, we want to make enlargement work and must therefore create the appropriate conditions. In addition, everything to do with enlargement is all about the future and about the availability of financial resources too. We shall also discuss the budget in the light of the debate on the financial perspective, because this 2005 budget will be the last but one before the new financial perspective. It goes without saying that the figures we estimate represent choices for the future, and they will also be one of the foundations of the debate on the financial perspective, whether we like it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, Europe is not an island. We Europeans must engage in international politics, whether in the field of foreign policy, where we must work to prevent conflict, or in the sphere of internal security, to which you have referred, where we must play our part in a concerted effort to combat international crime. Lastly, we must rise to the challenge of global competition and ensure that our businesses and our economy can hold their own.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the preceding years, we shall try to ensure that the budget on the table in front of us is a tight one, even in the conditions I have just described. It must, however, also be adequate. We shall not let anyone cry ‘miser’ at those who advocate great prudence and thrift, nor shall we tolerate any accusations of extravagance against those who point out that more money is needed in particular areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In the process of drawing up this budget in the conditions I have described, which make it no easier to reach agreement, we shall continue to adhere to the line we have always taken in the past, pressing for the adoption of a tight but adequate budget, so that the public know that they can rely on the European Parliament to deal responsibly with budgetary matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Next year’s budget will be a difficult one, with the accession of ten new Member States, bringing with them nine new official languages. This will be a very hard test for EU administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States have to be included in the work of the EU as a whole. This means they also have to receive their rightful share of employees and officials to work in the EU’s different institutions. This is a massive recruitment and training exercise. The Commission’s request for 700 new posts is right, even if it is a huge number. At the same time, however, we have to guard against too much bureaucracy with regard to administration. The downward devolution of responsibility and power should continue, as should the clarification of personal accountability. Administration must move more in the direction of activity-based management, where what is most important is better productivity and cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">There should be special attention paid to improving internal security. This will mean, among other things, stepping up the fight against drugs and other international criminality, as well as illegal immigration. This will bring pressures for budget heading 3, ‘Internal Policies’, in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding structural policy, we must once and for all be in a position to reduce the figure for outstanding commitments. Regarding the structure of the budget, we have to improve its degree of informativeness: it must be clearly evident what the costs and achievements of individual policy areas are.
