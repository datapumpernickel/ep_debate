<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to inform the Honourable Member that the Commission Communication on food prices in Europe was presented to the Council at its session on 19 January 2009. This Communication follows up on a request by the June 2008 European Council to investigate the causes of the sharp increase in food prices following the even stronger rise in commodity prices.</p>
<p>The Communication reviews recent developments in agricultural commodities and food prices. It proposes, in particular, ways of improving the functioning of the food chain in Europe, setting out a work programme to improve its functioning. In addition, a need to balance the global supply and demand for food and to remove barriers in international trade is also, inter alia, noticed.</p>
<p>The Presidency considers that the Council's discussions were useful in giving Members of the Council the opportunity to exchange views on this important issue. During the course of the discussions, a number of views were expressed. Several delegations, for instance, raised the weak position of producers in the face of big retail chains and the need to reflect price decreases throughout the whole food supply chain.</p>
<p>Most delegations agreed on the need to monitor closely the market, and the Commission undertook to report back on this issue by the end of 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1048"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its concern about the continuation of the humanitarian crisis in the North-East of the Central African Republic (CAR). The Council is also aware of the need to create conditions in this area (CAR) which are favourable to the voluntary, secure and sustainable return of refugees and displaced persons, and to the reconstruction and the economic and social development of the region.</p>
<p>For this reason, the EU provides many different types of support to the Central African Republic, just as it does to Chad. The ESDP operation EUFOR Chad/RCA is one part of this multidimensional response. Action by the Commission in support of development cooperation, as well as the provision of humanitarian aid, offer additional support.</p>
<p>The EU operation EUFOR Chad/RCA had already made a considerable contribution to the stabilisation of the region, together with the UN mission MINURCAT as well as UNAMID in Darfur. EUFOR Chad/RCA in particular provided protection for refugees, displaced persons and humanitarian staff.</p>
<p>EUFOR Chad/RCA is a military bridging operation for twelve months and will end on 15 March 2009. The Council has underlined the importance of full deployment of the United Nations Mission in Chad and CAR (MINURCAT), approved by Resolution 1861 (2009) of the UN Security Council when the EUFOR mandate expires. Full deployment of MINURCAT is key to providing an effective response to the non military threats of banditry and crime.</p>
<p>Against this background, and having consulted the Central African authorities, the Council has insisted that all steps be taken to ensure that arrangements on the follow-up to the EU's operation be put in place, including through a United Nations operation, in accordance with Article 10 of Resolution 1778.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1051"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The fight against child labour is a core element of the European Union's human rights agenda and needs to be tackled at all levels and in different areas of action. The EU is pursuing a comprehensive approach to the elimination of all forms of child labour, covering the political, trade and development governance dimensions and actions with regard to the alleviation of poverty, the labour market, the social dialogue and social protection, with an emphasis on free and universal primary education.</p>
<p>The Czech Presidency intends to initiate discussions on a number of issues related to child protection. The Presidency will focus in particular on active police cooperation in searches for missing children, improved use of the Schengen Information System (SIS) for these purposes and joint action to combat illegal content on the Internet. Furthermore, the Czech Presidency will follow up on the activities of the French Presidency as well as on the conclusions of the Council concerning the Child Alert project. Child protection was the topic of an informal meeting of Justice and Home Affairs ministers in Prague on 15/16 January and will also be discussed at the ministerial conferences "Safer Internet for Children" and "Children Friendly Europe", both taking place in April.</p>
<p>As regards child labour, based on the conclusions of the GAERC from May 2008, the European Commission is working on a report aimed at outlining the existing measures available for combating child labour; CZ PRES is awaiting its results.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission plans to submit a revision of the Council framework Decision on combating the sexual exploitation of children and child pornography to the Council in March 2009. The Czech Presidency is prepared to launch actively the negotiations of the respective initiative, which aims to create a more effective instrument for fighting against the sexual criminality concerning children. Furthermore, under the Czech Presidency a criminal law conference on “Protection of vulnerable victims and their standing in criminal proceedings” will be held in March 2009 in Prague.</p>
<p>In the Human Rights context, the aim of the Czech Presidency will be to improve the cooperation and partnership of EU institutions with non-governmental organisations and to contribute to the increased effectiveness of the relevant financial tools of the EU. The evaluation of the renewed European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR) is expected to take place in 2009. EIDHR includes actions aimed at preventing the recruitment of children for armed conflicts and at encouraging their release and reintegration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1053"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council Presidency is engaged in regular ministerial meetings and summits at Head of State level, with a range of third countries, including the US, China and India. At these meetings topics of mutual interest, including financial services are discussed and a common understanding is sought, where possible. Nevertheless, in the absence of a proposal from the Commission the Council is not in a position to adopt any legislative act. The current financial crisis makes the meetings with partners on the global level utmost important.</p>
<p>As regards the relation to the US the importance of the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC) should be stressed. It was established in 2007 to oversee the EU-US framework on transatlantic economic integration, this covers i.a. integration of the financial markets.</p>
<p>In addition, for several years the European Commission has been developing regular dialogues in the area of financial services regulation and, in some cases, macroeconomic dialogues with key economic partners. These started with the EU-US regulatory dialogue in 2002 and the EU-China dialogue followed in 2005 and the EU-India dialogue in 2006.</p>
<p>The Council does not participate in these dialogues, but monitors progress through the Financial Services Committee and the Economic and Financial Committee. Where appropriate the Council is briefed by the Commission on progress and has an informal exchange of views.</p>
<p>Finally, I recall that the G 20, including the US, China and India, held an initial meeting in Washington on November 15, 2008 to meet the serious challenges to the world economy and financial markets posed by the current crisis. The Council was represented in this meeting by the Presidency. The G 20 Heads of State agreed an ambitious action plan for measures to be taken both in the short and medium term to improve international financial regulation. This process will continue - the next meeting is already planned for April 2 this year - and this work will probably set the basis for the most important international platform for better regulation and supervision of the global financial services market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1055"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The recent Russia-Ukraine gas dispute has underlined the importance of strengthening the Union's energy policy. The CZ PRES has placed energy on the top of its three main political priorities long before the vulnerability of EU in terms of energy dependency was once again highlighted by the disruption of supplies. As Prime Minister Topolánek said clearly two weeks ago in Budapest at the Nabucco summit, the common energy policy for Europe is an ultimate need. It is now the task of the CZ PRES to use the momentum and political will generated by the crisis to bring the most pressing short-, medium- and long-term measures into being to prevent major supply disruptions in the future, and improve our ability to cope with the consequences should the need arise. An Extraordinary meeting of the Energy Council took place on 12 January and identified a set of measures that need to be taken in this respect.</p>
<p>As for long-term strategic measures – diversification of supply routes, suppliers and sources is an answer. Be it Nordstream, Nabucco, Southstream or LNG terminals, diversification is beneficial in terms in lowering our energy dependency and thus strengthening the bargaining position of EU vis-à-vis its partners.</p>
<p>As for medium-term measures, missing energy infrastructure and interconnections should be identified and work on them should be accelerated. European internal energy market will never work unless crossborder transfers are easily possible. The same goes for European solidarity. Problems of energy islands need to be tackled. The precondition for that is to mobilise necessary financial resources, i.e. via EIB or EBRD. The Presidency will strive that priority is given to energy infrastructure projects within the frame of the European economic recovery plan.</p>
<p>Last but not least, short-terms emergency measures should enable us to assist Member States in need. The examples of Slovakia and Bulgaria pointed sharp to the necessity to enhance bilateral and regional solidarity arrangements.</p>
<p>Several other useful measures have been identified, such as improved transparency as regards gas flows, demand and storage volumes both in member states and supply /transit countries followed by the installation of the reliable metering system. The Early Warning Mechanism should be assessed and extended to the transit countries.</p>
<p>The revision of the Directive on the Safeguard of Security of natural gas supply can play important role too. All these measures will strengthen EU and thus enable us to talk with one voice to our energy suppliers.</p>
<p>The Union's energy policy is based on the Action Plan adopted by the European Council in March 2007. Work on implementing this Action Plan is underway. It will be further enhanced in the light of the Commission's Second Strategic Energy Review which was submitted to the Council in November 2008, and which focuses in particular on energy security and the need for solidarity.</p>
<p>The Council will review the situation on 19 February and decide on further concrete measures set out in the Second Strategic Energy Review, as well as follow up on the measures agreed on 12 January. This work will provide the basis for the European Council in March to agree on the responses which are necessary if the Union will pursue the aim of developing a common energy policy and in particular if it is to enhance its energy security.</p>
<p>Another important element of the common energy policy is energy efficiency. In this area, the Council will address the various legislative proposals which the Commission has recently submitted, together with the Second Strategic Energy Review, namely the recast proposal on the energy performance of buildings, the recast proposal on energy efficiency labelling of energy related products, and the proposal on the fuel efficiency labelling of tyres.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1057"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is committed to respect fully the principle of subsidiarity.

<p>In considering any proposal for action at the Community level, the Council examines not just the content of the proposal, but also assesses whether the proposal respects the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. The Council will not agree to any proposal where it considers that this is not the case.</p>
<p>This is no different in the areas of education and social affairs and private law highlighted by the Honourable Member. This is moreover the case as, in both these areas, the treaties provide that action by the Community is aimed at supporting and complementing the activities of the Member States. In particular, the Council is vigilant to ensure that Community action in the area of education respects the responsibility of the Member States for the content of teaching and the organisation of the educational systems and their cultural and linguistic diversity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1059"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council attaches importance to territorial cohesion as one of key aspects of Cohesion policy aiming at addressing territorial imbalances in economic, social and environmental development within the European Union. It recognises the importance of Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013 in enabling Member States to take into account the territorial dimension. The Commission’s Green Paper on Territorial Cohesion of 6 October 2008 is currently under the public discussion, so the Council has not yet reached a final position on its content. Preliminary outputs of this public debate will be presented during the informal meeting of Ministers in charge of regional development taking place in Mariánské Lázně (the Czech Republic) in April 2009.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, an interim report was drawn up by the French Presidency and is publicly available<a href="#defann_7_1" name="refann_7_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The main findings of this interim report were to confirm broad support for the following broad objectives of:</p>
<p>- a reduction in disparities between regions in terms of development;</p>
<p>- sustainable and balanced development of the whole of EU territory, taking into account the specific characteristics of individual regions so as to ensure fair living conditions throughout the Union;</p>
<p>- promotion of the principle that each territory should have a minimum level of access to major transport infrastructure, new information and communication technologies, and the main services of general interest such as health and education;</p>
<p>- support for the need for both Community and national sectoral policies to take greater account of their varying impact on territories, and for better links with other European policies with a territorial impact.</p>
<p>However, according to the report, some delegations expressed their concerns about particular aspects of the Green Paper.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to follow the issue closely, and in particular as a follow-up of the public debate on the Commission's Green paper. It will be able to adopt a formal position once the Commission comes forward with any proposals in the light of this debate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of labelling of origin is currently under discussion in both the Council and European Parliament on the basis of the European Commission's Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers<a href="#defann_8_1" name="refann_8_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In accordance with current Community legislation, origin labelling is required</p>
<p>- in cases where consumers might be misled on the true origin or provenance of the foodstuffs, and</p>
<p>- in application of specific rules such as those for fruit and vegetables, beef, wine, honey, fish, and imported poultry.</p>
<p>With respect to the labelling of the country of origin or place of provenance of a food, the basic requirement in the proposed new legislation remains the same. Labelling would therefore remain voluntary, unless failure to provide such information might mislead the consumer. In this case labelling becomes mandatory. The Commission proposal also aims to clarify the conditions under which Member States may adopt national rules on origin labelling.</p>
<p>This approach is based on the view that food labelling, including indications on origin, is primarily an instrument of consumer information. Origin labelling cannot by itself be regarded as a tool for contributing to food safety, as it does not address the causes of contaminations such as that referred to by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>All food and feed legally placed on the market in the European Union must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from. In order to safeguard consumer confidence, this basic principle must continue to be the cornerstone of EU food safety policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU has demonstrated its commitment to support the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) through the "EU Agenda for Action on MDGs", endorsed by the European Council in June 2008. This Agenda for Action sets a number of milestones which will contribute to this objective, and provides examples of EU action in support of the commitments already made by the EU.</p>
<p>The EU Agenda identifies priority actions in key areas such as education, environment, health, water and sanitation, agriculture, pro-poor growth, infrastructure and gender equality. Action is also needed to enhance the integration of cross-cutting issues in all sectors. The EU has proposed to its partners in development to share this Agenda for Action, which should also be taken into account in the context of the joint Africa-EU Strategy and its different partnerships adopted at the Lisbon Summit. Ownership of the agenda by partner countries will represent a key factor in ensuring its success.</p>
<p>In light of progress made in some countries and areas, the EU is convinced that all the MDGs can still be attained in all regions of the world, provided that concerted and sustained action be taken between now and 2015. However, the EU is seriously concerned about the effects of the trend in many countries and regions, in particular sub-Saharan Africa, in terms of achievement of the MDGs.</p>
<p>New challenges have emerged that may undermine the achievement of the MDGs: global financial crisis, high and volatile food and commodity prices. The emergence of new actors has made the aid architecture more complex. The priority given to combating climate change and to strengthening developing countries’ capacity to adapt has been continuously growing, leading to the new increased collective effort by way of additional aid. A renewed commitment from the international community in support of the Monterrey Consensus and the readiness to take further action are required if these new challenges are to be tackled.</p>
<p>In its Guidelines for the participation in the Doha Conference on Financing for Development, the EU stated that the poorest countries and countries in situation of fragility should not be the victims of the current crisis, which must not undermine the implementation of commitments in support of the Monterrey consensus and the achievement of the MDGs.</p>
<p>Against this background, the EU will maintain its leading role in providing financial support towards achievement of the MDGs including to maintain its ODA commitments and will make every effort to ensure an ambitious action oriented response by the wider international community. The Council will discuss these issues in detail during the GAERC meeting in May 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1068"></a>

<p>The respect and promotion of human rights and of the freedom of opinion and expression is a core element of the EU's external relations policy.</p>
<p>In its conclusions of 23 June 2008, the Council called upon the Cuban Government to improve the human rights situation by, inter alia, releasing unconditionally all political prisoners, including those who were detained and sentenced in 2003. It also called on the Cuban Government to facilitate access of international humanitarian organizations to Cuban prisons. The Council has also "reaffirmed its determination to pursue a dialogue with the Cuban authorities as well as with representatives of civil society and democratic opposition, in accordance with EU policies, in order to promote respect for human rights and real progress towards a pluralist democracy. The EU will continue to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, and will press the Cuban Government to grant freedom of information and expression including access to the Internet.</p>
<p>The dialogue with the Cuban authorities was re-opened at the ministerial meeting of 16 October 2008. It provided an opportunity for the EU to outline to the Cuban Government its views on democracy, universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. At the same time the EU maintains its contacts with the democratic opposition.</p>
<p>The evolution of human rights and of the freedom of opinion in Cuba will be an important element in the evaluation of the EU's relations with Cuba including the effectiveness of the political dialogue process.</p>
<p>As concerns individual cases, the Council follows them closely and raises them with the Cuban authorities at every available opportunity.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1070"></a>

<p>The issue of electoral participation is a matter for each individual Member State and information campaigns concerning elections to the European Parliament are organised in each Member State in accordance with national legislation. It would not therefore be appropriate for the Council to take a position on this issue nor to undertake any particular initiatives.</p>
<p>However the European Parliament, Council and Commission in their political declaration of 22 October 2008, entitled "Communicating Europe in Partnership" underlined the utmost importance of improving communication generally on EU issues in order to enable European citizens to exercise their right to participate in the democratic life of the Union.</p>
<p>The Council, for its part, in its conclusions on “Communicating Europe in Partnership", has pointed out that “occasions such as direct elections to the European Parliament provide good opportunities to enhance communication with citizens on EU issues and to inform and encourage their participation in the political debate”.</p>
<p>In accordance with that declaration, the Council recognises the importance of addressing the communication challenge on EU issues in partnership between Member States and the other institutions to ensure effective communication with, and objective information to, the widest possible audience at the appropriate level.</p>
<p>Under the declaration the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission highlighted the “European Parliament elections” as one of the inter-institutional communication priorities for 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0002"></a>

<p>On 8 December 2008 the Council of the European Union (EU) adopted a text (17041/08) setting out its conclusions on strengthening bilateral relations between the EU and its Mediterranean partners; this text upgrades EU-Israel relations, despite the fact that Israel had imposed a blockade lasting months on the Gaza Strip and extended settlements and stepped up violence against Palestinians.

<p>In December 2008 the EU reaffirmed its policy of stepping up its bilateral relations with Israel, in the context of the adoption of a new instrument, planned to replace the present Action Plan from April 2009. The guidelines for reinforcing the political dialogue with Israel include: more bilateral summits at all levels; more frequent Israeli access to the Union's Political and Security Committee; facilitation of the hearing of Israeli experts by the Council's groups and committees; systematisation and enlargement of the informal strategic consultations; encouragement of Israeli alignment with the CFSP; enabling of cooperation at ground level in the area of the Union's European Security and Defence Policy; and encouragement of Israel's participation and involvement in multilateral bodies such as the UN. Israel's ambassador to the EU has now stated that there is no question of any reconsideration of that decision and the associated process and that Israel's and the EU's positions are currently convergent.</p>
<p>In view of the renewal by Israel of its brutal and unjustified attacks on the Palestinian people in the Gaza strip, the horrendous crimes perpetrated by the Israeli army, and Israel's total disregard for international law and human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, can the Council state why it has not issued a condemnation of Israel and suspended the agreements with that country and any process tending to reinforce those agreements?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This decision, which excludes Israeli citizens of Arab origin from political life, deprives the Arab community in Israel of their democratic civil rights and is a flagrant violation of civil liberties and the right to freedom of expression. This ban on Arab parties is part and parcel of the Israeli Government's criminal war against the Palestinian people and the brutal slaughter of thousands of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza Strip, including hundreds of children.</p>
<p>In the light of Israel's policy, which is in blatant violation of international law and democratic freedoms, does the Council condemn Israel's actions and will it suspend the EU's association agreement with Israel?</p>
<p>NJoint answer</p>
<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council fully shares the preoccupations of the Honourable Member on the dire situation of civilians in the Gaza strip.</p>
<p>The European Union deeply deplores the loss of life during this conflict, particularly the civilian casualties. The Council has reminded all parties to the conflict, most recently in the conclusions of its meeting on 26 January, to fully respect human rights and comply with their obligations under international humanitarian law. The Council continues to raise its serious human rights concerns with Israel in the framework of all high level meetings, most recently during the EU Foreign Ministers' dinner with Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni on 21 January 2009.</p>
<p>The issues of the EU-Israel Association agreement and of the upgrading of the relations with Israel, raised by the Honourable Members, were not addressed in the conclusions of the Council meeting of 26 January. In general, the Council considers it vital to keep all channels of diplomatic and political contact open and that positive persuasion and dialogue is the most effective approach for conveying messages from the EU.</p>
<p>Concerning the specific issue of the ban on two Arab parties taking part in elections in Israel, the Council has taken note of a decision of the Supreme Court of the State of Israel which on 21 January 2009 overturned a decision by the Central Elections Committee banning the "National Democratic Assembly - Balad" and the "United Arab List and Arab Movement for Change" political party lists from standing in the upcoming elections to the Israeli parliament (Knesset) scheduled to take place on 10 February 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Efforts to increase attendance at school in the developing world have had considerable success, but the increase in the number of pupils in schools has not been matched by an increase in the number of teachers. In many classrooms in developing countries, the pupil-to-teacher ratio is often 100:1, or even higher. Current International Monetary Fund conditions attached to loans to developing countries place restrictions on public sector spending as a whole, and also impose a ceiling limit for teachers' wages. Millions of school children are not getting the education they need because fiscal rules prevent developing countries from employing enough teachers.</p>

<p>The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council fully shares the concerns of the Honourable Member about the low number of teachers – and other key professionals such as doctors or nurses – in many developing countries.</p>
<p>To achieve universal primary education by 2015 is the second of the Millennium Development Goals. In line with this objective, the Union has identified education as one of the multi-dimensional aspects of poverty eradication in the European Consensus on Development. Where circumstances permit, the EU also encourages the use of general or sectoral budget support for education budgets.</p>
<p>The issue of lack of teachers and their low wages is a particular problem for developing countries, where the empowerment of teachers is critical to the provision of education in general. In accordance with the principle of ownership, it is for the partner countries to establish their own development priorities and to allocate the share of the budget to be dedicated to education accordingly. At the same time, teachers' wages should be set at a reasonable level in comparison with the average national wages within the public sector.</p>
<p>As far as the IMF is concerned, the Member States of the Union are just some of the 185 countries which are members. Most of these are developing countries, which of course also have a say on how the IMF operates. In the event that member countries experience difficulties in financing their balance of payments, the IMF is a fund that can be tapped to facilitate recovery. A policy program supported by financing is designed by the national authorities in close cooperation with the IMF, and continued financial support is conditional on the effective implementation of this program.</p>
<p>The IMF also provides low-income countries with loans at a concessional interest rate through the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0010"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council, together as co-legislator with the European Parliament, adopted on 18 December 2007 Directive 2007/65/EC (the "Audiovisual Media Services Directive") which updated the legal framework for television broadcasting and audiovisual media services in the EU<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Article 3b of this Directive prohibits broadcasts inciting hatred on grounds of race, sex, religion or nationality.</p>
<p>The scope of this Directive, and its predecessor the "Television without Frontiers Directive" can include programmes broadcast by organisations established outside the EU, such as Al Manar and Al Aqsa, but it is necessary that they use satellite facilities "appertaining to a Member State". It is on this basis, the Council understands, that the regulatory authority of France issued an order in January 2009 against the broadcasting of Al Aqsa on Eutelsat. However, the situation of Nilesat and Arabsat, on which Al Manar is still available, different due to the non-usage of EU satellite facilities. An appropriate EU response is therefore more difficult to establish.</p>
<p>Faced with this situation, the Council is aware that the Commission is exploring ways to highlight this issue in its political dialogue with both Egypt and the Lebanon. The Council will similarly seek to ensure that this question is addressed in its dealings with these countries.</p>
<p>Radicalisation and recruitment has been one of the highly important EU security issues for several years. Specific EU documents have been prepared and approved to deal with this phenomenon, including strategic documents like the European Union Counter Terrorism Strategy and its Action Plan, the EU Strategy to counter radicalisation and recruitment and its Action Plan.</p>
<p>The EU Counter-Terrorism Coordinator has been encouraging the development of measures to counter radicalisation in Europe and elsewhere, which is one of the main threats facing Europe as recognised in the Report on the Implementation of the European Security Strategy delivered to the last European Summit. A revised strategy and action plan to counter radicalisation was adopted by the JHA Council on 27/28 November 2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In 1997, the European Union recommended that Russia sign a border agreement with Estonia without delay. On 18 May 2005, the States signed a border agreement from which Russia withdrew its signature because the Russian authorities did not agree with the unilateral declaration added by the Estonian Parliament referring to the Tartu Peace Treaty of 1920 and the occupation after the Second World War. At the end of August 2006, Russia proposed to Estonia that negotiations begin on new border agreements in which it would be stated that there were no territorial claims between the parties and that all previous agreements dealing with border matters ceased to apply. In an interview given to the news agency Interfax on 25 December 2007, Estonia's Foreign Minister, Urmas Paet, called on the Russian authorities to ratify the border agreement; at the same time, Estonia welcomed the entry into force of the border agreements between Russia and Latvia on 18 December 2007. Any progress towards placing relations between the EU and Russia on a firm footing in the form of treaties is in the interest of the whole EU and of Estonia too. The entry into force of the border agreement between Latvia and Russia could encourage Russia also to proceed with the border agreement between Estonia and Russia.</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU's approach towards Cuba was set out in the Council conclusions adopted on 23 June 2008. Discussions in the Council on how to pursue the implementation of these conclusions continue. At a ministerial meeting on 16 October in Paris, the EU and Cuba agreed on the resumption of a comprehensive political dialogue, including political, economic, scientific, cultural and especially human rights issues, on a reciprocal, non-discriminatory and result-orientated basis. The Council will continue to pursue the objectives set out in the 1996 Common Position and its two-pronged approach: dialogue with the Cuban authorities and with all sectors of Cuban society in order to promote respect for human rights and real progress towards pluralist democracy. The Common Position remains at the core of the EU policy towards Cuba and in particular insistence on a real and measurable improvement of the human rights situation from the Cubans and is the unconditional release of all political prisoners.</p>
<p>The Council continues to monitor closely the situation in Venezuela, and pursues its policy of contacts at all levels with the authorities and the institutions as well as with the opposition in order to contribute to a national dialogue and to prevent moves by any side which might endanger the stability of the country or erode democracy and the state of law. This strategy seems to be fruitful. Both sides in Venezuela acknowledged the value of our contributions.</p>
<p>With regard to Colombia, the Council welcomes and supports continued clear improvements in the security and respect of human rights in the country, including through the recent adoption of legislation. At the same time, the Council remains concerned at the situation in Colombia, and in particular at crimes, such as the recent murder of the husband of Mrs. Quilcué, defender of the rights of the indigenous population. The Colombian authorities have regularly been urged to provide the appropriate means for a successful implementation of the justice and peace law. The Council also reiterates its call to the illegally armed groups to release all their prisoners, to end violence and to respect human rights. The EU will continue its very regular discussions with the Colombian authorities, and will maintain its support for the disarmament, justice and peace process.</p>
<p>It is premature to speculate on the approach of the new US administration towards Latin America. However, the early announcements on the lifting of restrictions on family and other visits as well as on the transfer of money in relation to Cuba are encouraging. These changes respond clearly to requests by Cubans both on the island as well as in the US. These measures are in line with the EU's approach, as set out in the Common Position of 1996. The Council intends to maintain a regular dialogue with the US on Latin America.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0033"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the February 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that currently the situation in Gaza has to be improved by the full implementation of UN SCR. 1860 by both parties, which implies foremost the free and unhindered passage of humanitarian aid to and within Gaza. A durable ceasefire is needed which has to be based on a mechanism taking into account Israel’s security needs by preventing arms smuggling on the one hand, and enabling reconstruction and economic development in Gaza by opening border crossings on the other hand.</p>
<p>The Council believes, however, that the Gaza crisis has to be seen in its broader context. On the basis of existing policy lines, as elaborated in successive Council conclusions, the Council pursues an active policy in support of both addressing the urgent challenges in the aftermath of the Gaza war as well as the medium-term actions required to renew the prospects for peace in the region. In this regard the Council believes inner-Palestinian dialogue and the resumption of the peace process to be crucial elements.</p>
<p>The Palestinian Authority has proved to be a reliable and efficient partner, preventing further escalation of the situation in the West Bank. The Council strongly encourages inter-Palestinian reconciliation behind President Mahmoud Abbas which is key for peace, stability and development and supports the mediation efforts of Egypt and the Arab League in this respect.</p>
<p>The Council is convinced that peace in the region can only be achieved by the conclusion of the peace process leading to an independent, democratic, contiguous and viable Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, living side by side with Israel in peace and security. In order to maintain this perspective the Council reiterates its call on both parties to comply with their obligations under the Roadmap. Considering the Arab Peace Initiative to be a solid and appropriate basis for a comprehensive resolution of the Israeli-Arab conflict, the EU is committed to work with the Quartet, the new US-administration and Arab partners to this end. The Council welcomes the immediate nomination and engagement of the new US-special envoy for the Middle East, Mitchell, in the region and is ready to closely cooperate with him.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0037"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has warmly congratulated President Obama on his inauguration. The Commission welcomes his initial moves to close the detention camp at Guantanamo, reinforce US engagement in the Middle East peace process, and reach out to the Islamic world.</p>
<p>The recovery of the global economy will be the top priority in the months to come. The Commission must make sure that EU and US policies are mutually reinforcing, and boost the transatlantic economy by perpetuating and improving the Transatlantic Economic Council. The Commission should co-operate to counter the resurgence of protectionist voices. The Commission wants to work closely with the US on climate change, above all to engage the emerging economies and achieve real progress in the multilateral negotiations before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The Commissioner for External Relations and Neighbourhood Policy has written to Secretary of State Clinton setting out the Commission's views on the immediate external relations priorities: a sustainable ceasefire in Gaza, the need to address state-building in Afghanistan in its regional context, and how to promote stability in the EU’s Eastern neighbourhood. The Commission must also promote, together, an equitable architecture of international co-operation that embraces the newly emerging powers.</p>
<p>Efforts to set the EU-US relationship on a new footing will build up towards the next EU-US Summit in mid-2009. Once the Commission has established a good dialogue with the new US counterparts on the priority issues, the Commission will also be taking a look at whether the institutional framework of EU-US relations – the New Transatlantic Agenda of 1995 – needs to be updated so as better to serve our mutual objectives.</p>
<p>The EU will have to live up to US expectations by demonstrating that the EU can be an effective partner. The EU must speak with one voice. In that respect, a rapid entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty would deliver a major boost to transatlantic relations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1060"></a>

<p>2. Social Affairs</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission welcomed the opening for signature of the international Convention on Cluster Munitions by Member States of the United Nations (UN) in Oslo on 3 December 2008. In particular, the Commission applauded the immediate adherence to the Convention by 95 of the 193 UN Member States and the swift ratification by four States. This is indeed promising and the Commission hopes that all countries, both those affected by cluster munitions and users and producers of these weapons, will sign and ratify the Convention as soon as possible, so that it can enter into force without delay.</p>
<p>The Convention banning cluster munitions is a milestone towards enhancing the security of victims of conflicts in many regions across the world. The Commission sees the Convention on Cluster Munitions primarily as a humanitarian instrument. At the same time, the Commission realises that such a Convention also has disarmament and defence implications for States, areas on which the European Community and thus the Commission have no specific competence. The question of signing and ratifying this Convention is up to the Member States.</p>
<p>In the context of its development co-operation and assistance the Commission does have an important role to play in supporting effective implementation of the Convention.

<p>(EN) The Commission follows political and human rights developments closely in both Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova. Respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, in particular, is an essential element in our relationship with both these countries. The Commission has engaged extensively in support of these issues through political dialogue and financial and technical co-operation, including support to civil society organisations. The Commission has not hesitated to express concern where progress in needed, and has repeatedly underlined that the deepening of the EU’s relationship with both countries is dependent upon their progress in meeting international human rights commitments.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently negotiating an ambitious Association Agreement with Ukraine, and planning to start negotiations on a new enhanced agreement with the Republic of Moldova shortly. Both these agreements will contribute to locking in internal reforms in these countries, by way of binding arrangements. They will allow the Commission, in particular, to strengthen our co-operation further on human rights issues. Furthermore, the Eastern Partnership proposal foresees a multilateral track which the Commission expects will contribute significantly to increasing stability in the region. For example it will provide increased opportunities to coordinate our efforts on the Transnistria conflict and on bilateral issues of contention between Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova issues, such as the demarcation of their common border.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0008"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid travelled to the region last week and on Monday 26 January, announced €32 million emergency assistance to the population in Gaza, to be used for food, shelters, health, and psychological support.</p>
<p>Already earlier this month, the Commission has provided more than €10 million, in response to the humanitarian situation in Gaza. This comes on top of more than €73 million of such aid during 2008. It is focused on food, emergency shelter repairs and further medical support. These are all areas identified as priorities in the United Nations Relief and Work Agency's (UNRWA) Flash Appeal launched on 30 December 2008.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as you probably know, the Commission provides all the fuel to the Gaza power plant. For the sake of better coordination, the Commission has placed a full time official in the Joint Liaison Centre set up by the Israeli government, to help with the delivery of humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The Commission will also continue to be a predictable donor to UNRWA. This year, the Commission will again provide an early contribution of €66 million to the Agency’s General Fund, and will top up the above amounts with humanitarian and food assistance, as appropriate.</p>
<p>During the coming weeks, the Commission will be called upon to contribute to the emergency relief effort, and later on also to reconstruction work in Gaza. In this respect, the Commission expects that an international donors’ conference, tentatively planned in Egypt on 28 February, will focus on the most urgent needs of the population. The Commission intends to play a major role throughout all this process.</p>
<p>As to your second question on a possible suspension of the Association Agreement with Israel, the Commission recognises the frustration of those who feel that things have gone from bad to worse in particular over the last year. On balance, however, it is the Commission’s judgement (which reflects the views of the EU Foreign Ministers meeting in the External Relations Council) that measures such as suspension of our Association Agreement would make the Israeli authorities less rather than more responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting settlement.</p>
<p>With regard to the upgrading process, the Commission always stated that this is being influenced by developments on the ground. For the moment, the Commission is entirely dedicated to pursue another priority, i.e. the situation in Gaza, especially after the temporary ceasefire of 18 January. The population in Gaza has immediate basic needs the Commission will have to cater for.</p>
<p>The Commission considers therefore that the time is not right to deal with this question and will come back to it when circumstances allow us to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0009"></a>

<p>(EN) Respect for human rights is one of the fundamental values of the European Union, and an essential element of the EU’s foreign policy. Consequently, the Commission attaches great importance to the protection of human rights in its relations with Israel.</p>
<p>In its meetings with Israeli authorities, the Commission expresses its concerns with regard to the human rights situation of the Palestinians, and in particular in Gaza, and continues to remind Israel of its obligations under international humanitarian law.</p>
<p>On balance, however, it is the Commission’s judgement (which reflects the views of the EU Foreign Ministers meeting in the External Relations Council) that measures such as suspension of our Association Agreement would make the Israeli authorities less rather than more responsive to the efforts of the international community to promote a lasting settlement.</p>
<p>This being said, the Commission is following closely the investigations into the conduct of both parties during the most recent conflict which are currently being carried out.</p>
<p>In response to the outbreak of the Gaza crisis, EU Foreign Ministers held an emergency meeting in Paris on 30 December to develop proposals - the Paris Declaration - to bring the conflict to an end. Shortly after the Council meeting, the EU Troika to the region with the objective of achieving an immediate cessation of hostilities.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the crisis, and under the instructions of the Commissioner for External Relations and European Neighbourhood Policy, the Commission has concentrated all its contacts and discussions with Israel on the best way to deal with the crisis. Meetings on other topics have actually been put on hold due to the priority given to the Gaza issue. This has been explained to the Israeli authorities who have understood that Gaza takes precedent to any other matter for discussion at the moment.</p>
<p>Following the establishment of a temporary ceasefire, the Commission is now working to make this ceasefire sustainable. At the same time, the Commission is contributing to improving the humanitarian situation of the Palestinian population, and is enabling the Gaza power plant to operate, however insufficiently.</p>
<p>Last week’s General Affairs and External Relations Council decided to develop an EU work plan. This will focus first and foremost on immediate humanitarian relief for the population of Gaza, and will include support to the prevention of illicit trafficking in arms and ammunition, the sustained re-opening of crossing points, rehabilitation and reconstruction and the resumption of the peace process.</p>
<p>The Commission's priority in its relations with Israel at the moment remains to be Gaza and in particular questions of access and provision of humanitarian aid. For all this matters, dialogue with Israel is essential.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0019"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. The Strategic Partnership between the EU, Latin America and the Caribbean - which will be celebrating this year its 10<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary - is articulated on the following objectives: intense political dialogue, the strengthening of democratic governance and the respect of human rights, support to integration processes including the establishment of a network of association agreements, and extensive cooperation to reduce poverty, social inequalities and improve educational levels.</p>
<p>These objectives are constantly adapted to new developments and global challenges, such as the impact of the current financial and economic crisis, the urgent need to tackle climate change and to address energy security.</p>
<p>The Commission will make use of forthcoming meetings, such as the Ministerial Meeting between the European Union and the Rio Group in Prague in May 2009, and preparations for the next Latin American, Caribbean and EU Summit (in 2010 in Spain) to address these issues.</p>
<p>Regarding Venezuela, our objective is to strengthen relations and to establish more regular, open, constructive and structured dialogue on areas of common interest through the development of the economic dialogue and the bilateral cooperation (40 million Euros earmarked for 2007-20013 for two priorities: modernization of the Venezuelan state and diversification of its economy).</p>
<p>Regarding Cuba, following the Council Conclusions in 2008, development cooperation has been resumed between the EC and Cuba. The EC cooperation will, in the short term, be done on an ad hoc basis and channelled through the UN agencies and European and local NGOs. One of the main objectives of this cooperation will be to support the efforts of reconstruction and rehabilitation after the passage of the hurricanes in 2008.</p>
<p>Cuba is the only country in Latin America and the Caribbean with whom the EU does not have a contractual framework. The Commission hopes that in the medium term it will be possible to normalise the relations with Cuba.</p>
<p>2. The Commission is offering the Colombian Governement every possible assistance and solidarity in its efforts to secure the release of the hostages held by the FARC. However, in view of past experience, the Colombian Government has decided on this occasion to limit the involvement of other countries or Vatican institutions, and the Commission must respect this decision.</p>
<p>As regards the peace-building process, the Commission is dedicating 70% of our aid (more than EUR 160 million) specifically to peace-building, alternative and sustainable development and the fight against drugs. Furthermore, 20% of this assistance will be focused on enforcing the rule of law in Colombia, through judicial institutions and by promoting human rights, among other things. Without question, building peace and stability remains our primary objective in Colombia.</p>
<p>3. The Commission maintains good and fluent contacts with the US Administration on Latin American issues. We have a regular political dialogue (twice a year) at the High Official EU troika level with the US, dealing specifically with Latin America and the Caribbean. We are convinced that we will continue this constructive dialogue and cooperation with the new Obama Administration.</p>
<p>President Obama has not yet made substantive statements on the future relationship with Latin America. But the first indications are positive, as demonstrated by the meeting he had a few weeks ago in his capacity as President elect, with President Calderon from Mexico. We have to wait to know more about President Obama’s strategy and engagement towards the region. Possible fields in which we could work for an enhanced cooperation between the US, the EU and Latin America could be the fight against drugs and organised crime.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1047"></a>

<p>(FR) Social progress and the protection of workers’ rights are objectives that have always been central to the development of the European Union. That is why the policies contained in the existing Treaties on social affairs and the protection of workers’ rights have been strengthened in the Treaty of Lisbon and the decisive role of the social partners is very clearly recognised in the text.</p>
<p>Obviously, the context in which we are evolving determines the measures required in order to secure these objectives. Hence, the fundamental developments in our society, such as globalisation, development of new technologies, demographic changes and climate change have transformed the nature of social issues. These changes have prompted the European Union to establish the Lisbon Strategy, to adapt legislation, the European Social Fund (ESF) or the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF), to develop the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) in order to continue to ensure that the European Union’s social values are appropriately maintained, while at the same time adjusting our instruments in a dynamic way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in July 2008, the Commission presented its renewed social agenda in order to adapt and strengthen our European social model in the face of all these changes. We have to give everyone the same chances to succeed in life through access to education, to health or social services, take action to support those people who are most disadvantaged, on the basis of solidarity, encourage social dialogue through the revised directive on European works councils and improve protection of the rights of temporary workers.</p>
<p>Today the whole of Europe is affected by an economic crisis which has led the Union to take exceptional measures with an economic recovery plan that clearly demonstrates the importance it attaches to protecting the most basic of workers’ rights, which is that of access to employment. Furthermore, the Commission has proposed extending the scope and increasing the flexibility of the eligibility criteria of the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund in order to enable it to give more effective help to workers affected by the crisis. At this stage and beyond these financial measures, it has clearly become urgent to carry through the reforms in progress in relation to flexicurity, active inclusion and pension schemes.</p>
<p>This context of crisis, therefore, only strengthens the Commission in its pursuit of social progress as well as the protection of workers’ rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1058"></a>

<p>(EN) The report to which the Honourable Member refers was drafted by the Danish Centre for Human Rights at the Commission's request.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that multiple discrimination is a social reality which should be addressed in an appropriate manner. However, the body of the proposal for a Directive implementing the principle of equal treatment between persons irrespective of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted by the Commission on 2 July 2008 contains no explicit provision prohibiting multiple discrimination.</p>
<p>There are two reasons for this. First, the proposal concerns discrimination on grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. Introducing a clause on multiple discrimination on other grounds too(such as gender or racial or ethnic origin) could be seen as going beyond the remit of the Directive. Alternatively, if multiple discrimination concerned only the four grounds of discrimination covered by the draft Directive, then such major forms of multiple discrimination as those involving gender, or racial or ethnic origin would not be tackled. Secondly, when it was preparing the abovementioned proposal, the Commission considered that this issue deserved further reflection.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposed that the non-discrimination governmental expert group set up recently should work on the issue of multiple discrimination. The tasks of the group, which was established by the Commission decision of 2 July 2008<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, are:</p>
<p>- to establish cooperation between the relevant Member State authorities and the Commission on issues relating to the promotion of equality and the fight against discrimination based on racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation;</p>
<p>to monitor the development of EU and national policies in this field; and</p>
<p>to foster the exchange of experience and good practice on issues of common interest relating to non-discrimination and the promotion of equality.</p>
<p>At the group's first meeting in November 2008, the Commission agreed with the group that it would address the issue of multiple discrimination. The Commission has also asked the European Network of Legal Experts in the field of Gender Equality to draft a report on the legal aspects of multiple discrimination with a specific focus on the gender dimension. That report is expected to be completed by June 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) It must be stated straightaway that the Commission does not have the information to which the honourable Member refers and according to which businesses, during this period of economic crisis, are apparently in the process of reducing costs, on a large scale, in the area of health and safety at work.</p>
<p>With regard to the honourable Member’s concerns about the fact that cost cutting could lead to lower standards, it must be emphasised that at European Union level, the provisions relating to health and safety at work – that is those in the framework Directive 89/391/EEC and its specific directives – are legally binding. These directives must be transposed and implemented by Member States in their own national legal systems.</p>
<p>Consequently, any potential reduction in the standard of health and safety for workers in workplaces could not under any circumstances bring these standards below the minimum level required by the Community directives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission and the Bilbao Agency for Safety and Health at Work are constantly striving, even during this period of economic crisis, to make employers aware of the fact that, in economic terms, businesses that invest in health and safety for their workers achieve measurable results: a reduction in the cost of absenteeism, increased workers’ motivation and improved productivity and business competitiveness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0005"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to the Community provisions on the coordination of social security schemes as contained in Regulations (EEC) Nos 1408/71 and 574/72. In accordance with those provisions, a person who is solely employed in Denmark but resides in Sweden would normally be entitled to social security benefits in Denmark on equal terms with persons employed and residing in that country. A frontier worker would be entitled to receive sickness benefits in kind either in Denmark or in Sweden, as he or she chooses. However, the obligation to pay sickness cash benefits, which also covers sick pay from the employer (for example in the event of an accident that occurs while the worker is commuting), would fall on the Danish social security system. It would consequently be the employer's obligation to pay sick pay to the employee, even where he or she resides in Sweden.</p>
<p>According to the Commission's information, the way Denmark applies the coordinating regulations does not appear to be in compliance with Community law. This matter has been brought to the attention of the Swedish authorities who have written to their Danish colleagues with a view to resolving the matter.</p>

<p>(EN) In 2008 the Commission published a staff working document on implementation of Article 8 and related provisions of Council Directive 80/987/EEC of 20 October 1980 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer, concerning supplementary company or inter-company pension schemes outside the national statutory social security schemes<a href="#defann_43_3" name="refann_43_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The conclusions point out that, in certain cases, issues can be raised as regards the extent to which some of the measures adopted by Member States are sufficient to protect the interests of employees and retired persons in the event of insolvency of the employer. Further investigation is therefore needed in order to address the following issues:</p>
<p>how to protect employees and retired persons against the risk of under-funding of pension schemes, and to what extent;</p>
<p>how to guarantee any unpaid contributions to pension schemes;</p>

<p>(EN) Enhancing the energy performance of buildings is an important avenue towards reducing climate change and enhancing energy security and the competitiveness of the EU economy. The Commission has taken a wide range of measures to increase the energy efficiency in the building sector, such as legal measures, financial instruments and actions in order to disseminate information. One of the most important legal instruments in this field is Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy performance of buildings, of which the Commission is monitoring the implementation. In order to extend its scope and strengthen some of its provisions, the Commission recently presented a Proposal for recast.</p>
<p>As regards the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund, it should be recalled that in all Member States the current legislation allows a broad range of energy efficiency and renewable energy interventions in buildings other than those serving housing purposes. For the latter, the current legislation foresees limited eligibility of expenditure on housing in the EU-12 depending on conditions relating to the financial allocation, the context of intervention, the type of housing, the zone and type of intervention.</p>
<p>In line with its Communication on the European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, on 3 December 2008, the Commission presented a proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EC) 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund as regards the eligibility of energy efficiency and renewable energy investments in housing. The modification would make all Member States eligible for an amount of up to 4% of the total ERDF allocation as regards expenditure on energy efficiency improvements and on the use of renewable energy in existing housing. The categories of eligible housing will be defined at national level, with the aim to support social cohesion.</p>
<p>Should the modification be adopted , then it is for Member States to decide whether they wish to re-programme their Structural Funds Operational Programmes in order to devote a greater share to energy efficiency investments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Measures need to be put in place within the EU to address the needs of women and girls who are at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM).

These 15 EU Member States have committed to enacting a law to place an outright ban on FGM in their respective countries.</p>
<p>Can the Commission recommend to non-participating Member States that they consider such action plans and legislation outlawing this harmful practice? Such a law would send a clear signal to potential practitioners of this tradition that FGM is wholly unacceptable within the EU. Considering that the World Health Organisation estimates that between 100 and 140 million girls and women are living with the consequences of FGM (and three million girls are at risk each year), what is the Commission doing to minimise the detrimental effects of this tradition as part of its external relations policy?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that female genital mutilations (FGM) constitute a serious violation of women's and girls' fundamental rights and that all European countries should take strong measures to prevent such practices from happening both within and outside the EU.</p>
<p>All forms of female genital mutilation are associated with an increased risk of pyschological and physical damage including haemorrhage, infection, infertility, incontinence and mental health problems. Female genital mutilation is also a cause of obstetric complications to the mother and infant including stillbirths, infant death and long term disability. These practices are a serious violation of their fundamental right to physical and mental integrity, which is recognised in all Member States of the EU. Although the Commission does not have competence to propose legislation in this area, it is consistently making Community funding available under the Daphne III Programme to assist European non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and local or regional public authorities and institutions to combat FGM.</p>
<p>The Daphne Programme has in particular contributed to creating and supporting the European Network of NGOs fighting FGM (Euronet-FGM), which is the coordinator of the Daphne-funded project that the Honourable Member is referring to. This project is developing national plans of action (PoA) for the elimination of FGM in 15 EU and EEA Member States (Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Finland, Germany, Greece , Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom) and is also exploring the situation of FGM in 10 new Member States. The project ends in June 2009 and a final conference will be organised near the end of the project in order to present, discuss and disseminate the national PoA, to sensitise the international community for the problem of FGM in Europe and for violence against migrant women and girls in general. The Commission will be present at this event and will urge Member States which have not yet developed action plans to learn from the project results and take necessary measure as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In its external assistance to third countries, the Commission has three polices in use against FGM. Firstly, The Commission brings women's empowerment, human rights and women's health issues in political and policy dialogue with partner governments. Secondly, the Commission supports advocacy and lobbying initiatives for the improvement of national legislation and the development of adequate national policies for the promotion and protection of women’s rights and the prohibition of harmful practices. Thirdly, the Commission supports capacity-building initiatives for government officials as well as advocacy and awareness-raising in all sectors of society.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently financing the following projects:</p>
<p>Under the "Investing in People" programme a project aiming at contributing to the abandonment in selected countries of social norms harmful to girls and women is financed in co-operation with the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF).</p>
<p>In Burkina Faso, the Commission supports a Centre for women's well-being and prevention of FMG. The Centre focuses on prevention and on treatment of FGM consequences, as well as on awareness raising on women's rights.</p>
<p>The Commission will provide support to the justice sector in Nigeria, to a wider variety of non-State actors, to parliamentarians and to mass media. The action will contribute to increase public awareness, to sustain the domestic debate and to promote policy advocacy on key issues concerning good governance and human rights including FGM.</p>
<p>In Senegal, we support a project by the Senegalese association AFELP "Association Femmes Enfant Lutte Contre la Pauvreté" in partnership with the "Secours Populaire Français". The project helps women to fight for themselves against all forms of violence of which they are victims, as well as to help them combat damaging cultural practices and promote the principles of democracy.</p>
<p>Under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights the Commission is funding a project in Somalia, "Somali women's FGM Eradication Plan". The beneficiary organisation is the international civil society organisation Co-operation for the Development of Emerging Countries (COSPE). The Commission also recently finalised a project in Nigeria, carried out by a local organisations addressing violence against women, also including FGM. The aim of the project is to increase the report rate of gender based violence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1042"></a>

<p>(FR) Combating counterfeiting and piracy is a priority for the Commission. Every year it publishes a statistical report on the goods confiscated by the customs authorities of Member States. This report is drawn up from information submitted by Member States and according to the provisions of the legislation in force<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The reports are available on the Europa website at the following address:</p>
<p>http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/counterfeit_piracy/statistics/index_fr.htm" </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The results of joint operations carried out by the customs authorities of Member States are integrated with the results they have supplied to the Commission. At present the basis for collection of statistics does not make it possible for the Commission to provide more details, particularly in relation to the operations carried out. Nonetheless some operations carried out by the Commission services have given rise to specific reports. This type of operation always focuses on certain products, certain means of transport or specific countries of origin. Consequently the results are closely linked to the criteria applied.</p>
<p>Operation ‘FAKE’</p>
<p>In May 2005, the joint customs operation ‘FAKE’, organised by the Commission with the customs authorities of the European Union Member States, led to the seizure of 60 containers sent by sea and 140 consignments sent by air. This represents a total of more than 2 000 000 counterfeit products (including 1 258 110 packets of cigarettes) coming from China. The counterfeit goods seized were mainly textiles, shoes, bags, electronic goods, medicines, cigarettes, and other products (spectacles, belts, ink cartridges, watches, toys, razors, honey, toothbrushes).</p>
<p>Operation ‘DAN’</p>
<p>In 2006, operation ‘DAN’, initiated by 13 Community ports and coordinated by the European Commission, focused on goods coming by sea from China. This operation led to the seizure of 92 containers with a wide range of products. Among the counterfeit products seized were, for example, tens of thousands of toys, hundreds of boxes of sunglasses, millions of pairs of shoes and numerous fake spare parts for cars, DVDs, knives, clothes and millions of lighters and cigarettes.</p>
<p>Operation ‘DIABOLO’</p>
<p>In 2007, the joint customs operation ‘DIABOLO’, organised by the Commission with 27 European Union Member States and 13 Asian countries (</p>
<p><a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>), as well as Interpol, Europol and the World Customs Organization, led to the seizure of approximately 135 million cigarettes with counterfeit trademarks and 1 089 585 other counterfeit products, namely textile products, shoes, toys, furniture, suitcases and watches. Furthermore, eight people have been questioned following this operation.</p>
<p>The report is available on the Europa website: http://ec.europa.eu/anti_fraud/diabolo/i_en.html" </p>
<p>Operation ‘INFRASTRUCTURE’</p>
<p>At the end of 2007, the joint operation ‘INFRASTRUCTURE’, undertaken by the Commission with the support of the customs authorities of the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Belgium and the United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in order to enforce intellectual property rights, led to the seizure of more than 360 000 counterfeit integrated circuits with more than 40 different trademarks and some fruitful exchanges of information. This was the first joint activity targeting intellectual property rights.</p>
<p>Operation ‘MUDAN’</p>
<p>In 2008, the joint customs operation ‘MUDAN’, organised in April 2008 by the Commission with the support of the customs authorities of the European Union Member States, focused on postal packets from China and led to the seizure of 1 300 000 cigarettes.</p>

<p>(EN) Defence-related products cover a broad spectrum of military goods and services, ranging from low sensitivity components and light arms to complex weapon systems, such as combat aircraft or war vessels, as well as highly sensitive material, such as nuclear, biological and chemical gear.</p>
<p>Member States can currently invoke restrictions to the circulation of defence-related products within the Internal Market on the basis of Article 30 of the EC Treaty. This Article permits certain prohibitions or restrictions on the free movement of goods between Member States on grounds of, inter alia, public policy or public security and the protection of health and life of humans, provided that such prohibitions or restrictions meet the proportionality test. This Article is not amended by the Lisbon Treaty. Two reasons play a particularly important role in this contrext:</p>
<p>1. Member States wish to ensure that such material does not eventually end up in hostile hands or failed states. Reducing the threat of terrorism and the risks of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is a key concern of all Member States.</p>
<p>2. Member States also wish to ensure that defence equipment is not used by criminals within the EU. The prevention of violent crime and of terrorism within the EU requires a strict control of the circulation of many types of defence-related products.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 296 of the EC Treaty may also allow Member States, under certain conditions, to take such measures as they consider necessary for the protection of the essential interests of their security which are connected with the production of or trade in arms, munitions and war material. This Article is also not amended by the Lisbon Treaty.</p>
<p>As such, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty does not effect the possibility for Member States to introduce restrictions motivated by public security concerns.The proposal for a directive on simplifying terms and conditions of transfers of defence-related products within the Community which the Parliament voted on 16 December 2008 nevertheless constitutes a major step towards a better integrated internal market for defence-related products without jepodizing national security concerns.</p>
<p>While the Commission did not foresee the possibility for the EU itself to issue licences for the transfer of defence-related products, the Directive adopted, has three important provisons which should gradually eliminate or substantially alleviate licensing requirements:</p>
<p>– The Directive allows Member States to exempt transfers of defence-related products from the obligation of prior authorisation in several cases, for example when the supplier or the recipient is a governmental body or a part of armed forces;</p>
<p>– The Directive contains an evolution clause whereby other transfers of defence-related products can be exempted from the obligation of prior authorisation, for example where the transfer takes place under such conditions as not to affect public policy or public security;</p>
<p>– The system of general transfer licences put in place by the Directive is not an individual licence but a general authorisation to suppliers who fulfil the terms and conditions attached to the licence, to perform transfers of defence-related products to be specified in the licence to a category or categories of recipients located in another Member State.</p>
<p>This Directive will abolish many superfluous administrative formalities while allowing Member States to perform the necessary controls in order to prevent the wide dissemination of defence equipment and the risk of diversion.</p>
<p>The Commission will review the functioning of the Directive and submit a report to the Parliament and the Council in which it will evaluate whether, and to what extent, the objectives of the Directive have been achieved, with regard to the functioning of the internal market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2008-1063"></a>

<p>(EN) The fundamental principle of European Union (EU) food law is that all food and feed legally placed on the market in the EU must be safe, irrespective of where it comes from. A wide range of measures to ensure food safety and to assist in the removal of unsafe food/feed from the market have been introduced under Community legislation.</p>
<p>In accordance with the General Food Law Regulation<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, traceability on EU territory is compulsory for food business operators at all stages of the food chain, from the importer up to the retail level. That means that food operators must have in place systems and procedures to identify food business operators from whom they have received and to whom they have delivered products.</p>
<p>In particular for products of animal origin, including products from outside the Community, the food hygiene legislation enhances further the traceability rules of products of animal origin covered by Regulation 853/2004<a href="#defann_49_2" name="refann_49_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> by requiring the application of a health mark or identification mark on such products.</p>
<p>The Commission does not agree that the system is inadequate. The recent contamination incident of Irish pork and beef with dioxins has demonstrated that the traceability of food of animal origin has significantly improved compared to similar contamination incidents in the past. Once the contamination was known, possibly contaminated Irish pork and beef was withdrawn from the market in 25 Member States and 12 third countries in a very short period of time thanks to the traceability systems in place. The rapid removal of possible contaminated meat from the market is the key to protect public health and to maintain consumer confidence.</p>
<p>As to the mandatory indication of labelling of origin for all foods in general, it must be underlined that origin labelling is not a tool for contributing to food safety. The Commission views origin labelling as primarily an instrument of consumer information, particularly about the characteristics and, as the case may be, about the quality of the food.</p>
<p>Origin labelling is required in cases where consumers might be misled on the true origin or provenance of the foodstuffs, and in application of specific rules such as those for fruit and vegetables, beef, wine, honey and fish. In addition, an indication of origin must be shown for imported poultry meat and, with effect from 1 July 2010, the origin of pre-packaged foodstuffs labelled as organically produced must be shown on an EU product (and on imported products if the Community logo is used).</p>
<p>The recent Commission proposal for a Regulation of the Parliament and of the Council on the provision of food information to consumers<a href="#defann_49_3" name="refann_49_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> does not extend the items to which compulsory origin labelling applies, but provides for rules in order to ensure that voluntary origin indications are based on the same criteria.</p>
<p>In particular, as regards meat different from beef and veal, the draft Regulation foresees that voluntary origin indications should provide information on the different locations of birth, rearing and slaughter of the animal in so far as that animal has not been born, reared and slaughtered in the same country or place.</p>
<p>The Commission is certainly aware that the issue has given rise to further debate. In its Green Paper on agricultural product quality<a href="#defann_49_4" name="refann_49_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Commission specifically asked whether an obligatory indication of place of production of primary products, such as 'EU' or 'non-EU', could be useful to ensure a better connection is made between the farming input and the final product. The Green Paper was open for responses from stakeholders and the public. The consultation ended on 31.12.2008.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

It provides a reference point which can guide action by Member States. And as the question identifies, the report shows significant variations across the European Union.</p>
<p>Regarding action to be taken, according to Article 152 of the Treaty, in the health domain the primary responsibility lies with the Member States. It is therefore primarily up to individual Member States to consider what issues this report identifies for them, and to take appropriate action.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, addressing inequalities in health is one of the objectives of the EU Health Strategy. The Commission plans to publish a Communication on tackling health inequalities later in 2009.</p>
<p>The Commission has already taken action in this area. For example, the Commission has supported Member States in their actions aimed at reducing risk behaviours relating to perinatal and infant mortality in their populations. This includes informing women of risks associated with smoking and drinking during pregnancy.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports improvements in healthcare systems, such as through investment under the Structural Funds, and through research into better health technology and techniques under the Research framework programmes.</p>
<p>The Commission will also continue to produce this kind of comparable information on health and health-related behaviour of the population, on diseases, and on health care systems.

These reports can be found in the Commission web page as well as in any of the ECC web pages.</p>
<p>In addition, the Commission has sent a questionnaire to all competent national authorities in November 2008 with deadline 15th of January asking for relevant information, including information on complaint handling on the operation of Regulation 261/2004 in 2007-2008. The answers to the questionnaires are currently under translation and analysis by the Commission services. The Commission intend to send soon a similar letter to the airline associations. The Commission services will compile and analyse all the available data and inform the Parliament about the outcome of this exercise in the second semester of 2009, as it was the case in 2007. The ECC has planned to issue their third report in 2009 on the complaints they have received in 2007-2008.</p>
<p>2. Under article 16 of the Regulation, Member States are in charge of the enforcement and, therefore, it is for the Member States to proceed against the airlines that do not fully apply the Regulation. The Commission only can open infringement procedures against the Member States that do not respect their obligations on enforcement.</p>
<p>The Commission considered in its Communication of 2007 that a period of stability was required to allow NEB, airlines, Member States and the Commission itself to develop a practical, consistent and harmonised application of the Regulation. Further to the Communication, the Commission brought together In 2007, all the stakeholders (notaby airline associations and NEBs) to set up a set of documents that would improve the application of, and adherence to, the regulation. All these documents are available on the Commission's website<a href="#defann_52_3" name="refann_52_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. 2008 has provided us with the necessary period of stability that allowed all stakeholders to put into practice all the procedures and mechanisms that were agreed in 2007.</p>
<p>Since all the NEB were fully committed to this voluntary approach and started improving their enforcement, no infrigment procedures were opened in 2007-2008, during the stability period.</p>
<p>The meeting held in Brussels last 2 December, which gathered together again all the stakeholders, closed the period of stability and initiated the new evaluation phase, in which the Commission will analyse whether and why regulation 261/2004 may still be not adequately respected, and will take the necessary solutions.</p>
<p>In January 2009 the Commission is about to initiate contacts on three files with two Member States in the 'EU Pilot' system for problem-solving, two regarding lack of action of the Italian NEB and one regarding lack of action of the Spanish NEB. Subject to the answer of the competent national authorities in these cases, the Commission may open infringment procedures against them. Secondly, the Commission services will send a letter to several Member States in the coming weeks asking for further information regarding the way they enforce the Regulation vis-à-vis non-national air carriers. If the information to be provided by these Member States is not satisfactory, the Commission will open infringment procedures against them in 2009.</p>
<p>3. Since only a reduced number of passengers which are dissatisfied with the airline or the NEB answers write to the Commission, the Commission considers that these complaints may not be representative of the overall situation in Europe. However, these complaints are very useful for the Commission to monitor how the Regulation is actually applied by member states and the air carriers, and to act accordingly whenever it seems necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission sends to the competent national enforcement authority all the letters of passengers providing information suggesting that the airline does not respect their obligations under the Regulation. The Commission follows up with the National enforcement bodies their work on these cases and keeps informed the passengers that request so.</p>
<p>The Commission encourages NEB to collaborate and to exchange information among themselves to ensure a more homogeneous implementation of the Regulation. To do so the Commission organises regularly meetings with the NEB. The last one took place on 2 December 2009, the next one is likely to take place in May through a joint meeting of the NEB-ECC-CPC networks. Points raised in passenger complaints are systematically discussed during these meetings.</p>
<p>4. The number of complaints received by the Commission has fallen since 2005 and it has stabilised around 2200 letters and mails per year since 2007. The two kind of incidents mentioned by passengers more often are problems related to their luggage (regulation 889/2002 implementing the Montreal Convention), and long delay or cancellation of a flight (Regulation 261/2004). Further to the adoption of Regulation 261/2004, the number of overbooking and downgrading cases has clearly diminished.</p>
<p>5. The Commission intends to provide another report to the Council and Parliament on the operation and the results of Regulation 261/2004 in Autumn 2009. The Communication to be adopted by the Commission on the second semester this year will analyse the 4 years of operation of the regulation in order to assess its success in reducing the number of incidents and improving the protection of air passenger rights. It will also announce the Commission's intentions regarding future legislative measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>According to the ban order, issued on 11 November by the German Federal Minister of the Interior, the 'purpose and activity of al-Manar TV is to support, advocate and call for the use of violence as a means to achieving political and religious aims.'

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member that some of the material broadcast by al-Manar TV amounts to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the EU-Egypt Association Committee on 16 December 2008 took stock of progress made on the implementation of the Association Agreement and the joint Action Plan under the European Neighbourhood Policy. Among other items on the agenda, the Association Committee discussed the conclusions of the different sub-committee meetings which were held during 2008; but no specific topic was raised in detail, as this is done in the relevant sub-committee.</p>
<p>The sub-committee on political matters with Egypt is the appropriate mechanism for raising issues related to the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance. This includes the undertaking in the joint EU-Egypt Action Plan to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard”.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the sub-committee on political matters with Egypt on 2-3 June 2008 did not raise the issue of incitement to hatred via the media. In light of the many other pressing developments that had to be addressed, as well as the EU’s priorities for this dialogue, it had been decided with the Member States that this issue would not be discussed in this first sub-committee meeting (see reply of the Commission to oral questions <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0480_EN.html">H-0480/08</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2008-0491_EN.html">H-0491/08</a>).</p>
<p>The Commission has raised the issue of al-Manar's broadcasts on several other occasions: For instance, following an intervention of the Commission at the 2<span class="sup">nd</span> EU-Lebanese sub-committee meeting on Human Rights, Governance and Democracy on 17 November 2008 the Lebanese Government made a statement that they had never received an official complaint on al-Manar TV. In addition, the issue was discussed at the meeting of the Working Group of the Audiovisual Media Services Regulatory Authorities<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on 4 July 2008. At the meeting of the Contact Committee<a href="#defann_53_2" name="refann_53_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on 16 December 2008, the Commission asked the Member States whether recent evidence exists that al-Manar TV still incites to hatred and, if this was the case, whether they would consider to launch a diplomatic complaint with the Lebanese Government (and inform the Commission thereof).</p>
<p>The Commission continues to follow this issue closely and may raise it on another occasion under the EU’s regular political dialogues with Egypt and Lebanon or at any other forum.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the problem of clear and complete pricing in the airline sector and has taken action in order to ensure that airlines improve their practices. In September 2007, the Commission coordinated with national authorities an EU sweep targeting websites selling air tickets, including airlines websites.</p>
<p>More than 400 websites were checked and the results showed that about a third had irregularities with misleading price information being one of the most common irregularities. Often airfares, sometimes advertised as free, would not include taxes and charges and therefore the final price charged would be substantially higher than the price advertised. 60% of these irregularities were rectified<a href="#defann_54_2" name="refann_54_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>within the subsequent 13 months. The other 40% remain under investigation.</p>
<p>The Unfair Commercial Practices Directive<a href="#defann_54_3" name="refann_54_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> obliges traders to provide consumers with the information they need, in a timely and clear manner, in order to make an informed choice. Traders must also provide clear, complete and final prices, inclusive taxes and other charges, where prices are advertised.</p>
<p>The Directive also states that even where information provided is technically correct, it will be deemed misleading where it deceives or is likely to deceive the average consumer. In addition to this, the Directive's blacklist prohibits misleadingly describing a product as free where it is not.</p>
<p>More specifically however, the Regulation on common rules for the operation of air services in the Community<a href="#defann_54_4" name="refann_54_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which came into force on 1 November 2008, obliges airlines to display complete airfares. These should include taxes and airport charges and all other foreseeable fees.</p>
<p>In November, the Commissioner for Transport and I met with the representatives of the aviation industry to raise the level of compliance of their website with the EU consumer rights legislation. A checklist of compliance for their websites has been provided to the industry and the Commission has informed them that an independent study shall examine this spring which websites are in compliance with the checklist.<a href="#defann_54_5" name="refann_54_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Implementation of the rules adopted in the wake of the mid-term review to individual products has led to a collapse of prices so that they no longer even cover production costs. For instance, the price of durum wheat fell from 0.50 euros a kilo in 2007 to 0.30 kilos in 2008; the price of cotton fell from 0.40 to 0.20 euros a kilo and the price of olive oil fell from 3.5 euros a kilo to 2.4 euros a kilo over the same period.</p>

<p>(EN) After a sharp and rapid increase at the end of 2007 and beginning of 2008, the prices of many agricultural commodities fell drastically due mainly to the strong production development in 2008 at EU and world level. They are now back to levels similar at or even below those before the price spikes. Furthermore, the price decline has been exacerbated by the increased nervousness and uncertainty about the economic outlook and the general turbulence in the global financial system.</p>
<p>The price drop led to some income decline in 2008 in many EU Member States, although higher input prices (in particular energy and fertilisers) were in fact the main driving factor behind the fall in agricultural income. In Greece, the agricultural income per worker declined by 7% in real terms, despite a 3% rise in the value of agricultural products (resulting from a 4% increase in output volume and a slight fall of 1% in output prices).</p>
<p>In spite of these unfavourable price trends, the income of farmers in Greece in 2008 were substantially supported by the granting of the EU decoupled direct payments, which are paid regardless of the prevailing market price environment and which make up for around 40% in Greek agricultural factor income. Furthermore and in an attempt to countervail the current trend of decreasing agricultural market prices, the Commission has recently adjusted its market management in the dairy sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0026"></a>

<p>On 18 December 2008, the European Parliament adopted a resolution with recommendations to the Commission on e-Justice. As regards the current system of gathering criminal evidence in other Member States, the resolution states that it is still based on slow and ineffective instruments offered by mutual assistance in criminal matters, and that, where appropriate and only where it would not be detrimental to the legal position of the person giving testimony, the use of technological tools such as video-conferencing would be a great step forward in the taking of evidence at a distance.</p>

<p>(EN) 1. The Commission shares the view that the possibility of using videoconference for the taking of evidence in cross-border cases could be a way to facilitate procedures for citizens concerned by such cases.</p>
<p>European legislation already provides for possibilities and rules for using videoconferencing in cross-border cases:</p>
<p>Council act of 29 May 2000 establishing in accordance with Article 34 on European Union the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union</p>
<p>Council Regulation 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil and commercial matters</p>
<p>Council Directive 2004/80/EC of 29 April 2004 relating to compensation to crime victims</p>
<p>Regulation 861/2007 of the Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 establishing a European Small Claims Procedure</p>
<p>The 2001 Regulation enables a Court from one Member State to request a Court in another Member State to take evidence in another Member State. This Regulation provides for the use of the most advanced technological means and privileges videoconference. To support the implementation of this regulation, 50 000 copies of a practice guide on this Regulation were disseminated at the beginning of 2007 and served to raise awareness among the judiciary on these provisions.</p>
<p>In criminal matters, the 2000 Convention indicates that Member States shall agree to a request from another Member State about hearing a witness or an expert by videoconference, provided that it is not contrary to the fundamental principles of their national law and that they have the technical means to carry out the hearing.</p>
<p>The judicial authority of the requested Member State summons the person to appear in accordance with its national law. During the hearing, a member of the judiciary of the requested Member State has to be present. The person may claim the right not to testify in accordance with the law of the requested or requesting Member State.</p>
<p>These rules apply only to the hearing of witnesses and experts. However, Member States may also agree to apply the rules to the hearing of accused persons in accordance with national law and relevant international instruments.</p>
<p>The 2003 Agreement on mutual legal assistance between the European Union and the United States of America also includes provisions for the use of videoconference.</p>
<p>The Parliament's Resolution and the Council's Action Plan on e-Justice encourage consideration of all possible uses of videoconference tools in court cases.</p>
<p>2. On 5<span class="sup">th</span> December 2007, the Commission adopted a report on the application of the Council Regulation 1206/2001<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. To prepare this report, a survey was carried out and published in March 2007<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It showed that, regarding the use of advanced communication technology in the taking of evidence,</p>
<p>62,2 % of the legal professionals indicated that it was rarely used,</p>
<p>17,7% had seen it being sometimes used and</p>
<p>4,2% often.</p>
<p>The use of advanced communication technologies was considered by 24,3% of these professionals as of interest to improve the efficiency of evidence-taking, to cut costs and to significantly reduce timescales.</p>
<p>Current discussions in the e-Justice Working Party of the Council have shown that, while videoconference is not yet widely used, recent efforts in all Member States have resulted in a much more widespread equipment of courts and increased interest in the use of videoconferencing facilities for cross-border cases.</p>
<p>A survey organised by the Council has shown that the equipment installed in different Member States respects the same international technical standards. However, organisational (such as contact points, testing phases, etc) and legal questions (sufficient understanding of another legal system and structure) may constitute stumbling blocks or hurdles to more widespread use of videoconference in cross-border cases.</p>
<p>3. The Atlas of the European Judicial Network (EJN) in civil and commercial matters<a href="#defann_57_3" name="refann_57_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> includes a directory of Courts of all Members States. If the national Contact Point of the EJN has provided the information, it is possible to identify which courts are equipped with videoconferencing tools and to get in contact with them.</p>
<p>The future European e-Justice portal which is expected to be presented at the end of December 2009, will include more detailed information about the use of videoconference and location of videoconferencing equipment in Courts.</p>
<p>4. European e-Justice is a priority for the Commission. In discussions regarding the use of IT tools to improve efficiency in cross-border cases the protection of the rights of victims and defendants is a key element. The organisation and legal background of the use of videoconference in national cases is the responsibility of Member States.</p>
<p>However, the Commission welcomes all comments and proposals aimed at improving the integrity of justice systems and protecting the rights of citizens. The Commission has direct contacts with European as well as national organisations of legal practitioners. In 2009, the use of videoconference in cross-border cases will be discussed at one of the meetings of the Justice Forum<a href="#defann_57_4" name="refann_57_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>. The purpose is to stimulate exchanges of experiences and discussions on the best use of this tool.</p>
<p>5. It is necessary to assess properly the benefits and potential negative consequences of the use of videoconference in cross-border cases. It is essential to ensure full respect of citizens' rights and to ensure that the quality of legal professionals' work is not negatively affected, and to take due account of the needs of citizens and legal professionals when adapting to a tools.</p>
<p>For example, in cross-border cases, the procedure may take place in a multilingual context. Quality of interpretation is thus a crucial issue, which has to be considered in detail, both for on-site interpretation and remote interpretation.</p>
<p>The Commission supports research on the specific needs of interpreting in the framework of videoconference exchanges.</p>
<p>To achieve the full potential offered by videoconferencing and to ensure best use it is necessary to assess and promote best practice, to understand the difficulties and to provide practical answers. Additional legislation might be needed at a later stage, but it does not constitute the main barrier at the moment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In his question <a href="/doceo/document/P-6-2008-6678_EN.html">P-6678/08</a>, José Javier Pomés Ruiz, MEP, incorrectly disputed the correctness of the term 'Euskal Herria'. Article 1 of the Statute of Autonomy of the Basque Country (Organic Law 3/1979) states: 'The Basque people, or Euskal Herria, as an expression of its nationality and in order to attain self-government, constitutes itself as an autonomous community within the Spanish state under the name of Euskadi or the Basque Country, in accordance with the Constitution and with the present Statute, which is its fundamental law'. In addition, Article 2 of the same Statute states that '[the provinces of] Álava, Guipúzcoa and Vizcaya, as well as Navarre, have the right to be part of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country'.</p>
<p>It should therefore be clear that the term 'Euskal Herria' is recognised by the Organic Law, in other words by a higher legal authority, and that the term also includes Navarre.</p>

<p>(EN) Combating corruption is one of the key issues closely monitored and promoted by the Commission with regard to candidate countries and potential candidates in the Western Balkans. This is done in close cooperation with other major stakeholders, such as the Council of Europe, International Financial Institutions as well as non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In our annual Progress Reports we refer in detail to the developments in this area. Fight against corruption is also a key benchmark for the visa liberalisation dialogue.</p>
<p>Overall, despite considerable efforts made in some countries, corruption remains a serious problem in most of the Western Balkans. In particular, conviction rates for corruption cases are usually low, leading to allegations of corruption within the judicial system. Financing of political parties, privatisation and public procurement are areas most vulnerable to corruption, but also other sectors such as education and health care are affected.</p>
<p>With regard to the candidate countries, there is some further progress:</p>
<p>In Croatia, the legal framework to combat corruption is now largely in place and the Office for the Fight against Corruption and Organised Crime (USKOK) continues to become more active. However, corruption remains widespread. Further efforts are required in tackling and prosecuting high level corruption as well as in the field of public procurement. A culture of political accountability is lacking.</p>
<p>The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has made some progress in implementing anti-corruption policy and improved some of its anti-corruption laws. However, the fragmented legal system that has resulted from the large number of legislative acts continues to make implementation and monitoring difficult. Overall, corruption remains a particularly serious problem. Further steps are necessary, in implementing provisions on financing of political parties and election campaigns.</p>
<p>With regard to the potential candidates, the situation is as follows:</p>
<p>In Albania, progress in the fight against corruption remains slow. A new anti-corruption strategy for 2007-2013 with an action plan was adopted in October 2008. Implementation needs to start and monitoring mechanisms remain to be assessed. Corruption in Albania remains a particularly serious problem.</p>
<p>As regards Bosnia and Herzegovina, progress also remains slow. The Commission highlighted in meetings with BiH political leaders the need to demonstrate political will and take determined action to fight corruption. The country needs to improve its anti-corruption legislation and more vigorous investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>In Montenegro, efforts have been stepped up in monitoring, awareness raising and the adoption of the necessary legal framework for fighting corruption. However, corruption continues to remain a serious and widespread problem, with limited results in securing adequate prosecution and convictions.</p>
<p>Serbia has made some progress in fighting corruption and developing a comprehensive anti-corruption policy. The legislative framework improved, and specialised departments within the courts and prosecution offices were set up. However, practical results in fighting corruption so far have been limited and corruption continues to be widespread and to pose a serious problem in Serbia.</p>
<p>In the case of Kosovo, under United Nations Security Council resolution (UNSCR) 1244/99, corruption is still widespread and a major problem. This is due to insufficient legislation and implementing measures as well as a lack of clear political determination and the weakness of the judicial system.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
