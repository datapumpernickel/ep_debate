I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Members here today and those who worked with me with a view to drafting and presenting this resolution to you today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank the draftsmen of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Committee on Fisheries and the Committee on Development and Cooperation who supported all the drafts that your rapporteur presented on the protection of biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would also like to thank the NGOs who really made an enormous effort for this report. We know that they are excellent observers who have a perfect understanding of the status of biodiversity throughout the world. Mr President, the situation is not rosy and I would like to answer a question that, strictly speaking, has not been raised but which is often implicit in some Members’ comments. What is the real use of biodiversity, or, in more straightforward terms, why protect nature when there are so many other issues of concern?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that biodiversity plays a part in our own survival and that although nature does not need man to survive, we, as human beings, need nature in order to live.</p>
<p class="contents">Our responsibility as elected representatives is to preserve a rich biodiversity. This rich biodiversity holds the assets for the development of future generations. Each living species that disappears from the face of the planet is an irreversible and irretrievable loss, and if we allow biodiversity to be destroyed, we are slowly but surely destroying ourselves. We can see this destruction taking place every day. Is the Brazilian Congress not due to issue an opinion in the near future on a project that authorises the use of 50% of the Amazon rain forest, which we know represents a huge genetic pool? It is not out of disinterest that man destroys or threatens biodiversity – very much the opposite in fact. It is out of genuine interest. It is because huge financial interests are at stake, involving the precious wood as well as trafficking in endangered species, the intensive farming of land, the overexploitation of fish stocks or even the pillaging of the age-old practices of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to put a stop to this massacre, the Convention on Biological Diversity was signed at the Earth Summit in Rio. Ten years down the line, it is still the poor relative – the Convention’s signatory States have not kept their commitments and so far no country has biodiversity in its list of priorities for September’s summit in Johannesburg.</p>
<p class="contents">In just a few days’ time, the Conference in The Hague will be held, which will bring together those party to the Convention on Biological Diversity, the European Parliament, by means of our resolution, must shoulder its responsibilities and send out a strong and clear message. We call upon the Union to place the issue of biodiversity on the Johannesburg agenda and upon the Commission to present an action plan at this meeting, as it is doing for the European Union. We must reiterate the fundamental role of biodiversity as the cornerstone of sustainable development and the importance of the full application of the Convention and its provisions. We also call on the Union to put in place an ambitious policy to preserve its own biodiversity. The action plans presented by the Commission in the areas of natural resources, agriculture, development and fisheries, which are the subject of this report, may, of course, be seen as a first step along this road, but they are not enough. We need additional action plans, particularly for forestry and for transport, as all these Community policies had or still have a negative impact on biodiversity. And although the Commission claims its ambition is to reverse the current trend, it is fully aware of the challenge that it faces. The report states – and I quote – that “during recent decades, the reduction and loss of biodiversity in Europe and worldwide has accelerated dramatically and existing measures have proved to be insufficient to reverse present trends”. I would add to this the new threats posed by the introduction of certain GMOs and even the conflicts related to the ownership of living things, which give an indication of future ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">To reverse this destructive tendency is a bold challenge, admittedly, but it is one we are prepared to face. The European Union has still to equip itself with the political and financial means to hope to achieve this objective. We already have the birds and habitats directives, which enable us to preserve a part of our biodiversity. We demand that they be applied throughout the European Union, including in the candidate countries and in the outermost regions and particularly in areas such as the coral reef. We must find ways of preserving these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The second way of making headway in implementing a sustainable ecological development plan, as formally acknowledged at the Gothenburg Summit, is to equip ourselves with effective means of measuring how far the environment is taken into account in the Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Spring European Council is due to adopt six environmental indicators. This is not enough. No mention is made of biodiversity. We also call on the Commission to present a specific indicator for biodiversity by 2003. If we want to make progress in the area of biodiversity, we know that we must begin immediately and continue every day to integrate this problem in the policies of the Union, starting with the forthcoming reform of the common agricultural policy, the common fisheries policy, the policy on transport and the Cotonou development agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there is consensus between the various groups within Parliament on the ways of protecting biodiversity, several Members hold conflicting views on the impact of GMOs on biodiversity. Nonetheless, as rapporteur, I hope that the references to the environmental liability of GMOs for polluting the countryside are retained.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, allow me, Mr President, to presume that no one would even think of planning to destroy a cathedral, for example, or a listed monument to build a motorway. We must have the same approach towards preserving our natural heritage and biological diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, it must play a double-edged and central role in the conservation of biodiversity: first, by consolidating farming practices that are compatible with the environment and, secondly, by ensuring the survival of viable farms and systems of production throughout the territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the relentless intensification of farming and the fact that farmers are leaving the industry, with the consequent decline of rural areas, are having a devastating effect on biodiversity. A Community strategy for biodiversity must guarantee a method of farming that is more sustainable, in the broadest sense of the word, and which, in addition to the biological aspects, incorporates economic and social requirements and, ultimately, the survival of the rural world.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, maintaining this sustainable form of farming is a prerequisite for the European agricultural model, which is based on the protection of multifunctionality in agriculture, as the Council and the European Parliament have reiterated in numerous resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The CAP is a useful instrument for biodiversity, as are the resolutions of the Earth Summit adopted at the Helsinki and Gothenburg Councils. On this basis it would be a mistake to confine the protection of biodiversity within the narrow limits of the CAP's second pillar and, more specifically, within agri-environmental programmes – designed to encourage the extensification of organic farming, the preservation of native species, the protection of natural habitats, etc. – for two reasons: firstly, because the second pillar of the CAP accounts for only 10% of the agricultural budget and, secondly, because although agri-environmental programmes encompass 20% of the EU's farmland, they have been implemented very unevenly and these days they are restricted almost entirely to the least productive areas of five Member States. This state of affairs is aggravated by the fact that there has been insufficient insistence upon environmental protection requirements in respect of market aid, and this has generally resulted in the setting of excessively low standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we should extend eco-conditionality and encourage more active use of the agricultural market policy mechanisms designed to protect the environment and biodiversity. We must support these requirements in our legislation on food quality, plant-health products, seeds and genetic resources.</p>
<p class="contents">It is crucial that we strengthen the financial element of the CAP’s second pillar as well as making a distinction between its measures for socio-rural development and its agri-environmental measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a major challenge, which is to consolidate Community agricultural policies and to draw them together so that they work in parallel to preserve biodiversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank the rapporteur for her clarity of vision. She spoke about Brazil, but I should like to start close to home in discussing biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">At present in the fishing industry we are depleting glass eel stocks from our coastlines, with the result that the eel itself hardly occurs in its natural habitat. This seems to me to be an issue for the Commission and our Environmental Commissioner to look into further and to draft a policy accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fishery Committee’s second point of concern pertains to the development of genetic engineering in fish farming. Canada and the United States currently have a system which they can set in motion as soon as they receive the green light. It seems important to me for the Commission to verify to what extent we can stop this development in Europe, or at least are able to hold a reasonable political debate on the subject before we resort to such technology in fish farming.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point concerns aquaculture and the implications on the maritime environment. We need more research on that score too, particularly to find more closed systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point to which the Fisheries Committee would like to draw your attention is the implications of the dissonance which sometimes exists between bird and fish stocks. Particularly with regard to cormorants, there are serious problems in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the Fisheries Committee wants research to be carried out into the connection between climate change and fish stocks. What is the connection? Insufficient research has been carried out in that area and we will very much welcome the Commission’s action plans particularly on that score.</p>
<p class="contents">The sixth point concerns policy we are currently adopting to close areas in order to protect certain fish species. It is unclear whether this has truly positive effects on fish stocks or not. More research by the Commission in the framework of biodiversity would be appreciated in that area too.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to conclude by at least inviting the Environment Commissioner, Mrs Wallström, to come and exchange ideas with the Fisheries Committee on these specific points, so as to ascertain to what extent she can make a contribution to the Green Paper on fishery, also in terms of biodiversity. We would welcome such an initiative from the Commissioner with open arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My only objection is that, because most of the world’s biological diversity exists in tropical areas in the developing countries, I should like to have seen the development aspect given a rather more prominent place in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 49 calls for EU support for measures aimed at encouraging indigenous peoples to manage and preserve biodiversity. I have tabled an amendment adjusting the wording to the effect that the EU should support the role which, in virtue of its traditional knowledge, the original population plays in preserving and managing biodiversity. That applies especially to protected areas in which it is important for the indigenous peoples to participate in management so that forced relocations and inadequate access to resources are prevented. I have tabled an amendment with a view to having this aspect included in the report. In a number of developing countries, there is a clear need to be able to derive economic benefits from the sustainable use of wild resources, if people are to have an incentive to preserve stocks. In southern Africa, elephant populations have become so large that they destroy biodiversity and, given the economic situation of the countries concerned, it is completely unreasonable that the latter should not be able to obtain an income from their elephants. Biodiversity is now being lost at an unprecedented rate but, for all that, nothing has really happened since Rio. Biodiversity has become a concept that has been put on the back burner, and it is now our task to try to keep it on the agenda. In order to tackle the issue of conservation, it is necessary to protect the whole ecosystem. The Community’s cooperation programmes have proved to be sustainable alternatives to a protectionist approach, and I am able fully to support this way of thinking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the measures we have taken so far, we have quite simply failed to curb this trend.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the adoption by the Council of the Community strategy on biodiversity in June 1998, it is gratifying that the communication proposes biodiversity action plans in four areas – conservation of natural resources, fisheries, economic cooperation, and development – and this is of course very welcome in principle. The Commission's proposals on agriculture are to be welcomed as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore rather disappointed that the otherwise excellent report by the rapporteur takes such a negative view of agriculture – at least, that is how we see it – and fails to make any mention of agriculture's contribution to protecting biodiversity. My group will vote for this report, but we will vote against it on a number of individual points. You see, I come from a country which would have no future without its farmers. Austria is primarily an Alpine country, and without our Alpine farmers – whose working practices date back a hundred or even two hundred years – there would be a great deal wrong with our country. We are well aware that agriculture – especially non-intensive agriculture – also maintains specific eco-systems. Some habitats, such as those which exist in the mosaic of planted fields and boundaries defined by hedgerows and ditches, are quite simply vital to protect specific flora and fauna and ensure that they can nest and find sources of food.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to recite a list of the different types of bird affected or tell you which species have survived as a result of agriculture, and I certainly have no intention of telling you all about plant and insect species. Nonetheless, I think it is important to mention that non-intensive agriculture – let me emphasise this quite specifically – non-intensive and family-based agriculture has made a very substantial contribution to the conservation of wild and, indeed, domesticated flora and fauna. I believe that if we fail to recognise the contribution made by farmers today, we are doing a disservice to our natural environment and our eco-systems. We will vote for this report, but in the areas where we think it does not do justice to our farmers, we will vote against it.</p>

<p class="contents">The protection of biodiversity deserves top priority. When species become extinct, they are gone for ever, and this is why now is the time for action. Action plans cannot be non-committal. They can only be successful if they take account of the socio-economic circumstances of the people in that area. They must set priorities. We must tackle hot spots worldwide; areas that are particularly rich in species deserve special protection. Action plans must be clear and, above all, concrete. Public support is important, and nobody gets excited about an abstract idea such as biodiversity. It is about the conservation of the natural resources, valuable landscapes and endangered species. We must be well-informed, independent monitoring must be put in place, and we must draw up annual balance sheets of the quality of the natural environment. This motivates and inspires.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union itself should be a little more consistent. The bird directive and the habitat directive epitomise biodiversity protection. These must be implemented effectively, however difficult that may be at times. The end result must always be at the forefront of our minds.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these pearls of nature preservation are in sharp contrast with other policy. I mean in the first place agriculture, but also fisheries. Large-scale agriculture and the conservation of biodiversity are a difficult match. The common agricultural policy must for that reason alone undergo far-reaching changes. Subsidies purely based on production are asking for trouble. The fishery implications for biodiversity are less visible. Seabed disturbance in many coastal waters and deeper waters threatens biodiversity. This should be met with a forceful response.</p>
<p class="contents">Biodiversity must form a guideline in regional planning. Member States should draft action plans for that purpose. I ask the Commission to select and support a flagship project annually, preferably in one of the candidate countries. These projects must set an example to other nature reserves. The Polish primeval forest could be a good flagship project. I should once again like to thank Mrs Isler Béguin for her sound report.</p>

The proposals have an aim worthy of support: environmental diversity is something that is important to all of us. I would, however, like to raise two matters in this parliamentary report.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in item eight the matter of forests is raised, mentioning the desire to see a bureaucratic, centralised monitoring system for the EU based on certification for forests and all living organisms in them. The use of forests in the Member States would be controlled by the EU by means of action plans. At this point we must remember that forestry matters in the EU are covered by the principle of subsidiarity and there is no cause to extend Brussels’ control in these matters unless there are special reasons for doing so. Furthermore, all those engaged in forestry matters agree that certification should work on a voluntary basis, and on no account should it be managed by the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in item 44 it is proposed that all support payments for agricultural production should be replaced with environment-based aid. We have to remember, however, the situation regarding world trade which we have today. If production aid were not paid there would no longer be any agriculture on the present scale in the EU in the future. How would things stand regarding biodiversity then? In certain regions of the EU, production aid is, relatively speaking, even more important than in central Europe. For example, in my country the major problems are not really connected with the state of the environment or biodiversity, but the fact that production must in general be supported, production costs being as high as they are. For farmers it is a waste of time to talk about additional environmental action, as all production in our country is in practice organic.</p>
<p class="contents">I propose that point 44 should be deleted from the text. The same goes for the last part of item 42, where agri-environmental action would be solely geared towards protecting endangered species. No self-respecting EU institution should record something like this in the resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, it clearly shows that thousands of species that have not even been identified will disappear. In fact, 11 000 species of fauna and flora are in danger of extinction. I believe that is sufficient for us to adopt the appropriate measures. The rapporteur welcomes the plans that are proposed but points out that there are plans that have still not been carried out such as, for example, those concerning forests. She also speaks clearly about the need to incorporate environmental policy into our other policies, whether they concern agriculture, fisheries or anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have very little time, Mr President, I shall just give one example, because examples are the best way of explaining what needs to be done: the use of EAGGF Funds in the destruction of the last remaining laurel forest on the island of Gran Canaria.</p>
<p class="contents">I spent last weekend on the island of Gran Canaria with a group of volunteers who protested to the European Commission – I refer you to the question I asked at the time – that in the lime-tree forest of Moya, the only laurel forest remaining on the island, now that all the water that used to come down during droughts has been enclosed in pipes, all the forest’s trees are drying up. This is being done with EAGGF Funds. We must acknowledge all the valuable work done by volunteers, because they give their spare time, unpaid and unrewarded, to fight to preserve this natural resource.</p>
<p class="contents">The volunteers are grateful for the answer that Mrs Wallström gave them, because it proved her excellent knowledge of the area – which must be looked after, because it is likely to become part of the Nature 2000 network – and because she asked the Spanish Government to assume responsibility for looking after this area. Mrs Wallström, your speech gave hope to the volunteers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a clear example of why European Funds should not be used for projects that damage the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The extent to which biodiversity impacts on the lives of all citizens and the quality or otherwise of their lives makes this debate extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Those of us entrusted with the task of ensuring a future for our past must now act with decisiveness. We must do so, however, in an enlightened and informed way and be prepared to avail ourselves of modern research and technology in achieving this objective. Controversial areas such as biotechnology must, in my view, be part of this equation.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of farmers as guarantors of sustainable and quality food supply must be brought more into focus, because we ignore at our peril the fact that agriculture is a commercial activity. The unique role of farmers as environmental managers must also be fully recognised, appreciated and rewarded. In this regard, I ask the House to take serious note of the fact that the profession of farming is in decline. Farmers are getting older and young people are reluctant to take up farming as a career. From a biodiversity viewpoint, the role of farmers and the preservation of family-based farm units are important. They represent an important part of the rural infrastructure. Biodiversity and sustainable development will not happen if they are planned out of the equation.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, and in conclusion, we must adopt a practical approach which safeguards biodiversity, while, at the same time, acknowledging the professional and commercial role of farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is, however, an important subject, affecting areas that the Union is considering, such as the protection of natural resources and the relaunch of the development policy, as well as the new objectives for agriculture and fisheries, for example. Drawing up national strategies or action plans on biodiversity could only be contemplated if they were drafted after a broad consensus had been reached, respecting regional socio-economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As for enlargement and the rapporteur’s proposal to select a flagship project on the protection of biodiversity, we must not forget that the candidate countries want to join the Union in order to make up for their economic and social shortfalls as quickly as possible and to modernise their infrastructures. Biodiversity is not their main concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that the four amendments that I tabled in committee were all rejected, even the amendment in which I called for a CAP that respects the environment as well as those working in the rural community. Several points in this report give me cause for concern and, in particular, the desire to introduce certification for the timber sector and for animal species seems unrealistic in my view, given the considerable diversity in forests and living species. What added value does this kind of certification provide? What has happened to the desire to increase the financial resources granted to Natura 2000 and to other measures on biodiversity? Why continue along a path that is, increasingly, called into question by the people, landowners, farmers and users? Who will pay for the introduction of a strict protection system beyond the zones specified in the birds and habitat directives? Are we moving towards a situation where the entire territory will be divided into zones? What are we aiming to achieve with this maximum protection approach towards biodiversity? When reading this report, I wonder whether, in the rapporteur’s mind, man is still included in this biodiversity. In our view, there is no doubt that he is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, there are plant species that are disappearing, animal species that are at risk and, even within the species and breeds which are not threatened by extinction, the reduction in numbers, the consanguinity and the uncontrolled spread of GMOs are giving rise to genetic decline, which is a threat to the environment. But I wonder whether forcing through regulations without properly consulting the local actors, with the declared objective of transforming sizeable areas where people live and work into sanctuaries – people who have helped considerably to shape current ecosystems – as well as introducing incoherent procedures for implementing Natura 2000 in a number of countries – is the right way to protect biodiversity? Is there not a danger that this will have quite the opposite effect and, instead of achieving the desired goal, will provoke an exodus from farming, which will harm biodiversity?</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we will support the rapporteur’s reaffirmation of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, her prudent approach to GMOs, and her appeal to subsidiarity, but we will not support her call to tighten the Commission’s proposals on agriculture, which would result in the CAP being completely taken apart as of 2003. We will not preserve biodiversity without the help of the farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already heard this evening that the greatest degree of biodiversity is to be found in the tropical regions of the developing countries. These parts of the world have a wide range of crop plants, livestock, wild animals, etc. Moreover – and this is equally important in our eyes – huge numbers of the local, the indigenous, populations are dependent on the existence of this biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">If the breadth of biodiversity is now reduced, if there are major erosions of the natural world, this will create a knock-on effect which will plunge the people of these tropical regions into poverty. We also know that, unless action is taken to combat poverty, it becomes very difficult to raise and foster awareness of the need for biodiversity and sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is important that this action plan seeks to integrate the principle of preserving biodiversity into the development-cooperation programmes of the European Union. This means supporting the sustainable use of natural resources, particularly forests, as well as more frequent recourse to environmental-impact assessments of planned development projects.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also express the support of my group for all those amendments which emphasise the fundamental role of indigenous populations and their social, economic and cultural rights?</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are talking about biodiversity and, of course, sustainability too, I should not wish to miss this opportunity to say that we must also put our own house in order if we want to possess credibility in the eyes of the international community. When I recall the discussions on the resolution concerning the Barcelona Summit, a resolution which referred quite clearly to specific projects in Europe that contravene the principle of biodiversity and fail to protect rare flora and fauna, I am persuaded that it is not enough for us here in Europe merely to keep tabling splendid resolutions designed to protect mountain gorillas in African forests but that we also need to engage wholeheartedly in the implementation of projects and of our own European programmes, such as Natura 2000. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Biodiversity is a central issue in terms of sustainable development and the integration of environmental considerations into other policy areas. It is important in its own right but also forms the basis for activities based on natural resources such as agriculture and the fishing industry. Biodiversity is also important environmental capital which local societies in many countries depend on for their livelihood. At the same time, it is disappearing faster than ever before in human history. I have sad news tonight. We have now lost the first species on our list of protected species. The Pyrenean mountain goat has vanished for ever. We are thus unable even to completely protect the species we have placed on our lists of species we have promised to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the EU’s strategy for sustainable development and the seventh Environment Action Programme state that one of their central goals is that of halting the decline in biodiversity by 2010. If we are to be able to achieve this goal, it is very important that the action plans for biodiversity which we are discussing today are really implemented. Safeguarding biodiversity depends on the birds directive and the habitats directive being implemented in full. However, this is not enough. If we really want to stop this loss of biodiversity, we have to look at the entire territory of the EU and not just the protected areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to integrate the question of biodiversity with the policy on the development and use of the mainland and the sea. The biodiversity action plans are not just ambitious but also realistic. They mean a great step forwards in terms of integrating biodiversity into agriculture, fisheries and development cooperation policy, as well as into our own environmental policy. The action plan for the conservation of natural resources clearly shows our firm intention to fully implement the birds directive and the habitats directive and to support the work on Natura 2000. This also states how we intend to use general environmental controls such as environmental impact assessment, environmental labelling, environmental audits and other financial controls to promote the safeguarding of biodiversity throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan relating to agriculture states priorities for achieving mutual benefits from agricultural activity and biodiversity. The most important instruments cover everything from rural development measures to various environmental initiatives in the common organisations of the market for beef, milk and cereals, etc. The action plan covers all of our countryside, including the Natura 2000 areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan for fisheries addresses threats from both traditional fisheries and aquaculture, and it complies entirely with the Green Paper on the future of the common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority, and the most serious, of the threats to global biodiversity are in the developing countries. The battle for biodiversity therefore has a great deal to do with our strategy for eradicating poverty. We have a responsibility for helping developing countries so that the natural resources which are crucial to their well-being can be protected. The action plan for economic cooperation and development provides the tools for this.</p>
<p class="contents">These plans for biodiversity are not static instruments but instead will be developed primarily through the use of various indicators. This has been pointed out during the debate and is naturally also something which the Commission supports and which we have begun working with. These plans will primarily contribute to the discussion of the reform of the common fisheries policy, common agriculture policy and the regulations on the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that these reforms will have the scope and provide the controls that are required if we are to completely meet the goals of the biodiversity action plans. Only then will we be able to achieve the overall goal, namely that of halting the decline of biodiversity by 2010. I would like to thank all my fellow MEPs for your valuable contribution to the debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
