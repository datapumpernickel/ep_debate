<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pirker (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Ahern, the President-in-Office of the Council, said today that the Irish Presidency aimed for greater security and prosperity for all citizens of the European Union. At the same time as backing him up 100% on that, I would also propose that it would be in the interests of our security if the package of measures that this House expects were to be implemented during the term of the Irish Presidency and also during the Dutch Presidency that will follow it. The House proposes this package of measures in the spheres of illegal immigration, the smuggling and trafficking of human beings, the securing of our external borders and the return of illegal residents in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I was commissioned to draft an own-initiative report for Parliament, and I am extremely pleased to note the excellent negotiations that we have had, with good results, and the fact that we have been able to achieve a broad consensus in the Committee, receiving also the support of the Council and the Commission. Let me express my gratitude to all those who played their part in producing this report.</p>
<p class="contents">On what does this report focus? It basically appears to me that, although Parliament is able wholeheartedly to endorse the priorities set down in Thessaloniki, we do see it as important that particular attention be given to some of them, and I would now like to present six priorities for your consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority has to do with securing external borders. Especially on the new external borders, we will need, in future, the same high standards of security everywhere. It necessarily follows that we will have to train the border guards in accordance with one single training plan, and that we should establish a European college in which senior officials can be promptly and speedily trained.</p>
<p class="contents">Also connected with the external borders is the creation of a corps of border guards. This does not, however, mean that we can take competences away from the Member States, but rather, on the contrary, that competence to secure the borders must remain with them, whilst the European Union will provide, for fixed periods of time, on high-risk stretches of the border, and at the Member States’ request, special units financed by the Community in order to guarantee security there when there are temporary and special threats. That is what is meant by a corps of border guards, and we believe that it is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We of course want this to result in the Schengen standards being met as quickly as possible on all the new external borders, which means that the new Member States have the task – in which they will have the European Union’s support – of efficiently and speedily implementing as many of the measures as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority is the standardised collection of data. If we want to exchange detailed information accurately between one Member State and another, between the Member States and the Commission and with third states, we need data in standard formats, and to take appropriate steps towards having a standardised data system at our disposal. We also urgently need the means to exchange this information with countries of origin and with transit countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to implement a common asylum policy, common immigration policy measures and a return policy. Our expectation is that the Treaty will be adhered to and that the Irish Presidency will indeed manage, by May 2004 to decide on and adopt the necessary items of asylum legislation, so that we can comply with the Treaty and take the necessary political action to get a common asylum law. That will mean speedy decision-making on our part if refugees are to be helped and action taken. That is the second aspect of controlled and legal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">As our next priority, we should introduce documents that are difficult to counterfeit or falsify. I welcome the new requirement for biometric data to be included on visas and residence permits. We should also be working towards forgery-proof passports and towards the legal framework and technical equipment for the visa information system, which we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly – and then I will finish – there is a need for information to be provided in the countries of origin, in order that suitable instruments may be used against people-smugglers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there are the financial aspects; we have already announced that increased funds will, by 2006, be made available for the visa information system, for the return plan and for border controls, provided that Parliament is given an appropriate say in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Ambitious though all these measures are, we hope that they can be implemented during the term of this Presidency, thus enabling us to guarantee our citizens a secure Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has adopted a position on illegal immigration policy by adopting this own-initiative report by Mr Pirker, whom I congratulate on the results he has achieved. We all agree to support the creation of a European corps of border guards funded at Community level, the creation of which will require a new legal basis. With the proposal of this solution, the proposal to set up an independent agency to control our borders automatically lapses. Furthermore, it is a shared opinion that the Community’s borders should remain open to people fleeing forms of repression who then apply for asylum in the Member States of the Union. We also all agree in acknowledging that it is an exclusive right of the Member States, deriving from the principle of subsidiarity, to establish the nature and scale of legal immigration, but a common social integration policy is now essential in an area of security, common policy, social relations and economic justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is worth noting that the debate in the Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs came to the conclusion that bilateral readmission agreements between Member States and countries of origin and transit should, if possible, be replaced with truly Community-wide agreements, perhaps recognised by all the Member States without exception – in other words, without any opting-out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in this common area of European commitment on immigration, I am pleased to recall – as the rapporteur also did when closing his speech – an initiative that complements this effort to combat illegal immigration. This is the regulation that came into force on 1 January this year – just a few days ago – that will spend EUR 250 million over five years financing the efforts of third countries to combat illegal immigration at source. The aim of this initiative is first to inform, and then to instruct and help to give people who intend to emigrate a thorough understanding of the value of legal emigration and all the risks involved in illegal immigration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission welcomes the support that the Pirker Report gives to the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">The main policy recommendations put forward in the communication were endorsed by the European Council in Thessaloniki and further developed at its meeting in Brussels in October 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">A major boost was therefore given in 2003 towards completing the policy framework for common management of migratory flows. Nevertheless, these positive developments must be complemented by substantial progress in other areas of migration policy, and in particular legal migration and asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has proved to be capable of delivering what was announced in the communication and requested by the Council in Thessaloniki, and moreover within very tight deadlines in some cases. I could refer to the Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders. Other proposals, such as visa information systems, a financial instrument for return management and a proposal for a directive on minimum standards for return procedures, will follow soon.</p>
<p class="contents">Following political agreement on the main elements regarding the External Borders Agency, it is now important that the Council armed with the opinion of the European Parliament formally adopt the proposal as soon as possible. This would allow the Commission to start the preparatory work for setting up the agency in the spring of this year, with the target of having the agency operational by January 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a visa information system is another important development. The need for such a system was mentioned in our communication on illegal immigration in 2001. The Thessaloniki European Council asked the Council and the Commission to focus on the legal and technical arrangements for the development of the VIS.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is expected to agree very soon on the basic elements of the system, including its architecture and functions, taking into account financial aspects and the choice of biometric identifiers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to present the first instrument for the development of the VIS in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding biometrics, the Commission has already submitted two proposals to amend the uniform format applying to visas and residence permits for third-country nationals so that biometric identifiers for such documents can be taken into account in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has arrived at a common approach to these proposals, pending the opinion of the European Parliament. Other future proposals in this field, such as the one on European Union passports, must be guided by the coherent approach in particular with respect to the biometric identifiers chosen which was defended in our communication and endorsed by the European Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim of managing migratory flows is in fact rooted in the illusion of strict regulation, something which has proved impossible in the last several years. Few countries have admitted to the limitations, let alone the failure, of the programmes they intended putting in place. Those programmes are no match for the problems posed by the complexity and diversity of the flows, which encompass traditional movements of labour, people fleeing poverty and asylum seekers. National traditions, cultural peculiarities, massive or residual xenophobia and a greater or lesser openness to the claims of minorities explain the differences between the Member States’ immigration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Refugee status is particularly attractive when immigration or staying in a country legally has become virtually impossible, and it is in fact the only door that stands ajar for entry to many of our countries. The many attempts to take advantage of it by persons not strictly covered by the Geneva Convention but who fall into the much wider category of economic migrants, attempts which are sometimes exploited by organised crime, have cast suspicion on all applicants and provided a pretext for considerable restrictions on the right to asylum, which is appalling. Having on our territory people with no rights, with absolutely no security, in fear of being reported to the authorities, reduced to feeding the profitable illegal labour market or resorting to petty crime, but who nevertheless prefer that situation to the risk of being returned to their countries of origin, in fact raises inevitable social, moral and legal questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Undoubtedly, this problem needs to be tackled as one affecting all Europeans. It is also clear that we cannot arrive at a rational policy by being guided by narrow national interests alone. With rising populism symptomatic of xenophobia, many fear seeing the common treatment of the immigration issue take on a dangerously repressive hue, although we know full well that such a policy is no answer to the problems but that, quite the contrary, it risks enflaming them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by saying that stepping up the fight against terrorism must not be allowed to affect the integrity of our immigration and asylum policies and in particular the substantial development of our national integration policies. Immigration is a reality and we will always have to deal with flows of migrants into Europe seeking work or fleeing persecution. Illegal immigration will not be eliminated simply by opening channels for legal immigration, that is true, but legal immigration may help to give a positive direction to our society’s development. Migration is a phenomenon of the contemporary world. We cannot evade our responsibilities as rich nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To an extent, the mix of subjects renders the report impractical and difficult to place in relation to the real world, but that is in no way Mr Pirker’s fault.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, I am able to support the report’s overall objective of strengthening cooperation and coordination within the EU in these essential and cross-border areas of policy. The report nonetheless contains a proposal that I find too far-reaching: that of establishing a federal European corps of border guards which – in contrast to, for example, Europol – would have extensive operational authority to use its powers. I am opposed to the creation of a federal corps of border guards.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the principle of subsidiarity, I do not think that the Commission is able to document either the effect of, or the operational need for, a federal corps of border guards. Secondly, I think it is too early to establish such a corps. We still do not know what would be the effects of the many sensible proposals, such as those for increased cooperation and coordination between the Member States’ customs and border authorities. In particular, no account has been taken of the encouraging fact that we are now working towards a better distribution of the financial burden. Thirdly, there is simply no legal basis in the existing Treaties for a federal corps of border guards and, even if the Convention’s proposals for new Treaty wordings were adopted, it is doubtful if there would be a legal basis for such a corps.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that, in its present form, the proposal to introduce an EU corps of border guards simply proposes a model according to which the Member States might voluntarily make use of this force. At the same time, it is clear, however, that, if the introduction of a corps of border guards were to have any meaning at all, the Commission would, in the long term, plan to delegate a number of EU tasks to that body. In other words, the common corps of border guards would, to an increasing degree, come under general EU legislation, and the voluntary element would thus quickly become illusory. With regard to the proposals concerning the biometric data, I do not wish to comment in more detail upon these at the present time. I am myself rapporteur for the report on which Parliament is to adopt a position, and it will not be long before we have a debate on it.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I recommend, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we vote in favour of the motion for a resolution in the report. At the same time, it is, however, crucial for me to emphasise that what I want is a common policy in this area and not a common police force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the European Commission’s efforts to develop genuine European policies on immigration and asylum. Despite all these efforts, the Tampere agenda will not, however, be kept to. Many of the Commission’s proposals are at present pending before the Council. The few measures that have been taken come in for regular criticism and the directive on family reunification is still the subject of an appeal by our Parliament before the Court of Justice. For some time now, we have noted with regret that the driving force behind immigration and asylum policy has been the security of the Member States above all. In reality, this results in an intensive and often disproportionate struggle against illegal immigration, which is considered a threat, a source of terrorism and a destabilising factor.</p>
<p class="contents">That is therefore the vision of the Council and the Member States, a highly security-conscious, repressive and utilitarian vision geared to their own needs and disregarding the needs of others. The proliferation of border control authorities is an illustration of this. While it is legitimate for the Union to want to protect its residents and its interests, the Member States must be aware that only an overall, integrated approach will produce an effective European policy. For that, such an approach must at one and the same time include a management of migratory flows that allows legal immigration, the socio-economic, cultural and political integration of third country nationals and cooperation with third countries in a Community framework. Fighting illegal immigration means above all protecting its victims, in particular fighting the trafficking in human beings and the networks of unscrupulous smugglers. To this end, we call on the Member States to ratify the Palermo Convention. To date, only Denmark, France and Spain have done so.</p>
<p class="contents">Illegal immigration will not dry up so long as there are still such yawning economic and political gaps between North and South. People are right to want to flee horrendous situations. All too often, the democratic deficit goes hand in hand with the social and humanitarian deficit. We must not, however, bury our heads in the sand: illegal immigration is also a necessity for our economy. Today, all liberal policies argue for a return to a measure of specific immigration. Thus, the countries of the North are allowed to transform the South into a manpower supermarket to meet the needs of its enterprises for a specific period. This effectively plunders the productive forces of the South.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s policy for fighting illegal immigration will not be credible without measures to combat moonlighting, but instead of penalising those who come to our countries looking for hope, we should be penalising employers who shamelessly exploit immigrants who have no papers. On the other hand, such a policy must regularise those immigrants’ situations, recognise them, give them rights, give them the means to fight against discrimination and exclusion and make them our equals.</p>
<p class="contents">Any returning of people whose situation is irregular must fully respect their human rights and comply with international conventions, including the right to seek asylum. The European Parliament will shortly be deciding on the Italian initiative which seeks to coordinate expulsions of aliens by using joint European charters. We clearly condemn such a project, which neither complies with our international commitments nor respects basic rights. Readmission agreements can be an adequate framework for a return policy only if they take sufficient account both of the interests of the third countries and the wishes and plans of the person concerned. For that to happen, they must be given genuine assisted returns so that they can be fully reintegrated both socially and economically.</p>

While the Member States must specifically retain their competences regarding the security of their external borders and the establishment of domestic immigration quotas, it is equally necessary and urgent to set up effective transnational cooperation to create a common <span class="italic">modus operandi</span> on visas, border control and repatriation, as the rapporteur has underlined.</p>
<p class="contents">An effective coordination policy, the harmonisation of certain procedures and the prompt exchange of information would make it possible to combat illegal immigration more effectively, as well as many other criminal activities that are linked to it: drug trafficking and trafficking in human beings, to give just a couple of examples. It is worth recalling that an intransigent policy of combating illegal immigration would not only give Europe’s citizens greater confidence and security but would also allow all legal immigrants to enjoy their rights and opportunities to the full.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it should be underlined that the European Union should strengthen its external relations with all those non-Community countries that want to collaborate effectively in combating illegal immigration and should also promote the so-called special quota policy for such countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe it is mere rhetoric, then, to recall that we must direct our greatest efforts to a strong cooperation and development policy, which will in general help most to contain immigration and stop the outflow of people and hence of manpower, as well as the brain drain, from the countries of origin, not only to avoid draining the developing countries of human resources but also to avoid condemning them to certain, irreversible economic and social decline. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission explains what has happened to date and aims to set out guidelines for the future. In so doing, it focuses on a number of points that it considers essential in bringing about an effective policy. I should like to give a few examples of these.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is visa policy, where the Commission rightly advocates the prompt establishment of the Visa Information System (VIS). Making documents unforgeable is vitally important to a secure system, and, therefore, there is a need for a clear choice of one or more biometric identifiers that will be stored in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is external borders policy, within which the Commission proposes a European Corps of Border Guards under its own aegis. As far as we are concerned, that is going too far. I agree with Mr Sørensen in that regard. The protection of external borders remains, in principle, a national concern. Cooperation is necessary, but this cooperation can also take a less far-reaching form than the Commission is proposing. The Commission rightly emphasises the importance of a common return policy to the credibility of European immigration and asylum policy, but I cannot see the connection that seems to be made between permitting legal immigration on the one hand, and a direct decrease in asylum seekers and illegal immigration on the other. I wish to join the rapporteur, Mr Pirker, in emphasising that the Member States have an exclusive right to lay down provisions governing whether or not to permit legal immigration. I am not yet convinced by the Council’s proposal to agree legal immigration quotas, particularly if this is done in order to achieve a better outcome of negotiations on readmission agreements with third countries. Individual Member States must at all events retain the option of prohibiting all legal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I fully support the Commission’s wish that the budgetary dimension of the solidarity principle be recognised in the field of immigration and border controls, provided that this principle is also recognised in other fields, such as asylum policy and the reception of refugees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An integrated and global approach must be developed, in order to prevent and eradicate this phenomenon and to combat its underlying causes. The Tampere Council called for a common asylum and immigration policy; at Laeken and Seville the need was confirmed to effectively combat illegal immigration and an initial balance sheet was drawn up of the progress that has been made in this field in the framework of the Thessaloniki decisions, which lay behind this initiative. I wish to congratulate Mr Pirker on the excellent report he has presented to us. I agree with him when he emphasises the need for a universal and coherent approach. There are eight points that I wish to highlight:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, the existence of legal channels of immigration that enable the citizens of third countries to enter the European Union on the basis of each Member State’s capacity to receive people, This will require closer cooperation with the countries of origin;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, integrating legal immigrants who live and work in the European Union by means of a common social integration policy that strikes a balance between the rights and the corresponding obligations of these citizens and the host societies;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, the joint management of migratory flows, in particular visa policy, because agreement must be reached as swiftly as possible on the necessary legal, technical and financial bases of the visa information system (VIS);</p>
<p class="contents">- fourthly, improving controls at the external borders, which means creating a European border guard;</p>
<p class="contents">- fifthly, the much-trumpeted European asylum system;</p>
<p class="contents">- in sixth place, negotiating readmission agreements, with a common policy for returning persons in an illegal situation, with minimum rules for return procedures and the mutual recognition of these decisions, and with the co-financing of projects for cooperation under a programme of aid for return;</p>
<p class="contents">- in seventh place, combating trafficking in human beings, calling to account those who profit from this business and providing support for the victims of trafficking. It is worth highlighting the importance of increasing operational support for Europol in preventing and combating this type of trafficking;</p>
<p class="contents">- my eighth and final point is the fight against illegal immigration, which means investing in information on prospects for legal immigration that provide a genuine alternative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, as is customary I would like to begin my remarks by congratulating the rapporteur. This is done with a bit more sincerity than is sometimes the case as I can give great credit to Mr Pirker. If he had asked me whether it was possible to draft a report on immigration or asylum for our committee and win almost unanimous support for it, or bring it to plenary and find that with a few exceptions it was voted through, I would have said that would have been impossible. However, by sleight of hand and various other tactics, he seems to have managed to present something that is going to command support across Parliament. He deserves credit for that, as do the Commission and the Council for the way it has been presented and brought forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pirker and others have highlighted particular aspects and it would be easy to draw attention to them. Indeed, there is a lot to concentrate on, but I do hope that this report is seen as part of a wider package and that we do not lose sight of our overall aim of moving towards not only a common European policy on asylum but also, in parallel, a separate and equally important common European policy on legal immigration. This is reinforced in points 16 and 17.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn now to the aspect of external borders – points 2, 3, 4 and 5, etc. – and cooperation amongst Member States. I take issue with Mr Blokland and Mr Sørensen, who claim this is entirely a subsidiarity question. Everyone is affected by external borders, even in countries that do not have them. The very nature of migration is such that people do not stay in the first country they get to; they move around. So it is very important for all countries to cooperate and work together, especially, as Mr Pirker has highlighted, in an enlarged European Union of 25 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As we ponder all these issues, it is equally important that we look further afield to those countries just outside the European Union and bear in mind their situation, as well as that of countries further afield which are less prosperous and from which people, for a whole variety of reasons, try to move away. This picks up on a point also alluded to by Mrs Roure.</p>
<p class="contents">If priorities and finances were directed towards helping these less-developed countries and those in internal conflict, we might be doing as much to address the challenges of migration as we are in all the post-Seville and Thessaloniki projects that have been put into operation.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this report. It is a move in the right direction and I hope very much that it commands the support of Parliament tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is linguistic and I have made it before. I hope we can in future move away from the term 'burden-sharing' and adopt the term 'responsibility-sharing', because that, and cooperation, is what is involved here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to say that Mr Pirker's report turns that tendency on its head. In a report responding to a Commission communication specifically on illegal immigration, he pays a great deal of attention to how opening up legal migration channels can help combat smuggling and trafficking. Indeed, in his report, on which I also congratulate him, there are 15 references to illegal immigration. That is nearly matched by 11 references to legal migration. This is truly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mr Sørensen, I cannot share Mr Pirker's enthusiasm for a European corps of border guards. No-one seems to be clear what this means. Mr Pirker says it would just be a unit in support of national border guards and not a supranational body replacing them, but some Commission documents suggest that the ultimate aim is indeed some sort of supranational force with power over national authorities. It is dangerous to start going down this route without having a clear idea about the final destination. Obviously we need to have maximum coordination and exchanges to provide a more uniform level of security at external borders, but there is plenty more we can do about that before rushing into a centrally managed EU body that would raise all kinds of legal difficulties regarding border guards exercising power outside their own jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">There could be very practical problems. Imagine, for example, the case of Euro-guards stationed on a border where local pay rates were lower than elsewhere, and the resentment that would create among lower-paid local staff. We are already seeing that sort of thing in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I urge the British Government to recognise the contradictions in its own approach. It constantly lectures other Member States on the need to strengthen external border controls, but refuses to make any constructive contribution to Schengen or to support the common immigration policy. This ambivalence cannot continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are some interesting aspects in it that I can support, but the issue of the creation of border guards with police powers is a disturbing development. One of the issues that has not really been taken into account is the control and accountability of these police guards. This is the wrong direction to take.</p>
<p class="contents">In general there is too much emphasis on turning this matter into a criminal issue. I listened to the speaker from the UEN Group, who lumped illegal immigrants in with drugs traffickers, but there is a big difference between the two. Illegal immigrants may be illegal, but they are still just ordinary people and not criminals. All they are doing is desperately trying to find somewhere to live.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole emphasis on keeping people out has to be addressed. We should in fact be addressing the issue of why people want to enter the European Union, instead of building our barricades higher. More and more people are being driven into the hands of people traffickers and, as my colleague has said, the whole issue of work practices and exploitation needs to be tackled. We have to examine, with regard to illegal immigration, the root cause of why people have to leave their own country, and this is a human rights issue rather than a criminal issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Innovative, as the report states, in the close interaction between, on the one hand, enhanced measures against illegal immigration and, on the other, a policy in the field of legal immigration that is geared towards Member States’ capacities and needs. Promoting common asylum and return policies and introducing more secure documents or undertaking awareness-raising campaigns in the countries of transit and of origin of illegal immigration are areas in which innovation can be demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">What, furthermore, do we understand by the term ‘responsible policy? It does not necessarily mean consolidating our external borders, turning the Union into a fortress, but nor does it mean opening up these borders willy-nilly, leaving to their fate the individuals who are anxious to enter our countries. Reality has shown that neither of these methods is up to the task and we therefore want to see rules of entry that enable us to be generous in integrating immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where our social concerns arise. We do not want these people to live in our countries without being integrated, without participating, benefiting or having obligations towards the Community that they are joining. It is this dialogue between rights and obligations, defining the way people function within society, that we want to maintain. Realistically speaking, reception implies a mutual benefit for the individual and for the host State. This common policy will, however, be less efficient if supported by only one of the parties involved and we therefore welcome the cooperation agreements with the countries of origin and of transit that have just been concluded. We cannot agree in the same way, however, to the planned creation of a European Corps of Border Guards, which needs to be discussed at greater length.</p>
<p class="contents">We do welcome, though, the option to include in these agreements economic or commercial measures, which would only enter into force if the agreements were complied with. This is a question of honouring commitments that have been given. I will conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on the excellent contribution he has made to promoting a responsible, tough and generous Community policy on the movement of people, with the participation of all the parties involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
