<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Galeote Quecedo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, despite the changes, or perhaps because of them, we in the Community institutions must reaffirm our political commitment to strengthening integration. The European Parliament has often reiterated the need for the European Union to play a solid role on the international stage and to be able to speak consistently in that context. To this end, the Maastricht reform drew up the CFSP and for the same purpose various proposals are currently being considered with a view to 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, for the European Union to consolidate its external role, it is necessary, firstly, to organise and strengthen the external policy instruments which the Union already has and, in particular, its external service.</p>
<p class="contents">We must accept that the external service, which currently has such important functions, suffers from numerous shortcomings which have not been surmounted, despite the reforms promoted by the European Commission itself, and, therefore, this Parliament last September approved the own-initiative report ‘Common European Diplomacy’, with a view to greater efficiency in the exercise of the Union’s external policy. At that time we proposed moving ahead decisively on three fronts: firstly, improving the training of Community officials destined to be involved in external activity through the creation, eventually, of a Community diplomatic school and the linking of national diplomatic corps through a system of ‘walkways’ which would be created for that purpose. Secondly, we proposed the clarification and development of the legal status of delegations, their role and their relationship with the institutions; and, lastly, we proposed the improvement of the coordination between the delegations and the external services of the Member States, for which we suggested, amongst other things, promoting the grouping together of the missions of Member States who so desire with the Commission’s delegation whenever, wherever and however possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, Commissioner Patten told this House that he would consider those recommendations very carefully and would prepare a communication on the external services during the first half of 2001, which we are eagerly awaiting.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while waiting for more ambitious initiatives, Parliament must now give its opinion on the latest communication from the Commission on the development of the external service, which clearly has a much more limited objective, since it basically focuses on the network of delegations and their staff. It is a welcome communication nevertheless, since it allows us to open a debate on that important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">In this communication the Commission confirms its will to make progress on decentralisation and on the deconcentration of external aid. This can only be seen as positive even though it requires greater human resources and therefore an increase in costs, which, I believe, we must contribute to. We indicate, however, that not all the difficulties in the operation of the delegations and the management of external aid are caused by the lack of resources. The Commission must also adopt additional measures, such as contracting policies, training plans and a review of procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the network of delegations, the Commission’s proposal to move ahead with regionalisation seems appropriate, although we must consider opening up new delegations in certain countries of South-East Asia, the Gulf region and Latin America, as well as Switzerland. In this context, we must express our concern at the recent rumour that the Commission is considering the possibility of closing its delegation in Costa Rica.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore take a positive view of this communication from the Commission. I believe that it takes us in the right direction, but it clearly does not fully deal with the issue. We hope that in the coming weeks the Commission will approve a new communication, a more ambitious one, which takes account of the opinions of Parliament and finally allows us to rationalise, organise and improve the external service, so that it may become an effective instrument for a solid European Union external policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I say ‘we’, I mean, of course, the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets simply wishes to draw the attention of all those involved to two basic problems. Firstly, there is the need to move quickly. We believe that the reform should be carried out rapidly and ambitiously. Reform means increasing deconcentration and grouping together a certain number of delegations which are fewer in number but better equipped administratively and extended by branch offices with minimum representation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reform means the active vertical redeployment of staff from Brussels to delegations. We are well aware that there is some resistance among Commission staff, resistance of a human, social nature which we understand, as regards this redeployment. This resistance must be broken down.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the problem of horizontal redeployment. There are some delegations which are overworked, and some posts is which there is not enough to do, and we are not always aware of objective criteria having been used to decide on staff distribution.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we need a better balance, a more homogenous balance, between regular Commission staff and local agents who are less costly but who do not have, as it were, the ‘central memory’ of the institution. Both types of staff are necessary and the balance between the two needs to be rationally organised.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, we expect you to proceed more quickly and further in this direction, which we know is the direction you wish to move in. We shall support you in that movement, but we shall oppose you if by any chance you should drag your feet, which I am sure you will not.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I should like to mention quickly is the budgetary aspect. The Committee on Budgets is in favour of a qualitative reform which will give rise to higher costs, because redeployment has to be paid for, but the Committee on Budgets is against any increase in staff numbers in the external services. Costs may rise, yes, but a rise in staff numbers, no, because if we increase staffing levels this would put the brake on redeployment measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has prepared a splendid report, and I am, of course, also glad that he has accepted my action plan in its entirety. I am, in general, very much in favour of the Commission’s plans to provide its delegations with more resources, more employees and more powers but, all too often, we have seen examples of ‘champagne delegations’ which have spent more time in diplomatic clubs than on their real work. In their defence, it may be said that they have had neither powers nor resources under the old system. Many problems with aid projects are due to the fact that the projects are administered centrally from Brussels. In the future, the work is therefore to be done out in the field.</p>
<p class="contents">The new system is still not in place, but 24 delegations have, for the time being, been given direct financial responsibility. I hope that, as soon as possible, we can see the valuable experience gained in, for example, Bosnia transferred to the remainder of the delegations. The idea of giving the delegations more duties and more responsibility does in fact operate in practice, but we have recently seen examples of fraud and irregularities in the delegations in the applicant countries. I am thinking especially of Slovakia and the Czech Republic in this context. The Commission must issue Parliament with supervisory reports on the delegations, but I am not asking to see the reports themselves because I appreciate that they contain sensitive personal information. What I <span class="italic">would</span> like to see, however, are reports on the financial aspects. The Commission has already promised me these in connection with the 1999 discharge, and I now hope that the Commission will go on to deliver the goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the years, their range of tasks and geographical coverage have expanded considerably. Their internal structure has, however, not kept pace with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is a need for radical reform which, despite all of the changes which the European Parliament has been calling for for years, will not be achieved through this Commission communication either. Development policy is no longer the only area of responsibility of the EU's external service, but it is still of huge significance. The dissolution of political blocs and the changing political processes, including in developing countries, have considerably increased the political as well as the trade and economic dimensions of its work. This is particularly true of the development partnership with the ACP countries, into which the Cotonou Agreement has introduced new aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely in this respect, however, that delegation staff lack qualifications and training; it is precisely here that there is a lack of the necessary schemes for flexible personnel deployment, which should definitely allow for the involvement of local graduates or external experts, if necessary with fixed-term contracts for a particular type of task. In practice, however, delegations in the ACP countries have been and are being threatened with downgrading or even closure. Many posts remain unfilled for long periods of time, without suitable local staff being considered at least temporarily. Even the European Court of Auditors criticises this. The Committee on Development and Cooperation therefore sees a danger that the formation of new regional centres and the move towards regional offices – and good reasons can certainly be put forward in favour of this – could in practice lead to a thinning out of delegation structures in developing countries. That regional offices are more economical than several individual offices is obvious. That they are also more effective has not, however, been verified. Here too the conceptual weakness of the Commission communication manifests itself.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of content the Commission is still in debt. Mr Galeote's report and the proposals of the committees which have drafted opinions will provide an excellent basis for paying it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Once again he has tabled an excellent report on the external service and I hope, Commissioner, that you will listen to me and Mr Galeote Quecedo and that in the spirit of his report you will be so good as to give clear answers. I believe – in fact we agree on this – that we need to leave history behind. We need to consider the current functions of the delegation, based on the functions of the Union. We have of course had Maastricht with the second pillar, the foreign and security policy, and we now have increased responsibilities in the field of world trade policy. We therefore need to make sure that delegations are opened in all of those cities which are important political and economic partners.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me back, Commissioner, to the debate of a few minutes ago. I believe that it is precisely in Asia that we need more delegations. Mr Galeote's report proposes Singapore and Taipei as the places where we should open delegations immediately. Coming back to Mr Sakellariou's comments on Taipei, Taiwan is the EU's fourth largest trading partner and an example of how a society in Asia can be transformed, at its own instigation, from an authoritarian regime into a living parliamentary democracy. This is an excellent illustration of the fact that the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights work in Asia and are even something which the countries themselves want. That is why it is high time that we also open an office in Taiwan.</p>
<p class="contents">So, delegations in Singapore and Taiwan, and Mr Galeote also mentioned other regions in the world. What I believe is important now is for you, when you send us the next document, to provide a clear list of countries and dates – in months and years – indicating where and when you think that delegations should be opened. If there is no money then say: we need the money. Then we will have to have a chat about it here and see whether we can have a friendly argument with Mr Bourlanges and win him over. But we need a report in which it clearly states which countries and in which month of which year, and then we will also be able to lend you our support and build up a decent external service for the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation of the Union’s external image has been subject to criticism from various quarters in the last few years and still requires a concerted effort to achieve a major transformation. The interrelation of its various aspects, such as trade, development aid, economics, politics and diplomacy is increasingly apparent in today’s world and must clearly be seen, not so much as something inevitable, but above all, as an opportunity. It is an opportunity for the European Union to improve its presence on the international scene, defending the principles of democracy and human rights, which give legitimacy to this objective. We acknowledge that the concept of this reality underpins the Commission’s concerns to improve its external service, which have been put into practice by the adoption of various communications since 1996. The package as a whole, however, lacks coherence and a great deal remains to be done. I must confess that we are greatly looking forward to the Commission communication on the external service, which Commissioner Patten promised last September to send to Parliament and which, I think, needs to be a strategic framework for important future developments. Although we must not lose sight of the fact that the issue we are considering today is actually very limited, improving and adapting the network of delegations, it has very real implications and, as I already emphasised, also affect the political and diplomatic spheres. What is generally known as the deconcentration and decentralisation of external aid, and its rationalisation, therefore deserves our support, with the concomitant requirements for resources and technical support. Nevertheless, I wish to state that I disagree with the almost excessively realistic aspect that still exists in certain ideas on the international role of the Union in development aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, consequently, like to stress three aspects: firstly, that of the importance of regional cooperation, which must, however, be increased to take account of political balances, processes of transition to democracy and of consolidating democracy and also of the relationship between the various countries themselves. Another aspect linked to this is the need for coherence in fundamental guidelines, so that they do not become tied to and dependent on, sometimes almost exclusively, budgetary restrictions which are not necessarily crucial. A further aspect is the importance of accepting certain political criteria, in particular, acknowledging the role of the various States in the processes of democratisation and in defending human rights in their own region. We call on you to suspend the project to shut down our delegations in these countries, also bearing in mind that the cost of maintaining these delegations is a drop in the ocean.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Galeote Quecedo, considered these and other issues and has produced an excellent piece of work. We therefore support his proposals for a resolution and we hope that the Commission and the Council will consider them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, however, decentralisation is not accompanied by the necessary powers, it might well turn out to be a two-edged sword. The delegations must have the right powers but so too, of course, must the headquarters itself, in the form of both knowledge and a talent for coordination. In my view, that combination is just a touch difficult to detect at the present moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not actually too bothered about diplomatic schools and other such facilities, whatever they are called. I am, in fact, more concerned about more substantive and practical subjects, for example women’s issues and issues relating to ICT, and I should like to illustrate what I mean about the problems in the light of these two subjects. We most certainly have no guarantee, of course, that the delegations have any special knowledge of women’s issues and any special knowledge at all of women’s issues in relation to the developing countries. It might be said that the Commission used not perhaps to have any such knowledge either, but Parliament did, at any rate, then have the opportunity to exercise closer supervision, and that supervisory function declines somewhat when it is farmed out to the various countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is there any guarantee whatsoever that the delegations have any special knowledge of information technology. Certainly, they know how to send e-mails, but information and communications technology is certainly about rather more than just sending e-mails, and when, at the same time, the Commission says that there is absolutely no necessity for any unit in the Commission with specific knowledge of this area but that it is just a question of mainstreaming and general knowledge, then one might well be anxious about how those skills are to be acquired, including in the delegations. I would therefore hope that, in connection with the proposal to be produced by the Commission, the latter will be able to illustrate – for instance, with the help of the two examples I have quoted: women and ICT – how it is imagined that the development will take place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report is in line with the priority shared by the majority of my group and of Parliament: to improve the European Union's presence on the international scene. We see the development of an external service as an instrument to strengthen the EU's foreign policy, although of course we still have to educate our national services in some respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the most embarrassing experiences I have had as an MEP travelling outside the European Union were those very funny meetings with the ambassadors of Member States where the Union delegate is still seen as an external element or, at best, as a sort of trade or economic attaché. We are happy that the Galeote report includes our amendment asking the presidency-in-office to take some responsibility for verifying the willingness of Member States' embassies to cooperate with the EU delegations and enhance their role for creating a real common European voice.</p>
<p class="contents">An improved Commission external service will bring the greatest benefits if we manage to set up a real common foreign and political service at European level. The first step in this direction would be to make Mr CFSP part of the Commission: this is necessary if we are to have a common voice in the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When one leaves the European Union, it is shocking to experience the paradox that the Union has a strong image from the outside despite having a practically non-existent image from within. The necessary coordination does not exist within the European Union. It is therefore essential for the Union to put its all its weight behind the external services and coordination. In this respect, we must accept that, with a miserly budget, we are not going to be able to achieve the image, the appropriate coordination, an unequivocal presence in the UNO, or in other international bodies, and we should therefore revise the financial perspectives in that direction. We should also concentrate on greater coordination of the information received so that we do not have to witness such sad spectacles as the Member States giving differing opinions. That is why it is important to take the direction indicated by Mr Galeote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission, as our rapporteur points out, quite rightly, ‘does not appear to be aware’ that cooperation with Member States’ diplomatic services is ‘totally inadequate’. He emphasises that the partnership programme created so that diplomats and officials from Member States could be seconded to the delegations has so far had very disappointing results: only seven national diplomats have been appointed to Community delegations under this scheme</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of moving towards the development of a Community external service which is completely independent from those of the Member States, which would give rise to considerable extra costs, particularly as regards training, pointless redundancies and inevitable conflicting responsibilities, the sensible thing to do would be to make use, at Community level, of the experience acquired in a bilateral context, particularly in the aid and cooperation service, the competence and expertise available within the national external services, and their familiarity with the diplomatic practices of their members. We would then avoid the doubts, and the risk of drifting off course, which are linked to the concept of the development of a Community diplomatic service which would be composed, <span class="italic">ex nihilo, </span>of officials totally outside the national diplomatic services, which some people, looking at the matter from the point of view of substitution rather than complementarity, would like to see developing at the same time and completely separately.</p>
<p class="contents">Effectiveness and subsidiarity, on the other hand, require that we should move beyond the partnership programme and its current failure, and show some initiative and imagination, so as to create a real osmosis, at the level of human resources, between the embassies of Member States and the Community delegations, in order to encourage the development, in harmonious complementarity, of the closest possible relations with our external partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I refer on the one hand to the need to improve the Commission's efficiency in achieving its priority tasks and on the other hand the ambition to create some sort of EU diplomatic service. The emphasis should be on the first of these, and this is reflected very much in paragraph 1 of the Galeote report which, and I quote: "Insists that the overriding priority for the external service of the Commission must be the efficient organisation and management of EU external assistance programmes".</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when enlargement of the Union is a priority – and we have large-scale pre-accession aid programmes to assist this process – it is essential that we have the right number of staff with the right qualifications delivering and monitoring this assistance. The Commission obviously recognises the priority of reforming external assistance management, as we have seen over the last year or so. But according to some estimates, there is a shortfall of something like 1 254 posts dealing with priority policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not require more generalists and diplomats in its delegation, it needs competent managers, particularly those with expertise in tendering, contracting and, above all, project implementation; personnel with business experience perhaps. I wonder if the Commission's recruitment and retirement procedures reflect this priority?</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Council regulation on the early retirement of some 600 officials is under consideration at the moment. I would like to know what steps the Commission is taking to recruit the right sort of people to replace those officials who will be retiring early. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The importance of his work is accentuated by two factors which have arisen simultaneously in recent times. On the one hand, the role, which is increasingly recognised and accepted by the Union, which we have to play on the globalised international stage, and, on the other hand, the cooperation which we must promote in pursuit of a North-South rebalance and which finds its most obvious embodiment within the framework of the new Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">As a member of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I would like to support what Karin Junker said in her opinion, highlighting the essential fact that our external service contributes to the success of those countries which, through development, are seeking freedom and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Through the amendments approved by the Committee on Development and Cooperation we ask that the rationalisation of the external service should not mean the closure of delegations in the developing countries. The reform must take place with a view to increasing the efficiency of action rather than according to exclusively financial criteria. To this end, the Commission must be present on the ground, the officials must have direct contact with the reality of under-development, with the development agents and the local authorities, and very much increasing support for, and support from, both local and European NGOs. The creation of delegations with a regional scope is not an acceptable alternative to the closure of delegations in countries such as Cape Verde or Costa Rica.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask that the multi-annual programmes for delegations, announced by the Commission, take account of the development objectives, that local staff be employed, that the officials have specific training and that greater coordination between the Commission delegations and the representations of the Member States be sought.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it would be very positive to open a delegation in a country such as Cuba, which is a pre-candidate to the signing of the Cotonou Agreement and which has been accepted for membership by our partners in the ACP Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore in favour of increasing the number of delegations and increasing their staff numbers in line with their increased responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, cooperation on development should remain the priority of the delegations in developing countries, in particular as regards the planning of aid programmes. It is important that the representatives who negotiate on behalf of the Commission should be on the spot and in direct contact with the real situation. In order to do this they should develop relations with the local NGOs and with society in general, so that they can get to know and integrate the priority needs of communities, and not only those of governments in these indicative programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to consultation, we must also increase the number of local agents in the delegations. It is vitally important that the delegation staff should have an extremely good knowledge of local conditions and should be able to speak regional languages, so as to maintain a permanent link with the various levels of the local community.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the delegations must propose special training programmes for local experts so as to encourage their recruitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is urgently necessary to recruit staff who are qualified in social and environmental matters, which have so far been the poor relations of the aid and development programmes drawn up in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Surely there can be no doubt that this is a particularly serious question which touches on a fundamental aspect of the work of the European Union, i.e. the common foreign and security policy and, hence, the active and efficient presence of the Union on the international stage and its ability to play a leading role in a consistent, coordinated manner, quite independent of any factors extraneous to Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, this objective cannot be achieved without a suitable, operational tool. And this tool is none other than a well organised external diplomatic service, with specialised and highly trained cadres to man the Union's delegations or embassies so that, by operating within an institutionalised regulatory framework of relations with the European Parliament and the Council, they can develop into real representatives of Union policy and interests and of the interests of the Member States as a whole. And in order for this to happen, the diplomatic services and delegations of the Union and of the Member States will need to be properly coordinated. The report anticipates this by making provision for a system of cooperation and agreement to be developed between these services.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, all this needs resources and a great deal of money, which will obviously need to be provided transparently and by carefully weighting requirements and the expediency and usefulness of each item of expenditure, accompanied by a real desire to strengthen the external service so as to ensure that it has the means to fulfil its mission productively.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, special attention must be paid, as the report notes, to arrangements governing relations between the external service and delegations and the European Parliament, both as regards having systemised contacts, with reports and appearances by the heads of the delegations in Parliament and its competent committees, and as regards some of the delegations taking on the job of providing assistance in connection with visits and missions by members of the European Parliament to third countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite appropriate that we should be reforming the Commission's foreign delegations and examining how they can perform in a much more efficient way, hopefully in the context of a much more coherent common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In that context I would like to make some very brief points. Firstly, with regard to my own experience with the Commission's delegation offices when I was in Sri Lanka, it was excellent to have it as a backup. It was very helpful to us in discharging our work and coordinating the various EU ambassadors in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">In some other experiences I have had with the Commission's external offices I sometimes felt that they can get too close to the local political administration and are somewhat reluctant to take a strong stance on policy and political issues. It must be made absolutely clear that any of our delegation offices are there not simply to have a cosy relationship with the local administration but to represent EU policy in the wider sense.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point, and I am sure it has already been made by my colleague, Georg Jarzembowski, is whether the Commission would respond positively to our repeated request for the establishment of a delegation office in Taiwan. We have pussyfooted on that issue for far too long. We should have the courage of our convictions and I hope that the Commissioner would respond positively to the proposal that there should be an office in Taiwan sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should not forget the important contribution of the Committee on Budgets, with the ever-wise Mr Bourlanges as rapporteur, the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control – I have enjoyed discussing these matters with Mr Blak – and not least the opinion of the Committee on Development and Cooperation drafted by Mrs Junker.</p>
<p class="contents">All these documents are also timely as the Commission is now finalising its communication to Parliament on further developments of the external service as a follow-up to the one we presented last July. I can assure Parliament that the recommendations made in the report are extremely important for the Commission. I also take them as an encouraging sign that Parliament shares our ambition to make the external service an even more effective instrument of our external policy. We will, of course, continue to report regularly to Parliament on the progress we make.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me offer a number of observations. First, this Parliament stresses its wish to clarify its relations with the external delegations. The House may remember that this point was already raised when we discussed Mr Galeote Quecedo's report on a common Community diplomacy last September. I assured this House that although delegations are formally delegations of the Commission, we have made it absolutely clear that they should regard themselves as serving Parliament, the High Representative and the other Community institutions as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to some of the points that were made during the debate, of course it is the case that our delegations and the embassies of Member States have to coordinate their activities far more successfully. This is something that we have debated in the Council. The delegations should indeed help to arrange programmes for visiting parliamentary delegations and committees. I also agree that it would be useful for heads of delegations to appear occasionally before the Committee on Foreign Affairs and other committees of Parliament when they are back in Brussels to report on recent developments in their host countries and the development of European Union policy and programmes there.</p>
<p class="contents">A second major concern of this Parliament is the so-called deconcentration of our operational activities. That, as the House knows, is jargon for devolving authority and responsibility where it belongs, to the people in the field. Parliament will remember that this move to more deconcentration was an explicit commitment of the Commission in its communication of May last year on the external assistance reform, reiterated in the July communication on the external service.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the middle of the first wave of the deconcentration exercise. Deconcentration concepts have been established for each major programme. Staff requirements have been assessed for each delegation. Officials are in the process of being selected and trained. Last, but not least, accounting and management systems are being interconnected between headquarters and the delegations concerned. More then 20 delegations will be strengthened this year, another 30 or so next year and the remaining ones in 2003 and 2004. I will, of course, report to this House in more detail on deconcentration later in the year, but generally speaking the work is on schedule.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one point that I want to emphasise very strongly. There is nothing whatsoever to be said for deconcentration while retaining a collection of mothers-in-law in Brussels. If one is going to deconcentrate, then that means management of programmes on the ground. It does not mean many people second-guessing the people on the ground back in Brussels. The problem of <span class="italic">double emploi</span>, the problem of whether or not we are really going to deconcentrate, is one I feel very strongly about. As far as I am concerned and as far as the board of EuropeAid is concerned, it is imperative to ensure that among our performance indicators there is one which gives us an indication of progress made in moving all the management of projects into the delegations, where it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen, as somebody pointed out in the debate, the success of deconcentration in Sarajevo and I want to see that success replicated elsewhere, but deconcentration is not just a question of numbers and procedures. To be successful it requires a real change of administrative culture in the external services of the Commission, at headquarters and in delegations. In this respect, the rapporteur's insistence on the need to improve and develop our training programmes is very opportune. Although I am the first to admit that there is still room for improvement in this area, serious efforts have been made and will be continued. I had the opportunity to take a look at the training programme for our external staff and I was very impressed by it. It covers not only policy areas such as trade and CFSP, but also practical day-to-day topics and modern management techniques. It does, of course, need to include all the subjects which are loosely described as gender mainstreaming, to which the honourable Member referred in the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the EuropeAid Cooperation Office has set up a very ambitious training programme specifically for the deconcentration exercise. Parliament may also be interested to know that the first pilot session of the European Diplomatic Programme, which is a common training programme for European diplomats sponsored jointly by the Member States and the Commission, has recently been assessed and deemed to be successful. The second session is starting this autumn. This initiative may not be based precisely on the model of a college of European diplomacy, which the Mr Galeote espoused in his report last autumn; but it is a sensible step forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also aware that the House is expecting to be fully informed by the Commission on the redeployment of human resources, regionalisation of the network and the opening or closing of delegations – a point which I want to return at the end of my remarks. As these points still have to be decided by the College, I will merely say to the House that the recommendations made in the reports now under discussion will be carefully examined and analysed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me comment on the proposed action plan. Some of its points, such as the proposal that starting in June of this year each head of delegation signs an annual declaration that adequate internal controls have been put in place, will be considered in the follow-up to the recent discharge resolution. The House should be aware that heads of delegation already have to sign the new charter of authorising officers, which sets out the tasks entrusted to them, their obligations and their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Other points the House makes concerning, for example, mission statements, redeployment, new delegations, monitoring and evaluation will be tackled in the communication on the development of the external service, which we will be bringing forward shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the message is clear. We take the reform and development of the external service very seriously. I have said since I took up office that I want to see the emergence of a modern, effective and streamlined service, working as an integral part of the external relations structures of the Commission, and at the service of all the institutions of the Union. This is still my objective, shared by my colleagues and by the senior management in the external relations services of the Commission. But it is a long haul. It must build on the trust and motivation of the staff, many of them working in difficult conditions far away from their colleagues at headquarters. It requires careful planning, training and not least funding. I trust that we can count on Parliament's support and understanding in the work still ahead of us.</p>
<p class="contents">One or two honourable Members asked us not to be short of ambition, to be more ambitious in what we do. I just want to make one very obvious point to Parliament, which may be a little prosaic. Ambition depends on two things. First of all, ambition depends on having the money to actually implement your ambitions. Secondly, ambition depends on being prepared to take tough political decisions in order to achieve your ambitions. One of my ambitions, and this may be regarded by some as an eccentricity, is to try to ensure that the ambitions in the area for which I am responsible are matched by the funds that we actually have to spend on them.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to see us being prepared to take the tough political decisions that are required to modernise our external service. But with great respect to the House, it is no good the House on one side telling me that we can never close a delegation; then on the other side people tell us that we should open new delegations and the whole House agreeing that there should be a limit on the number of delegations we can have. In the past Parliament has insisted that there should be a ceiling on the number of delegations. I do not object to that, provided that if we have to close some delegations in order to open others, we have the understanding and support of the House.</p>
<p class="contents">But if we are to be ambitious, as I would like to be, there has to be an understanding between the Commission and Parliament as well as between the Commission and the Council. We have to be absolutely open about any tough decisions we have to make. Then all of us together have to share in taking the political responsibility for those decisions. Please do not let us get into a situation in which everybody wants to be ambitious but nobody is actually prepared to spend the money to be ambitious or to take the necessary political decisions. I am looking forward to this debate and to Parliament's understanding as we try together to create the sort of external service which the European Union deserves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
