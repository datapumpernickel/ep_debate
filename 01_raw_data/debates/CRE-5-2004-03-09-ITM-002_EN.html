I acknowledge in particular the admirable efforts made by Mrs Paulsen on this important initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal establishes rules on the organisation of official controls on feed, food and live animals to be respected by the Member States and it defines the tasks of the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office. It takes into account the principles of a risk-based approach to a comprehensive and integrated food and feed chain from farm to fork, including controls within the Community as well as controls on feed and food imported from third countries. It streamlines the primary responsibility for food and feed safety at the level of the business operators and it strengthens the role of the competent authorities through stricter enforcement mechanisms within the existing control systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all the proposal aims to improve the efficiency of controls undertaken by both the Member States and the Commission. It defines tougher enforcement measures. It also creates a framework to support developing countries in meeting important requirements and provides for a financial framework to organise activities that enhance food and feed safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I underline in particular Mrs Paulsen's strenuous efforts to adopt the proposal at first reading. I share the very same aim and hope that it succeeds. Cooperation between the three institutions on this proposal has been excellent and again much of this is due to Mrs Paulsen, the driving force in bringing the three institutions together.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the majority of the European Parliament are now taking a convergent view on this text, which I am glad to accept in its entirety.</p>

Will, knowledge and cooperation are required. I wish to thank all those of my fellow MEPs who have contributed their opposition to, and support for, this process. It has been hard, but it has been extremely constructive.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall address some of the aspects that are most important to me about the proposal. One such aspect is its scope. I am exceptionally fortunate that the inspections now extend to include animal health and welfare. That probably constitutes Parliament’s greatest success in this hugely sensitive area about which the electorates in all our countries are extremely concerned. Another aspect is the transport of animals through Europe, and it is important that this is at least included in the control programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has also contributed the control of labelling while the inspections are under way. The Member States’ own control programmes must state that the inspectors’ tasks include that of checking that the labelling on food packets is correct, that it complies with the rules and that the contents and declaration of contents do in actual fact correspond with each other. That is a crucially important point for us as normal consumers when, on an ordinary Thursday afternoon, we are to do a bit of quick shopping for the evening meal. The fact that the whole chain is to be included – right from the field to the shop, dining room and restaurant – is the principle that of course permeates the whole of the food safety legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect, about which I am both disappointed and pleased, is transparency. A clear majority of the committee demanded a name, shame and fame system. It was not possible to implement this because the Member States invoked legal and constitutional reasons why it should not be. As a Liberal, I perhaps eventually realised that it is probably not the state’s and the authorities’ task to say that the one producer is good and the other bad. With the system of transparency that now exists in this regulation, we have handed over this name, shame and fame function to civil society. A consumer group, animal protection group or local media organisation will be able to request the inspection reports and thus be responsible for this function, telling people how things appear behind the scenes.</p>
<p class="contents">The funding of duties is a very controversial issue – not between the Commission, the Council and myself but within Parliament. Some people want to see a permanently fixed duty, which is set in stone and the same for everyone. That would perhaps be very good, but it has been tried and has failed. Not all countries within the EU are exactly alike. The same basic conditions do not apply from Portugal to Finland or from Ireland to Hungary. I do, however, think that the proposal now before us is nicely balanced. Duties are to be collected, but it is clearly defined which duties are to be included. Special account is also to be taken of small, traditional companies, something I think is very important. It is important for us in the European Parliament to protect the small producers of unusual products that are the essence of Europe’s cultural heritage in the area of food. We must defend them and give them a chance. They must not be exempted from the thinking about safety, but less harsh duties might in actual fact be imposed upon them in the context of this control.</p>
<p class="contents">I would appeal to you all firstly to vote today despite all the problems that exist and, secondly, to fall in with my compromise vote list. Finally, I wish again to extend my many thanks to the Commission and the Council and, above all, to the Italian and Irish Presidencies. Thank you very much for your fantastic cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We welcome the feed and food controls in order to ensure healthy animals and good meat for people throughout Europe. However, we must give the industry time to develop a uniform approach across Europe. I would like Commissioner Byrne to explain in more detail how we are going to enforce the same kind of controls on feed imported into the European Union. It is very important that the same stringent controls are applied not only to our feed in Europe but also to imported feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare is also extremely important. Mrs Paulsen mentioned labelling. We have to ensure that consumers can tell from the labelling which products have met those high animal welfare standards in Europe. Consumers should also be able to see from the labelling which products have not met those high standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The cost of inspection within the EU and fees charged to each feed company have to be looked at, because if one country is charging significantly more for inspections than another, it causes distortions throughout the single market. In broad terms, we must welcome these controls, but we have to be careful that we do not over-regulate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regulation on feed and food controls before us is one of the EU measures to improve food safety. There is a common thread running through all the arrangements in this area, and that thread is the principle of universal controls, from the farm to the shop counter to the table. The participation of stakeholders in the food sector in food safety has been extended, responsibility has been clearly defined, and official controls have been shaped on a more scientific basis and clearly structured. This regulation on feed and food controls represents a piece of framework legislation in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, unfortunately, that the treatment given to this regulation in this House is not in line with the usual parliamentary procedures. The text to be voted on today was largely worked out in the European Council and is significantly different from the Commission proposal. It has not been possible to consider and discuss the text before us in depth. We in this House have been endeavouring for years to extend our powers in relation to the legislative process. The procedure adopted for this regulation runs very much counter to those attempts.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we welcome the inclusion of animal welfare in this regulation, we are critical of the nature of the provisions relating to it. The regulation very much opens up the way to transferring certain official control activities to third parties. I believe, however, that official control activities, if their independence is to be ensured, should be engaged in by state institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the proposed financing procedure. The proposal will of course provide a uniform basis for calculating the fees for inspections in Europe, but it does nothing to eliminate the distortion in competition resulting from enormous differences in the level of fees, something that has been criticised for years. Just the opposite, in fact: this approach makes it quite possible that companies in the same administrative district will have to pay different fees because of their different geographical distance from the administrative authorities. Yet official controls are intended to promote health and should therefore be charged at approximately the same level for all companies involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The inadequate reference to national control plans and to the financing of ad hoc controls means that this procedural approach exposes companies to financial risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to specifically emphasise that we support many of the ideas put forward here. However, the unconventional way of producing the legislative text that has been imposed upon us, with new drafts repeatedly being published at short intervals, and with the final version of the amendments only becoming available in our own languages this morning, has unfortunately made in-depth consideration of the text impossible. It cannot be ruled out that possible shortcomings and critical points will go unnoticed because of this haste. For this reason, our unreserved support cannot be taken for granted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, transparency in food safety and the controlling of this are of course extremely important. More rules and greater control are not in themselves a guarantee of improved food safety: we can only put an end to tinkering with food if we also demand transparency. Information on businesses that have a rather casual attitude to food safety must be made public. Those who tinker lose customers. Transparency is an important condition for food safety, and we welcome the compromise reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the financing of the controls must be fair. We must combat unfair aid to businesses and unfair competition. Granting small businesses a discount enables us to accommodate this category of business, which is very important within the food sector, to some degree.</p>
<p class="contents">My third comment concerns the proper, fair application of this legislation. Our group has been advocating equivalent controls and equivalent methods throughout the EU. It must not be the case that a cargo is rejected in Rotterdam on food safety grounds yet subsequently enters the EU via a different route. Our question to the Commission is as follows: can the Commission assure us that, in the interests of European citizens and of fair competition, it will monitor the proper implementation of this legislation closely?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, our group warmly welcomes the assistance that the EU is planning to give to developing countries to help them build capacity in order that they can comply with European food safety rules. This kills two birds with one stone: the EU increases the safety of imported food products, and developing countries obtain important assistance in taking measures capable of improving their food safety situation and thus their trading position. Food safety must not be a cover for protectionism. We also have to keep current events in mind here. In view of the outbreak of avian influenza in Asia, it is important that food safety is controlled right from the countries of origin. Can the Commission confirm that this and other Community legislation offers the EU effective protection against carry-over of contagious diseases such as avian influenza?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it remains for me to make a comment of a general nature. On behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should again like to thank Mrs Paulsen, and also the Council and the Commission, for their constructive work. We hope that this milestone brings an important piece of work over the past five years to a conclusion, and we look forward to hearing the Commission’s answers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It was a great pleasure for my group to take part in the discussions on the compromise, not least on account of the reference to criminal law in Amendment No 206.</p>
<p class="contents">I now hear that the Council is very reluctant in this regard. I regret that the Council is not currently taking part in the debate or expressing an opinion on the compromise that we have reached among four groups. Consequently, I support the request by Mrs Klass, albeit for reasons other than language, to postpone the vote until tomorrow. This will give the Council another chance to deliberate and express its opinion on the reference to criminal law in Amendment No 206 to the plenary sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to emphasise a number of elements of this Regulation that are important to our group. The first, of course, as the rapporteur herself has said, is the extension of the scope of the Regulation from feed to animal welfare and animal health. The second is the explicit statement of the need for controls to be carried out without prior warning. The third is the need for official checks on self-monitoring and labelling controls. The fourth is, very practically, the avoidance of conflicts of interest among controllers. In Belgium, we have learnt that those still exist. There are still self-employed veterinary surgeons, with their own practice, who are carrying out controls. The fifth is the imposition of quality conditions on laboratories. The sixth is the need for cooperation between national and regional authorities, as the MPA case has taught us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, since international networks are very often active in this field, international cooperation between control and customs services, and also between authorities, is tremendously important, as is the introduction of liaison bodies. I believe that we are taking a major step forward in the form of this Regulation, and I hope that we can adopt the compromise of the four groups by a large majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The food scares experienced in recent years must never again be allowed to reach proportions which threaten European consumers, farmers and the agrifood industry. I believe that great credit is due to the Commission, in particular Commissioner Byrne, for systematically putting forward a series of legislative proposals which aim to address each of the issues that needed to be tackled to guarantee our consumers a safe and traceable product, from farm to fork.</p>
<p class="contents">This particular proposal addresses some clear weaknesses which have been highlighted in the control services. Tremendous effort has been made to facilitate a first reading conclusion of this dossier before the end of the legislative period. The Commission initially sought to introduce criminal sanctions, but faced with the Member States' unanimous opposition to this approach, the Commission wisely decided to settle for a statement on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of scope and whether the proposed regulations should take in all aspects of animal health and welfare, or only those aspects impinging on food safety, I am glad that in the final analysis the Council accepted the wider scope that was urged by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The fees issue was also hotly contested. The latest text allows a situation whereby the collection of fees will continue to apply to those activities that are currently subject to fees – i.e. meat and fishery products inspection, veterinary residue testing, and controls on live animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It seems to me that, pursuant to Article 175 of the Treaty, it would be illegal to impose penalties of the kind that the Commission is proposing. Further, together with my colleague Mr Blokland, I tabled an amendment for their deletion before the Irish Presidency lifts the penalties for intentional actions or serious negligence. I do not think it is acceptable for the cost of inspections to be harmonised by means of a European fee. Firstly, it is already difficult enough to implement such a measure, given the diverse modes and costs of production in the current 15 Member States. How could this function in an EU of 25 Members, given that this fee may not differ by more than 10% from the average within the Community? Secondly, in legal terms, it is not for Parliament to decide on the introduction of a European tax. I would remind you that such a measure depends on a unanimous decision by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is necessary to remain firm on import controls. It would be difficult to justify imposing strict controls on European Union operators if those from third countries were able to avoid them. In addition, special provision must be made for primary producer installations. The continuity of family businesses producing much-appreciated traditional products that made their areas famous must not be threatened. To conclude, the Commission does not have the competence to assess the extent to which national measures conform to the regulation under discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst welcoming the animal welfare aspect of this proposal, I agree with Mrs Klaß that maybe we are rushing a little and we need time to look at every aspect of this rather complex deal.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also worried that once again we may be coming up against the law of unintended consequences. You may recall that when the original slaughterhouse regulations came forward, the UK Government got hold of them and goldplated them. This resulted in very high costs for some small slaughterhouses which, faced with those costs, closed. That then resulted in animals having to travel very large distances to slaughterhouses.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards charges, in the case of this particular proposal, whilst it is true that different charges being levied in different countries is a distortion of the free market, common charges would not reflect the differences in cost of inspections in, for example, Lithuania as opposed to Germany. We now seem to have a balance where the cost will reflect the actual cost of those inspections, but it is possible that there will be loopholes, particularly in the way that some countries define 'small operators'. Yes, I support exemptions for small operators, but I can see how some countries that want to subsidise production in certain remote areas would use that definition.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on the issue of 'naming and shaming', nobody could be against freedom of information – we are all in favour of transparency and openness – and not to be in favour of it would be to support secrecy. We need to be careful, for example, to look at the situation in the UK, where if you are prosecuted you appear in the paper, but if minor infringements are discovered, such as a cracked tile in a slaughterhouse or a piece of mouse dirt in a restaurant, this does not appear on the front page of the local newspaper.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, whilst I appreciate the good intentions, we need to look at this more carefully to make sure that we do not once again come up against the law of unintended consequences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to pay personal tribute to Mrs Paulsen, who has brought through a number of complex, difficult measures of this kind. Mr Goodwill said that these measures have unintended consequences. I would remind him of the principle of 'unright time', according to which people always say that the time is not right for doing something. Well, it is high time to be doing what we are doing in this area. The institutions have come together. There have been significant changes in the proposals for sanctions, financing, transparency and import controls. That, with the input of the Council, has made this a good proposal, and a very good one for Mrs Paulsen to end on, because I know this may be her last report in Parliament. She deserves all our thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issues that have been raised and which I wish to touch on are, first, how the balance of fees is being struck in a way that is fair to small operators, as Mr Goodwill said, but nevertheless does not allow exploitation and evasion of the rules by some.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, how far we can specifically assist developing countries in meeting EU standards. How are these standards going to be applied and what assistance are we able to offer? Most of all, how can we guarantee the system of prior notification for high-risk products at ports that have the necessary facilities to deal with them? There is a big question mark concerning these ports of entry and recent experience shows that we have to deal with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am particularly glad that we have reached some agreement on the issue of sanctions. Sanctions as originally proposed were unwise and would not have worked. I am pleased to say that the route we are now taking, which has been agreed by most of the main players, is likely to lead to success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, food controls are still a farce. This directive is indeed successful in many areas, and we Greens are particularly pleased that animal welfare has finally been incorporated into food controls. The intensity of controls has also been improved, so that national control reports are now also required. Nevertheless, an investigation carried out in Germany has just highlighted the fundamental problem, which is that not enough controls are carried out in practice. We need much more funding for food controls, so that controls can be carried out more frequently, and so that anyone breaching food regulations runs a genuine risk of punitive action. That remains the weak point in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also like to have seen laboratory methods brought in line, with some harmonisation of how controls are implemented in the Member States. What we also urgently need – and I have not given up hope, Commissioner, and would be pleased if you could say something about this – is for a consumer information directive to be brought in at last, mirroring the environmental information directive. That would mean that just as consumers, the public, have the right to know what is happening in the environmental world, they would also have the right to know what is happening in the food sector.</p>
<p class="contents">My very last point is this: I hope that the Council will stop playing hide-and-seek and tell us today in the clearest possible terms what the position is on fees and fines, so that this is clear when we come to vote, because we cannot demand more food controls and improved animal welfare if the Council is secretive about this point and there is a lack of transparency towards this House. That is all we want. Because what we need is food controls …</p>

Some very important aspects have been included, as many other people have mentioned. I am especially pleased with the inclusion of animal welfare. Some people dismiss this as an issue but I think it is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of controls, this is something that relates not only to this issue but also to a vast area of legislation in the European Union, where legislation is in place but it is not enforced; there are no controls. It is important that if you have legislation and rules, they must be enforced. You cannot do that without proper and adequate controls.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most concerned about the issue of sanctions; it is regrettable that they are not included. You will not force Member States and companies into complying with the law if there are no adequate sanctions in place. We have seen in the past that companies responsible for feed scandals never go to jail; those responsible within those companies are never properly penalised. There are derisory fines which are no deterrent to any continuation of these kinds of offences. We are not going to find a way forward without sanctions, because we need both the carrot and stick approaches to ensure that the legislation is complied with. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am grateful that Parliament has accepted our proposal on official feed and food controls so favourably, and that it has endorsed the need to ensure an improved monitoring system of the food and feed chain at national and Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to underline once more my appreciation for the intense and productive contribution of the various committees and to stress the importance and sensitivity of the issues under discussion today, which have been raised and explored as a result of Mrs Paulsen's excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the emphasis put on certain aspects, such as increased transparency and the recognition of the efforts of good businesses to produce safe food and feed. The Commission regrets that its proposal to introduce penal sanctions is not supported by Council and Parliament. The Commission considers that the use of penal sanctions would be an important strengthening of controls on food and feed operators. The Commission disagrees with Parliament's and the Council's view that Article 55(2) and (3) relate to the third pillar. On the other hand, it notes that this issue has already been submitted to the Court of Justice for determination in another case.</p>
<p class="contents">In these circumstances and taking into account the overall political context of this procedure, the Commission is prepared to withdraw Article 55(2) and (3) of this proposal, awaiting the Court's determination of the issue and reserves the right to propose again measures providing for criminal sanctions in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Paulsen raised the question of sensitive treatment of small enterprises and I would refer to the provision in the legislation that provides for a special case to be made in respect of small enterprises. I know from her extensive experience in dealing with food safety issues in this House, that she will be aware that similar sensitive provisions have been included in the hygiene regulation. She will also be aware from Commissioner Fischler's recent review of the CAP proposals that special provision has also been made there for the funding of small and medium-sized food enterprises, particularly in rural areas, throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Parish raised the question of import controls. Third countries must give guarantees on compliance with EU law. If these guarantees are not given, imports will be submitted to special controls, or not be allowed at all. Imported food and feed will be submitted to import controls upon arrival. That control system is based on risk: the higher the risk, the more intensive the import controls. For example, food that may contain certain toxins will be checked intensively.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Whitehead then raised the question of how we can guarantee that the prior notification system works properly. There is already a system in respect of veterinary controls, where there is a form that deals with this issue of prior notification. A modest adjustment will be made to the existing provisions in relation to the veterinary controls to take this particular system into account. Thought has been given to this; my officials have noted this issue as one requiring attention and it will be dealt with at a technical level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Parish also raised the question of animal welfare. As he probably knows, animal welfare aspects are not included in the WTO (World Trade Organisation) sanitary and phytosanitary code and there is therefore no international consensus on the organisation of controls in respect of animal welfare rules with our trading partners. The Commission's proposal is to conclude agreements with third countries on animal welfare. The Commission has also raised the matter in the OIE in order to bring the matter on to the international agenda. There was a conference in Paris a couple of weeks ago that I attended, where the OIE has clearly indicated its intention to upgrade the whole question of animal welfare in international trade. This legislation also provides for national control measures to be put in place so that the FAO can inspect them and be satisfied that they work properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Concern was expressed about the deflection of trade from one harbour to another and whether this would arise or not, owing to different levels of inspection and the application of less expensive control measures, thus creating an advantage for food business operators. For this reason, the proposal provides for a standard level in the veterinary sector. With regard to control measures, the proposal will contribute to reaching a harmonised level on import controls. I believe that the essential elements to avoid deflection of trade are included in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Klaß raised the question of the system of inspection fees and why they cannot be regulated at a more central level. There are a number of reasons for this and some have been referred to by a number of speakers earlier today. The inspection costs, for instance, are different across Europe. This is due to differences in salaries, energy costs, etc. The fees in several Member States are regulated at local level, which results in different fees within a single, individual Member State. It is impossible for the Commission to exercise its control powers in view of the complicated methods for auditing national or regional financing systems. Therefore, the proposal on the table is believed to be the appropriate response to this somewhat complex issue.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I confirm that the Commission accepts a substantial number of the amendments that have been tabled. A full listing of the Commission's position on each of the amendments is being provided to Parliament, and I trust this will be included in the record of this session<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In the event that there are amendments tabled that are not part of the package, the Commission will not be able to accept them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
