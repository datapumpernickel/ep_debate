<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patrizia Toia (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the debate we are about to have this evening takes its context from the next review of the regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore necessary to ask if this framework has worked, if and how it has been applied, if it has been in a position to promote a genuinely open, competitive and transparent market for all operators and if it has been able, at the same time, to promote the necessary investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that we need to provide for an updating of the regulatory framework, we have to ask along what lines this should happen. In other words, we need to ask if we should give greater freedom to operators – as certain people wish, especially for the new markets – or instead maintain the regulated services. These are the questions we must do our best to answer when we set about reviewing the regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from the debate in committee, I would like to highlight certain priorities myself.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, this sector is a driving force behind the development of the European economy, both according to Lisbon and because telecommunications are the cornerstone of any economy based on knowledge, innovation and research. Telecommunications technologies act as a stimulus for productive innovation and a catalyst for the productivity of labour.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, therefore, to focus upon this strategic, high-investment sector – given that it requires infrastructure, research and constant innovation – and create a market for it that is open to new operators, with the widest possible choice for consumers and with the principle of access to networks as a key feature.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we must avoid penalising operators that are already securely entrenched in the market, and we must effectively compete with the giants of the markets outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a market characterised by constantly evolving technologies – I refer to broadband, third-generation telephones, voice, image and data convergence, and the new market of voice over Internet protocol services – and these innovations need to be sustained and encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said all this, I turn to how this is being applied in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission report describes a situation that varies greatly from country to country, and that constitutes a weak point in a market that is truly integrated at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives are poorly applied everywhere, and, where they are, the bodies needed for them – the National Regulatory Authorities – have not always even been established. We must be aware therefore that there is still a great deal to be done as regards implementing the current regulatory framework before we change it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important point, Mr President, because it is impossible to implement this legislation, which requires flexibility and often <span class="italic">ex post</span> intervention to prevent dominant positions in the market, without the system as a whole working. It is difficult to bring in <span class="italic">ex post</span> legislation if all the operators have not done their part beforehand in intervening at an institutional level to guarantee market transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report, after the consideration of Parliament, we suggest various points: first of all it is necessary – and I say this strongly to the Commission – to open a debate on the whole institutional set-up. It is necessary to strengthen the role of the Commission, to clarify and precisely define the role of the European regulators and to ask the Member States, whilst also involving Parliament, to guarantee the establishment of authorities that are genuinely independent and authoritative, as well as capable and in a position to work in a tireless and entirely transparent way, which is essential. I propose, moreover, a task for the Commission: why not create, through the new regulatory framework, a European regulatory authority?</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond this clearer definition of the various institutions and their competences and duties, we need the involvement of Parliament. We ask the Commission to draw up, at regular intervals, a report that provides, for the Commission as well, the clearest possible analysis of all the operators’ billing parameters as well as contract guarantees and price trends, in order to keep Parliament informed and provide it with a more front-line role.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish for greater opening up of the operator sector: whilst we welcome the increase in unbundled local loops, we think more should be done to allow further opening up and the entry of new operators. We have seen that investment comes from established operators but some also comes from new operators.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude with the central importance of the user and the consumer. The question of roaming is crucial: we appreciate what the Commission and the European Regulators Group are doing but we ask for something more, which appears in our document to the Commission specifically on roaming. Finally, reducing the digital divide also means increasing the number of users, including among Europe’s elderly and disabled. I finish by welcoming the voluntary codes to protect users ...</p>

It is very encouraging to see that Parliament shares the Commission’s policy priorities and concerns as regards implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications. This support is important, especially when we have to make difficult or unpleasant decisions with regard to Member States. You know that the electronic communications sector is a major driver for a knowledge-based society and economy. Our regulatory framework, which has been in place since 2003, establishes conditions for competition, investment, growth and jobs, while guaranteeing basic consumer rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective has been and will continue to be a single market with choice, quality and low prices for all European businesses and consumers. The rapporteur is right, we are taking responsibility for ensuring that Member States implement the framework correctly. The fact is that they do not always do this. We maintain a constant dialogue with the European Regulators Group and the national regulatory authorities, in the context of the monitoring of this market. When instances of non-conformity or incorrect implementation arise, we launch infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned. Although some objectives have not yet fully been achieved, I can assure you that progress has been made since last year and this will certainly be reflected in the 11th implementation report which we are currently preparing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to answer the specific requests made by the European Parliament. The Commission shares your views about the importance of adequate frequency allocation and the need for sufficient flexibility in that respect. We also fully share the Parliament’s concerns on data retention, which is why the Commission has made a balanced first-pillar codecision proposal. In the same way, broadband access and ways to reduce the digital divide are key priorities and will remain so under the i-2010 action plan.</p>
<p class="contents">You will know also that roaming charges are an issue to which the Commission has paid great attention. In relation to the issue of transparency for consumers, we have set up a website with information on roaming prices in the Member States. I can inform you that since this website came online a lot of Europeans have used it and prices are falling.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of the concerns expressed in the report on the role of the ERG. The ERG is an advisory body and a good forum for national regulators to exchange views and experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">I also take note of the request for the Commission to carry out regular studies on the transparency of invoicing, contract guarantees and trends in the market and prices. This information is already available and specific studies are unnecessary, but I can assure you that if problems are identified, they are included in the annual implementation reports.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure Parliament that the Commission will remain vigilant to ensure that measures relating to national markets do not jeopardise the completion of the single market in electronic communications. We will continue to monitor Member States’ activities relating to the regulatory framework, and will submit an annual implementation report, which will be adopted by the Commission in February 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">A few words about the future. The report makes reference to the need to open an institutional debate. That debate has already started, and will go on until the first half of 2006. In the summer, the Commission will publish a communication with the conclusions of the debate and will make concrete proposals by the end of 2006. The European Parliament will of course be fully involved in this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Electronic communications play a key role in developing the European knowledge-based economy, fostering innovation and creating value for customers. When fully implemented, the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications will enable innovative services with competitive prices to develop on a level playing field throughout the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to support the Commission in monitoring and enforcing the implementation process of the EU regulatory framework in the Member States. Currently, the establishment of the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications has been a success story of the internal market, the field being one that has proven to be most beneficial for clients. This success has been demonstrated by a decrease in prices and an increase in services in the electronic communications field.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the regulatory framework has also encountered problems, owing to its slow implementation in many Member States. On the one hand, these problems are reflected in numerous ongoing infringement procedures that the Commission has initiated against Member States who fail to transpose parts of the framework. On the other hand, some Member States’ national regulatory authorities might even have done too much. Efficient operators and efficient markets should not be penalised. In some Member States over-regulation has led to draconian competition where no operator generates any revenues. Regulation should be there to please the customers, not only the competitors.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission should continue efficient monitoring of the implementation of the whole electronic communications framework and it should be completed within the shortest time possible. Once fully implemented, it is also very important that the monitoring task be shifted from the national regulatory authorities to the competition authorities. In this respect, we should put more trust in competition law.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to lower exorbitant international roaming charges – such as the ones the Commissioner has already mentioned – and to further increase customer visibility in international pricing on the website. I heard that the website is updated only once every six months. That is not regularly enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to point out that functioning mobile number portability system is vital to healthy competition and there should be no rates – or at least <span class="italic">very</span> low rates – on carrying your number in every Member State. The deadline for realising the number portability operation should be shortened in those Member States where it is still a serious problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to extend my sincere thanks for the excellent work done by Mrs Toia, with whom I agree that the information and communications technology sector is enormously relevant both for the Community economy and for individual countries, given the notable contribution it makes to employment growth and the development of new technologies to improve and speed up communications.</p>
<p class="contents">European legislation is required to regulate the relationship between producer and user and to guarantee that digital technology is available to all, that governments invest more in infrastructure and, above all, that free and fair competition is maintained, thus ensuring better quality services at more and more favourable prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The report addresses five thematic areas.</p>
<p class="contents">First: the improvement of international roaming services, with a reduction in tariffs and greater transparency in billing and the drawing up of contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Second: the establishment of a clear framework to regulate the institutional relationship between the European Commission and the European Regulators Group, to increase the responsibility and involvement of national authorities – thereby restoring competitiveness – and to provide greater incentives for investment, especially in the new emerging markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Third: an increase in the number of power lines so that broadband connection is available to all, without territorial limits and in the shortest time possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth: the protection of user health, as argued by the rapporteur for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, who fully supports the rapporteur, Mrs Toia, hoping that the European Parliament will accept the recommendations in her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I wish to congratulate Mr Reading on the work he is and will be doing in his report on research, which has the full support of the PPE-DE. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to mention some essential points. We need to encourage the creation of a single market in telecommunications covering the entire European territory. Such a single market is necessary in order to reduce the digital divide, which is a priority aim for the European Union. However, this transition to a new framework for the regulation and supply of electronic communications must respect the public and consumers by bringing the transparency and security necessary for the proper use of telecommunications. This means transparency on questions of safety and public health, especially radiation measurement; it also means a correctly regulated market, which is the only way to guarantee fair service and pricing conditions. This concerns international roaming in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we draw up an action plan, with a timetable, so that consumers can enjoy continuity of service, which means the potential for international roaming throughout European territory, at the best price and at the earliest opportunity. On 7 December, the single Internet address .eu will be launched for businesses. Just as the Commission is giving concrete expression to this long awaited decision, it should also act to bring in a single dialling code with a single tariff for the European Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">That must be a priority of the action plan, the importance and significance of which I have just pointed out, strengthening a telecommunications area appropriate to the free movement of persons and of personal communications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But has the world actually become better in 2004, in the period reviewed by the report, and will it be better in the future as a result of the development of electronic communications? Whatever the case, we can say that the information/communication sector boosts the development of European economy and facilitates the creation of jobs. It is also obvious that the expansion of new technologies – primarily that of mobile broadband – facilitates the integration of social groups inaccessible by traditional means into the information society. Therefore these are indisputable advantages. However, we must also ask the question: at what price? The answer is nowhere near as favourable as the effects mentioned above. Complicated pricing models, strange fee constructions, a practice that oversteps the single market principle – roaming charges are only one example. This is the current price of the advantages listed, of the better world. I am not saying that this is an unaffordable price, as all of us, European consumers, are paying it month by month. However, one of the most important objectives of our Parliament is to change the current situation, which is also our duty in the spirit of consumer protection. Most importantly, we need transparency, and unambiguous and clear information for consumers. We need true competition and a full implementation of the principle of the single and common market. And last but not least, we need lower prices that reflect the true value of services. Only when these objectives are attained will consumer protection be given the importance it deserves alongside economic considerations, and if this happens, then this report was worth preparing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is this current electronic communications regulation does not really work. I say that as rapporteur for the report on Parliament’s framework directive. The consequence is that the internal market for electronic communications is not developing, the necessary competition is not evolving everywhere and consumers are not being offered the range of services they need, services for which there should be fierce competition. The services are therefore not cheap enough. There are many examples of this. This also puts different Member States in different positions: where there is tough competition money goes on advertising. If there is no competition money can be used on product development and the company concerned has a better chance for development than the one which has to compete fiercely. Businesses are therefore in unequal positions among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Another basic reason for this is that the Member States are not applying this legislation and that is definitely a problem. The position of the regulatory authorities varies greatly from one country to another and the status they enjoy should be made more even among different countries. How can we imagine, then, achieving the Lisbon objective in such a situation? We need to make a great effort, together with the Commission, to persuade the Member States that it is to their benefit to apply this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the new legislation, it has to be neutral with regard to technology. It would be better if it were framework rather than detailed legislation, and it should guarantee a competitive environment and a secure service for consumers. Obviously, again, roaming costs should be reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the same concerns as the Commission, so can we not also move forward together? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(FR)</span> Mr President, I simply want to say briefly that I agree with most of the analyses that the honourable Members have made. It is true that the regulatory framework is being applied very unevenly. Competition, too, is operating according to very different national systems that are often inadequate. That is why the Commission has to bring Member States before the Court of Justice when the rules are not enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of cases pending before the Court of Justice, as you know; you also know that I am in constant touch with the national regulators, who meet in the European Regulators Group. That exchange of views is extremely important because it is in a way an exchange of good practice and also an opportunity to bring pressure to bear on each other. Moreover, the regulators are helping me over the prices of roaming, which are very high. I have to make clear to you that the Commission is unable to impose prices itself, but it can push for a downward revision of prices. That is what we have done with the setting up of an Internet site for comparing prices in our Member States and since that site has been up it has been visited by thousands of consumers every day. Since it has been up, too, we have noticed many prices falling in many countries. As promised, there will be a price review within six months to see what the trend is and where talks with national regulators are up to in the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I told the honourable Members that talks about the present regulatory framework and its possible reform had begun. Those talks are going to take a few more months yet. The very important report before us today is Parliament’s first contribution. I am looking forward to other debates, other proposals from Parliament as from the main interested parties, and starting in the spring I shall be making a summary of those analyses, suggestions and proposals so that we can then go on to discuss a possible reform of the regulatory framework, adapting it to developing technologies and fine tuning it to the very different situations in the various Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
