<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the May 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the concern expressed by the Honourable Member regarding the difficult situation on the milk market. After an unprecedented period of record prices for milk and dairy products in 2007 and early 2008, European producers now face weak and uncertain markets characterised by a sharp drop in global dairy product prices.</p>
<p>On 23 March the Council held an extensive exchange of views on the difficult situation on the milk market and took note of a memorandum presented and supported by a number of delegations.</p>
<p>The legal framework regulating the milk and dairy market has changed considerably over the course of the last two years, with the adoption by the Council of the so called "mini-milk package" in September 2007, the increase of national quotas for milk by 2% as from 1 April 2008 and the adoption of the "Health Check" package in January 2009.</p>
<p>This new legislative framework was set with the long term competitiveness of European producers in mind. Short-term market effects have to be countered by the existing instruments of market support measures.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member will be aware of a number of market support measures taken by the Commission. These include the reactivation of export refunds for all dairy commodities, the introduction of private storage aid for butter and intervention for butter and skimmed milk powder. The Commission updates the Council regularly on the situation in the milk market.</p>
<p>It is for the Commission to present further proposals to the Council on this matter. The Commission has declared its readiness to examine the possibilities for extending the dairy products eligible for the "school milk scheme". However it stated that it was not ready to re-open any discussion on the "health-check" package.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0223"></a>

<p>The conclusion of the negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement with the Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) remains high on the agenda of the Council and has been a priority for both the former Presidencies and the present Czech Presidency of the Council. The Presidencies and the Commission, that negotiates the Agreement on behalf of the EU, have been in close contact with the GCC side in order to take forward the negotiations. At the 19<span class="sup">th</span> EU-GCC Joint Council and Ministerial Meeting in Muscat on 29 April 2009 both sides reviewed their recent consultations on a Free Trade Agreement and agreed to continue these consultations between them on all outstanding issues towards the resumption of negotiations.</p>
<p>The discussions at the ministerial meeting included issues of common interest such as the Middle East Peace Process, Iran and Iraq as well as number of global issues including counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. In the light of the importance of the global financial crisis, the EU and the GCC have expressed their deep concern at the impact of crisis on the global economy. They also welcomed the six key messages and recommendations of the G-20 summit and called for immediate and decisive measures to implement these decisions and recommendations in order to restore confidence to global markets and stability to financial markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0235"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the May 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At the EU Heads of State and Government informal meeting with President Obama on 5 April 2009 in Prague, three topics were discussed, namely the economic and financial situation, climate change and energy security and external relations (Peace in the Middle East, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iran). As far as the economic and financial situation is concerned, Heads of State and Government expressed satisfaction with the results achieved at the London G20 meeting on 2 April, while stressing the importance of implementing the measures agreed at that meeting as soon as possible. The Heads of State and Government agreed on the need to fight all forms of protectionism and expressed their support for an early conclusion of the Doha Round. In the context of keeping trade and investments flows open, the role of co-operation within the Transatlantic Economic Council was also highlighted.</p>
<p>The Council is satisfied that the informal discussions with President Obama were fully in line with the language agreed by the European Council on 19-20 March on the leading international action necessary to promote a swift return to sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p>In particular, as concerns the need to combat economic protectionism, the European Council agreed to keep markets open and avoid all forms of protectionist measures (no new barriers to investment or to trade and no new export restrictions), and to strive to swiftly reach agreement on modalities for the Doha Development Agenda with an ambitious and balanced outcome.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0237"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the May 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The second paragraph of Article 100 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which appears to be the paragraph to which the Honourable Member is referring in her question, has never been the legal basis for any proposal examined by the Council. Similarly, the Council never examined any proposal based on the second paragraph of Article 103a of the EC Treaty as inserted by the Maastricht Treaty, which was the corresponding provision prior to the paragraph in question.</p>
<p>No definition of "exceptional occurrences beyond the control of a Member State" exists and the Council has never discussed it. Similarly, the Council has never discussed the possibility of invoking "exceptional occurrences" in the context of the current economic situation.</p>
<p>The Council stands ready to examine any proposal from the Commission based on Article 100(2) of the EC Treaty, should the Commission present such a proposal. In accordance with Article 114(2) of the EC Treaty, the Economic and Financial Committee would be involved in the preparation of the Council's examination of any Commission proposal based on Article 100(2).</p>
<p>The Council recalls the terms of the Declaration on Article 100 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, which is attached to the Nice Treaty. According to this declaration, "decisions regarding financial assistance, such as are provided for in Article 100 and are compatible with the 'no bail-out' rule laid down in Article 103, must comply" with the provisions of the inter-institutional agreement on budgetary discipline and financial perspectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0239"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the May 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the European Parliament's Resolution on an integrated approach to earthquakes by the EU. It had already on 5 March 2007 adopted a decision establishing a Civil Protection Financial Instrument aimed at providing financial assistance to improve the effectiveness of response to major emergencies as well as to enhance preventive and preparedness measures for all kinds of emergencies. Following the resolution, the Council adopted on 8 November 2007 the Council also adopted a new Decision establishing the Community Civil Protection Mechanism aimed at providing, support in the event of major emergencies and to facilitate improved coordination of assistance intervention provided by the Member States and the Community. In addition, the Council adopted in November 2008 conclusions which called for the strengthening of the civil protection mutual assistance between Member States and for the establishment of a European Disaster Management Training Arrangements. The Presidency believes that those acts and initiatives will improve significantly the technical and financial resources available for better needs assessments, joint interventions of Member States' civil protection teams as well as their transport and coordination.</p>
<p>After the earthquake that hit the Abruzzo region in Italy, on 6 April 2009, the Presidency wishes to express its condolences with the relatives of those who lost their lives and to pay tribute to all first responders, other professionals and volunteers who worked constantly and risked their lives during the whole campaign in order to save lives and limit the damages on properties and the environment.</p>
<p>On 10 April 2009 the Italian Civil Protection Department requested through the Monitoring and Information Centre (MIC), established according to the Community Civil Protection Mechanism, technical experts to support Italy in assessing the stability of buildings. Following this request, , 6 technical experts started their assessment of the situation on 18 April. As the MIC is established and managed by the Commission, the Honourable Member is invited to raise any additional questions to the Commission.</p>
<p>Finally I would like to draw your attention your attention of the fact it is for the Commission to decide whether assistance can be granted through the European Union Solidarity Fund which can be mobilised in case of natural disasters, such as earthquakes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0243"></a>

<p>On 3 and 4 April during the NATO summit meeting in Strasbourg the French authorities used every means at their disposal to obstruct the demonstrations which had been planned by pacifist organisations from all over Europe and terrorized the city's inhabitants, deterring them from taking part in these demonstrations. At the same time, in collusion with the German authorities, they barred thousands of pacifist demonstrators from entering the city. They turned the centre of Strasbourg into an exclusion zone by erecting a large number of police checkpoints. It is characteristic of their behaviour that, at a checkpoint far from the demonstrations, the police stopped an MEP, the author of this question, as a suspect, detaining him for over half an hour, despite the fact that he had had revealed his identity and had showed his European Parliament pass and diplomatic passport!</p>

<p>A drawing of portrait of the historic leader of the October Revolution, Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, was found recently in the village of Svirplyay in Lithuania. The police immediately launched an investigation to prosecute the 'perpetrators' on charges of 'publicly exhibiting Communist symbols'. This measure has been taken under the notorious anti-Communist legislation which was used to outlaw the country's Communist Party as early as 1991 and to ban the use of Soviet and Communist symbols in 2008.</p>
<p>These actions form part of - and stoke - the anti-Communist hysteria in which the EU's institutions play a leading role, characterised by historically misguided efforts to equate Fascism and Communism, the attempt to criminalize Communist ideology and the prohibition of the use of Communist symbols and the actions and operations of the Communist parties. History has demonstrated that anti-Communism and the persecution of Communists are invariably the precursors of a general assault on working people, democratic rights and popular freedoms.</p>
<p>Will the Council say whether it condemns this unfolding anti-Communist campaign and indeed the very existence of this unacceptable anti-Communist legislation which seeks to prevent the free movement of ideas and unhindered political activity in Lithuania, and also in other EU Member States?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The issue of piracy off the coast of Somalia and within the Gulf of Aden is a matter of considerable concern, and has been raised in the Council on a number of occasions, most recently on 30 March when there was agreement on the need to step up all possible measures in order to make this important sea package safe for all merchant fleets and ships carrying humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>Combating piracy is also being extensively discussed within the framework of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) Maritime Safety Committee.</p>
<p>Following the adoption of UNSCR 1816 (2008), the Council decided on 8 December 2008 to launch a European Union maritime operation (Atalanta) to contribute to the deterrence, prevention and repression of acts of piracy and armed robbery off the Somali coast. The purpose of this operation is to contribute to the security of maritime traffic in the area.</p>
<p>This operation is part of a wider effort by the international community that involves a number of countries affected by piracy, as well as the maritime community.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the May 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Community and Member States are active parties to most major conventions and agreements covering regional seas around Europe, such as the 1992 Helsinki Convention for the protection of the Baltic Sea, the 1983 Bonn Agreement for the protection of the North Sea, the 1976 Barcelona Convention for the protection of the Mediterranean Sea and the 1992 Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR).</p>
<p>At Community level, the framework established by the European Parliament and the Council for cooperation in the field of accidental or deliberate marine pollution, for the time period 2000-2006 provided support to Member States in their efforts to protect the marine environment. This framework concerned in particular discharges of harmful substances into the seas, including substances linked to the presence of dumped material such as munitions.</p>
<p>Under this framework a Community information system, hosted by the Commission, was set up with the aim of exchanging information amongst Member States on intervention capacities and measures in place in the event of marine pollution.</p>
<p>In October 2001, a Community Civil Protection Mechanism was set up by the Council in order to improve coordination of assistance provided by Member States and the Community and to mobilise assistance from them when inter alia marine pollution accidents occur. The Community Civil Protection Mechanism was recast by the Council Decision on 8 November 2007.</p>
<p>Particular reference should be made, in this specific area, to the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), established by Regulation (EC) Nº 1406/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 June 2002. To reduce the risk of all kinds of marine pollution from ships, including sea dumped chemical weapons; this agency provides technical assistance to the Commission and to the Member States of the EU on the implementation, monitoring, development and evolution of relevant EU and international legislation.</p>
<p>The Presidency would like also to recall that the Council, in its conclusions of December 2008 on the integrated maritime policy, welcomed progress on the proceedings on the proposal for a Directive of the EP and the Council<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on pollution caused by vessels and the introduction of penalties for infringements, currently examined by the Council.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council encouraged Member States to begin work required for the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive, adopted in 2008, which establishes a framework within which Member States shall take the necessary measures to achieve or maintain good environmental status in the marine environment by the year 2020 at the latest.</p>
<p>As regards the specific question raised by the Honourable Parliamentarian of promoting Baltic States cooperation, the European Council in December 2007 invited the Commission to present an EU strategy for the Baltic Sea region at the latest by June 2009. Such a strategy should, inter alia, help to address the urgent environmental challenges related to the Baltic Sea. The Council, in its conclusions of 8 December 2008, reiterated the importance of the future strategy for the Baltic Sea for the integrated maritime policy of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the May 2009 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council understands the concern of the honourable Member that some material broadcast by the Al-Manar television station in question might amount to incitement to hatred.</p>
<p>The Council addressed these concerns in its statement for the last EU-Egypt Association Council, which took place on 27 April 2009. It was stated that "The EU encourages Egypt to continue to pursue efforts aimed at fighting discrimination on all grounds and at promoting tolerance in matters related to culture, religion and beliefs and minorities. In this context, the EU is concerned about the discriminatory content in some of the broadcasts of the Al-Manar television channel distributed by the Egyptian satellite Nilesat. The EU condemns any advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence".</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU raised its concerns during the EU-Egypt expert meeting on Counter-terrorism, which took place on 31 March in Brussels. The Egyptian side took note of this issue.</p>
<p>The Council believes that dialogue with Egypt, through the institutional structure of the sub-committees and political dialogue, is the most effective way to encourage the Egyptian government to progress in the area of human rights. The sub-committee on political matters with Egypt, whose second meeting is scheduled for 7 July, might also allow for issues related to the fight against racism, xenophobia and intolerance to be raised. These include the undertaking in the joint EU-Egypt Action Plan to “strengthen the role of media in combating xenophobia and discrimination on the grounds of religious belief or culture” and encouraging the media “to assume its responsibilities in this regard”.</p>
<p>The Council will continue to pay close attention to this issue and may raise it on other occasions within the EU’s regular political dialogue with Egypt.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0255"></a>

Work is still underway to solve the few outstanding issues with the aim of the Partnership becoming fully operational as from 1 January 2010. The Partnership will play a crucial role in addressing various transport/logistics related bottlenecks as well as facilitating key infrastructure projects agreed by all partners.</p>
<p>An important concern remains the imposition of a new road user charge scheme by Russia, which it has implemented as of 1 February 2009. The Commission urged Russia to remove these discriminatory tariffs, which give an unfair advantage to Russian hauliers in a market that should be balanced and fair. In this context, agreeing to revitalise the EU-Russia Transport Dialogue and the discussion of Commissioner in charge of Transport on this issue with Russian Transport Minister Levitin in February are two steps in the right direction. The Commission is presently in contact with Russia with a view to re-energising our Transport Dialogue and convening Working Group meetings covering all areas of mutual concern. The Commission will make further efforts to stop implementation of the scheme so as to avoid raising new barriers in our trade and transport relations.</p>
<p>The Commission is determined to pursue constructive cooperation with Russia also in the field of transport and logistics. Our bilateral transport dialogue as well as the Northern Dimension Partnership will be important tools in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0230"></a>

<p>(FR) For years the Commission has been undertaking many initiatives and actions that are designed to make passengers aware of the rights granted to them by Community law and to enforce those rights in practice.</p>
<p>Firstly, in 2007 the Commission undertook the large-scale distribution of new posters and brochures, available in all the official languages of the European Union. The Commission’s poster, which offers an insight into the various types of rights granted to passengers, has now been placed in the large majority of Community airports by the ACI (Airports Council International). These posters and brochures are free of charge and can also be ordered via the Internet on the Commission’s website.</p>
<p>Through the ‘Europe Direct Contact Centre’ passengers can also receive the information they need by telephone, e-mail or web-chat. This Commission-funded information centre responds to requests for information in all the official languages of the European Union.</p>
<p>In November 2008 the Commissioner for Transport set up a new contact point that can be accessed via his website and that of the DG TREN<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Here passengers can address their requests for information on all Community regulations relating to their rights. These information requests are answered very promptly via the Europe Direct service.</p>
<p>Next, the Commission has verified that the vast majority of the competent national authorities (NEBs) have also set up websites providing necessary information in their national language on Regulation No 261/2004 on passengers’ rights in the event of cancellation, long delays and denied boarding, and on Regulation No 1107/2006 concerning the rights of disabled passengers and persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air.</p>
<p>NEBs also carry out inspections to verify that airlines are fulfilling their obligation to provide written information to passengers, directly at check-in and in case of incident, under Regulation No 261/2004.</p>
<p>Lastly, in 2008 the Commission launched a video to coincide with the entry into force of Regulation No 1107/2006 on the specific rights of persons with reduced mobility when travelling by air. This video has also been distributed as a communication tool to all airports belonging to the ACI. Information concerning Regulation 1107/2006 and its implementation is a regular agenda item at the meetings of the High-Level Group, whose participants include representatives of European civil society most directly affected by such legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Between 2000 and 2008, Greek shipowners collected 226,822,254.98 euro in subsidies for operating ferry services to islands on unprofitable routes. The subsidies soared with the PASOK government's introduction of Law No. 2932/2001, which implemented Regulation (EEC) No. 3577/92<a href="#defann_14_1" name="refann_14_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In 2003, when the law entered into force, the subsidies shot up from 12,000,000 euro in 2002 to 25,180,000 euro. The scandal of shipowners receiving subsidies paid for by the Greek people is also being perpetuated by the current New Democracy government which, in 2008-2009 alone, secured the shipowners more than 100,000,000 euro, i.e. a profit of 267,315.41 euro per route. During the same period, fares rose by 376%.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's position on the substantiated allegations that shipowners are enjoying a 'goldmine' of subsidies for 'patented' unprofitable ferry routes? Why does it not publish the related report on ferry services within the Member States of the EU?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) In accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 (on maritime cabotage), public service contracts may be concluded where the market does not provide an adequate maritime transport service to islands. There is very broad scope for the Member States to assess the ‘adequate’ nature of the service.</p>
<p>In return for services provided, the Member States grant financial compensation to the shipowner in charge of providing the public service. The compensation may not exceed the amount necessary to cover the costs of the service, taking into account the operators’ revenue and a reasonable profit.</p>
<p>The Member States are not obliged to notify the Commission of either the public service contracts concluded, or the associated compensation. For this reason the Commission does not have access to detailed information on the amounts granted to shipowners in the Member States. The Commission would point out, however, that compensation of this kind is granted by all Member States which have islands and use this type of public service contract.</p>
<p>The honourable Member is suggesting that certain profitable routes are deemed to be unprofitable in order to justify the payment of compensation. If this is in fact the case, the Commission believes that the routes in question should be made subject to a purely commercial system. The Commission would be very grateful if the honourable Member could provide it with detailed information on the routes in question.</p>
<p>Lastly, with regard to the report on the application of ferry services, a consultation is under way with the national maritime authorities and the other interested parties with the aim of collecting information for use in assessing the operation of ferry services and the effects of their liberalisation.

<p>(EN) The Commission recognises the importance of moving to a resource-efficient, low-carbon economy<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Progress made towards this structural change will depend principally on the development of new up to date and coordinated policies in various fields, on the pace of implementation of existing policies including those aimed at reducing carbon dioxide in the Member States, the speed at which markets and technologies mature, and the degree of responsiveness of the labour markets to accommodate all these changes.</p>
<p>In order to mitigate and adapt to climate change and meet other environmental challenges, a comprehensive strategic approach and coordinated action by policy-makers involved are needed in several fields in addition to energy and employment (such as the environment, industry, R&amp;D, transport and education). In relation to adaptation, the ingredients for coordinated action across different sectors and levels of governance were set out recently by the Commission in its White Paper 'Adapting to climate change: Towards a European framework for action'<a href="#defann_15_2" name="refann_15_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. With regard to mitigation, the climate and energy package adopted last December is a fundamental step in the right direction and its implementation will create employment opportunities in the energy sector. E.g. the renewable energy sector is expected to have between 2,3 to 2,7 million jobs by 2020, with a high contribution from small and medium sized enterprises<a href="#defann_15_3" name="refann_15_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Further efforts to facilitate the transition to a low-carbon economy may be facilitated under the Lisbon Strategy to help speed up the restructuring process and ensure it runs smoothly. The Economic Recovery plans for most, if not all, Member States, contain a focus on investment in green technologies, and on the aim of creating green jobs. EU policy in this area seeks to create more and better jobs and to make employment cost-effective and sustainable. Reducing the carbon footprint at the workplace would make all jobs in the EU economy greener.</p>
<p>Information on skills profiles in a 'green' economy is scarce, partly because not enough awareness exists of the potential effects of structural change. It is reasonable to assume that the 'greening' of skills will involve, first, the application of traditional qualifications and skills to the production/use of new 'greener' techniques, material and products, and secondly, specific 'green' skills, such as for reducing the carbon footprint. The Commission has therefore recognised two measures as important, namely developing a capacity to identify skills for the green economy and to match labour-market requirements, and the organisation of training programmes to develop the skills needed to fill new positions.</p>
<p>In its Communication to the Spring European Council<a href="#defann_15_4" name="refann_15_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, the Commission underlined the importance of improvements in monitoring and anticipating skills needed, and matching and upgrading skills in line with future labour-market needs, such as for jobs required by the green economy. It will therefore support the Member States and the social partners in anticipating the forthcoming changes linked to the greening of the economy and the associated labour-market challenges. The Commission's 'New Skills for New Jobs' initiative<a href="#defann_15_5" name="refann_15_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> sets out a number of activities to improve knowledge of current and future labour-market demand and mobilise various Community instruments to support skills upgrading. In 2009 the Commission will accordingly step up cooperation with the ILO<a href="#defann_15_6" name="refann_15_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and Cedefop<a href="#defann_15_7" name="refann_15_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>on the development of tools and methods for anticipating skills required, in particular from a 'green skills' perspective.</p>
<p>The Restructuring Forum which the Commission will host in June will consider issues relating to the easing of adverse effects on workers and employers due to the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change. It will also look at the issue of skills and at how to provide retraining for those affected or those who can take advantage of the opportunities associated with low-carbon technologies.</p>
<p>Simplifying the European Social Fund rules in line with the European Economic Recovery Plan will also make it easier to fund such measures as training and skills upgrading, activation measures for unemployed and redundant workers, and support for self-employment. The flexicurity approach<a href="#defann_15_8" name="refann_15_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> may also assist in the process of adaptation to the structural challenges of climate change.</p>
<p>With ambitious spending on green economy and environmental projects (€105 billion for the 2007-2013 period), Cohesion Policy is making a considerable contribution to sustainable growth and jobs in Europe as well as to the EU objectives in the fight against climate change. In particular, Cohesion Policy is contributing €3 billion to the promotion of environmentally-friendly products and production processes in SMEs<a href="#defann_15_9" name="refann_15_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a> and to new “green-collar” jobs. One of the clear aims of funding for research and innovation is to boost overall investment in green technologies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Exchange rates are subject to significant fluctuations, which are generally, although not always, related to changes in economic fundamentals. The recent fall in the British pound can be related to a number of economic factors. These include financial market participants' concern about the United Kingdom's twin deficit (a large trade deficit coupled with a growing budget deficit, including large contingent liabilities), fears that the recession will be deeper in the United Kingdom than in other advanced economies and sharp interest rate cuts by the Bank of England. In addition, although to a lesser extent than the United States dollar, the euro has benefited from flight-to-safety flows since the outbreak of the financial market crisis. Furthermore, the depreciation of the pound in 2007 and 2008 started from a level where the pound was clearly above its long-term historical average.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission regretted the decision of the last Summit of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC, 29 December 2008) to suspend the negotiations for an Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the EU.</p>
<p>Despite the suspension, the Commission, as negotiator of the Agreement, considers that an agreement is within reach if there is sufficient flexibility on the remaining issues (i.e., the political clauses, and the prohibition of export duties). It remains, therefore, committed to continuing the discussions.</p>
<p>The signals emerging from the 29 April 2009 EU-GCC Ministerial Meeting in Oman were positive : the GCC and the EU reviewed their recent consultations on the FTA and agreed to continue such consultations on all outstanding issues, so as to permit the resumption – and ideally the conclusion - of these long-running negotiations.</p>
<p>The Commission remains determined to make further efforts to find mutually acceptable solutions.</p>
<p>The results of the London G20 summit are very significant and deliver a strong message of global unity on both the diagnosis and the solutions in the face of the ongoing crisis. Saudi Arabia’s role was very constructive, especially with regard to regulatory reform and the reform of the International Financial Institutions. The Commission welcomes, in particular, Saudi Arabia’s support of the increase in International Monetary Fund resources.</p>
<p>In the light of the current international political environment, EU and GCC Ministers discussed the global economic and financial crisis and the way to address it at their Ministerial meeting in Oman held last week (29 April 2009). A detailed discussion on the current global imbalances will be the subject of the next economic dialogue between the Commission and the GCC on 15 June 2009 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The agenda of the EU-GCC Joint Council and Ministerial meeting (Oman, 29 April) included, like in previous years, cooperation issues and political matters of common interest for both the EU and the GCC:</p>
<p>Implementation of the 1989 Cooperation Agreement: state of play and prospects of cooperation activities in fields of mutual interest, such as energy, environment/climate change, research, higher education;</p>
<p>regional questions such as the Middle East Peace Process, Iran and Iraq;</p>
<p>a number of global issues such as counter-terrorism and non-proliferation, climate change, human rights and the global economic and financial crisis.</p>
<p>On all these issues, and on the FTA, the EU and the GCC exchanged views in Oman. A Joint Communiqué was agreed between the two parties. The main outcomes of the meeting were the decision to revitalize the bilateral relation between the two parties on the basis of the existing cooperation agreement, and the decision to continue talks on the FTA with a view to resume the negotiations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0225"></a>

<p>(EN) With regard to the Structural Funds and in according with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission is not involved in the selection of projects, with the exception of so-called major projects (above €25 million for environment and €50 million for all other sectors) which the Commission appraises in accordance with Article 41 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006. The responsibility for the selection of projects rests with the national or regional authorities in Poland. Since the value of the project in question does not exceed the thresholds for major projects, any decisions taken on whether the project will receive support from the Structural Funds is the responsibility of the Member State. For projects being implemented within the framework of the Regional Operational Programmes, the institution responsible for their selection is the Marshal's Office, in its role as the Managing Authority of the operational programme.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore suggests contacting the Malopolskie Marshal's Office.<a href="#defann_18_1" name="refann_18_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>

<p>According to the Council Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 of 11 July 2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund, Cohesion policy should contribute to increasing growth, competitiveness and employment by incorporating the Community's priorities for sustainable development as defined at the Lisbon European Council of 23 and 24 March 2000 and at the Göteborg European Council of 15 and 16 June 2001.</p>
<p>More generally, with regard to culture and its funding at national level it should be remembered that such funding is a responsibility of the Member States. Action at EU level is undertaken in full respect of the principle of subsidiarity, with the role of the EU being to support and complement actions of the Member States and not to substitute these.</p>

<p>(EN) Member States have established their own registers in which health professionals' members of a regulated profession are listed and where mention of disciplinary actions or criminal sanctions against them are included, where appropriate.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Directive 2005/36/EC<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the recognition of professional qualifications has reinforced the administrative cooperation between competent authorities, as exchange of information between the home and the host Member State has become an obligation. More specifically, it concerns the exchange of information with regard to disciplinary actions or criminal sanctions taken or any other serious, specific circumstances which are likely to have consequences for the pursuit of the activities in question, as well as any information relevant to the legality of the service provider's establishment and his/her good conduct.</p>
<p>An electronic tool, called IMI (Internal Market Information system), has been developed and facilitates information exchange between the relevant competent authorities on the basis of standard forms, pre-translated into all languages, which contains questions relevant for the effective application of Directive 2005/36/EC. The IMI system is fully operational for the health professionals, such as doctors, dentists, nurses, midwives, pharmacists and physiotherapists.</p>
<p>This exchange of information between Member States has to respect personal data protection legislation provided for in Directive 95/46/EC<a href="#defann_19_2" name="refann_19_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data and Directive 2002/58/EC<a href="#defann_19_3" name="refann_19_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> on privacy and electronic communications.</p>
<p>In 2012, the Commission will provide a report on the application of Directive 2005/36/EC in which an assessment of its provisions will be made. If it then becomes clear that the various obligations and means of exchange of information remain inadequate to deal with the problems at stake, the obligations (and their modalities) related to the exchange of information may have to be reconsidered.</p>
<p>The Commission's proposal for a directive on patients' rights in cross border health care focuses on the rights and mobility of patients. This proposal sets out the obligation for healthcare professionals to provide all relevant information to enable patients to make an informed choice. This may include confirmation of this registration status.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

As indicated in the follow-up note, the definition of corporate social responsibility used by the Commission and EU Member States encompasses measures undertaken by firms themselves on a voluntary basis, not as a response to compulsory regulation. Thus obligatory measures such as supply chain monitoring by public bodies or other independent audits are not foreseen.</p>
<p>The Commission has engaged with the private sector through the European Alliance for Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and has supported a series of workshops or "laboratories" addressing social and environmental themes. These workshops have resulted in a number of recommendations and tools to support the corporate sector, including a new web portal providing guidance for companies on social and environmental issues in the supply chain.</p>
<p>The Commission hosts a Multistakeholder Forum for CSR involving employers, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs), Trade Unions, academic representatives and investors. It also participates in the OECD<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> initiative to develop and promote Multinational Guidelines, as well as encouraging EU industry to join the United Nations (UN) Global Compact. More recently, the Commission and Member States are examining the framework developed by John Ruggie, the UN Special Representative on Human Rights and Business, in his 2008 UN report entitled Protect, Respect, and Remedy. In particular, the Commission intends to launch, in cooperation with the UN Special Representative, a study on the legal framework regarding human rights and environmental issues applicable to EU companies when they operate in 3<span class="sup">rd</span> countries.</p>
<p>As indicated during the presentation of the follow-up note at the meeting of the JPA Social Committee in February 2009, the Commission would be happy to participate in the September 2009 meeting of the JPA Social Committee to discuss new developments and the outcome of further follow-up measures. One such follow-up measure will include the next meeting of the European Forum on the Rights of the Child<a href="#defann_20_3" name="refann_20_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> (a permanent advisory forum on children rights in internal and external action), which is being organised for 18 June 2009 and which will focus on child labour.

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the suggestions of a link between cancer and night work, considered to be "probable" by the WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises that this "probable" link is known to the scientific community, whose research is based on the preliminary assumption that night shift work can impair normal rhythmic biological cycles. This has an impact on the production of melatonin which, in turn, induces an abnormal increased production of hormones, and thus the risk of developing certain types of cancer.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively involved in trying to reduce the negative impact of working conditions in relation to cancer. The European Agency for Safety and Health at Work and the European Foundation for the Improvement of Living and Working Conditions are also actively engaged in investigating the affects of disrupted sleep patterns on health.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the main scope for preventing cancer remains through taking preventative actions based on major health determinants, as set out in the European Code against Cancer. It has been estimated that around one third of all cancers could be prevented by modifying or avoiding key risk factors, such as tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>More generally, to support the Member States in their efforts to tackle the burden of cancer more efficiently , the Commission plans to launch the European Partnership for Action Against Cancer in September 2009. The Partnership will provide a framework for identifying and sharing information, capacity and expertise in cancer prevention and control, by bringing together relevant stakeholders across the EU in a collective effort to address cancer.</p>
<p>Actions regarding workers' protection from the risks triggered by any working conditions are covered by Council Directive of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work (Directive 89/391/EEC).</p>
<p>In addition, the Working Time Directive (Directive 2003/88/EC)<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> contains a number of specific protection measures for night workers. Member States must take the necessary measures to ensure that night workers are entitled under the Directive to a free health assessment, before they are assigned to night work and at regular intervals afterwards. They must also ensure that workers who suffer from health problems connected to their night work are transferred, whenever possible, to day work for which they are suited. Employers who regularly use night work must inform the competent authorities, if the authorities so request. And Member States must also ensure that employers who are setting work patterns take account of the general principle of adapting work to the worker, and of safety and health requirements.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to follow the important issue of the suggested link between cancer and night work.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member refers to pollution of the river Sperchios and of the Maliakos Gulf, and to related impacts on fish population and fishermen in the area.</p>
<p>EU environmental legislation provides clear mechanisms for protecting our waters by:</p>
<p>addressing pollution at the source through Directives such as the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and the Directive on Integrated Prevention and Control of Pollution (IPPC)<a href="#defann_23_2" name="refann_23_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a></p>
<p>setting environmental objectives for all waters (rivers, lakes, groundwaters and coastal waters) through the Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_23_3" name="refann_23_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Urban Waste Water Directive required Member States to collect and treat waste water from all settlement areas of more than 2000 inhabitants (or the equivalent in waste water pollution) by either 1998, 2000 or 2005 (depending on the size of the settlement area and the characteristics of the affected waters). The Directive on Integrated Prevention and Control of Pollution (IPPC) requires industrial installations within its scope to be subject to an integrated permit, including conditions based on the best available techniques. Existing installations were required to be covered by permits compliant with the Directive by 30 October 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission has scrutinised implementation by Greece of both Directives and concluded that the obligations have not been adequately implemented. Therefore, the Commission has started legal infringement procedures against Greece in respect of both Directives.</p>
<p>The Water Framework Directive provides for an obligation to achieve/maintain good water quality ('good status') for all waters by 2015 as a rule. Member States were required to carry out an environmental analysis of pressures and impacts by December 2004 and are required to develop plans and programmes for achieving 'good status' by 22 December 2009.</p>
<p>The environmental analysis of pressures and impacts for the Sperchios river specifically addresses water quality problems in that river. As mentioned by the Honourable Member for the Maliakos Gulf, disturbance of the ecosystem by pollution may also lead to mass growth of certain algae including with toxic impacts on fish. 'Good status' for rivers and estuaries ('transitional waters') is defined by a range of criteria including composition and abundance of fish fauna. The plans and programmes due by December 2009 will have to address existing problems and set out measures to achieve the environmental quality objective both for the river Sperchios and the Maliakos Gulf.</p>
<p>As regards possible support for the fisheries sector in that area, under the European Fisheries Funds Regulation<a href="#defann_23_4" name="refann_23_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, in the event of a natural disaster or other exceptional occurrence, Member States are allowed to take appropriate measures to contribute to the financing of aid measures for the temporary cessation of fishing activities. Whilst the general modalities and principles are defined by the Regulation, it is the responsibility of the Member States to decide whether the fishing activity concerned has to be closed as well as whether support can be given.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is regularly reviewing the list of exemptions from the "heavy metal ban" contained in Annex II to the ELV Directive 2000/53/EC<a href="#defann_27_3" name="refann_27_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. At the moment, the Commission is running a study preparing grounds for the 5<span class="sup">th</span> adaptation of this Annex to technical and scientific progress. This study focuses specifically on the two exemptions mentioned by the Honourable Member. The first public consultation on this subject was carried out between 26 January and 9 March 2009 (see: http://rohs-elv.exemptions.oeko.info). Once all the submitted technical and scientific data are verified by the Commission's consultant, a draft Commission decision amending Annex II will be prepared. This draft will undergo a consultation with all Commission Services and with the Member States who will vote on it. In the case of a successful vote, the draft will be subject to a three-month parliamentary scrutiny. After the latter, provided the result is positive, the measure will be adopted. The Commission is aiming at the adoption of this decision by the end of year 2009.</p>
<p>The process of reviewing Annex II does not create new economic burdens as it has been in place since the adoption of the Directive and the industry has always been aware that any of the exemptions may undergo a review process. The Commission services make all possible efforts to ensure the predictability and legal certainty for the industry, within the context of the rules and procedures which need to be applied during any revision process of Community legislation. The Commission is in regular contacts with the industry on this issue and endeavours to provide accurate information about the status of the revision of Annex II at each of its steps.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that demand-side measures such as scrapping schemes can play an important role in promoting fleet renewal and the replacement of older, more polluting cars with newer, technologically, more advanced vehicles. Therefore the Commission has welcomed relevant Member States initiatives while ensuring that these schemes are in conformity with the Community legislation.</p>
<p>Measures concerning demand-side which aim at improving the demand for new vehicles and assisting with the scrapping of older ones are foreseen by the European Economic Recovery Plan<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted in November 2008. This Recovery Plan sets out the key elements of the public support for the automotive sector.</p>
<p>On 16 February 2009 the Commission invited Member States experts for an exchange of best practices in relation to scrapping schemes. Consequently, on 25 February 2009 the Commission has adopted "Guidance on scrapping schemes for vehicles" as part of the Communication "Responding to the crisis in the European automotive industry"<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In this paper the Commission has indicated its willingness to strengthen the coordination of national measures with a view to ensuring full effectiveness of the measures and prevent distortion of the Internal Market. The guidance paper gives practical guidance to Member States on how to design scrapping schemes for vehicles and explains the relevant Community legislation. Moreover, Member States have been invited to always notify their scrapping schemes to the Commission in the interest of transparency. The Commission committed itself to assess the schemes quickly and to verify compliance with Directive 98/34/EC<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which requires notification of technical regulations at a draft stage. The Commission, therefore, does not currently intend see any necessity for legislative action to establish a framework for scrap premiums at this point of time.</p>
<p>Currently, 10 Member States have scrapping schemes in place and 2 more have announced their prompt introduction in the near term. It is worth remarking that the characteristics of the existing schemes vary, especially with regard to the conditions for the minimum age of the vehicle to be scrapped (from 9 to 15 years) and the requirements for the vehicle to be acquired (i.e. Euro emissions, CO2 emissions, maximum mileage).</p>
<p>It is too early to assess the overall efficiency of these schemes. However, based on the available information, these schemes have proved to be successful in some Member States with positive spill-over effects to other Member States. The smaller decline of passenger car registrations in Europe recorded in March 2009 has been attributed to the scrapping schemes. Also in March 2009, in some Member States, these incentives boosted sales significantly compared to the same month last year (Germany by 40 %, Slovakia by 18 %, France by 8 %). It is also reported that the schemes increase demand for more compact, environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars. However, no systematic assessment is available regarding the impacts on average CO2 emissions or air pollutant emissions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
