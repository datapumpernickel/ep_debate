<p class="contents">The European Union is increasingly concerned about the continued lack of respect for human rights and the rule of law in Belarus. Over the last months, the situation has gone from bad to worse, with further repressive measures and policies towards civil society and political opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many concerns. The first of them is the immediate and unconditional release of all 12 political prisoners and their rehabilitation. The presence of political prisoners in the heart of Europe is a shame.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also deeply concerned about reports of torture and inhumane prison conditions of political prisoners. The Belarusian authorities are under an absolute obligation to ensure the respect of the prohibition of torture and inhuman treatment and have a responsibility to investigate reports thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">All harassment of members of the opposition, and of civil society, must stop, and their freedom of movement cannot be impeded. The increasingly draconian legislation that will further restrict the Belarusian citizens’ freedoms of assembly and association, as well as provision of support to civil society, must be rolled back.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus remains the only country in Europe to still apply capital punishment. As already highlighted in this House, the European Union remains opposed to capital punishment under all circumstances. Along the lines of the Parliament’s resolution of 16 February, the European Union calls on the authorities of Belarus not to carry out the executions of Dmitry Konovalov and Vladislav Kovalyov, and to introduce a moratorium on capital punishment in view of its eventual abolition.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s policies are principled. We remain committed to a visible and united defence of our values – human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. It is clear that we cannot stay idle in face of developments in a country that is neighbouring three of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s restrictive measures are an important instrument to keep up political pressure, to strengthen our political message to Belarus. The European Union has repeatedly stressed that they remain open and under constant review. In January, the Council expanded the criteria to target those responsible for serious violations of human rights, the repression of civil society and opposition and persons or entities benefiting from or supporting the regime. As highlighted by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton after the February Foreign Affairs Council, work is currently ongoing in view of a decision to be taken by the 23 March Foreign Affairs Council, on the basis of a list of business interests supporting the regime or drawing benefits from it.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made clear that the EU’s policies are not directed against Belarus as such, nor against its people. The EU maintains its policy of critical engagement, including through dialogue and the Eastern Partnership. We remain ready to develop our bilateral relations, depending on progress made by the authorities towards the respect for the principles of democracy, human rights and rule of law. As highlighted by High Representative/Vice-President Ashton in her joint statement with Secretary of State Clinton in December 2011, the European Union remains willing to assist Belarus to meet its obligations in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The engagement with Belarusian civil society, the political opposition and the public at large is a crucial element of the EU’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain ready to launch negotiations for visa facilitation and readmission agreements which would enhance people-to-people contacts to the benefit of the Belarusian population. It is regrettable that the Belarusian authorities have so far failed our invitation to start negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also step up our dialogue with civil society and the political opposition through a ‘European dialogue on modernisation’ with the Belarusian society on necessary reforms for the modernisation of Belarus and on the related potential development of relations with the European Union, as well as possible EU support in this regard. The European Union and its Member States want to reach out to Belarus and to share their successful experience of transition to democracy and market economy. Once conditions are ripe, the EU will also be ready to provide the right conditions for EU companies and financial institutions to support the country’s transformation and to invest in Belarus’s future privatisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">The European dialogue will be launched in Brussels on 29 March in Brussels: what we want to achieve is an open exercise taking in all political forces, and civil society, with substantial involvement by EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In difficult times, it is important to maintain channels also of communication and information. This is why the EU upgraded its delegation in Minsk last summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to the request by the Belarusian authorities on 28 February that the EU Head of Delegation and the Ambassador of Poland should leave the country for consultations, the European Union agreed in a determined act of solidarity to withdraw all EU ambassadors for consultations. Our ambassadors fulfil a crucial function on the ground in Belarus as channels of communication and information and we remain committed to a unified and coordinated approach also to the issue of their return.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, nothing has happened until now to encourage us to change our policies towards the authorities in Minsk. Not the release of political prisoners and their rehabilitation. The persecution of opposition figures since the elections of December 2010 continues. Breaches of human rights continue. And, yes, further sanctions will probably not improve our bilateral relations with Minsk. This is regrettable but it is unavoidable if we are to remain true to our values.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only thank the honourable Members for their determination to face this difficult issue head-on. We owe it to the people of Belarus to show that we have solidarity with them in these difficult times and that there will be a European future when conditions allow.</p>
<p class="contents">The support of Members of this House in the unfolding situation in Belarus since the presidential elections of 19 December 2010 has been crucial to keep the issue high on the EU’s agenda. It has also been crucial to maintain the political pressure on Belarus to change its current repressive policies and to take the necessary steps, which would allow it to find its proper place in European cooperation. We look forward to examining the resolution that this House will adopt tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that our relations with Belarus – with our neighbour – and the domestic situation in Belarus are often discussed in this Chamber, and recently even very often. It was only in February that we discussed or we appealed for a moratorium on the use of capital punishment in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we are talking about the response of the Union to the diplomatic war declared on Europe two weeks ago by the authorities in Minsk. The effect of this war may be an intensification of the country’s self-imposed isolation. I hope this prospect does not amuse anyone at all – not even anyone in Belarus, not even the undemocratically elected authorities – because the only consequence of greater isolation would be to advance the process by which Belarus is losing its independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the irrational decision to ask the Ambassador of Poland and the EU Head of Delegation to leave Minsk, it is still possible to prevent the situation from deteriorating further. There is still time for Belarus to resume elementary relations with the Western world, but, of course, this would need the release of political prisoners, an end to the repression of opposition activists, independent journalists and human rights defenders, and preparations for parliamentary elections to be held in accordance with elementary, minimum European principles. In short, it is time for change, and this is an appeal to Minsk, before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it isolates not only itself but also the Belarusian people. This is not what we want. In our resolution and in our demands, we express solidarity with the Belarusian people. We want to show them – and we want them to know – that here in the European Parliament, in the European Union, we express our solidarity, our help and our hope that, in a similar way to Belarus’s neighbours, Belarusian society and the Belarusian state will one day move along the path towards more human rights, more civic rights, more democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belarusian economy is in dire straits. If we look at the budget deficit, the current account deficit and the future prospects, there is no way for an improvement without reforms. These reforms are not possible without reforming society, engaging in dialogue with young people, independent groups, the opposition, journalists and trade unions. Only in this way can a society – whether it is the Belarusian society or any other – be stable, and only in this way can both the society and the economy improve.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what we wanted to express in our resolution, part of which, of course, comprises our demands to release all political prisoners, no matter what their political affiliation. This is what we would like to express in our joint resolution. I think it is the view not only of the Socialists and Democrats but all democratic groups in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the fraudulent re-election of President Lukashenko, the dictator has treated the opposition with brutal severity and terror.</p>
<p class="contents">Dozens of people, whose only crimes were to demand democracy and participation, have been given long prison sentences, with their confessions being obtained under torture. For this reason, the EU has imposed a travel ban for supporters of the regime who were involved in this, and it has also frozen their foreign accounts. This is a strategy, which, on the one hand, exerts pressure on the system and, on the other, supports civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should look closely at the extent to which these measures actually work, and why the Belarusian Interior Minister is able to travel to the Interpol conference in Lyon, for example, while the sons of the dictator can explore the world with total impunity as members of the National Olympic Committee. The freezing of accounts, which is a matter for the individual EU Member States, is also questionable.</p>
<p class="contents">As most companies in Belarus are owned by the state, the EU, with a trade surplus of USD 6 billion last year, has, unfortunately, become the largest supporter of Lukashenko’s system, thereby keeping it going.</p>
<p class="contents">Targeted measures that affect the regime but harm the people in the country as little as possible would therefore be necessary. Economic sanctions against selected companies and intermediaries would have this effect, as the export of fertilisers, steel and crude oil products is 100% dependent on the West.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I do not think it is a good idea to relocate the World Ice Hockey Championships. This symbolic gesture may satisfy a few people, but it will affect the wrong people and is more likely to provide fuel for the dictator’s propaganda. Indeed, we experienced this with the Olympics boycott in Moscow, and we refrained from taking this route in connection with Beijing. After all, if we were to apply the method of boycotting sport consistently, we would also have to refuse to hold the European Football Championships in Ukraine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It mentions all the things we always mention – maintenance of economic sanctions, release of political prisoners and a guarantee of the basic conditions needed for political cooperation, public activity and a free society. It demands the release of political prisoners, and I personally am very pleased that it includes the names of Dmitry Bandarenka and Ivan Shyla – people I have met and know personally. However, there is something else important here, something we also talk about from time to time – the support the European Union gives to free media, because only free media can change the way Belarusians see their situation, so that in the free elections which are sure to come sooner or later, they will be able to vote with real freedom, democratically and in accordance with their own wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new here, and its importance should be stressed, is that in contrast to one of the previous speakers, I think it is, in fact, very important that we have called for the Ice Hockey World Championships to be moved to another country than Belarus. Why? It is because a celebration such as a world championships must not be held in a place or a country where there is no cause for celebration, where political activists are in prison, and where torture is used on oppositionists. This is an important new aspect, and we should welcome its inclusion in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When one of my children gets angry with another, that second one always goes off to join a third. Why does he go off? It is because he has somewhere to go. Europe’s relations with Belarus can actually be compared to relations between children. If we are not careful, we may send Belarus away from Europe altogether, because it has somewhere to go. Where is that? It is Russia, where, in recent years, democratic expression has decreased, not increased.</p>
<p class="contents">If we should like Belarus to get closer to Europe, then we must act very carefully and wisely. We must use both the carrot and the stick. The carrot would be not to reduce but to increase economic cooperation with Belarus. Through economic cooperation, we will achieve a situation where a section of the people become wealthier, and a prosperous class will be created. We can see that throughout North Africa, and in Russia itself, it is, in fact, the middle class, the affluent middle class, that demands democratic change in a country. The stick must be political sanctions, which, of course, maintain the requirements for the Belarus Government to respect human rights.

I think that, as stated in the draft resolution, the European Union is responding correctly by not allowing itself to be split into good and bad Member States. It is providing an adequate response by clearly signalling to Lukashenko that the Member States of the European Union or the European Union as a whole cannot be blackmailed in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the big question which we cannot basically find the answer to is: what else can we do as a European Parliament, a European Union and based on the commitment of individual Member States to change the situation in this country? How can we support civil society and what else can we do so that political prisoners are freed and to ensure that there will be no more political prisoners in Belarus? How should we bring about a gradual shift towards democratisation in Belarus so that the next elections will at least be a little more honest and a little more democratic than what we saw during the previous parliamentary elections?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we do not seem to be showing enough imagination in this area, and the methods we are resorting to seem again to be either tightening the sanctions or applying what is the new element in this resolution: we mention the option of imposing targeted economic sanctions. We must, of course, carefully remark at this point that they must not affect the citizens of Belarus. We are also talking about the World Ice Hockey Championships and it possibly being moved somewhere other than Belarus. I feel that this sounds more like a desperate move on our part. If this action is implemented, let us give it a try, but I do not think that it will produce the result sought after.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is important for us not to close the door and to use every opportunity. We will do this under the auspices of the Euronest Parliamentary Assembly. We will continue our efforts, and let us still hope that we achieve results. We must all put our heads together about how to change this situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the championship is in 2014, and there is still time to achieve progress, instead of saying that there will be none by 2014. Secondly, it is very important to understand that during the championship, a very large number of people will have come to Belarus. The fans and many others will be able to have direct contact with Belarusians and freely express their opinions and, to a certain extent, pass on information, perhaps not through politicians, but directly, on what the situation is.

Fantasies and illusions; every six months, a change of position; thaws and freezes. It has ended the way it has, and now we are wondering what to do about it. So I propose that instead of starting with harsh words and a show of sabre-rattling, it is time we gave the matter some thought and began at last to pursue a consistent policy, so that the Member States do not work against each other or talk officially about human rights while quietly agreeing terms over some nice little investment, because all of this is getting us nowhere, and Belarus is going nowhere. The only one who is happy about all this is Mr Lukashenko.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing today is to support the opposition, to show unequivocal support for the opposition, and demonstrate that it is they who are our partners. Lukashenko must hear from us that if there is to be another – quote – ‘thaw’, it will only happen in connection with specific changes. First and foremost, this means freedom for the press, independent newspapers, freedom in the Internet and an end to censorship. We should give him these conditions. He will never change his position on elections, because he cannot bring himself to do this. If we start making another agreement with him about some kind of election, we will end up going back to the same policy: fantasies, mood swings, every six months a new approach from the European Union – all this will only encourage Lukashenko to treat the opposition badly and keep oppositionists in prison. I have one simple piece of advice – we need to be consistent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The number of arrests of politicians is growing, as is the number of questionable trials, and threats to opponents of the regime and the press. There are bans on visas for journeys to and from the European Union. Tragically, following a questionable trial with unconvincing evidence, the death penalty was imposed on two young men. The time and place when the sentence will be carried out has been kept secret, even from their relatives. At the same time, it must be acknowledged that the expulsion of ambassadors confirms that the regime’s nerves are failing, and so we must continue to stress that the development of our relations is directly dependent on its ability to fulfil commitments in the sphere of human rights and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, Belarus is a small state, and is not rich in natural or energy resources. However, in stepping up the sanctions against the Lukashenko regime, we must refrain from the double standards that we sometimes adopt when assessing similar events, in Russia, for instance. Specific sanctions against the main actors within the regime must be widened, to include a ban on travelling to the European Union and freezing property and bank accounts. Sanctions must be directed against specific persons and entrepreneurs who support the regime, but not against the people or small traders. If we suspend cooperation with Belarus, then it is the people of Belarus that will suffer most and, for our part, we shall no longer be their allies, but people who have done them wrong. The regime’s leadership will pull through, though, by putting the blame for its difficulties on us. Our sanctions must serve as a political tool, and that means they should also support the civil society of Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The authorities in Minsk can still choose the sort of relationship they want to have with the European Union. However, it is regrettable that recently, they seem to be turning more and more into a dead end of isolationism. This means that once again, there will be no choice in the forthcoming parliamentary elections in Belarus. Minsk could revive relations with the European Union by freeing and rehabilitating all political prisoners, and this would not mean giving in to EU pressure, but would be a step towards implementing fundamental human rights in the country. I believe that both Belarus’ partners in Euronest and Russia should encourage Belarus to take such action. The EU does not want to worsen relations, which have already hit rock bottom, so that ordinary people in the EU and Belarus do not suffer. There are no insurmountable arguments that would prevent European Union countries from cooperating with their neighbour Belarus. The fate of that country will be decided in Belarus itself and we should therefore welcome the increased activity of the National Platform of the Eastern Partnership Civil Society Forum. Recently, members of the opposition and journalists were prevented from leaving the country and such cases are becoming more frequent. I believe that the European Union should draw attention to such things and require Minsk to also implement freedom of movement, which is one of the fundamental rules of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the indications are that the European Union’s reaction has made an impression on the President of Belarus, so perhaps we have at last found a way to make what we do about Belarus more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This method is to take action which, for a variety of reasons, will be painful for the Belarusian authorities. So I agree with Mr Migalski that Belarus should not be the host of the Ice Hockey World Championships in 2014. Why? It is because the championships would certainly be an opportunity for President Lukashenko to get himself some good publicity and to present Belarus as a normal country where normal sports competitions are held. However, this is not true. It is not a normal country; it is a country where fundamental human rights are violated and where there is no democracy, and the world championships should not be held in a place whose people are denied fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the tolerant attitude to sport seen in politics meant that the Beijing Olympics did not result in any beneficial changes in China in the field of human rights, so the argument for tolerance is difficult to accept. We must not allow the neutral character of sport to be used to manipulate public opinion and build a false image of normality. So moving the world championships is an important demand and I fully support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To achieve this, concrete progress should be made, such as the termination of persecutions against the opposition, the release of political prisoners, the organisation of free elections and an opening of Belarus to European values.

<p class="contents">EU policy aims to remain engaged with the country and its people. The European Union will firstly continue to provide support, both political and financial, to civil society, which is at the forefront of the vital work to secure a democracy, basic rights and freedoms in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will provide political – and, if necessary, financial – support to the victims of the repression. We cannot leave them alone in a situation where their only hope for release and rehabilitation would be international support.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we will keep targeting the restrictive measures, thereby reinforcing the political message that we are sending to the Belarusian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not interested in harming the Belarusian people. We aim to target the people who are responsible for repression. It is very clear from this debate that we all believe that the future of Belarus is in the hands of the Belarusian people.</p>
<p class="contents">They should have a fair chance to take these decisions and, unfortunately today, this is not the case. This is why the EU should continue to engage, and I understand some of the decisions taken will always be discussed in this House. But I believe basically that, as I have heard from this debate, the High Representative/Vice-President’s line is very much supported by Parliament, and we will follow your resolution to be adopted tomorrow very closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, a lot has been said about freedom of speech and democratic values which are violated in Belarus. Behind that are standing different national and financial groups of European Parliament lobbyists. Nobody wants real dialogue with the current governing power in Belarus. Why then does the EU not talk about China, where the number of political prisoners is a hundred times higher? I do not understand those who cover their financial interests by ‘democratic values’. We become hilarious and vulnerable when, because of a bunch of political losers, we want to harm attitudes both towards the people of Belarus and the important sporting event, the World Ice Hockey Championship. I am against such an approach and I insist on the wording ‘Sport beyond politics’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
