<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doris Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Rehn, none of us have forgotten the failed constitutional reform last year, the strident and often nationalistic election slogans, the result that emerged from those elections, or the plan to close down the office of the High Representative, all of which prompted us, in December of last year, to put together a report on Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the beginning of this year, though, a number of things have changed more rapidly than we had dared hope, for there is a functioning government for the whole country, its parliament has got down to work; the EU has decided to reduce the number of EUFOR troops; the issue of what is to become of the High Representative and of the ‘Bonn powers’ is again being discussed; and it is to be hoped that a way will soon be found to implement police reform, to which the Republika Srpska was, until very recently, resistant. We are therefore putting all recriminations to one side and joining with the country’s rational elements in looking forward to improvements and to political breakthroughs.</p>
<p class="contents">The stridency of the election campaign and the threats of a referendum have faded away, and it is evident that they meant something other than what we thought they did.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report, we try to be specific about what the problems actually are, and one of them is the fact that constitutional revision – which is indispensable as a means of reinforcing the powers of the State – is long overdue. The prevailing zero-sum mentality according to which ‘what is good for others is bad for me’ is intolerable, and will never make achievement of a common policy possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That the Dayton constitution is an impracticable monster is not the fault of the politicians, but of those others who, after the war, divided Bosnia-Herzegovina into two entities, seeing that as the only way to find peace. Today, though, that division is justified only if both parts are really able to support the state as a whole and do not hamper its functioning, and so what I want to say is that constitutional reform is indispensable if Bosnia and Herzegovina are to find their way into the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear, though, that this constitutional reform is not a job for us or for some other so-called ‘internationals’, but a responsibility that the elected politicians of all three nationalities must shoulder. While the Venice Commission, or American or Canadian experts, can give help, it is the parliament – and on this the newly elected prime minister of Bosnia-Herzegovina agrees – that must be the platform on which this happens. The agenda of the constitutional reform process must set out definite steps and goals. There is also a blatant discrepancy between the functionality of Republika Srpska, which is one of the entities, and that of the other, the Federation, and this must be remedied in the interests of the State as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This House takes a great deal of interest in the development of Bosnia-Herzegovina; we want it to become a properly functioning integral state, able to look after its own citizens and creating the legal and economic framework conditions on which its young people, in particular, rely as the only foundation on which they – and, I might add, those expellees who are willing to return – can build a future for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal in strong terms to the Republika Srpska to join with the Croatian Government in seeking viable ways of facilitating the return of its former inhabitants to Posavina, in the north of Bosnia, which is still uninhabited and ravaged by war.</p>
<p class="contents">The report does not address the current tensions in Srebrenica, and I should like to do so now; it is to be hoped, though, that the end result of them will not be efforts at secession, and I appeal to all to seek ways of reconciliation in order to secure coexistence without hatred, not least for the younger generation, for separation and isolation help nobody. Successful reconciliation is also, however, dependent on the extradition of the war criminal Radovan Karadzic to the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, and this has not yet been done. It is past high time that this chapter was closed, and I have to say that I had hoped that ESFOR, and later EUFOR, would have played a really major part in this – more so, in fact, than they have actually done.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the House that Bosnia-Herzegovina is surrounded by the EU, and that its fate is closely tied up with our own and with that of its neighbours; it is for that reason that our policy in respect of this country and its neighbours must be central to our endeavours. The prospect of EU membership is the incentive for the people there to delay no longer in taking many difficult decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude my speech with a few words addressed to all those in positions of responsibility in Bosnia and Herzegovina, reminding them that our educational programmes are now open to young Bosnians, and that their government must now, therefore, do everything possible to get the necessary administration organised, with a national agency to manage the programmes, for the sooner that is set up, the sooner their young people will be able to participate in ERASMUS, LEONARDO and COMENIUS.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all very keen that Bosnia and Herzegovina should, over the next couple of months, get their hands on the tiller, in other words, should set to work on the reforms that they need. I want to thank my colleagues for their support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have read this extensive report and the recommendation with much interest, and are largely in agreement with the analysis of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the next steps to be taken by Sarajevo and by the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">At its last meeting, on 5 March, the General Affairs Council welcomed the formation of the new government in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which, after difficult negotiations, came into being on 9 February as a broad coalition of the major parties from the three ethnic groups under a new Prime Minister, Nikola Spiric, a Bosnian Serb. The Council also called on Mr Spiric to ensure the rapid and effective implementation of all the outstanding reforms, not least on the grounds that this is a precondition for the conclusion of this stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations on technical aspects of the SAA were successfully concluded at the end of 2006; the three conditions for its conclusion waiting to be fulfilled are reforms in the three areas of the police, public broadcasting and public administration. The fourth precondition is cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. If it makes progress in these areas, Mr Spiric’s new government will be able to further open the gate that leads to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s attention is currently focused on the reform of the police in particular, an agreement on which was concluded in October 2005, confirming that the underlying principles of the desired changes were the jurisdiction of the whole State over police matters, the exclusion of political influence and the necessity of functioning police districts. The police reform directorate submitted its final report on 27 December 2006, and this must now be approved, at the policy-making level, by the governments and parliaments of the State and of the Entities.</p>
<p class="contents">The main points of dispute are the Republika Srpska’s demands for the retention of its own police and internal affairs ministry and of police districts extending beyond the entity borders. The Council has called on the new government to use the current momentum to make progress on police reforms, which are, and will remain, a precondition for the signature of the stabilisation and association agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">While the EU welcomes the talks on the report from the police reform directorate, it still notes with concern the failure to meet the projected deadline of 2 March, by which agreement was to have been reached on reform of the police. The European Union expects all parties to discharge the commitments they made under the political Agreement of October 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the parties to reach an agreement incorporating the three fundamental principles specified by the Commission, firstly, that the State should possess all powers in respect of the police and should be responsible for their funding; secondly, that functioning police districts must be established on the basis of technical policing criteria, and, thirdly, that there must be no political interference in police operations.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Pack has just made clear, it is also important that progress be made with the constitutional reform if the State’s ability to function is to be strengthened and the current constitution brought into line with EU standards. The successful formation of a government has paved the way for new progress.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be seen as a positive first step if the package of amendments to the constitution agreed on by six political parties in March 2006 were soon to be adopted. It would lay the ground for the onset of a more ambitious process by the middle of 2007, which would help to make Bosnia and Herzegovina an even more effectively functioning state.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for this reason that the Council has decided to extend the mandate of the EU Special Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with the consequence that, from 1 March onwards, Dr Schwarz-Schilling will, on that basis, participate in the constitutional reform process as an advisor and mediator.</p>
<p class="contents">In June last year, the Dayton Peace Implementation Council decided, in principle, to close down the High Representative’s office by 30 June and abolish his position, but it reviewed this decision at the end of February, since developments since the summer of 2006 had fallen regrettably short of expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The resurgence of nationalistic rhetoric and the perceptible standstill in the reform process are doing nothing to make the beginning of a sustainable process any easier, while unpredictable regional factors following the delays in settling the status of Kosovo are also coming into play; indeed, it was these that prompted the Peace Implementation Council to postpone the deadline. The Peace Implementation Council, then, takes a view of the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina that coincides exactly with that expressed in your House’s recommendation for a proposal, more specifically that to be found in paragraph 32 of the proposal. The intention is that the position should again be reviewed in October 2007 and February 2008 in order to facilitate the transfer from the office of the High Representative to the EU’s special representative by 30 June 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has so far felt unable to endorse this line on the grounds that the deadline extends beyond November 2007 and has announced that it wants to draw its own conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might, by way of conclusion, return to the subject of the ruling of the International Court of Justice concerning Srebrenica. It was only to be expected, in view of the fact that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s claims against Serbia were not allowed to stand, that this should be greeted by differing responses, with some Serbs ignoring the court’s admonitions and expressing relief, while the Bosnian reaction tended more towards disappointment and frustration.</p>
<p class="contents">Our desire – and our hope – is that this ruling from the ICJ will eventually, despite the differing responses it evoked, result in the closing, in a fair manner, of this painful chapter, for that, too, is a vitally important precondition for the future development of a thriving Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The year 2006 was not a year of success for Bosnia and Herzegovina. As a result of an extended election campaign, the reform agenda stagnated and the political climate turned sour, reflecting a zero-sum mentality, as Mrs Pack said, leading to nationalist rhetoric and tensions. To be frank, we have had enough of it!</p>
<p class="contents">Let me update you on the state of talks on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement. Bosnia and Herzegovina has continued to make progress, albeit slowly. In December, we were able to finalise the technical talks on the SAA.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we will not conclude the SAA negotiations before tangible progress has been made on key conditions, especially police reform and cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal. This will be my main message when I visit Sarajevo tomorrow and Friday.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Bosnia and Herzegovina and its citizens need an efficient and effective police service. It is important that the state and entity authorities, together with the political parties, finally agree on the reform in line with the proposal from the Directorate for Police Restructuring as well as the three EU principles referred to by Mr Ehler.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Bosnia and Herzegovina also needs to show that it is serious in its commitment to cooperate with the ICTY. Recent actions by Republika Srpska to crack down on some of the fugitives’ support networks are encouraging in this regard. The authorities must now remain proactive and continue their efforts aiming at tangible results, arrests and transfers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the recent judgment of the International Court of Justice in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina versus Serbia is accepted and respected by all. The verdict underlines individual responsibility of the genocide and thus the absolute necessity of full cooperation with the ICTY, including the arrest and transfer of the fugitives.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been some attempts to politicise the ICJ verdict, which is regrettable because it hinders reconciliation and takes attention away from more important policy and political matters, such as solving the issue of police reform, which should be the first priority. This does not benefit the country or its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to see tangible progress on the reforms of public broadcasting and public administration before we can sign the SAA, as expressed by the President-in-Office of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">For the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina, constitutional reform is essential. It is necessary in order to make the country functional, efficient and affordable for its citizens. This process should be led by Bosnia and Herzegovina itself, based on consensus and supported by the entities and peoples. The adoption of the April package from last year would be an important step towards more ambitious objectives. The Commission is ready to support the work for constitutional development by both providing experts and funds.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to support and promote people-to-people contacts between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the EU. The visa facilitation negotiations have progressed well, and we should be able to conclude these negotiations very soon. Our aim is to have the visa facilitation and readmission agreements in force with all the countries of the western Balkans before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures include scholarships through the Erasmus Mundus programme, as well as increased support for research, education, culture and civil society dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">International presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina is, and should be, in transformation. As a transitional measure, the Commission can support the decision of the Peace Implementation Council to delay the closure of the office of the High Representative by a further 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">We have critical months ahead with Bosnia and Herzegovina, also taking into account the Kosovo status talks. For their part, the leaders of the country must rise above parochial party interests and show real statesmanship for the sake of their country and their people.</p>
<p class="contents">This year of 2007 is, and should be, seen as a year of opportunities for Bosnia and Herzegovina. As long as everyone does his or her part, we can succeed in bringing Bosnia and Herzegovina towards its European future. I am glad that I can count on the solid support of the European Parliament for this important objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that it is essential for Bosnia and Herzegovina to unlock its political potential after the elections and accept its share of responsibility for the progress which it needs to make on its road to the Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">However, accepting responsibility means opening the door to reform. This will only be possible if the country commits itself further to what unites it, and less to what divides it. Without constitutional reform, there can be no progress along this road.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the report because it takes a holistic approach to the problems at hand and because it is realistic, constructive and very conciliatory. The proposals for the education system seem particularly useful to me. They are, of course, intended to help the new generation to assume political responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome, in particular, the emphasis placed on the urgency of adopting and implementing police reform. It may also serve as a model for bridging differences between entities in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by reiterating the highlight in the concluding section of the report: progress will be impossible without unity within the international community and among its representatives. It seems very important to me that the mandate of the High Representative has been extended, as he must, of course, be given unanimous support for his supervision of Bosnia and Herzegovina. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an objective and well balanced report, which is aimed at further progress in the political and social reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at bringing the country closer to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The report takes account of the progress achieved in a number of areas, but also warns of the numerous problems that need to be resolved before the stabilisation and association agreements can be concluded. One of these problems, as previous speakers have mentioned, is constitutional reform. In this regard, I firmly believe that the EU should, mainly through its special representative, offer Bosnia and Herzegovina a helping hand through strengthening political dialogue between individual participants and providing technical assistance and expertise.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement on the implementation of police reforms is a further condition for concluding the stabilisation and association agreement, as previous speakers have said. I also feel it is important that the report takes account of and places emphasis on a wide range of issues in the area of education and schooling. Europe’s post-war experience has taught us that an education system founded on the values of human rights, citizenship, equality, tolerance and democracy will gradually help to overcome religious national and ethnic animosity and gradually lead to reconciliation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am convinced that in spite of the many tricky problems that Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to face, the future of the country lies in European integration. In conclusion, speaking as an MEP from a country that has not long been a Member of the EU, I should like to offer some advice to our friends in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Cooperation between all political forces, regardless of ethnic, political and religious affiliations, is a vital prerequisite to successfully achieving that goal. I should like to wish not only the Bosnians but also the Serbs and Croats every success on this difficult path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I arrived in a Sarajevo that was a model of coexistence between three cultures: Croatian, Serbian and Muslim. That town in which the bells of the Catholic cathedral rang in chorus with those of the Orthodox churches and with the cry of the muezzin, that extremely diverse town, without any ghettos, whose Serbian, Croatian and Muslim residents lived together in the same neighbourhoods and the same buildings, without even knowing who was Serbian, who was Croatian or who was Muslim.</p>
<p class="contents">On 4 April 1992, I witnessed, in that town, the desperate attempt by an entire population, men and women, young and old, Serbian, Croatian and Muslim, marching through the town, to bring down the barricades that the supporters of ethnic cleansing had begun to erect. I saw those barricades give way one by one before the crowd, at the end of the demonstration, you may recall, were taken to task by Karadzic’s mad militiamen. I appreciate that town, that province, that republic for having recognised their assets and, above all, for having shared their suffering born out of the disease of a fear of others, of a fear of being wiped out and of a fear of losing their identity, so many fears that irresponsible criminals sparked there.</p>
<p class="contents">With this memory in mind, I cannot overstate my satisfaction with the report by our fellow Member, Mrs Pack, whose commitment Parliament recognises and to whom it pays tribute for the dedication with which she has always worked to bring about a reconciliation in that country which, as she points out in her report, was once peaceful and multi-ethnic. In that country that we should encourage along the road to European integration by pushing it to adopt constitutional changes that are, as you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, vital, in spite of the persistence, within one section of its political class, of radical discourse that is still overly imbued with ultra-nationalism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not today, not tomorrow or the day after, but in a realistically defined future. Of course, before that Bosnia and Herzegovina needs to meet all the basic standards regarding human rights, combating corruption, judicial reform and administrative reform. Above all, however, it needs to conduct a genuine inter-religious dialogue and a dialogue between the nationalities making up the country, which has been the theatre of the greatest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War.</p>

My group welcomes the evidence of a process of change in Bosnia-Herzegovina, although it has to be said that, twelve years on from Dayton, it is high time for it, and also high time that the local politicians shouldered more responsibility and – irrespective of their ethnic origins – stood up for a shared Bosnia-Herzegovina, while desisting from trying to achieve by verbal attacks what they could not achieve by warfare.</p>
<p class="contents">With the prospect of a shared, democratic and peaceful future under the rule of law, every effort should be made in dealing with the shared past in a process that will no doubt be painful but will also be one of healing, and so we welcome the establishment of a national Truth and Reconciliation Commission as referred to in the report. One important step towards that was the acknowledgement by the parliament of Republika Srpska of the genocide of Bosnian Muslims. As has been said several times today, we expect cooperation with The Hague and not merely words, and I would also like to see civil society involved in this process of discussion; speaking as a German, I know perfectly well what I am talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what I expect of the international community is that it should be, and carry on being, a reliable partner carrying real weight, and it has to be said that constant changeovers of personnel in the High Representative’s office is not very likely to achieve that.

The only way they will be able to do that is by turning this country into a permanent protectorate with a powerful high representative of the European Union and a continuing military presence.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to see things move in a different direction, towards a peaceful and democratic solution that respects the fact that Bosnia is Yugoslavia in miniature and that the majority of the people feel Serb or Croat rather than Bosnian. The Turkish period proved beneficial to the Bosnians, the Austrian period to the Croats and the Yugoslavian period to the Serbs. People now want to move away from the old inequality and of one nation group calling the shots to the detriment of the others.</p>
<p class="contents">A federal solution along Belgian or Swiss lines is the best way of keeping the three peoples of this country together whilst acknowledging their differences and maintaining cordial relations between them. This is consistent with the principle that authority over the regional police lies with the entities and definitely not with the central state. Unfortunately, the proposed resolution does not solve the real problems and there is still no prospect of anything superior to the Dayton Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur is also right to underline that internal problems, such as ethnic segregation, constitute a threat to national stability.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst the report does not breathe a word about external threats, past incidents and the recent unrest in the Central Bosnian town of Kalesija, caused by a handful of radical Wahabites, should not be overlooked. Not for nothing did the highest police official of the Muslim-Croat federation, Zlatco Miletic, issue a warning on 10 March about the influence of this radical, relatively young, current among the Muslims in Bosnia Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from this, I would ask the Council and the Commission whether they have acquainted themselves with this tendency of sustained Islamicisation. I hope that you, both with regard to the internal and external problems, will make every effort to bring about national stability within Bosnia Herzegovina, because the European prospect for the western Balkan countries, as expressed in the agenda of Thessaloniki in 2003, is clear. How, though, can the association and stabilisation process succeed if not all problems, both internal and external, receive serious attention?

<p class="contents">I note with concern the over-hasty reduction in our military presence, something that sends out the wrong signal for the present time, and I am particularly concerned to see an incipient loss in interest in how Bosnia and Herzegovina develop.</p>
<p class="contents">That is happening at a time when a laborious process of reconstruction is only just beginning, and what is needed before all else is the reform of its constitution by the country itself, something that we can do no more than monitor and support, but there will be no long-term stability there unless the country is turned into a federation of three peoples with equal rights. There is no other road to that destination than the long and stony one that leads via patient dialogue, culture and education.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful to Mr Rouček for having, like Mrs Pack and Mr Schwarz-Schilling, highlighted the importance of multi-religious, multi-denominational school, which are the only way to achieve progress. Perhaps, one day, Sarajevo will be home to the great, multi-faith European university that will also herald the dawn of a European Islam; that might, indeed, emerge from the EU’s major meeting, in May, with the faith communities, and, if it did, it would have an impact not only in South-Eastern Europe, but also far beyond that region that has suffered so much.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a European University, European schools, we need in-depth cooperation between nationalities, and, most of all, we need money; that is why the functions of the High Representative and of the EU’s Special Representative must continue to be exercised as they are at present, in other words, not in a dictatorial manner, that is, Ashdown-fashion, but with sound judgment and attempting real even-handedness in a way that heals wounds, gets people and ethnic groups to grow together, and unleashes in the country itself the powers of renewal and self-healing without which Bosnia and Herzegovina have no future, and if Bosnia and Herzegovina topple into a crisis, their neighbours risk being dragged in as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner is right; it is 2007 now, a real date with destiny for this region. We have to accompany Kosovo on the road towards independence, guide a strengthened Croatia – under the watchful eye of the international community – towards accession to the EU, and stabilise Bosnia and Herzegovina while, at the same time, making Serbia democratic and stabilising it on that basis. That is the great challenge of our age.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us be frank: there are, in Bosnia and Herzegovina today, two strong men, in the persons of Mr Dodik and Mr Silajdžić, the former of whom – with arguments some of which were right – created difficulties over the reform of the police, while the latter made things tricky for the constitutional reformers, and some of his arguments were just as apposite. Both these strong men must now join together with everyone else in ensuring that the reform of the police and of the constitution get off the ground. I am sure that, over the next few days, the Commissioner will be spelling it out to them and to all the others, among them the new prime minister, that these are the tasks they have to perform if they want history’s judgment upon them to be favourable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, although I am addressing Mr Erler in particular when I say that we, in Bosnia and Herzegovina, must speak plainly when it comes to the appointment of the EU’s High Representative, those words are also, of course, intended for the Commissioner, since it is not clear to the people on the ground just who is speaking on behalf of the European Union. Any representative of the European Union needs to carry a clear message.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say something about visas. If we do not, through a more relaxed visa regime, enable the people in this region to become familiar with European values, European ways of doing things, and European ways of communicating with one another, we may be able to decide a lot of things, but we will not be able to put them into practice. That is why we should bring in easier visa arrangements without delay in order to bring the people of this region, their hearts and their minds, closer to Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The judgment passed by the International Court of Justice in the Hague last month has reopened old wounds and reawakened the spectre of war and other antagonisms within the Bosnian political arena. The Court is right. There can be no collective responsibility, only individual, concrete responsibility borne by politicians and commanders. For this reason, as EP rapporteur for Serbia, I call on the members of the Serbian Parliament to heed the call of their President, Boris Tadić, to confront the past and condemn the genocide in Srebrenica. By publicly condemning the genocide, Belgrade would make an important contribution to appeasing tensions in Bosnia and take a step forward into the future. It is unacceptable and shocking that the two culprits of the worst crime in Europe after the Second World War are still at large.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the authorities of Republika Srpska must adopt a much more constructive position on police reform, including approval of the police’s new areas of responsibility. As has been said many times in this House, the Stabilisation and Association Agreement cannot be signed without such participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to inform you all that Neil Parish, my fellow Member of the European People’s Party, and I have taken the initiative to form an inter-party MEP mission to Sarajevo and Srebrenica, which we are visiting next week. Our visit will be devoted to the problem of the refugees who are returning to this fragile region of our continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Iată că, la 4 luni de la alegeri, Bosnia-Herţegovina a reuşit să instaleze un nou guvern. Cabinetul condus de prim-ministrul Nikola Špirić şi-a propus să semneze, în prima jumătate a anului 2007, acordul de asociere şi stabilizare şi să finalizeze reforma constituţională. Astfel, Consiliul de miniştrii şi-a asumat o agendă care conţine reforme importante şi sperăm ca, în cel mai scurt timp, să înregistreze rezultate concrete.</p>
<p class="contents">Bosnia-Herţegovina trebuie să-şi asume treptat întreaga responsabilitate asupra politicii interne. Din nefericire, naţionalismul etnic încă se manifestă puternic şi, de aceea, prelungirea mandatului Biroului Înaltului Reprezentant cu încă un an reprezintă o opţiune corectă care oglindeşte realitatea.</p>
<p class="contents">Uniunea Europeană trebuie să acorde o atenţie specială modului în care autorităţile din Bosnia-Herţegovina implementează reformele asumate. Finalizarea reformei constituţionale, încetarea segregării educaţionale, crearea unui spaţiu economic comun, restructurarea poliţiei şi întreaga cooperare cu Tribunalul Internaţional sunt obiective care astăzi nu pot fi atinse fără o prezenţă europeană puternică.</p>
<p class="contents">Trebuie să subliniem una din provocările căreia trebuie să-i facă faţă Bosnia-Herţegovina în următoarea perioadă: decizia finală asupra statutului provinciei Kosovo va reprezenta un test pentru soliditatea construcţiei politice a acesteia. Situaţia din Bosnia-Herţegovina, ca şi aceea din Kosovo, nu pot fi privite separat, ci doar în contextul regional. De aceea, eforturile noastre trebuie continuate în direcţia consolidării stabilităţii regiunii.</p>
<p class="contents">În concluzie, Bosnia-Herţegovina se află pe drumul european, susţinerea noastră fiind absolut necesară pentru dezvoltarea economică şi socială si pentru stabilitatea politică a ţării. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What draws the country out of the vortex of conflict is the attraction of the European Union. It is precisely this force that can hasten reform and strengthen democracy and human rights, simultaneously improving citizens' lives. This should be clearly stated: the prospect of EU membership would halt the country's slide into fragmentation and nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sarajevo and Mostar I saw the important role being played in the country by EU peacekeeping forces. It is the citizens themselves, not the peacekeeping forces, who must create a nation-wide administration and police force, as well as good laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Only the young people will be able to build a strong, unified country. The schools and universities, where Bosnians, Serbs and Croats would be studying together, should become forges of reconciliation between ethnic communities. One has to be very careful when dealing with the recent bloody history of the country. Nonetheless, the truth must be told without distortion or emotion.</p>
<p class="contents">By increasing regional cooperation, Bosnia-Herzegovina can demonstrate the Europeanness of its foreign policy. It is essential to regulate conflict and to ratify border demarcation treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">I would encourage reaching as rapid a resolution as possible concerning the easing of visa regulations. Better opportunities to visit European Union countries would provide examples to be emulated and would stimulate inner unity. </p>
<p class="contents">Its negotiations concerning a Stabilisation and Association Agreement, and its learning from the experience of new EU countries, should help Bosnia-Herzegovina catch the European wind in its sails. That would be a confirmation of the magnetism of the European Union, which manages to stifle nationalism and hatred and to promote the coexistence and welfare of nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps now work can begin on the plinth for a monument to her. In a difficult situation such as this one, it is right that so many constructive elements should be built into the report, for there is a paradox – the EU takes every conceivable opportunity to affirm its commitment to the Thessaloniki declaration, while, in Bosnia, the train is going in precisely the opposite direction, towards more nationalism, if one is to judge by the utterances of the country’s leading politicians. This debate, too, is – or so I believe – a wake-up call, for, when even Commissioner Rehn, who is such a cautious and responsible fellow, says that ‘we have had enough of it’ then it really cannot be anything else.</p>
<p class="contents">That which is in the report is spot on: ‘yes’ to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and ‘yes’ to the unity of the international community. We should allow the High Representative to remain in office. The focus on easier access to visas and, in particular, on education and the young is exactly what is wanted. Young people must get to know Europe; that is what matters. The report really is a constructive contribution, and I hope that people in the country concerned will see it in that light, and also take note of this debate. That strikes me as important.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to deal with three key areas. First, regarding the High Representative: like some colleagues, I have also been to Bosnia-Herzegovina and to Republika Srpska and have seen the actions carried out by both the current High Representative and the previous High Representative, Lord Ashdown. In a lot of ways, they allowed politicians in Bosnia-Herzegovina off the hook by saying to them: unless you make these changes, we will make them for you. So if politicians were politically unable to make the changes, the High Representative merely came in and did it for them.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to emphasise that, if we truly want to work towards the establishment of a peaceful and stable Bosnia-Herzegovina that will have respect and tolerance for all the different peoples within that unified country, then we must ensure that they take responsibility for themselves, and for the laws and decisions that must come about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with any state, the separation of powers is essential, particularly regarding the police and judiciary. There can be only one police force in Bosnia-Herzegovina. That must be a key point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to visa facilitation: let us first bring over the young people – undergraduates and graduates from schools and universities in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Allow them to come first and then open up the wider visa process, because young people are the future for the development of a peaceful Bosnia-Herzegovina and a peaceful Balkan area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not about to blow up, but the apparent calm should not deceive anyone. Stalemate on police reform, the slowing down of reforms, a floundering decision-making process and daily verbal aggression between Bosnian Serbs and Bosniaks are all cautionary signs. It is important that the mandate of the international community’s high representative has been extended until 2008. Ending it would have been very premature. I agree with the basic principle that the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina are the ones who must decide on their own destiny. In certain circumstances, the international community has to intervene. I hope cutting back the ALTEA mission was not premature, as it still has an important role to play in this tense situation. Achieving normalisation in Kosovo, which is under way this year, is another test, another challenge. The EU has to keep Bosnia and Herzegovina under very close watch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Берлинският договор определи 30-годишен протекторат над Босна и Херцеговина като част от Австро-Унгария. След като този срок изтече, Австро-Унгария анексира Босна и Херцеговина. Според Парижкия мир, сложил край на Първата световна война, тези територии бяха прехвърлени в рамките на Югославия.</p>
<p class="contents">С тази кратка ретроспекция исках да ви кажа, че всички проблеми на Балканите се дължат на слепотата на Великите сили, които защитават собствените си интереси. Ние не можем да налагаме на суверенната босненска нация как да си изменя конституцията. Не можем пряко волята на народа да им налагаме чужд генерал-губернатор, който да насочва пътя на тази държава. Освен това, искам да ви напомня, че този доклад е за Босна и Херцеговина и насилието, което беше там преди десет години, беше и от двете страни. Не са само сърбите виновни. Имаше насилие и атентати от страна на босненците. Ние трябва да бъдем обективни и да виждаме всички страни на един конфликт, ако наистина искаме да направим разликата. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank you for your support for the Commission’s policy on the western Balkans, which is based on long-term commitment to supporting the European transformation process in the countries in the region. I am pleased that this policy obtained the clear support of the European Council in December. The European Council decided to keep the European Union’s doors open to the countries of Southeast Europe and they can come in as long as each one of them first fulfils all the obligations of membership.</p>
<p class="contents">On my Sarajevo visit tomorrow and on Friday I will make special mention of the matters which you have raised in this debate and which the European Parliament itself sets great store by. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s unity is vital for the country to succeed on its path to the EU, as was emphasised in your discussion. We need cooperation across the political spectrum. That is one watertight conclusion which we can draw in general about the success of small countries in the European Union and it must surely also hold true for Bosnia and Herzegovina.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important thing now is that Bosnia and Herzegovina’s political leaders understand the responsibility they have and implement these vital reforms, so that the country can make progress along the road to the European Union and provide its citizens with better living conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
