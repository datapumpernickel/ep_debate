<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cederschiöld (PPE-DE)</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States. In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry. It is about artists’ entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products. It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed. Forgeries are big business. It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy. The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry. </p>
<p class="contents">This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation. </p>
<p class="contents">There exists a special clause which requires Parliament’s assent in two cases. With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled. A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences. The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure. Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence. The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission’s powers regarding these issues. Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter. </p>
<p class="contents">The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works. It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works. It also creates protection for software and databases. There are problems regarding the term “author”. For example, it has not been defined. Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage. This too has not been solved. It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition. If no definitions are provided in questions such as this, it can lead to their being dealt with differently around the world, with no uniformity of approach. That would not be a good thing. The question of arbitration procedures is still to be resolved, too. </p>
<p class="contents">Parliament cannot change these details. We can only say yes or no to the agreement as it stands. Yes or no to an agreement which contains deficiencies. Both myself, as rapporteur, and the committee think we ought to say yes. We have here an agreement which, in spite of its defects, constitutes a significant step forward for the issue of copyright. We have of course discussed at length whether Parliament and whether the EU should have powers in regard to patents under intellectual property law. I think they should have. However, there is still no Community legislation in the areas of patent law and protection of designs, and there needs to be. A European patent is in the offing, and that is a good thing. </p>
<p class="contents">Now, the Union and the Member States are combining to take the first steps in the area of intellectual property law. It is good for us that we have the power to do this, in spite of the fact that we are not completely satisfied. In that way, we can act as a model for the applicant States. We have a direct financial interest in these issues being settled before enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the Commission for its efforts in this area and for the cooperation with the Commission’s officials, which has been quite excellent. Finally, I also want to thank this Chamber for being so good as to listen to these words at this late hour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Koukiadis (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, on her very serious work. She has clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the World Intellectual Property Organisation’s treaties. Their approval is undoubtedly an historic occasion because for the first time the European Union is participating as a contracting party in an international treaty that governs the field of intellectual property. It is a fact that the road has been a long one, mainly because of the legal problem that arose in connection with the extent to which the Community could be considered to have absolute competence in matters of intellectual property. The problem has been overcome. Today we are asked to give our assent in effect to two treaties: the treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations, performances and phonograms. As regards the first of these, it seems to provide an effective solution for the long-standing demands by the creators of artistic and literary works, while at the same time creating a framework of protection in relation to issues such as distribution, rental and the presentation of their works to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the second treaty on performances and phonograms, it must be stressed that for the first time an international treaty signed by the Community as well recognises exclusive rights for performers, interpreters and artists for reproduction, distribution and rental to the public, and the right to fair remuneration for radio broadcasts. In that context a noteworthy and important step forward is the treaty’s treatment of the right of reproduction. Even though, as the Commission says, the texts of the treaties do not contain special provisions to regulate all the respective issues raised by technological development, it can nevertheless be said that within the legislative framework created, performing or interpreting artists enjoy broader protection than that accorded by the Treaty of Rome or even by the Community directives. Interpreting Article 7 of the Treaty, we can conclude that the application of protection for reproduction does not only mean protection for the reproduction of the interpretations or performances themselves as such that are embodied in recordings, but also protection against copying, whether in whole or in part and whether permanent or temporary, and protection against any other form of production.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be appropriate, however, for us also to mention some points which should be at the focus of future WIPO work or the work of other diplomatic conferences. First, there is the right of distribution as referred to in Article 8(1). The option accorded to States by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the exhaustion of the above right is dangerous and is one of the Treaty’s most negative points, since there is nothing to prevent States from enacting special conditions for the exhaustion of the right, a thing that would be to the disadvantage of artists.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards rental rights, on interpretation of Article 9, we can conclude that the exclusive right of rental belongs to artists, interpreters or performers, only if this is laid down by national legislation. I think this conflicts with Article 13.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I want to say that ratification of these treaties opens a horizon for property rights. In the 21st century, the century of knowledge and the invisible economy, intellectual property will be the dominant form of property and will, in many cases, be more important than traditional property. We are at the dawn of an age in which new legislation will be created, where the right to utilise intellectual property will clash head on with the public interest in terms of its dissemination and exploitation by the public at large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe she has touched on a few important points, which I intend to raise again myself very shortly. First and foremost, we are discussing Parliament’s assent to the aforementioned WIPO treaties. Nothing is in force yet and so this time Parliament’s decision will carry some weight. In signing up, the EU is acting in accordance with its intention to arrogate all internal and international powers, but it is unclear as to where the powers withdrawn from national control, are to end up. Therefore assent will only be the order of the day here if the EP is involved in the development of WIPO law every step of the way, from start to finish, and has the right of codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam. What does the Commission have to say to that? Crucial aspects have remained unclear in the draft treaties, and the rapporteur says the same. To quote one example: the concept “author” is not defined in any way in the Treaty, which would make the situation ripe for litigation amongst parties to the Treaty. I would like to ask the Commission at this point if it intends to go into this with its eyes shut? Does it intend to impose its own definitions of copyright on other parties to the Treaty?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the WIPO approach is based on the concept of individual rights. This will lead to problems for indigenous people such as the Sami, for they have a different notion of rights: that of collective rights.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are also public interests at stake. For example, it is unclear as to whether public libraries will even be allowed to loan books, videos and cassettes at no charge in the future. This would directly affect the individual’s right to equality of opportunity with regard to access to education. Why does the Commission say nothing about this? Does it in fact want to privatise education? Economic interests are there in the large print of the treaties; public interests, on the other hand, are there in very small print indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been conjuring up images of the penniless poet, but what we are talking about here is the total marketing of the soundtrack of Titanic. Furthermore, the relationship between WIPO and TRIPS has not been clarified, particularly as parts of the two treaties overlap. One could now say: “fine, TRIPS, the difference is trade-related intellectual property, but WIPO is mainly about relevance to trade. Therefore, how do we distinguish between these two treaties and ought there to be cooperation? If so, what form should this take? Should we set a precedent with WIPO so as to give the EU complete control over TRIPS too? </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, there is still a huge amount of room for improvement and clarification as far as the draft is concerned. I expect the Commission to provide some information on the questions that have been raised so that I can at least give an explanation of vote for my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This ratification is also necessary in the light of the enlargement of Europe. However, an objective is emerging behind this issue of Community accession, one I find as yet too theoretical but one that some Member States, nonetheless, find too offensive. This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy. In this connection, I expect our three institutions, Parliament, the Commission and the Council, to be in agreement. Cultural policy means, in particular, defending the role of the arts, recognising the role of authors and setting high cultural standards. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, at a time when Europe faces the task of defining a new policy on copyright and neighbouring rights, there is an urgent need – as has just been pointed out several times – to define and redefine what exactly an author is. Our definitions are still too vague and new technologies now make it essential for us to clarify them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreements crystallise the decades-old legacy of copyright, and they represent a precisely considered and balanced solution for the regulation of copyright and neighbouring rights. The entry into force of the treaties and their final form is, however, in addition to this recommendation, dependent on implementation by the parties themselves. In the United States the WIPO Treaty has already entered into force, having been enacted into law by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and there they have managed to retain the delicate balance of the Treaty by means of this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU too must proceed in its legislative work in accordance with what is agreed in the WIPO. It is worrying that the position adopted by the previous Parliament does not support this balanced WIPO system. The opinion on the copyright directive at first reading was very distorted, and, furthermore, the balance is moving in a harmful direction from the point of view of Europeans. The recommendations that have been made will not improve the status of culture in Europe, on the contrary. Parliament’s amendments would mainly improve opportunities for the media enterprises that are well established in the market to move their old, in excess of 80% market share to a new environment with rigid, excessive copyright regulations. I am not now speaking of Charlotte Cederschiöld’s recommendation, which is an excellent paper, but of the matters of copyright that the previous Parliament discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">On one point of detail, I would like to thank Mrs Cederschiöld for having clarified, for example, the concept of so-called temporary copies in her opinion. There is no consciously adopted position in the WIPO Treaty on temporary copies. If these, which technically speaking are copies, were covered by the protection in force it would make the transfer of information – as the recommendation quite rightly states – expensive and complicated for no good reason. It would be as if the deliveryman had to pay a copyright fee whenever he carried a book to be read by the purchaser. The real benefit of culture is that art and knowledge can be transferred safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer. The new operational environment is, above all, a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before. It is essential that the interests of all parties are taken into account. Parliament has tried to take account of this in its own recommendation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The evolution of the economy, the appearance of new forms of contract and technological innovations are phenomena which mean frequent and rapid changes which must be taken into account when </p>
<p class="contents">drawing up regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this field, the process of producing regulations is slow, too slow, given the speed of the actual changes which that legislation is intended to regulate. If this is the case, it is all the more obvious when the process involves multinational or supranational organisations, such as the WIPO, which has debated the treaties which we are proposing to rectify.</p>
<p class="contents">In considering whether we are in favour of the ratification of these treaties, we may wonder whether they meet the most current needs in that field. It would be difficult to reply in the affirmative.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that these treaties update the regulations in this field, but neither is there any doubt that there are currently many problems which they do not resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent inclusion of the Encyclopaedia Britannica on the Internet and the appearance of virtual libraries have demonstrated that there are still many problems to be resolved. For example, the solution adopted by one of the most significant virtual libraries – which, by the way, belongs to my own university, the University of Alicante – which consists of not including works still protected by copyright, implies a considerable limitation to the development of this type of virtual library.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, ratifying these treaties now is going to be of little relevance. On the one hand, the problems which it aims to resolve have already been resolved to a large extent by means of the directive on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society. On the other hand, the majority of the Member States have already adapted their legislation to the treaties which are now being ratified.</p>
<p class="contents">I must finally point out that the legislative amendments introduced in a number of countries, such as Spain, have resolved some conflicts but have led to others which are commonly found when it comes to putting a price on rights and material. In such a sensitive field, we must find solutions which balance the different interests involved. Only in this way will the regulations be accepted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is under the impression that she has worked fast and effectively. This is important. It befits the Commission to express its gratitude towards the rapporteur. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to present the Commission’s conclusion to you without any further ado: it agrees with the conclusions of the draft recommendation and, therefore, with ratification by this Parliament. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress the importance of both Treaties. Both the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty constitute progress in the international protection of copyright and neighbouring rights and are, as such, a considerable improvement on the Berne Convention and the Treaty of Rome. </p>
<p class="contents">Both Treaties contribute towards a high level of protection for works and other matters, but offer the public access to the contents of these via electronic networks. The two Treaties explicitly permit the Community to become a party to the Treaties and to play an important role in managing them. Consequently, approval of the Treaties by the Community is of major importance, because it illustrates that the Community sets great store by intellectual property rights. In addition, assent leads to more widespread international recognition of the European Union’s role in terms of copyright. </p>
<p class="contents">At international level, there is a great deal of support for treaties entering into force more swiftly. These have now been ratified by twelve or thirteen WIPO Member States, including the United States. The entry into force of treaties largely depends on the European Union, because thirty ratification acts are required in order for treaties to enter into effect, and these acts that are signed by the European Union and the Member States, including associated countries, are of vital importance in order to reach this number. </p>
<p class="contents">The developing countries, too, expect the European Union to bring about ratification swiftly because this would give a strong signal worldwide. In this context, Parliament has already played a key role in the discussions on the draft directive on copyright in the Information Society, which led to the approval of the Barzanti report in February 1999. This directive is the necessary counterpart of the proposed decision and largely embraces the key principles of the WIPO Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must now follow once again the exceptional assent procedure of Article 300(3). It is vitally important to give the correct signal to the outside world, in the form of this recommendation. In a nutshell, I would like to reiterate the Commission’s conclusion here: it supports the draft recommendation and hopes that it will be of key importance to anyone with an interest in intellectual property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
