This is true not only as regards what we were talking about this afternoon; it also applies to ingredients. What it says on the outside must be on the inside, no more and no less. Changes in society over the past twenty years have also left their mark on our eating habits. Who, nowadays, peels their carrots and potatoes themselves? Many do not have the time to do it, while all too many have forgotten how to cook or never learned in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">This also resulted in profound changes to the food industry, with complicated processing methods and new ingredients giving rise to finished and half-finished products capable of being prepared quickly and simply, but with ignorance about them breeding uncertainty. Numerous recent health warnings have made the need for information even more urgent, to which one must add the substantial increase in the number of food allergies. People suffering from food allergies rely on the proper listing of what a product contains.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached second reading stage, and the greater part of the Commission proposal is made up of the Common Position, which limits the number of derogations and takes on board most of the amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading stage, notably the regular revision of the list of allergenic substances and of the way in which it is to be interpreted, the inclusion of celery and mustard in the list and the mandatory indication on the labels of preparations of sauces or mustards of ingredients amounting to less than 5% of the end-product.</p>
<p class="contents">I still see the table of allergenic ingredients as the most important element in this directive. The list is to be drawn up on the basis of the latest scientific findings, revised on a regular basis and updated where necessary. At second reading stage, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy adopted three amendments, all of which have the same objective in mind, that of removing the requirement to include on the label processing aids manufactured from substances on the list of allergenic substances, but no longer present in the end product and thus not liable to trigger an allergic reaction. Checks must be carried out to establish if a product is still allergenic if, in the course of its production, a processing aid was used that was allergenic in its original form – protein is one example – but which has lost its allergenic character as a result of the food production process, or which is either no longer present, or present in a modified form. Those who legislate are to establish that this is the case before requiring labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">Processing aids have been in use for decades, including in the production of wine and beer. They undergo change in the course of the fermentation process and are naturally precipitated or filtered out. It is therefore a matter of certainty that they are no longer present in the wine or beer that is eventually produced. Allergies have hitherto been unheard-of in this area. As a wine-grower myself, how am I to explain to my fellow wine-growers or to my customers that labels must in future bear the legend ‘made with eggs’? Wine is a pure and clear product of nature, clear and golden in the glass. No research has been done into allergic reactions to it, as nobody has ever heard of there being any – so why this new requirement for labels?</p>
<p class="contents">Politics, however, is about doing what is possible, and so I have, with the Commission and the Council, arrived at a compromise making it possible for evidence to be brought within a fixed period of four years. The first point to be made here is that substances in connection with which a study has been notified to the Commission are provisionally exempted from being indicated on labels. The second is that, if the study demonstrates that these substances have no allergenic effect, they will continue to be exempted from the labelling requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask the Commission – and you, Mr Byrne – to confirm to me that further new studies can be commissioned and notified up to nine months after the directive’s entry into force, and that exemption from mandatory labelling will apply for a full four years. This is important if we are to have studies of all types.</p>
<p class="contents">This new directive gives consumers certainty. Only 2% of ingredients are not required to be included on the label, as against the former 25%. For the first time, there is a list of allergenic substances that must always appear on the label, and we will produce scientific evidence in order to ensure that labels state only what is contained. We are thus avoiding the possibility of excessive labelling making the list of foods allowed to allergy-sufferers ever smaller. I think we should take this sensible approach of compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am doing so because there are products such as casein, egg albumin or fish glue which have been used for centuries in the production of wine and beer and which figure amongst the oenological practices laid down and permitted by Regulations (EC) Nos 1493/1999 and 1622/2000 and, above all, because there is no scientific evidence that they act as allergens in the final product. Why do we have to place them under suspicion by subjecting them to labelling? The Council and the Commission must accept Parliament's view of this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I will move on to my own report. I would firstly like to sincerely thank the Commission, the Council and the shadow rapporteurs, Mr Lund and Mrs Paulsen, for their excellent cooperation in reaching compromises which may allow us to approve this proposal for a directive at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">My main concern during the production of this report has been that the food additives included in it should not only represent technological progress but they should not pose any risk to health nor cause misunderstanding amongst consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise amendments we are presenting to plenary, together with the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group (Amendments Nos 19 to 32) are the result of this concern that we all share.</p>
<p class="contents">Framework Directive 89/107/EEC on additives, in its Annex II, specifies that ‘all food additives must be kept under continuous observation and must be re-evaluated whenever necessary’. However, in view of the existing concern about the use of polysorbates, of the ruling of the Court of Justice of 20 March 2003, on the maximum doses of nitrites and nitrates, and the declaration of the Scientific Committee on Food of 4 April 2003, on derivatives of parahydroxybenzoic acid, two new paragraphs for Article 2 are being presented by means of Amendment No 21. The intention is that the Commission should review the use of additives E 432 to E 436 (that is, polysorbates), E 251, E 252, and E 249 to E 250 (which are nitrates and nitrites) and that, before 1 July 2004, the conditions of use for parabens, from E 214 to E 219, should be revised.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to biphenyl, orthophenyl phenol and sodium orthophenyl phenol, which will now be classed as plant protection products, the Commission’s intention is to include them in the future in the legislation of pesticides, removing them from Directive 95/2/EC. We agree with this and our only desire is that a legal vacuum should not be created, as indicated in Amendment No 21 and Amendment No 4 of the report which was approved in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned that additives may be introduced into foods by means of additives in flavourings which are not required to be labelled. We are therefore presenting Amendment No 22 to restrict its use to the minimum necessary in order to guarantee the quality and safety of the flavouring when it has no technological function in the food. Otherwise, these flavouring additives will have to be labelled.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress that it is very important that we make consumers aware that thanks to the legislation on additives and the work of the Scientific Committee on Food they can enjoy adequate food safety and food products which are suited to their needs. These days our cities are increasingly large and industry needs more and more new additives and this makes our lives easier when it comes to consuming cooked or prepared products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like once again to thank the Council, the Commission and the shadow rapporteurs who have contributed to reaching these important agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I wish to express my gratitude; secondly, I wish to explain why I do not like the compromise; and thirdly, I wish to explain why, in spite of everything, I support the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to address a very big thank-you to everyone who has contributed: to the Commission, the Council, the committee secretariat and all my colleagues and fellow MEPs in the committee – the shadow rapporteurs – who have been of very great help to us in reaching this solution.</p>
<p class="contents">It really is, of course, the case that we do not want these hormones, especially oestradiol 17β which is used, for example in the United States, as a growth stimulant. We do not want them in our food and nor, for that reason, must we of course use them in such a manner that they may end up in our food. In that way, we should be more credible in our negotiations, for example within the WTO, with the United States. If they are used as growth stimulants, then they are clearly present in our food. They involve a health risk for human beings and are carcinogenic. If we use them therapeutically in the rearing of agricultural animals, there is also a risk of their being present. That is what we do in the EU, and it undermines our credibility and our opposition to these hormones. That is why, in principle, they should really be comprehensively banned in these contexts. If we had banned them completely, as proposed by our committee, it would have been almost possible to exclude them from the market. There would then have been no danger of their being used in the wrong way.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee was in agreement – as was Parliament, mainly, at first reading – about proceeding in this way. This is, however, an issue that needs to be solved. Even if I had full support for my desire for a total ban, I personally realised that it might be sensible to try to reach a compromise. I therefore contacted my fellow MEPs in the other political groups and said that we should perhaps try, for the fact of the matter was that the Council said that it wanted to retain the substances for three reasons: firstly, to induce rutting in cattle, which is the most important area of usage; secondly, for foetus maceration and mummification, also mainly in the case of cattle; and, thirdly, for pyometra in cattle. Of these areas of use, the first is the main one and the other two of relatively little importance. The latter two are, moreover, relatively important from the point of view of animal protection. Animals suffer if they cannot be given this medicine in the present situation. Even though there are alternatives, they were not believed to be accessible throughout the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposal, which became <span class="italic">our</span> proposal following contact with the other political groups, was that we should propose to the Council that the substances be kept for the purposes of the two less important areas relating to dead foetuses and pyometra. The Council accepted this, and we shall now be able to do away with use of the substances for inducing rutting, something I consider to be major progress. There will certainly be a transitional period, but then they will have been dispensed with. In the final proposal, we now say, moreover, that the second use too should be reviewed, and perhaps that too could be removed after a certain period.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this as major progress, and we can thus perhaps solve the problem. I am extremely pleased that we in the committee have been able to unite in supporting the proposal, and I hope that this will also be the case in the vote in the Chamber tomorrow. We shall therefore be able to phase out the main use and thus strengthen our hand in the dispute with the United States. I therefore want to reinforce this compromise, which is certainly weaker than what Parliament previously put forward but is still sufficiently sound for us now to be able to find a solution to the problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I welcome this joint debate, which covers three important legislative dossiers on which we are close to agreement following constructive interinstitutional dialogue. I will address each dossier in turn.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the three rapporteurs, Mrs Klaß, Mrs Ayuso González and Mr Olsson, and the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for their hard work on these legislative dossiers.</p>
<p class="contents">I will start with Mrs Klaß's recommendation for second reading. The adoption of this proposal on foodstuffs labelling legislation, to which we are very close, will be of great benefit to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position represents a balanced compromise, including the majority of the measures proposed by the Commission, whilst restricting the scope of exemptions. It also reflects the European Parliament’s wish to increase the accuracy of the information on foodstuffs labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position includes – either word for word or in substance – Parliament's four amendments as set out by the Commission in its amended proposal. It also takes into account most of the other Parliament amendments on three important points.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the flexibility in the ingredient listing and the exemptions from the obligation to indicate the components of certain compound ingredients will apply from 2%, rather than the 5% initially proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the review and update of the list of allergenic ingredients to reflect scientific advances. Moreover, when the list is updated, ingredients may be removed if there is scientific evidence to show that they are no longer allergenic.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the addition of celery and mustard and their derived products to the list of allergenic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one question is not completely settled. There is no available scientific basis that demonstrates either that the derivatives of certain allergens are still allergenic, or that they are no longer likely to cause adverse reactions. Thus the question arises: should we require mandatory labelling of those derivatives?</p>
<p class="contents">The common position includes mandatory labelling, but states also that these substances could be exempted in the future, should scientific evidence provide justification for such action. I share the view of the rapporteur and the committee that this might not be the best solution, but I do not agree with that suggested by Amendment Nos 1 and 2. Indeed, Amendment No 1 states that, for alcoholic drinks, derivatives should be labelled only if they are present in an amount which scientific research has shown may cause allergic reactions. This is not acceptable because science only provides evidence that allergens and their derivatives cause allergic reactions. No scientific data are available on what residual amount of a given allergen may trigger an allergic reaction. Furthermore, the amendment would be impossible to implement and the burden of proof is reversed. It is for the manufacturers to provide evidence that the specific allergen derivative they use is not likely to cause an adverse reaction in order to be exempted from indicating it on the label.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2, in its first part, is identical to Amendment No 1, but concerns foodstuffs other than alcoholic beverages. It also expressly exempts the processing aids used in alcoholic beverages from labelling, while these are not covered in this paragraph of the common position. It is, therefore, not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 requests the Commission to adopt, before 1 January 2004, following an opinion from the European Food Safety Authority, a list of derivatives that should be considered as non-allergenic.</p>
<p class="contents">This goes in the right direction but, in addition to the unrealistic deadline, it is not acceptable as such because only studies conducted under the responsibility of the industry, on specific allergens’ derivatives used in specific circumstances, could be considered and submitted for an opinion from the EFSA – for example, fish gelatine used as clarifying agent in beer.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why only Amendment No 4, which constitutes a workable and reasonable compromise, can be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to Mrs Ayuso González's first reading report. In December 2002 the Commission adopted a proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive amending Directive 95/2/EC on food additives other than colours and sweeteners. The main objective of this proposal is to adapt Directive 95/2/EC in the light of recent technical and scientific developments and to ensure the functioning of the internal market, a high level of protection of human health and the protection of consumers’ interests.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the Commission proposes to authorise a new food additive, to withdraw the authorisations for the use of some food additives, to revise current authorisations and to harmonise the use of food additives in flavourings at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, on the 'use of food additives in flavourings', the proposal is in the interests of consumers and industry as it would achieve harmonisation of this sector at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">A package of compromise amendments has been tabled, following close contact between the various institutions. COREPER has marked its agreement to this compromise package, to which I gladly add the Commission’s support.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to the last of the legislative dossiers, Mr Olsson’s second reading recommendation on hormones. I very much welcome the progress made. The debate on hormones has proved to be as delicate as the hormonal balance controlling the physiological functions in living creatures.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission initially proposed to prohibit the use of oestradiol in the light of advice that this endogenously produced substance is a carcinogen. Parliament supported this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, intricate discussions in the Council – which took more than two years, spanned four presidencies and included two extra background reports – have demonstrated that prohibiting oestradiol is not as straightforward as was first imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States have drawn attention to the significant difficulties likely to arise from a prohibition, in particular the distress that this may cause with respect to animal welfare and the reorganisation of stockbreeding.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore had to reconsider, by asking ourselves: what are our objectives? They are, firstly, to protect consumer health and, secondly, to achieve compliance with WTO requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission’s analysis both objectives can be achieved with the compromise proposed today by the rapporteur, Mr Olssen, and his colleagues, to whom I offer my sincere thanks.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this text with Amendment Nos 17, 18 and 19 would result in a significant reduction in the use of oestradiol. Moreover, it clearly distinguishes the three remaining uses from the use of oestradiol for growth promotion. It will, therefore, allow the Community to implement its international obligations in the context of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I look forward to the debate on these interesting and important issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Things being as they are, and politics being the art of the possible, I would, however, like to make it plain to you that this House cannot be expected to co-decide on a European directive that demands that winemakers and brewers should indicate on the bottle label that these beverages were produced using fish and eggs. That, though, would have happened had we approved the Common Position without the amendments tabled by our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß.</p>
<p class="contents">To her I would like to extend the warmest thanks for her tireless efforts at bringing to the light of day a well thought-out directive, one that will of course ensure that, where potentially-allergenic ingredients – and I say ingredients rather than processing aids – are present, that presence is required to be indicated on a label. Wine and beer, however, do not contain such allergy-triggering ingredients. There is no doubt that their manufacture and processing involves the use of traces of processing aids described in Annex IIIa as having allergenic potential, these being isinglass and egg derivatives as clarifiers and fining agents. They help in technical processes such as filtering. The crucial difference from conventional additives is that processing aids are removed after use, and things that are not present in wine or beer do not have to be declared on the list of ingredients. That is the solution that this House adopted at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the ministers responsible would, if they had known what is at stake, have followed this House’s wise and far-sighted lead and would have put a proper Common Position before us.</p>
<p class="contents">We know for certain that the presence in the end product of traces of the aids used cannot be scientifically demonstrated, even though, in such small quantities, they are unlikely to trigger allergies. Until such time as that is sorted out, there must be no labelling of such a nature as to mislead consumers, arouse unwarranted fears and do indefensible harm to major sectors of industry. That is why our approval of our rapporteur’s compromise motion represents the outermost limit of what we can tolerate, and beyond that we cannot go.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as you did not give Mrs Klaß an answer, I will ask you once more: is it indeed the case that studies may be submitted nine months after the directive enters into force? This is something that must be clarified now, or else the rapporteur will have to speak for another few minutes.</p>

Furthermore, food safety will be a burning political issue from now on, becoming an integral element in the overall safety of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, it is considered essential to provide extensive information on the ingredients of foodstuffs. Precise and relevant labelling, then, is indispensable, especially for ingredients which may cause allergies.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is relatively simple for those allergens actually present in the final product. Is it reasonable, on the other hand, to demand the inclusion on labels of ingredients such as technological aids, used especially in the production of alcoholic drinks, which constitute part of the production process but are not present in the finished product? Since the best is always the enemy of the good, are we not in danger, in our commendable desire to protect allergy sufferers, of weakening traditional production methods through such measures, even causing markets to go bust, with no scientific proof of the harmful character of these aids? One can well imagine the horror of consumers when they discover that sulphites and other unappetising ingredients are used in the production of wines as prestigious as champagne, or those of this beautiful region, Alsace, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore glad that a balanced compromise has been found on this controversial question. The compromise states that it will be possible to withdraw certain ingredients from the list of allergens on the evidence of a scientifically-researched dossier, pending a full scientific study.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming from a wine-producing region, of course, I would have preferred it if the burden of proof – in other words, the production of the technical dossier – did not fall on the shoulders of producers who are sometimes small operators. I am aware, however, that if we did not accept this compromise, we would have to ratify the Council’s common position, which makes no provision for a procedure for exempting ingredients from the list of allergens. For these reasons, although my feelings are mixed, I believe that it is advisable to adopt this compromise. At the same time, I express the hope that the Commission will allow small - and medium-sized producers the flexibility they need in order to make their arguments heard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has fought her corner and defended her case against some of her collaborators, notably the Commission, which was not predisposed to listen to the demands of the elected Members of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Klaß’s report, as adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, was the best solution in my view, speaking as an eagle-eyed native of Champagne. Certain higher and sometimes contradictory interests, however, could not be ignored, and we thus decided on a fallback solution. In a sense, I had already proposed that solution anyway, in the amendments I tabled in committee, but I had then rallied round, without enthusiasm, to the solution advocated by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, part of me is happy that a partial solution has been taken up and reworked to satisfy the majority of us. Ensuring clear and relevant information as well as a certain level of protection for consumers suffering from allergies makes good sense to me. On the other hand, alarmist labelling would terrify consumers who suffer from allergies and reduce their own consumption. Iconic European drinks such as champagne or Irish beer would suffer terribly from this, Commissioner, dragging the whole European wine industry down with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow, before representatives of the wine industry of my region, Champagne-Ardennes, I am going to have to defend the established principle that it is the responsibility of producers great and small to prove that derivatives of supposedly allergenic products used by them as technological aids in wine are not themselves allergens, because they are the result of an important process of transformation of raw materials and operate in a totally different context, that of wine or beer. All of this alters their characteristics fundamentally. Brewers will thus have to prove that isinglass, used for centuries in beer-making, is not a proscribed product. In short, the burden of proof falls on their shoulders, but we have bought some time to do the relevant research.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by thanking the rapporteur and supporting the solution proposed in Amendment No 4. The Union for Europe of the Nations Group has moreover co-signed the compromise amendment and assumes the consequences of that choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank my colleagues for their excellent work.</p>
<p class="contents">In the single market consumers encounter new and strange products and manufacturers on the shelves of their own familiar local shop every day, and they must be able to have complete confidence in quality control and food safety in that single market. It is regrettable that whenever the EU is proactive in setting such important standards, this is so often felt to be needless concern over details. One cause of that, of course, is the way the European press often deliberately sets out to portray things in a negative light, and disregarding the real problem at issue. The reasons for this are not political; they are to do with journalism. Stories need colour, and, unfortunately, that colour is often acquired by spreading scare stories instead of factual information.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest example of this is the news story about limiting the maximum amounts for PAH compounds in foods to protect consumers’ health. A totally legitimate research project carried out by the Commission has, at least in the Finnish newspapers, already developed into a scare about whether the EU is now going to ban private barbecues and our favourite summer treat, the grilled sausage. There has been continual whining about the EU meddling in everything and being overly protective, and they have been asking when the Europolice are going to start lighting bonfires piled with dangerous cookery books and whether soon we will have to eat wearing a helmet on our head, just to be on the safe side.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the nation swallows whole the scare stories spread in this way without any justification, giving rise to negative feelings and resentment. For that reason it would be important if the good work done in Parliament to protect people’s health also had more vigorous support from the EU Information Centres. It is obviously necessary to provide background information early on at the preparatory stage so that the unsubstantiated urban legends about the EU do not get a chance to take root. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I suppose our package permits the further use of additives, but it has been quite crucial for me that we are now also putting the emphasis on the Commission’s supervision and re-evaluation of the use of previously approved substances. I hope that we do not continue with the policy of just going on accepting new additives and an extended use of already approved substances so that such additives and substances are only omitted from the list when the industry itself informs us that they are no longer used. I think that the policy so far has been unduly defensive. In my opinion, the Commission should constantly inspect and re-evaluate the use of additives so that the three well-known conditions for using them are fully complied with at all times. I am therefore very pleased about the provisions in the package whereby the Commission must, within two years, present an overall report on the re-evaluation of additives and whereby this report must promptly focus especially upon the use of certain types, including nitrates, nitrites and polysorbates. I hope that tomorrow’s adoption of the reports and the process leading to approval of the package may herald a better policy on the use of additives in food.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take the opportunity of thanking Mr Olsson for his really constructive cooperation in connection with banning the use of hormones in animal husbandry. In this area too, we are now obtaining a result in which the use of the carcinogenic hormone, oestradiol 17β will cease in the course of two years. In other words, hormones in general will cease to be used in animal husbandry. This is a sound and very positive result that Mr Olsson has piloted through. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know from my own personal experience the different preconceptions that have to be taken into account when considering issues of labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">I would particularly like to highlight the rules on labelling for products that trigger allergic reactions. In the European Union, 8% of children and 3% of adults suffer an allergic reaction to food ingredients to such an extent that it markedly affects their general state of health, and that is an alarming statistic. When it comes to keeping consumers informed, labelling is the only option in view of the large number of compound foodstuffs, the composition of which changes frequently. Unlike the previous speakers, I am in favour of the continued addition of ingredients that, it simply has to be said, improve the quality of the meal. That products should be listed only if there is scientific evidence that they trigger allergies goes without saying; we should also ensure that the list can be amended quickly when new findings come to light. It should always be borne in mind that the plethora of information on a label has to communicate the essentials. In this perspective, I look forward with keen anticipation to learning what the Commission thinks about the inclusion on labels of, for example, unproven assertions. This is where there could well be a reduction in the amount of information provided.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just make one additional observation? In 1998, as a rapporteur, I tried to bring in rules on the labelling of alcoholic drinks; the sole issue then was the labelling of sulphur. What was, at that time, seen as revolutionary is now no longer an issue; proof that Parliament has, in recent years, come round much more to the consumers’ way of thinking.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I welcome the proposal for labelling where the proportion of an ingredient is in excess of 2%. Although this was, years ago, regarded as impossible, and may well not be necessary, we are now taking account of the tendency to use many ingredients in small quantities in the production process, and we are discharging our obligation to inform the consumer. Businesses with whom I have had discussions have told me that most labels now include ingredients the proportion of which is under 2%.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to make a brief comment on the Olsson report; I welcome Mr Olsson’s accommodating approach and see it as a good thing, but I am also aware that oestradiol 17β is already being replaced by other substances in many countries in the European Union. That is something that we should be encouraging and promoting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
