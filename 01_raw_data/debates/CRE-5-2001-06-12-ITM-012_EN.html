<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Bart Staes (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0437_EN.html">H-0437/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Irregularities in SENSUS and EUROPOLIS projects</span></p>
<p class="contents">The AVENTINUS project and its successor, the SENSUS project, have been subsidised by the Commission since 1996. Both projects seek to develop an information-exchange programme for European police and intelligence services. Coordination is in the hands of Stephan Bodenkamp/ Christoph Klonowski of the German Federal Intelligence Service (Bundesnachrichtendienst).</p>
<p class="contents">On 25 May 1999, the original Decision E/1791/97 of 3 September 1997 was amended so as to enable Europol to join the project (E/696/99). In November 1999 Europol effectively joined the ranks of SENSUS partners Gesellschaft für multilinguale Systeme mbH (Multilingual Systems Company, Ltd) and the Italian firm Datamat.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the conviction of coordinator Stephan Bodenkamp/Christoph Klonowski for forgery and the formation of the dubious SENSUS-Bundesnachrichtendienst-L&amp;H-Sail Labs complex, Europol awarded a new contract worth 20 million euro at the beginning of 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council arrange for an external audit of the AVENTINUS, SENSUS and EUROPOLIS projects to be conducted in order to eliminate irregularities and come up with a transparent project? If not, why not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It surprises me that this question should fall within the exclusive remit of the Commission, but that it <span class="italic">was</span> deemed admissible for this Question Time to the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, the response illustrates that there is an urgent need for democratic control of Europol. I am indeed familiar with Article 30 of the Treaty on European Union, but there is no denying the fact that the case file is as it stands. It is likely that Europol uses stolen information technology, and this at the expense of a German firm which was led to the brink of bankruptcy. The services of the German intelligence service were called in, and the case involved many tens of millions of European government money. A Europol employee is being arrested as we speak, and other arrests may be imminent. I would ask the Council whether it is prepared to agree on a drastic overhaul of Europol. If not, what is the reason for that decision, and why does the Council give its blessing to police cooperation getting off to such a bad start? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, once again I would point out that it is the Commission’s responsibility to deal with these issues. I am also sure that Europol, which comes under the supervision of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, has regulations on auditing and accounts, etc. which are designed in a way which makes it possible to quickly discover the type of inaccuracies and irregularities mentioned by Mr Staes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that he has brought up this important issue and I am sorry that, as President-in-Office, I cannot provide more details, as it lies outside the competence of the Council.

<p class="contents">In its answer to written question <a href="/doceo/document/P-5-2001-0054_EN.html">P-0054/01</a>, the Council stated that Turkey would 'remove any legal provisions forbidding the use by Turkish citizens of their mother tongue in TV/radio broadcasting (short-term)'. Turkey would also 'develop a comprehensive approach to reduce regional disparities, and in particular to improve the situation in the South-East, with a view to enhancing economic, social and cultural opportunities for all citizens (short-term)'. What progress has been made with realising those short-term aims? Has Turkey made a start in moving towards them? Has it given any serious thought to how it will achieve the long-term aims stated ('ensure cultural diversity and guarantee cultural rights for all citizens')?

As we know, the Council adopted the Accession Partnership on 8 March 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Turkey’s response came in the form of a national programme for implementing the legislation adopted by the Turkish government on 19 March. The Commission is currently examining the content of Turkey’s national programme, including looking at the extent to which it agrees with the Accession Partnership on the points brought up by Mrs Maes in her question. The assessment will be conducted by the Commission within the framework of the progress report to be presented to the Council in the autumn. The Council has noted that the Commission’s preliminary analysis proposes that, with regard to the political criteria, considerably more effort should be demanded in the areas of abolishing the death penalty and of cultural rights for all citizens regardless of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it is important to remember that the fact that something is included in the national programme for implementing legislation or that the legislation has been adopted is not sufficient. The European Union makes greater demands than that. It is implementation which is important, and we all know that Turkey must ensure that what is written in the programme is also put into practice. Therefore, it is important that the various bodies for monitoring the Association Agreement really monitor the way the Turkish government is realising the undertakings contained in the programme in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will actively continue to urge and encourage Turkey to carry out reforms in the areas brought up by Mrs Maes, as there is much room for improvement. Therefore, the issues taken up will continue to be top of the agenda in the improved political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Turkey’s policy on the Southern Caucasus, and in particular links with Armenia, the Council is urging Turkey to play an active role in efforts to strengthen peace and welfare in the area.

That is hardly surprising. I do have some understanding for the time aspect. It is important for matters to be looked into thoroughly, but I share your view entirely that paper is not sufficient. There is a saying in Dutch, ‘<span class="italic">papier is geduldig</span>’ [paper can wait], and I am certain that this proverb also exists in other languages. Implementation is the most important aspect, and the inspectorates should therefore show a very high level of independence in order to actually monitor implementation. Indeed, we often note that candidate countries go out of their way to create the impression that all is well. Turkey is, in fact, unable to do this at the moment, for extremely tragic events are unfolding in Turkish prisons, and – although I do not wish to discuss this now – there are still people who are risking their lives, or having them endangered by others, on a daily basis because no dialogue is being entered into. This approach seems to be at odds with the sound measures taken on behalf of minorities. I hope that the Troika can be firm but fair in its conclusions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The trial of the Fazilet Party is also under way. As a judgement has not yet been made, it is too early to express an opinion on any possible consequences. However, generally speaking it can be said that banning political parties is hardly a solution to Turkey’s political and economic problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion, as on previous occasions, I am grateful to be able to draw attention to this incredibly important issue, along with Mrs Maes, i.e. the way human rights are developing in Turkey.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Bilingualism in Istria</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 9 April 2001 the Regional Council of Istria (Croatia) adopted a regional statute which provides for parity between Italian and Croatian in all regional institutions and all procedures of administrative bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, on 23 April 2001 these rules were suspended by the Croatian Ministry of Justice, which argued that their constitutionality had to be confirmed. This is despite the universal view that they are consistent with the spirit and letter of the Croatian constitution (or Fundamental Charter).</p>
<p class="contents">There is great consternation and concern at the serious problems which would be created for the Italian-speaking population, given that Italy's status as a friendly nation and founder member of the EU should ensure the existence of full Italian/Croatian bilingualism in the border areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council state what action it intends to take, and in what quarters, to ensure that:</p>
<p class="contents">the Croatian government acts to restore the suspended rules immediately, confirming their constitutionality as soon as possible;</p>
<p class="contents">no 'political impasse' develops which could block Croatia's further progress in establishing closer relations with the EU should the decision of the Croatian government be such as to cast doubt on Zagreb's pro-European stance;</p>
<p class="contents">the basic principles and 'acquis' of the EU are reaffirmed and there is no question of suspending the right of the Italian-speaking minority to recognition of its cultural identity or that right being declared unconstitutional. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Respect for and protection of minorities is a condition built into EU policy towards those countries covered by the Stabilisation and Association Process in South Eastern Europe. Croatia is, as we all know, one of these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Stabilisation and Association Process, which will hopefully bring these countries closer to European integration, is followed and monitored carefully by the Council. Mr Podestà can rest assured that developments in the region are monitored carefully also with regard to human rights and respect for and protection of minorities. Let me point out that the General Affairs Council of 11 June approved a progress report on the Stabilisation and Association Process, including an assessment of Croatia.</p>
<p class="contents">In this assessment, the Council welcomes the progress already made by the new Croatian Government since it was sworn in last year. Important results have been achieved in many areas, but we would also highlight certain issues which require more action. One such issue is the adoption of a new law to protect minorities. There is already draft legislation, and I am convinced that Croatia will adopt this and implement it appropriately. The Council is already monitoring these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The particular issue of bilingualism in Istria, where there is a fairly large Italian minority, and the position with regard to the regional statute recently adopted by the regional council of Istria are currently being dealt with by Croatia’s administrative court. We look forward to the court’s pronouncement, and we will continue to monitor the issue carefully in our dealings with Croatia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, you leave it to me to confirm that respect for minorities is truly part of the founding spirit of the Union, as is respect for cultural diversity, and multilingualism obviously represents an immediate aspect of that. The ominous fact is that the regional statute adopted by the Regional Council of Istria on 9 April has been suspended, giving the constitutional court a further year to check for any unconstitutionality. Considering that this was also a principal reason for the resignation of the Croatian Minister for Integration, I am wondering whether there is an internal struggle going on to the detriment of the Italian-speaking minority, or whether, instead – and this would be even more serious – the Croatian constitution really does not protect minorities and particular cultures. I wonder how the Croatian government can think about moving towards membership of the European Union with such attitudes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The hake fishery underwent a fundamental change over the second half of the 90s, notably thanks to the appearance of large numbers of gillnet vessels, which by 1999 accounted for over 20% of landings, as opposed to only 4% in 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that with this form of fishing the effort is measured on the basis of net length and the number of times the nets enter the sea, this shift in method has led to a significant increase in the actual fishing effort, in respect of a reproductive stock already affected by a fall in numbers to below the precautionary level over the 90s.</p>

In this context, on 7 March 2001 the Swedish Presidency, the coming Belgian Presidency, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission made a joint declaration which formally opened the debate on the future development of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The hope is that, based on a number of operational centres and a variety of contributions, a debate will be promoted which has greater scope than ever before. The debate will be concentrated on the fundamental challenges which the European Union is facing in the decades ahead and will stimulate proposals on how these challenges are to be met rationally when it comes to policy decisions, institutions and organisation of the work.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to create a ‘citizens’ forum’ – a place where all the elements of the debate can be collected and made available – the website ‘Future of Europe’ was opened on the same day. The first contribution to the debate was made by Swedish Prime Minister Göran Persson, Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt and President of the Commission Romano Prodi in order to inspire others to follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">On the same day the Swedish Prime Minister wrote to his colleagues in the Member States and candidate countries, inviting them to take part, for example by contributing to the website. The Prime Minister also sent similar letters to the European Court of Justice, the Court of Auditors, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, the Conference of Community and European Affairs Committees (COSAC) and labour market partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening the debate in this way has meant that, even at this early stage, a large number of initiatives have been taken in Member States, candidate countries and by the EU institutions, in various debate forums. So far everyone has been interested in a truly open and broad debate on the future of the European Union in the spirit of the Nice Declaration. I am convinced that the debate will take off over the next few months as more contributions are made.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Swedish Presidency has drawn up a status report ahead of the European Council in Gothenburg, in which facts are presented on the initiatives taken at national and European level to promote wide-ranging discussions between all parties, including representatives of national parliaments, political, economic and academic circles, civil society, etc. We also highlight in this report certain trends which we believe can be seen in the debate with regard to the next phase of preparatory work for the next Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to fulfilling the undertakings in the declaration on the future of the European Union, it is up to the Belgian Presidency to continue reflecting on the initiatives needed for this process to continue. The plan is that a declaration on this issue should be adopted at the European Council in Laeken in December. Therefore I believe that Mr Nogueira Román’s comment regarding silence and lack of significant initiatives is incorrect. On the contrary, the Swedish Presidency has followed the Nice Declaration fully in actively trying to stimulate an important debate on the future of the European Union through a wide range of initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">EU summit meetings tend to be met with popular demonstrations which, in turn, provoke repressive police action. This happened in Malmö when the EU Finance Ministers convened on 21 April, and it is expected to happen again during the Gothenburg summit in June, where President Bush will also be present. It has been reported that Mr Bush will be accompanied by a large number of security staff. It must be assumed that there has been consultation, coordination and cooperation between US security staff and Swedish security staff in preparing for the Gothenburg Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Was police action in Malmö planned and carried out as a pre-Gothenburg exercise? Were US staff present or otherwise involved in the police operation in Malmo? Who has final authority and responsibility for the security of the Summit participants?

However, the Community legislation which must be followed in this area concerns the following instruments: the Council Directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies, the Council Directive on the establishment of a European Works Council or a procedure in Community-scale undertakings and Community-scale groups of undertakings for the purposes of informing and consulting employees and the Council Directive extending the latter directive to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the criticism which may have been levelled against the Community legislation, including the criticism that company management is not forbidden from deciding to close down unprofitable sections of their companies in situations where the company as a whole is profitable or that employers which have breached the requirement for information and consultation have not been punished sufficiently, the Council would like to state that it can only act on the basis of proposals from the Commission. If the Commission were to put forward such a proposal for consideration by the Council, which has not yet happened, the Council would be prepared to act quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that the Council took a decision yesterday on the Commission’s proposal for a directive establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in companies operating at national level in Member States. This directive is intended to apply to areas such as the situation, structure and probable development of employment in companies and to planned decisions from the management which are expected to lead to major changes to the organisation of work or to the associated contractual links. During the review which can now be carried out, the Council will give due attention to the recent events which the honourable Member has brought up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like you to clarify two points – the first is on effective sanctions, in the event that the rules are flouted, as happened with yesterday’s agreement. I would like you to provide clarification on this point. I would also like you to explain the situation of non-British employees working in establishments in the rest of Europe between 2004 and 2009. Mr President, my last question is what can I, as an MEP, say to the employees who are shown the door by their employers, who are making a profit, when they know that the only reason why they are being laid off is to push up the profits. Can I be satisfied by telling them that the Council cannot do anything because the Commission has not made a proposal? I know that this is not what you believe, as a man and as a member of parliament, and I would like to have a slightly more firm commitment from yourself on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a great result for the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still, however, a crucial problem which, in my view, is not simply a trifling detail and this is the problem of sanctions. Yet, it turns out that the Council did not support the proposal made by the Commission and by Mrs Diamantopoulou, to provide for, in the form of sanctions, the overturning of decisions taken on mass redundancies, which could arise from a breach of the procedure on information and consultation and, therefore, as a result, to provide for the possibility of re-establishing the contracts of employment of employees who would have been made redundant, in breach of the European directive. Are you willing, would the Council be willing, to re-introduce this point in the text if, at second reading, Parliament again adopts the proposal which was put forward by the Commission? A directive without genuine sanctions that work as a deterrent would be totally ineffective and would not protect workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Position of the Swedish Presidency on the introduction of a tax on international financial transactions</span></p>
<p class="contents">In answer to the questions put to it last month, the Council stated that it had not included the subject of the 'Tobin tax' on the agenda for the ECOFIN Council, even though Mrs Lena Hjelm-Wallén, Deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, had declared on 23 March of this year that she approved of the 'Tobin tax'.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent weeks, certain Member States such as Finland have declared their support for a tax of this kind, while a number of members of parliament (from Europe, Canada and the United States) have issued an international appeal in support of the 'Tobin tax'.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of these recent developments, has the Council decided to include the subject on the agenda of the ECOFIN Council meeting of 19 June and to propose, at that meeting, that some of the proceeds of the 'Tobin tax' be allocated to meeting basic needs in the developing countries (access to safe drinking water, primary health care and vaccination), which would cost around USD 40 billion per year according to UNDP estimates?</p>

<p class="contents">Or could it be (in the mind of the Deputy Prime Minister) on account of the attractiveness of a tax which, according to estimates, could bring in between 50 and 250 billion dollars per year, possibly for allocation to development-aid programmes in the world's poorest countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was expecting you to give the same answer as the one you gave in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to point out to you that support for a Tobin-type tax is increasing. This support is coming from organisations of economists, naturally, but also from political institutions, as a result of the fact that certain positions have been taken up in the Finnish and Canadian parliaments, and again in Argentina, quite recently, even in Great Britain, and here, in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that this type of tax could only be effective if it were chosen and implemented by several countries or areas of the world. This is often the argument used against it. It is certainly true but a first step in that direction is absolutely necessary in order to clamp down on financial speculation which is sweeping the planet, whereas new resources are urgently needed for investments to help people, particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware, and you know this, that USD 1 500 billion pass through the stock exchange every day and half of these transactions are made on the European stock markets. There is no doubt that if the European Union decided to take this step, the impact would be considerable.

I believe that the reasons given by Mrs Boudjenah are very well-founded. How can we refuse to look into a tax which could be very low and which would thus not affect goods trade and investments, since it would represent 0.1%, but which, on the other hand, would enable resources of an estimated USD 50 to 250 billion to be generated, which would considerably assist developing countries to deal with their problems.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware that at the Conference on LDCs which was held recently at the European Parliament in Brussels, it was shown that 43% of people in these countries do not have access to drinking water, 50% of the population is illiterate, one child in six will not live beyond five years old, and that since 1990, the debt of the LDCs has risen from USD 121 billion to USD 150 billion, despite the Cologne initiative. I believe, therefore, that the Council should investigate the possibility of introducing this tax, particularly in preparation for the United Nations’ Conference on development funding which will be held in Mexico in March 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was always possible for the Swedish Presidency itself to put the item on the agenda. It seems to me to be another example of politicians being out of touch with ordinary people, who are well aware of the enormous support for such a tax. Although perhaps unfeasible, it enjoys enormous support, and I find the resistance of the Council and the Commission to discussion of this tax staggering. If it could be implemented it would end the evils of global speculation that destroy so many jobs, communities and families, while promoting a good in the form of large amounts of aid and assistance to the Third World.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps the President-in-Office could respond to my concern and tell me why the Council is so afraid of commissioning a study itself or of encouraging the Commission to do so? At least we would have an answer if we could say that we had an independent study and it will not work. I suspect that would not come up with such a result but, nevertheless, can I ask you whether you will look into the possibility of commissioning a study or encouraging the Commission itself to study the Tobin-type taxes, so as to see whether they are feasible and under what conditions they could work? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the conference a number of different initiatives were discussed which will help ensure that the goals described by the honourable Member are achieved. I suggest that you look at the discussions which took place during this conference.

<p class="contents">The European Union, the Commission, through ECHO and EuropeAid, and the Member States will continue to provide urgent humanitarian aid for the population of Afghanistan and for Afghan refugees abroad, where the difficult circumstances in the area allow. However, the Taliban position on women and the many obstacles which the Taliban régime has created for the non-governmental organisations which operate in the country make this task extremely difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly true of operations aimed at improving the education and health of Afghan women. Despite the difficulties, a few humanitarian organisations are able to support and run schools for girls.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the continuing efforts of the EU and the rest of the international community, the terrible reality in Afghanistan unfortunately shows that the Taliban regime has remained impervious to argument and pressure from abroad.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflicts between Taliban troops and the Northern Alliance continue, despite the long-standing military deadlock. In addition, the Taliban continue to reject the mediation efforts of the UN and others. There is a pressing need to improve the situation with regard to humanitarian concerns and human rights, but under the conditions which I have described the outlook for improvement is unfortunately not particularly good.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council hopes that the sanctions based on Security Council Resolution UNSCR 1333, and which the Council has implemented through the equivalent Common Position and EC Regulation, will help to reduce external involvement and promote a negotiated settlement of the Afghan conflict.

<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise that there has so far been widespread agreement in the Council that the most effective way for the EU to help improve the situation in Afghanistan is to fully back the efforts of the UN. The EU’s approach must be to contribute to international coordination. In many cases, the EU can and should act unilaterally, but in a situation such as that in Afghanistan coordination is required with others who are like-minded, in which case the UN is the best forum.

<p class="contents">I would like to remind everyone that Council Regulation (EC) No 974/98 states that the euro must be put into circulation from 1 January 2002 and that the participating Member States are responsible for ensuring that suitable sanctions are in place for counterfeiting euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">On 29 May 2000, the Council adopted a framework Decision on using penal and other sanctions to increase protection against counterfeiting in connection with the introduction of the euro. In order to add to and strengthen this, particularly with regard to taking action against euro counterfeiting through close cooperation between the authorities of Member States, the European Central Bank, the national central banks, Europol and in the future also Eurojust, the French government tabled, on 22 December 2000, a draft Decision on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting. As the honourable Member knows, Parliament gave its opinion on the draft on 3 May 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft, which is in the process of being approved, is linked to the draft Council Regulation on the protection of the euro against counterfeiting and the draft Council Regulation extending the effects of the latter regulation. Parliament also gave its opinion on all these regulations on 3 May 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">At the meeting of 29 May 2001, the Council agreed to divide the draft decision tabled last year into one draft for a Council decision and one draft for a framework decision. The European Parliament will be urged to give its opinion on both these drafts. At the same time, the Council agreed on conclusions regarding Europol’s role in protecting the euro, partly by providing Member States with the necessary aid to be able to carry out their work on preventing and combating euro counterfeiting.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of money laundering, the Council has, in previous answers to Parliament, clearly set out its view on the increased risk of money laundering on the introduction of the common currency and on the measures which the Council has adopted to reduce this risk. These measures, along with the increased vigilance of the national authorities and financial institutions, are crucial to reducing the risk of money laundering on the introduction of the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to a report in the Financial Times on 22 May, Europol apparently thinks that these measures are still inadequate. One of the particular concerns is the very high value of the 500-euro note, which is in danger of making the euro the currency of choice for counterfeiters and money launderers, because it is substantially higher in value than any other note in regular circulation in the United States, Japan or the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the Council not considered the possibility of delaying the issuing of the 500-euro note because, with the introduction of the euro, there will be a particularly dangerous window of opportunity for counterfeiters potentially to have a field day, as millions of people around the world will never have seen these notes before. Substantial counterfeiting will engender the severe risk of global damage to the whole credibility of, and confidence in, the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This action plan was also supported by the European Council at its Summit in Feira in Portugal in June 2000. In this action plan, which is now being implemented, the Commission is urged to work with Member States to draw up a procedure for voluntary monitoring of non-scheduled chemical precursors of synthetic drugs in partnership with the chemicals industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also urged to regularly report to the Council on the control of diverting illicit chemical precursors, measures which have been implemented in the previous year and measures which are proposed for the coming year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the Commission’s proposals, on 5 June 2001 the Council adopted a regulation<span class="bold"> </span>amending the previous regulation laying down measures to be taken to discourage the diversion of certain substances to the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, to extend the definition of scheduled substances to natural products which contain such substances, extend the cooperation between Member State authorities and the chemicals industry to also cover non-scheduled substances and to give the Commission responsibility for drawing up guidelines to aid the chemical industry in achieving the aim of the aforementioned cooperation. These guidelines are to contain a regularly updated list of non-scheduled substances commonly used in the illicit manufacture of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, so that the industry will be able to monitor trade in such substances on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is currently developing its activities in partnership chiefly with important countries of origin and transit countries in order to combat the illicit drug trade.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Latin America and the West Indies, the third top-level meeting within the framework of the cooperation and coordination mechanism has just started in Cochabamba in Bolivia. An action plan for the EU/Central Asia will be approved in the next few weeks. The fight against drugs has an important place in the partnership with the US within the framework of the Transatlantic Dialogue and with Russian within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. Within the preparations for the accession of candidate countries, the section of the Phare Programme addressing drugs is an important element of the fight against the drug trade. In addition, Europol has opened negotiations with 23 countries on entering into cooperation agreements. Most cooperation systems are concentrating on measures against illicit trade in drugs, seaways, control of synthetic drugs and increased police and customs cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, in my opening reply I tried to point out that, since the conference at which the expert to whom you refer expressed such criticism, the EU and the Council have tried in various ways to implement measures intended to lead to more effective cooperation in this area. I have also tried to describe the ways in which this is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in a position to make any clear statement on cause and effect. However, I believe that the criticism from Europol’s expert to which you referred, and many other critical comments, have led to us having more effective cooperation in this area within the EU. But I believe we all agree that a number of steps must be taken in the policy area and concerning legislation and judicial cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much still to do, but I believe the EU can state that important steps have been taken in recent years towards more effective cooperation in the fight against drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">One final reflection from the Swedish Presidency is that there is much still to be done in the areas of judicial and home affairs cooperation. At the European Council in Gothenburg on Friday and Saturday we will be proposing that the European Council agree to press to increase the tempo regarding cooperation in the areas of justice and home affairs. This applies not least to drugs cooperation, as progress needs to be faster on this matter. We hope that much of the groundwork carried out by the Swedish Presidency in this area will lead to concrete decisions during the Belgian Presidency in the areas of judicial and home affairs cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me simply agree with what Mr Sacrédeus said regarding the difficulties of achieving effective cooperation in this area and also the desirability of making some progress. Among the 15 Member States we have various legal traditions in this area. During our Presidency we have, for example in an informal meeting between justice ministers and interior ministers, tried to contribute to a process in which we converge in our views in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, with a certain amount of resignation, state that there is much still to be done. I am sure that our Belgian friends will be perfectly able to take the discussion forwards. I have a feeling that a number of presidencies after Belgium will also have to deal with the issue. However, I believe that it is vital for us to achieve major successes in the areas of justice and home affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
