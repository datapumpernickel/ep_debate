<p class="contents">I have great pleasure in today presenting the Netherlands Presidency’s priorities to you, the directly elected representatives of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of the European Parliament, you hold one of the finest and most important offices of all in the European Union. It is no accident that Parliament is the institution placed first in the Treaty. You watch over the quality of our community, which is, above all, a community based on shared values. You have received a proud mandate from Europe’s citizens. I wish you every success in carrying it out and warmly congratulate you on your election.</p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to congratulate Mr Borrell on his election as President of the European Parliament, in which important position I wish him every success.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though we play different roles within the European Union, we also have much in common. The main thing, in my view, is a great sense of responsibility: for Europe, for the substantive issues on which we want to make progress, but, above all, towards the people of Europe, for whom we are doing all this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Irish Presidency for the great job done. Mr Ahern and his team have performed wonders.</p>
<p class="contents">Successful enlargement to bring in ten countries, agreement on a new European Constitution and mutually agreed selection of a really top-class nominee as President of the European Commission: these are resounding achievements. In their dealings with the European Parliament as well, the Irish have set an inspiring example, and one that we wish to follow. Allow me to say a few words about the European Council’s nomination of José Manuel Barroso for the position of President of the European Commission. You will be discussing this issue this afternoon and tomorrow. I see Mr Barroso as a man of dialogue, but also as someone who does not shy away from setting out a course. The Council believes that he is the man to take the Commission forward at this time. Someone who, together with others, can help promote economic growth and increase security. We therefore hope that the European Parliament will approve his nomination tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a fine open-air exhibition to be seen around my offices in the centre of The Hague at present. Young visual artists from European Union countries have been asked to create work inspired by Europe’s striving for peace and justice. The event is entitled ‘Art, the Great Communicator’.</p>
<p class="contents">From my own office, I can see a number of the exhibits. What image of Europe do they represent?</p>
<p class="contents">One work shows Europe as a maze.</p>
<p class="contents">Another shows it as a tower under construction.</p>
<p class="contents">A third shows it as a drowning man trying to pull himself out of the water.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many ways of looking at Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">How do Europe’s citizens see it? Judging by the turnout at the recent elections, its citizens do not see Europe as a masterpiece to enthuse about. For the fifth time in succession, fewer Europeans turned out to vote. Some groups are swayed by mistrust and doubts regarding European integration. The European project is subject to critical scrutiny, from both within and outside the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency is only too aware of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Critical comments, however, are part and parcel of democracy. They can serve to strengthen democracy. There is no reason to lapse into pessimism. On the contrary: there is a need right now to show Europe’s citizens that Europe belongs to them. A work in progress. Not perfect. Open to improvement. Yet worthwhile and, as history teaches us, vital if we are to tackle problems which no country can resolve on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">That makes the European Union worth actively contributing to.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency wants to send out that message loud and clear, with both heartfelt ambition and clear-headed realism.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation with you is of the utmost importance in this. Whether you are among those who see Europe as a maze or those who see it as a tower under construction, you all represent the views of Europe’s citizens. They are what it is all about. We should like, with you, to make tangible headway, recognised and appreciated by those citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise that the period ahead is for you a time when new developments have to become bedded down. The European Parliament’s membership has been expanded to 732. Parliament has been joined by 162 representatives from ten new Member States, who have to find their feet. Political families are changing their make-up and taking in new members. It is pleasing to see that you are energetically getting down to business and pressing ahead with Parliament’s legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">There are more new developments in store, too. The new Constitution considerably increases the European Parliament’s influence over decision-making and the course of events in the Union. National parliaments are also to play an important role in addressing the question of whether there is actually any need for European regulation in specific cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This will make the Union more democratic. Under the new Constitution, its citizens will make themselves heard more loudly and more forcefully. Even those who take a critical view of European integration will be better placed under the new Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency welcomes the extension of the European Parliament’s powers. This is one of the major pluses under the new Treaty and thus also a strong argument in domestic discussion of approval. In a number of countries, approval will arouse heated debate. I hope that, in the process, facts will not lose out to presentation. The new Constitution will undeniably bring the Union closer to its citizens, and that is surely something we are all particularly anxious to see.</p>
<p class="contents">At just such a time of new developments, it is important to remain on course and ensure that we continue to make progress for Europe’s citizens. Without smooth cooperation between the Council, Parliament and the Commission, that will prove impossible. The Netherlands Presidency is ready and willing to work constructively with you and sincerely hopes that you are willing to work constructively with us.</p>
<p class="contents">Like many in this Chamber, the presidency regrets the failure as yet to resolve the long-running issue of the Members’ Statute. With your support, the previous President put in a lot of hard work, but without any result so far. If there is any prospect of a solution, the Netherlands Presidency will certainly assist in arriving at one.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not possible, within the space of this presentation, to cover all of the substantive issues on the agenda. I shall therefore merely deal with those subjects particularly in need of our mutual attention. Without wishing to tread on subsequent presidencies’ toes, we clearly have to venture to look beyond 1 January 2005. We are all too aware that it will take a number of years for objectives to be achieved. The Netherlands Presidency is a link in a chain. That is why we are trying to create the best possible conditions for the work of future presidencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency will constantly endeavour not to lose sight of longer-term interests. If there is one thing we want to bring to the Union, it is our forward-looking approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Internally, by working for consolidation of the enlarged Union, for sustainable economic growth, for security and for a sound financial foundation for the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Externally, by looking ahead, together with our partners elsewhere in the world, and by operating more decisively, as a Union, on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, consolidation of the Union. The ten countries which joined on 1 May of this year need to feel completely at ease within the Union as quickly as possible. The presidency has a particular responsibility in this. We shall do our level best to ensure that the new Member States can fully participate in all of the Union’s proceedings as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we want to pave the way thoroughly for future enlargements. Membership negotiations with Bulgaria were completed a short while ago. Those with Romania have reached a very advanced stage. Membership negotiations with Croatia are to begin next year.</p>
<p class="contents">In December too, the European Council is to consider whether Turkey fulfils the Copenhagen political criteria for human rights and democracy. If so, membership negotiations will be opened with Turkey as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision must be arrived at honestly, under the ground rules to which we previously, in 2002, firmly committed ourselves. That means strict application of the criteria laid down, but without inventing any new criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not allow ourselves to be guided by fear, for example of Islam. The raising of barriers to any particular religion is not consistent with Europe’s shared values. Our opposition should be directed not against religions but against people and groups misusing their religion to get their way by force.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Islam is not the problem. Muslims, Christians and people of other beliefs can live together perfectly well. The problem is not religion, but misuse of religion to sow hatred and intolerance and to repress women.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the decision on Turkey does greatly concern and trouble many people. The presidency wants to make possible a well-founded decision, one which gains all-round endorsement and will also hold firm in future.</p>
<p class="contents">A forward-looking approach is also at the heart of the second item on the agenda: sustainable economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">After a period of stagnation, Europe’s economy is gradually starting to pick up again. However, as a result of the underlying weaknesses in our economic structure, recovery is slow and laborious. Europe’s economy has stiff joints and makes too little use of its head. This makes our competitors too quick and too smart for us. Anyone who looks objectively at the developments sees that Europe is losing ground, even in periods of economic recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">We must avoid focusing on our own jobs, our own social safety net, our own pensions. We should turn our attention to the jobs, social safety net and pensions of our children.</p>
<p class="contents">How strong will Europe be in several decades? Will it be a place where our children and grandchildren can build a good life? Can we continue to put into practice our values of solidarity and social justice?</p>
<p class="contents">Beware: these are things that cannot be taken for granted. Look at the boom in countries like China and India. Is Europe strong and flexible enough to hold its own in the face of that competition?</p>
<p class="contents">It is against this background that we must give top priority to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. During the Netherlands Presidency, preparations are being made for its interim review. A working party chaired by Wim Kok is currently drawing up a report on what we have achieved thus far and what remains to be done. That report will appear at the European Council on 5 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is missing out on important opportunities. We do not capitalise on what our internal market has to offer. In particular, the market for services is still subject to all kinds of national restrictions. And it is in this very sector that most Europeans earn their living.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we do not sufficiently exploit the internal market’s strength. If we realise that 1.8% of Europe’s GDP and 2.5 million jobs depend on the working of the internal market, we have every reason to strengthen that internal market and expand it towards the services sector. The Directive on services, proposed by the Commission, is an important step in the right direction. It goes without saying that the swift approval of this legislation can give a significant boost to the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The functioning of the European market can also be improved by fewer and better regulations. We must make the rules work for us instead of the other way round. The Irish, Netherlands, Luxembourg and United Kingdom Presidencies are working together to make this a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the aspirations contained in the Lisbon agenda will have to be realised in the Member States. Labour markets must become more flexible, and social security systems more enabling. Pension systems must acquire a firmer base so that future generations can continue to build on them.</p>
<p class="contents">In the global economy of today and tomorrow, not only must Europe be flexible, it must also use its know-how. Europe’s innovative capacity is not strong enough. Let us take one example. Some 400 000 European scientists are currently working in the United States. They account for 40% of the US scientific community. This is an enormous exodus of people whom we ourselves sorely need. That is why we must vigorously continue to improve the knowledge climate in Europe. One concrete measure is the setting up of a European Research Council geared to providing risk capital for research.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause)</p>
<p class="contents">Our aspirations are focused not only on economic growth, but also on sustainability. The Netherlands Presidency will endeavour to strengthen the environmental dimension of the Lisbon process, paying special attention to sustainable mobility, clean technology and international climate policy.</p>
<p class="contents">(Applause)</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is more than an economic project. Sixty years after D-Day, it remains a project for freedom, solidarity and mutual respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the intangibles that particularly preoccupy people, security is the most important. Greater security has always been a driving force behind European cooperation. At one time, we sought a precarious peace on a continent torn apart by war. Now, we face new threats that compel us to act: terrorism and organised crime. These are threats that we can only overcome together.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that together we continue to look ahead. Now that the Tampere programme is ending, new steps are necessary to extend the European Area of freedom, security and justice further. The Netherlands Presidency is endeavouring to ensure that the European Council on 5 November outlines a vision that is as concrete as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In a free Europe with open internal borders, it is essential that we align our criminal-law systems and that our cooperation is watertight. Legally and geographically, the Union must offer no place of refuge to criminals who abuse the freedom that Europe offers them.</p>
<p class="contents">In so doing, we will at times have to walk the extra mile. Sometimes, countries are strongly attached to their national traditions as regards police and justice. However, without more extensive coordination in these areas, we continue to run the risk of criminals evading the law and jeopardising our security.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, the European Anti-Terrorism Coordinator, Gijs de Vries, outlined how Europe can put a stop to terrorism more effectively. The Netherlands Presidency intends to take active steps to elaborate and implement the proposed action points.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency also attaches priority to a new European drugs strategy for 2005-2012. This will focus on the joint approach to large-scale drug trafficking and also on improved prevention and health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Tension sometimes exists between freedom and security. Neither can ever be absolute. The important thing is always to strike the right balance.</p>
<p class="contents">We must strike the same balance in the areas of asylum and migration, which is another part of the follow-up to Tampere that will be on the agenda at the European Council on 5 November.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we do not wish to create a Fortress Europe, we also witness the hectic movement of asylum seekers and illegal immigrants entering and passing through. Human traffickers ruthlessly exploit this phenomenon. Furthermore, we know from experience how much it takes in order to provide newcomers with full opportunities in our society. Control of migration flows is therefore necessary, and we can only do that together. In a Union with open internal borders, we cannot afford not to have a European policy on asylum, immigration and repatriation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are entering a phase of further harmonisation, as provided for in the Tampere programme. Our efforts are directed towards a common asylum system and improved protection for refugees in regions of origin. We must act together, on the basis of solidarity between Member States, to combat illegal immigration. This requires effective surveillance of our external borders. The Agency for the management of external borders is vitally important for this purpose. We must therefore ensure now that it can become operational in 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe offers a place to anyone who is entitled to come. By ‘place’ I mean much more than a roof over one’s head. A place means a place in our society. We intend to pay greater attention to the integration of newcomers. In this area, Member States have their own traditions. While there must be room for such traditions, we can also learn from one another’s experiences.</p>
<p class="contents">A credible asylum and immigration policy also entails the return of those who are not entitled to stay here. The Netherlands Presidency has the task of forging ahead with repatriation policy before the end of the year. This involves, inter alia, common repatriation procedures and operations, as well as the establishment of repatriation and readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The last main item on our internal agenda to which I wish to refer is the financial basis for future years.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations on the EU’s multiannual budgetary framework – the financial perspectives – will be concluded in 2005. This is a delicate matter, which is viewed in many different ways. The Netherlands Presidency considers it its duty to give those highly complex negotiations the best possible structure even before they begin by agreeing this year on the guidelines and principles on which they should be based. This should increase their chances of success.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will, of course, be heavily involved in preparations for establishing the new financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">If it looks towards the future, the EU must also look outwards. Our future is closely linked to that of our neighbours and partners elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a Union of 25 developed countries, a community built on the cornerstones of freedom, solidarity and mutual respect, and the world’s largest economic bloc.</p>
<p class="contents">The world rightly expects great things of us. Are we fully living up to those expectations? Europe could be more decisive. We could achieve more by joining forces and speaking more in unison.</p>
<p class="contents">The major global issues of our time are combating terrorism, furthering human rights and democracy, economic development and the fight against poverty. In these areas, Europe must speak with a single, resonant voice.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Security Strategy, and in particular the broad vision on which it is based, provides an excellent foundation for doing just that. It is about more than just expanding the EU’s own capacities for crisis management. The Netherlands Presidency is keen to use every possible means to work towards implementing the Security Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations is at the heart of multilateral cooperation and must remain there. As the President of the European Council, the Netherlands will play an active role in discussions on reforming the United Nations. Extra impetus also needs to be given to the multilateral trade system. Following the Cancun failure, we have an opportunity this year to achieve real progress in the WTO. Everyone stands to gain from that.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of the most recent enlargement, the EU has gained not only new members, but also new neighbours. We feel closely associated with them and want to strengthen our ties with them. The same applies to countries in the ‘wider Middle East’ and the Mediterranean. The Netherlands Presidency is keen to work towards increasing stability in that region and encouraging reforms in the political, economic and socio-cultural areas. The Barcelona process must be strengthened and intensified.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency will devote a great deal of time to the Middle East peace process. Europe must make a concerted contribution to the future of Iraq. In so doing, we will rely on the pivotal role of the UN and take account of the desires and needs of the Iraqi Government and people.</p>
<p class="contents">Our economic and political relations with Asia have become much more important in recent years. The Netherlands Presidency will continue to build on the strategic relationship with our Asian partners at the proposed summits with China, India, South Korea and ASEM. We will also take that opportunity to look specifically at the sensitive issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">One in seven of the world’s population suffers from chronic hunger. In Africa, in particular, poverty, conflicts and epidemics are taking a heavy toll. The European Union will not leave Africa to fend for itself. The situation in Darfur, Sudan comes most readily to mind in that connection. The EU must remain active there, not only in terms of relief work, but also in a political sense. We are exerting pressure on the Sudanese authorities to improve the situation, and will not hesitate to step up that pressure if they fail to take sufficient action.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from Darfur, the EU will continue to devote its energies to combating HIV and AIDS, and preventing conflicts in Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Every era is an era of transition. The same applies to our term of office as President of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the features of our era – 2004 – is that the European Union is faced with a paradox.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we have seen the dream of the founders of the European Union fulfilled. The countries of Europe have dared to throw in their lot together and have thereby brought about reconciliation, stability and prosperity. Whichever way you look at it, that is a huge achievement.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, it is becoming increasingly clear that such cooperation and such feeling of solidarity are no longer obvious to many people. We seem to be finding it increasingly difficult to identify our common ground, as if we have lost sight of what connects us at the deepest level. This is something that cannot be ignored, especially now that the EU is working intensively on its enlargement. Before an edifice can be extended, it must be ensured that its foundations remain solid; otherwise, the entire structure, and therefore all its inhabitants, are at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, the Netherlands has decided to take the initiative of organising a debate on the significance of European values in 2004. The fact that such values are enshrined in the Constitution is not enough. They must also live on in people’s hearts and minds. Specifically, we will devote a number of meetings to that subject and develop initiatives to stimulate discussion of European affairs with Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In this way, we hope to make Europe’s citizens more aware of what it means to be European. What makes Europe so valuable is that we are a community in which freedom, solidarity and respect hold equal weight.</p>
<p class="contents">The agenda I have put before you is based on these three fundamental values.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="underline">Freedom</span>: that means working on security and deepening cooperation with our global partners.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="underline">Solidarity</span>: that means working on economic growth and social coherence, for present and future generations.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="underline">Respect</span>: that means working on understanding and mutual commitment in the expanding Union with all its differences.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is not perfect. However, that is no reason to write it off or adopt a casual attitude to it. It is not criticism we should be afraid of, but indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">Criticism is good. Without it, there would be no improvement. Indifference, however, is not helpful. Even worse, it undermines what has already been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Netherlands Presidency wants to work constructively with you, the directly elected representatives of the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I can give the final word to just such a citizen. A major newspaper in the Netherlands is currently publishing a series of portraits of ordinary Europeans and their visions of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the subjects is Ilma Kaulina, a 39-year-old graphic designer from Riga. Her husband is a bus driver, and they have three children.</p>
<p class="contents">Ilma Kaulina does not regard Europe as a panacea. Although she is critical of Europe, she does expect certain things of it.</p>
<p class="contents">She says: ‘The European Union can give us a better life. If you put the cultural differences to one side for a moment, you can see that, together, we have the prospect of a better social and economic future. All the obstacles will fade in time.’</p>
<p class="contents">That is how I would sum up our approach. Together with you, the Netherlands Presidency will do everything in its power not to disappoint Ilma Kaulina from Riga.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi, Romano,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, the beginning of the Dutch Presidency is a good time to reflect on the achievements made over these years and, most of all, the commitments awaiting us in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">Later, this House will be hearing from the President designate of the next Commission, José Manuel Durão Barroso, and together we want to wish the new President every success. It will certainly be essential in this new phase to ensure full and close collaboration among the three institutions while respecting the prerogatives of each one. Cooperation among the three institutions is indeed a top priority, especially while the new institutions are being set up. We have worked well over these five years: we have done so much and have left the institutional structure completely renewed. It has been a great privilege for me to direct this College of Commissioners, and the people who comprise it form an extraordinary team of whom all the citizens of Europe may be proud.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest achievement of these five years has been the final demolition of the wall that had divided the continent for half a century. A real political tour de force was completed on 1 May, and never before has the Union been able to express so well the strength of its model and the values on which it is based: peace, freedom and solidarity. I am convinced that enlargement has improved our security and the prospects for growth in the Union, and these, as Prime Minister Balkenende has said, are the problems that the Dutch Presidency is most concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking to the future in the wake of this success, we must complete the unification of Europe by opening the door to the Balkans. The Macedonian Government has already submitted its application to join and is now setting off along that road with determination. For Croatia the journey has already begun. The other countries will follow, each at its own pace, but the Commission will never fail to support this process, which truly rounds off the European frame of reference. Ever since the start of my mandate, I have in fact maintained that only the European Union can guarantee lasting stability and development in this part of our continent. Only the European model can help these peoples, our close neighbours, to overcome their old divisions and their old tragedies. In our new neighbourhood policy we have found an original and realistic formula for proposing a new model of ever closer relationships with our new neighbours, creating a ring of friendly countries throughout the region from Morocco to Russia. Setting up a broad, new region in political, economic and human terms was one of this Commission’s great strategic objectives. Today this objective is a political reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Over these five years the Commission has also promoted the economic and social renewal of the Union and has worked hard to ensure macroeconomic stability. The most important measure, without doubt, has been the introduction of the euro. The single currency has already kept its promise of stability and, in these difficult years for the world economy, our own economies have shown how well they are able to withstand external shocks. There has been no turmoil on the exchange markets and no crisis in public finances, not even in the difficult times of recent months, and inflation has remained low. Just think what would have happened if we had not had the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must recall that during this Commission’s mandate the text of the first Constitution for Europe was created; I have already spoken about this at length this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, while the euro, enlargement and the Constitution are the most visible achievements, we must not forget the other successes of this Commission. Without listing them all, I must recall the extraordinary work that has been done on state aid and the management of the Stability and Growth Pact. In this the Commission has remained faithful to its role as guardian of the Treaties and has ensured absolute equality of treatment for all the parties involved, large countries and small countries. We can indeed discuss the rules we have been given and we can see how to change them, how to make them more suited to the new economic reality, but it is the Commission’s specific duty to apply the existing rules impartially, seeking only the common interest.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I cannot fail to recall the constant work of constructing the internal market, in which we have often had to overcome the Member States’ resistance and lack of cohesion. Thanks to this work, however, it now costs European consumers less to fly, to connect to the Internet and to make payments from one country to another in the Union compared with five years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I must add that there is no genuine growth in the European project if it does not involve all the regions in the Union. Because of this measure, in recent years there has been a noticeable narrowing of the gap between the regions of Europe in terms of income and development prospects. This is an exceptional fact, because what usually happens in large economic aggregations is that, unless there is a strong policy in place, the richer areas get richer and the poorer areas get poorer. Of course, more needs to be done in future even in this direction, especially to respond to the request for solidarity voiced by the countries that have just joined the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, while the euro ensures our financial stability, our future growth depends on the renovation of our economic system as provided for in the Lisbon Agenda. As you know, this is still a sore point because the results are not up to expectations, but I assure you that the project would have run aground completely had it not been for our constant pressure on the Member States. We have almost reached the half-way point in this ten-year strategy and there is still a lot left to do. I am grateful to Prime Minister Balkenende for committing himself to this road, which is still the road that has given the least favourable results compared with expectations. The Commission has, however, laid a solid basis for the eventual success of the operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Lisbon Agenda is based on both the renewal of the economy and the creation of a truly competitive knowledge society, we have, for the areas within our remit, substantially increased the funds for research, education and training in Europe. Together with the projects to create networks of excellence, we are leaving the next Commission our proposal to double the Community research budget for the period 2007-2013, thus setting all the Member States an example of strong decision-making.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of education, one of the best days in our mandate was when the millionth university student went to study abroad under the Erasmus programme. A million is an extraordinary number, and by the end of the decade we will have trebled that. Pulling down these borders helps to create the knowledge society but it will also help to develop a generation of truly European citizens, since mobility and European citizenship are closely linked, and it is especially by targeting young people and students that we are laying the basis for the Union of tomorrow. I am therefore delighted that the Dutch Presidency considers mobility and young people to be one of its priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The same concept also applies to our external borders. It is essential to take full advantage of the external dimension of European policies on education, training and young people. This is why this Commission has launched the university cooperation and exchange programmes with the Mediterranean, the Balkans and Central Asia. The latest addition to this family is Erasmus Mundus, a programme of crucial importance that will bring thousands of students from all over the world to our universities and will help to restore Europe’s role as a world leader in research and higher education. This is precisely the objective that Mr Balkenende illustrated earlier, without which Europe will not be able to achieve the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, having recalled some of the achievements of this mandate, let us now look at what remains for us to do by the end of October.</p>
<p class="contents">First, we shall continue to press ahead with the preparations for the new Financial Perspective. As you know, last week the Commission approved a legislative package that follows on from the political programme adopted last February. The strategy is simple: first we defined the political priorities for the period after 2007 and then we put on the table the schedule of the minimum financial resources needed to achieve these objectives. We focused, therefore, on the content and the political objectives and not just the financial aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased with the great amount of work that has been done, because it shows we are up to the new tasks that the European Council has entrusted to the Commission. In 2007 the European Union will have over 100 million new citizens; even so, our proposal leaves the current own resources ceiling unchanged because, with strict – or rather the very strictest – budgetary discipline and careful programming, we shall even be able to raise the number of Member States in the Union to 27 while spending on average only 1.14% of gross national income.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that Europe really can make a difference, but if financial resources are lacking European added value will be zero. We have prepared our proposals with the aim of maximising the efficiency of Community spending, demonstrating chapter by chapter that one euro spent at European level yields more than one euro spent at national level. Where this is not the case, we have not made proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s priorities, as the European Council has so often reaffirmed, are competitiveness, European citizenship and Europe’s role in the world. We have made these decisions very seriously, and it is our job to find the resources in the Community budget to achieve them, because they are tasks that have been entrusted to us by the European Council. All the institutions – the Commission, the Council and Parliament – have a common duty to honour their commitments and respond to the people’s expectations. If the European Union cannot keep its promises it is bound to lose its citizens’ trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1 May 2004 we have continued our efforts for the unification of Europe. With Bulgaria the negotiations are technically over. As regards Romania, I intend to do everything in my power to advance the negotiations as speedily as possible, thus honouring the commitments made, which – I must remind you all – foresee the conclusion of negotiations in 2004, provided the country is ready. In early October, the Commission will adopt the report and opinion on the start of accession negotiations with Turkey, which will be the basis for the Council decision in December.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not hesitate to accept the mandate conferred on me by the European Council in December 2002 to present this report on Turkey’s compliance with the Copenhagen political criteria and to issue an opinion on it. It would be premature to reveal its contents now, but I can only say that we are collecting analyses, facts and statements across the board. I can thus assure you that the work we are conducting is exhaustive and thoroughly objective. This total impartiality is our duty towards our governments, our citizens and the Turkish people, who hope to join us, as well as towards the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I opened my speech by explaining why, in my opinion, the College I preside over is leaving behind a strong legacy and a renewed and vigorous institution. I have given a few reasons for saying this and I could give many more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, however, is not just the College of Commissioners. I should like to take this opportunity to pay due tribute to all the women and all the men who keep our institution alive and make it grow every day, often in the face of incomprehension and lack of awareness. In Brussels and the other seats of the European Commission, I have found levels of excellence, competence and commitment that would be the envy of many national administrations. This will be one of the fondest memories I shall keep of my experience at the head of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us, Commissioners and staff, believe in Europe and believe that the Union is the only road that will lead the continent to a future of peace, prosperity and autonomy in the world. This is our true strength.</p>

In the Netherlands, you have always been committed to European integration, and that will be of immense value in making your Presidency a success. Let me also say that the Dutch delegation in our group, led by our new Member Camiel Eurlings, does an excellent job of work, and they will generate the support your Presidency will need from our group; it goes without saying that you will have it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The most important task before us is more a matter of political psychology; it involves the inward completion of the enlargement of the European Union, and our gaining an understanding of each other. It is about ministers in the Council of Ministers understanding each other, about the peoples understanding each other and being willing to learn from one another and to meet each other halfway, and, if we have that respect and regard for each other, I am sure that will make for great success.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Presidency will see the signature of the European Constitution, and the Group of the European People’s Party sees the success of that as having the utmost priority. That is crucial, whether the decision is taken by referendum or by parliamentary bodies, as some countries’ traditions require. It must be a success, and that is where you are the vital link in the chain of which you have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the internal market. I cannot but emphatically endorse what you said about the continuing completion of the internal market, and also about the further realisation of the research area that you mentioned – as did the President of the Commission as well. We have to get young scientists to stay in Europe; they have to have prospects here that will keep them from emigrating to the USA or to other countries. Where the completion of the internal market is concerned, that is a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned enlargement. Contentious though the issue of Turkey is for us, it is important that the criteria should be complied with, that there should be no political opportunism and, should negotiations take place, that consideration be given to alternatives, such as, for example, a privileged partnership with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the Financial Perspective. We are in favour of establishing a committee in this House to consider these issues, and I would remind you that the Financial Perspective is not just the responsibility of the ministers on the Council, but we have an equal share in these matters, and that is something on which we insist.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to an issue that may appear a matter of form or symbolic – that of the family photos, about which I said something to the Irish presidency earlier today. We do not accept the constant marginalisation of the Presidents of Parliament and of the Commission. This Europe of ours is a community, and so, when such photos are taken, the Presidents of the institutions should be at the centre.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of Europe’s values. We are very much behind you in calling a number of conferences on the subject, and that will build up our optimism for Europe. I trust that all Europe’s media will now take up your reference to Ilma Kaulina from Riga, who believes in Europe’s future. I am quite convinced that, if everyone does his or her duty, this continent has a great future ahead of it. That is what you are working towards, and in that our group wishes you much success.</p>

One thing, though, is quite clear; we want the Lisbon process to be a social one. Economic renewal, a fitter Europe – which is indispensable – Europe as a global player not only in economic terms, a Europe that wants to be a success and will be one – only by maintaining internal social cohesion can these things be achieved. If we want that, we need social stability. Social cohesion is an indispensable part of the Lisbon process. If you concentrate your efforts on that during your presidency of the Council, then we European Socialists will be right alongside you.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is a second observation I want to make about enlargement. It has to be clear to us that there are two stages to enlargement. Bulgaria and Romania are now knocking on the EU’s door, and that is something we need to debate. Explicit promises have been made, and we have to talk about them, and if we are to talk in terms of fairness, let us talk about fairness towards both these countries, towards Bulgaria and Romania. We in the Socialist Group insist that there must be no gradations here. There also needs to be fairness in our dealings with Turkey. I know that you, Mr Balkenende, are well-versed in modern German history. Let me remind Mr Poettering of the former chairman of the CSU, Franz-Josef Strauss, and of his favourite dictum, ‘Pacta sunt servanda’, which he used in Vilshofen, and later in Passau. Treaties are to be kept to! You cannot, for forty years, make promises to a country like Turkey and, when it comes to the crunch, say that you did not mean it like that. If the European Union wants international credibility, it has to keep to its promises. What that means is that, if the criteria have been met, negotiations have to start. Let me repeat that: if the criteria have been met,</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">the two belong together. And Islam is not the problem, on the contrary. If we were to succeed in bringing together in reconciliation a society of Muslims – which is what Turkish society is – with a society to whose values you have referred, such as freedom, solidarity, fraternity, civilian control of the armed forces, respect for human rights, the abolition of the death penalty, the freedom of the justice system; if we were to succeed in demonstrating that Islam and the Western value-system were not mutually exclusive, but mutually compatible, it would prove the Bin Ladens of this world wrong. The security dividend that could thereby accrue to Europe is not something we can risk without serious thought. I do not know whether Turkey will become a Member State of the EU, but to deny it the chance to do so would be a calamity.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Balkenende, I listened with great attention when you said you wanted to concentrate your efforts on combating terrorism and also on a new policy on drugs. We very much welcome that, but fighting terrorism also involves the EU institutions established for that purpose being capable of doing their job. That is why I will tell you, in your capacity as President-in-Office of the Council rather than as Prime Minister of the Netherlands – for as that you can do nothing about it – that Europol, the institution set up to combat terrorism in Europe, has been without a director for months because two Member States cannot agree among themselves. That is, quite simply, a scandal. We expect your presidency of the Council to see it brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">While we are on the subject of counter-terrorism, let me say that we are all willing to join in a coalition against terrorism. What we are not willing to do is to allow, as part of counter-terrorism, the abandonment of fundamental values for which we stand and to which you have referred, such as freedom, justice, and fairness in our dealings with one another. I find it unacceptable that the European Union’s High Representative has not yet had anything to say about Guantanamo; that is something we cannot tolerate. If Europe is to discuss values with the USA as an equal, then we have to tell them that this is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There is much else I could mention that is not acceptable, but if we want to make sustainable policies, we need Kyoto; if we want to make peace more secure throughout the world, we need the International Criminal Court, without special rights of immunity. If we want to seize a new opportunity in the aftermath of the failure of Cancún, then we need cooperation with the United States of America, just as we do when it comes to Kyoto and the International Criminal Court. Perhaps the American electorate will give us a happy event in November. That would be desirable, but, Mr Balkenende, what I expect of the Prime Minister of a country that has always stood up for these values is that the European Union should insist upon them in its dealings with our main partner on earth, and hence, also on the ratification of Kyoto and on fair trade. If you take that to heart, then we Social Democrats will be right behind your Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ALDE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, one quarter of the Netherlands is below sea-level so you have a long history of trying to keep dry! I suspect that your presidency will be about digging channels and containing the tides - tides such as the challenge of funding the new enlarged European Union, the deepening importance of rebuilding our economic strength, the ebb and flow of the dangers of international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">You need to inherit some of the momentum of your predecessor, without being caught in its shadow. The Irish presidency has passed one crucial legacy to yours: the European constitution. Liberals and Democrats in this House will lead the way in campaigning for the constitution and we expect every one of Europe's governments to be in the vanguard. If we cannot sell it, it was not worth a single glass of Justus Lipsius champagne.</p>
<p class="contents">For the rest of the work that you have set, time is short. With the summer recess and a new Parliament and Commission rushing to find their feet, you must achieve in three-and-a-half months what many presidencies struggle to achieve in six. We look forward to working with the good team that you have in Mr Nicolaï and his colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats in this House welcome your commitment to renewing the economic reform agenda. We agree that the need now is to focus more on better implementation and less on new regulation. The foundation of social cohesion in Europe is a strong and dynamic economy. With careful consideration for the needs of local and regional economies the single European market can be a tide that can lift all of our boats.</p>
<p class="contents">An important part of this is the credibility of the euro and the eurozone. We joined your presidency in welcoming the principle at the heart of last week's ruling by the European Court of Justice that a pact is a pact: that Member States cannot and should not break with impunity the rules they set for themselves. We will be watching closely to see that a rethought Stability Pact can command the respect of big and small states alike.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome your commitment to push ahead on the justice and home affairs agenda. We welcome the launch of a debate on the best way to integrate our migration controls, closing the door to illegal migration while protecting those who justly flee oppression. But we need qualified majority voting and codecision in asylum, immigration and judicial cooperation as provided for in Article 251 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also agrees that Member States have to work together better to tackle terrorism, but we remain suspicious of the Council's intent to employ biometric identifiers widely. Too many of our questions about fallibility, cost-effectiveness and privacy have not been properly answered. You must not pre-empt the decisions of Parliament in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Yours is also the presidency that will oversee the nomination of the new Commission. Last week my group asked the Commission President-designate to commit himself to striving for a better gender balance in the Commission. But in reality this is your job, Mr President-in-Office. Liberals and Democrats in this House want a Commission that is at least one-third women. We might remind you that if the gender balance of the Council reflected that of Europe itself, it would be thirteen to twelve.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a debate on Turkey. Let us have that debate, openly and frankly. What we are committed to is hearing out the Commission when it makes its recommendation in November, and we expect the Council to do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we all agree on the correct level of funding for the European Union over the next seven years, but we do share a commitment to ensuring value for money and focusing on the Union's key priorities. If this presidency can publish guidelines and principles for the negotiations in December we will have the basis for an intelligent debate on future financial perspectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Liberals and Democrats share your realism, but we hope it comes with a ballast of ambition and vision. You must decide on questions which will define the future of our Union. Mr President-in-Office. We are relying on your leadership to keep this ship afloat and keep it steaming, just as impressively as Manet's 'Steamboat Leaving Boulogne', which is on show at the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam.</p>

<p class="contents">On the first point, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance remains extremely worried, because the figures you insist upon, as when you enthusiastically signed the infamous ‘penny-pinchers’ letter’ or attacked the Commission for daring to propose that the budget for the Union of 25 should reach the monstrous level of 1.14% of Europe’s GDP, just do not add up.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree on the need to reopen the debate on the European Union’s spending priorities. We should like to be able to support a proposal of yours to eliminate agricultural export subsidies or to re-examine certain monumental and costly trans-European network projects.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not by aiming at making savings indiscriminately that the European economic system can be made ecologically and socially sustainable and also competitive. You yourself seem to admit as much when you speak of the need to give the European economy a boost by encouraging employment, innovation and research. You also used the word sustainability, a very fashionable term these days but one that for many has very little substance. Even so, there will be a lot to do over the next six months to encourage not only producers but also governments to make economically sustainable decisions. For instance, greater effort could be put into implementing the Kyoto Protocol, standing up to the pressures from the chemical industry on the Reach directive, truly enhancing the action plan for environmental technology, cutting aircraft fuel subsidies, or re-examining the Bolkenstein directive. Mr President, we shall meet again in six months’ time to judge how sustainable your Presidency has been.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in relation to Turkey, we support your approach and are delighted that you have stated that Islam in itself is not a topic of debate for its accession. This statement is particularly significant to us because it comes from a leading Christian Democrat. Perhaps you can make a contribution to this discussion in other countries too. In this you can certainly count on our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is precisely the main thrust of your actions over the next six months that will show our fellow citizens to what extent Europe has listened to the message that the European people have sent it.</p>
<p class="contents">The social partners, and in particular those who will be meeting in October at the European Social Forum in London, will certainly pay close attention to the three principal issues which you yourself, as well as Mr Prodi, have just mentioned, and which my group would like to put on the agenda right now.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all there is the draft directive on the liberalisation of services, known as the ‘Bolkestein Directive’, which you described as a step in the right direction. At the heart of this text, however, lies the principle of the law of the country of origin, by virtue of which the social law of the supplier country would apply everywhere. That would leave the door open to all kinds of abuse involving social dumping. The perverse system of flags of convenience would thus apply to more than half of all economic activity. For that reason, we see this text as unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, there is the reform of the Stability and Growth Pact. As far as reform is concerned, at this stage we have still not managed to put an end to our obsession with reducing public and social expenditure, or even to the 3% myth. On the contrary, and even worse, there is talk of the reform having a hidden face, with particularly severe treatment for those States with a pay-as-you-go system, which would be treated the same as hidden indebtedness. We must be aware that such a measure would give rise to strong public disapproval in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the revision of the Lisbon Strategy. The working party chaired by Mr Kok is due to submit its report in October, but you are already calling for more flexibility and deregulation, as a way of helping countries with a very low level of social acquis. We would urge you to beware of the temptation to make a headlong dash towards liberalism. Even the Commission, in its report to the European Council in March, admitted, in its own way, the failure of that strategy, which was supposed to lead the Union into full employment and an economy of dynamic growth by the year 2010. I would also like to add that the very restrictive measures which you have outlined regarding asylum seekers, migrants and refugees, as well as your vision of the WTO negotiations, are also certain to give rise to legitimate debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, Mr President-in-Office, we are waiting to see what the Dutch Presidency will do. See you in September. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The theme of this Presidency is innovation. Now we have a new Parliament; soon there will be a new Commission. In this connection, we ought to focus on the challenge that this entails rather than the threat emanating from excessive aspirations. Many new people with fresh ideas bring with them a wind of change, and that is what we need, for the public are still not excited by the European Union and the European institutions. Despite this, if everything goes well, they are the ones that really matter in all of this. All those good intentions, though, have led to an endless stream of regulations, and it is unclear which of them we really need. That is why I applaud the fact that the Presidency is prepared to work on keeping objectives realistic and in tune with the expectations of Europe’s citizens. How does the President-in-Office of the Council intend to achieve that? The Presidency wants to devote attention to a possible temporary application of parts of the so-called Constitution. In so doing, is the Presidency not running ahead of the ratification process, which also involves referendums? Are we, then, still taking our citizens seriously? After all, we take complete freedom of choice between a yes and no to this Constitution as a basic assumption. Another thorny issue is the position of Turkey. Will there be a serious assessment of the question of whether Turkey meets the Copenhagen criteria, or is it the case that, after 40 years of promises, we cannot do anything but say yes, even though we should, in actual fact, say no? What is the President-in-Office of the Council’s opinion about recent statements by some Heads of Government who apparently no longer need such an assessment and already know that everything is in order with Turkey’s application? The human rights situation in the world remains worrying. In large parts of the world, intolerance, repression and exploitation are more the rule than the exception. A chilling illustration of this is the religious law that was adopted yesterday in Sri Lanka and which, in effect, bans evangelising on pain of a long prison sentence. Are you prepared to take up this serious infringement of religious freedom with the Sri Lankan Government? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should, however, like to make a few recommendations. Firstly, it is true that enlargement of the European Union with ten new Member States has made it even stronger globally than ever before and particularly as regards such matters as trade policy and coordination of development. Therefore we expect that when leading and possibly completing negotiations on Russia's admission to the World Trade Organisation, the Dutch Presidency will be successful in getting Russia to lift its discriminatory tariff policy on transit cargo, in particular by rail, which Russia continues to impose on the European Union Member State, Latvia. Secondly, the Presidency's wish to ensure the safety of energy supplies in a liberalised market is commendable, therefore the Council wishes to intensify talks with Russia on the compatibility of electricity and natural gas pipelines. One should, however, bear in mind that Latvia has experience in cooperating with Russia regarding energy supplies – unfortunately Russia does not always operate according to market principles. Thirdly, the Dutch Government justifiably refers to its wealth of experience in matters of human rights as Chair of the OSCE. In your opinion that would allow you to carry on negotiations with Russia and tackle conflict situations. We should, however, like to inform you that despite Latvia having met all of the OSCE's recommendations, this does not prevent Russia from continuing to exert pressure on Latvia and Estonia supposedly on matters of human rights, but for an entirely different purpose – to legalise the consequences of occupation. Be vigilant in your work and I wish the Dutch Presidency every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only because your Cabinet appears divided over that issue; you will meet with very heavy pressure to assess Turkey not on the basis of meeting the Copenhagen criteria, but merely on the basis of the progress it has made to date. As you talked about a strict application of the criteria laid down in 2002, I can now only hope that you will put your money where your mouth is. It is, in any case, clear that Turkey failed to meet the prescribed criteria yesterday, fails to meet them today and will fail to meet them in December too. You spoke a moment ago about the people of Europe whom this is all about. Well, it should be possible for those people to have their say about an essential, fundamental issue such as the accession of a non-European country to the European Union. A country that, in some 20 years, will not only boast the largest surface area within this Union, but also the highest population. A country whose accession would constitute a financial and social drain and would set in motion a new and massive wave of immigration. Are you convinced that this is backed by democratic support? It also remains to be seen whether we should give much credence to a Turkish Prime Minister who claims he will respect the lay state and democracy but who, a few years ago, was still making statements along the lines of ‘the mosques are our barracks, the minarets our bayonets, the domes our helmets and the believers our soldiers’. Indeed, we should think very carefully about how consistent this is with our European values. The European Constitution will prompt a referendum in various Member States. If we want to avoid the people in Europe turning away from the European Union even more, we must keep this referendum linked to the issue of the Turkish application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Balkenende can, and must, provide considerable impetus in vital areas. In so doing, the Council itself will need to develop and apply new and effective working methods. This is necessary so as to ensure that the progress of the Union of 25 is not at a snail’s pace. In the same spirit, the Council needs to approve the European Parliament’s new statute rather than standing in its way. Democratic transparency is what the public expects from us, and rightly so. I should like to hear from Mr Balkenende how he intends to give the necessary signals in terms of approach and communication. From my own experience as a national member of parliament, I know how capable he is of forceful policy and of perseverance in his policy, even if that is unpopular or even controversial. That is why we can rely on his political vision and his ability to do what is needed. His speech yesterday in Berlin, in which he paid tribute to Count Klaus von Stauffenberg, was another illustration of this. The President-in-Office of the Council was right to make an actual link between the civil and moral courage and conviction of Stauffenberg and his sympathisers and the chance of reconciliation which Europe was given following liberation. It is in the same spirit that we must now also do what is needed following the liberating enlargement to 25 Union partners. What is to be done? Europe must be more visible. Rather than deny that its public image is that of a complex Moloch, it is important to change it in a concrete manner. Europe should, together, dare to address the big questions of this time, which directly affect each citizen. These range from a coherent and humane asylum policy that immediately tackles human trafficking, to a united stand against worldwide terrorism. This requires concrete action and the exchange of information and signals for citizens’ safety, and one clear line must be adopted in tackling criminals and their networks, including in relation to the drugs trade, across the national borders. In the context of credibility, I agree that no fresh requirements should be added in respect of candidate Member States such as Turkey. Instead, we must hold firm to the requirements already laid down in the Copenhagen framework and not yield to any pressure regarding these. If we Christian Democrats want to ensure that the community of values is not a pious platitude but an item on the daily agenda, we must specify what lines common and concrete policies must take. Also in terms of the economy, the document by Mr Kok, our ex-Prime Minister, would be ambiguous; I therefore expect clear proposals of their own from the Council and the Commission and essential action points in order to give the Lisbon agenda a shot in the arm. There is every reason to ask a great deal from this Presidency in those areas. Mr Balkenende has been graced with a huge opportunity and with much energy and decisiveness, and of those to whom much is given, much may be expected. Mr Balkenende knows that, in terms of decisiveness, he can count on the complete confidence and support of MEPs, myself included. We have every confidence in the personal vision, attention and decisiveness of this President-in-Office of the Council, and we wish him every success.</p>

Your European Affairs Minister has asked us, above all, to lead the political debate. As European Socialists, we gladly take on this challenge. You spoke about modernisation, competition with the US and Asia, and about achieving the Lisbon objectives. We Socialists fear that, with those enticing words, you intend to do something quite different in fact, namely to press Europe into the conservative corner. While a few years ago, enormous efforts were being made to combat unemployment by reducing working hours and introducing job sharing, there is now all of a sudden talk of extending the working hours and you mention shorter holidays. What is so modern about that? Whereas we used to concern ourselves with job quality, care for the workplace, the prevention of illnesses and accidents at the workplace with a European-wide regulation, you now talk about deregulation. Have, along with this, the objectives of higher labour participation and lower absenteeism through illness disappeared? We used to talk about more flexibility within the labour market with greater legal protection; you are now talking about deregulating that protection. It therefore seems that your objective of abolishing the administrative burden is more of an excuse for abolishing certain social and administrative achievements. At the same time, you fail to address the European tendering rules that are throttling the small and medium-size companies. Whereas we used to talk about investing 3% of the GDP per Member State in research and education, areas where, incidentally, the Netherlands has so far been lagging behind badly, you now only talk about the Stability Pact, economising and holding firm to the deficit of 3% maximum, without making resources and scope available for holding just as firm to 3% investment in research and education. This is something I would have liked to have seen fought out before the Court of Justice. In all fairness, the Kok report on ‘work, work, work’ would take this really seriously. Whereas in 2000, we used to talk about high-quality public provisions not only in infrastructure, you now talk about liberalising and privatising the service sector, which involves electricity, health care and public transport. Are you actually prepared to stop those disastrous proposals by Mr Bolkestein to liberalise the services? After all, they would enable Poles to offer their services in the Netherlands at Polish prices without being subject to prices current in our country, and this would, in fact, lead to social dumping. To the Social Democrats, it appears that the Lisbon agenda is being used to your advantage to adopt a hard conservative economic agenda, under the guise of modernisation. In our opinion, you are turning back the clock and refusing to create jobs that require brains and to commit to quality, research, education and high-quality public services. We fear that, as a result, unemployment will increase in Europe, that the weaker members of society will pick up the tab of the cost-cutting measures and that you, with your candidate Mr Barroso, are not going about things the right way if we want to win the fight against Asia and the US. We are throwing down the gauntlet before the debate.

A fellow member of the council, who is now well known in Europe and to you, once entertained us about what he referred to as the paradox of the mediocre brass band. To cut a long story short, the conductor of such a mediocre brass band had a dual task. He had to ensure that the players started and finished simultaneously. What happened in the middle was not that relevant. Mr President, an analogy with the Council of Ministers urges itself upon us. The programme of the Netherlands Presidency is good. I really mean this. Moreover, I am delighted that, following his somewhat qualified rhetoric during the election campaign, Mr van den Berg has simply continued on the old-fashioned Socialist path.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I think your programme is a realistic one. Unlike some other presidencies, you do not underestimate your task, but then you face a different challenge. The European elections have demonstrated that voters are not only indifferent, as you quite rightly pointed out; they are also outraged by the European institutions. People say that things cannot go on the way they are. It is not good enough that, for example, the Council’s brass band starts and finishes at the same time; the tune should also be worth listening to. This should, in fact, also be of concern to Parliament and the Commission. Europe must regain a human dimension. I am pleased with what you had to say on the matter, for I have not heard this enough in the Council so far. If you succeed in this, your Presidency will be successful in my view, and I wish you every success in this endeavour.</p>

I should really like to warmly welcome the President-in-Office of the Council to the European Parliament. In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Balkenende has appointed himself as the man of standards and values and, in Europe too, he is keen to seize upon the Presidency as a means of having a debate on European standards and values, which I welcome. I just hope that the debate does not turn out to be a vague and insipid discussion. My group would be in favour of measuring asylum policy against the yardstick of decency. For example, the Dutch insisted that the European directive on asylum procedures, which the Justice Ministers adopted in May, should allow asylum seekers to be deported before the final outcome of their appeal procedure. If that were to be the case, they could follow the appeal procedure via video conferencing, provided, of course, that they had not, in the meantime, been put into prison in their country of origin. That would be as good as useless and would also be completely at odds with international standards. I can say that my group will be proposing to the European Parliament that this directive be nullified before the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I do, though, also want to congratulate the Netherlands Presidency. I have, at any rate, understood that countries where referendums will be held about the European Constitution have been asked to keep those dates as close to each other as possible. That is really an excellent initiative, but it would be even better if an actual Europe-wide referendum were to be held. I would therefore ask the Netherlands Presidency in any case to make the necessary arrangements. An important advantage of the Constitution is that the Council of Ministers’ legislative meetings will from now on be held in public, something about which I am delighted. It is also absurd, of course, that at the moment, laws are still being adopted behind closed doors. There is absolutely nothing that stops you from introducing public access today. My group would therefore urge the Netherlands Presidency to throw open the doors, allowing citizens to follow the discussions and their governments’ voting behaviour from today.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would like to mention the Stability Pact. It becomes inevitable that the Stability Pact’s future is at risk. We need a smarter Pact that is less fixated on the annual budgetary balance and, instead, makes greater use of long-term indicators, such as public debt and pension duties. The Commission has already tabled some suggestions in this connection, and it remains to be seen whether the Dutch Government will take decisive action in this area. I do indeed hope that it will.</p>

It embraces the now outmoded illusions of the Lisbon Summit in 2000, which assumed that before 2010, Europe would be able to beat the United States and Japan in a competitive battle by making things as bad here as they already are over there. It has meanwhile transpired that the resources for education for the benefit of the expected knowledge economy are insufficient. The drawbacks of Lisbon may have become more visible by now, but the much touted benefits have not. The same is true of the Stability Pact. Without acting contrary to democracy, the 3% standard is becoming increasingly unfeasible. The Netherlands is increasingly being seen as the Goody Two-Shoes of the European Union and NATO due to its requirement of stricter compliance with the Stability Pact, its contracting-out of public transport to international companies, its introduction of longer working hours, Commissioner Bolkestein’s pressure for a service directive and its continuing military involvement in the American protectorate of Iraq, which is drawing the terrorist threat closer to Europe. I sometimes hear other Member States remark that it would be good if the Netherlands left the European Union, because that country has become the motor behind the lamentable aspiration for restricting public expenditure and disposing of public provisions. That aspiration involves exchanging hallmarks of European civilisation for America’s tough and ruthless system. If Mr Balkenende wants to transform the whole of Europe in this way, he will bring about major social conflict, because public opinion is heading in a different direction. Although the Lisbon Summit has decided to dispose of public services, this Parliament subsequently decided, at my proposal and by a large majority, to dispense with this requirement concerning public transport. Instead of striving for unbridled economic growth at the expense of social security, public services and the environment, it is preferable to keep taxes to an adequate level and seek a redistribution of national and European income for the benefit of the weakest and of useful community tasks, and also for the benefit of integrating immigrants and removing poverty and despair in the world, which are still providing a continuous breeding ground for terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Dutch presidency is going to push for the reinsurance directive. It is going to push for the third money laundering directive. It is going to push for the capital requirements directive and much, much more.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial services is Britain's biggest and most successful industry. All of this agenda is nothing less than a disaster for the City of London, and it is a policy of beggar thy neighbour because the businesses of investment and insurance is not going to move from London to Frankfurt or Paris: it is going to be forced outside the European Union. It is going to move to the offshore centres. Frankly this is a deliberate policy that is being pursued by the European Union year after year after year, and it is costing my country a great deal of money.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I do admire your sense of humour because you are still banging on about the Lisbon Agenda. Do you remember that - the great proclamation a few years ago that we were going to create the high-tech, dynamic economy with full employment? Here we are half way through the programme and we see high unemployment, sclerotic growth and not a cat's chance in hell of any of the Lisbon Agenda being realised.</p>
<p class="contents">And then you want to renegotiate Britain's rebate and we will lose a further GBP 2 billion a year! This is all so bad that it is really very good because the genie of public opinion is now firmly out of the bottle. We know that this is a political project. Frankly what I would like you to do is to press this programme as aggressively as you can because you will make the British public and the public in many other Member States so furious that when we get our chance in these ten referendums we will say no and we will say it loudly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to begin by referring to the Irish Presidency. It proved a historic Presidency, because it saw the enlargement of the European Union through the accession of ten new Member States. That was a momentous event for the new Member States and indeed for the Union as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of the draft of the new Constitution also fell within the Irish Presidency. During the coming presidencies, these drafts will be considered. They will be debated at European Union level and in all the Member States. I believe it is important to make it clear at the outset that a full assessment will only be possible after the new Constitution has been endorsed. But to achieve this, several concerns must first be addressed. In a number of countries notably my own, Poland, very large sections of public opinion are gravely concerned by the decision to omit all reference to God and to Christianity from the preamble. There is concern too about Union legislation taking precedence over national legislation in certain fields. The change in the voting system presents a further difficulty. We cannot agree to it. There is also the matter of the unfair advantages granted to the eastern German <span class="italic">Länder</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Montesquieu said that local legislation and traditions must be respected when establishing central legislation. There is much talk about bringing the Union closer to the people. It is important to give very careful consideration to the implications of increased centralisation of the European Union and of extending the economic competence of the central bodies of the European Union. In theory, the principle of mutual support must always be applied. Will this actually be the case in practice? Will Montesquieu’s warnings be heeded as the Union gradually strengthens its central bodies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Dutch Presidency has set out a programme for us which is also a challenge, namely the signing of the European Union Constitutional Treaty. As a member of the European Convention, I can guarantee that this Treaty contains the basic principles for a future strong and prosperous Europe. As we look to the future, I feel it is incumbent on me to mention some of the steps taken by the Slovak Republic in the past. This very month sees the 12th anniversary of the signing by the Slovak parliament of the declaration of sovereignty of the Slovak Republic. This was the first step in the creation of an independent Slovak state. The second step was the adoption of the Constitution of the Slovak Republic on 1 September 1992. This period culminated in November 1992 with the peaceful division of the Czechoslovak federation into two independent states – the Czech and Slovak republics. I can assure you that despite this separation of their states, relations between Czechs and Slovaks have improved substantially. The foundation of the Slovak Republic was a step towards the EU and it was my own party, the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, led by Mr Meciar, which submitted the application of the Slovak Republic to join the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore regard our current membership of the EU as the fulfilment of our goals, our ideas and our programme. We are interested not only in the removal of borders that hinder the free movement of individuals, but also in overcoming the separation between Old and New Europe or, as I heard it referred to yesterday, the separation between Western and Eastern Europe. The three Members representing the HZDS, the movement for a democratic Slovakia, Mr Kozlík, Mr Baco and myself, are working in the Group of Non-attached Members, but I would like to assure you that our efforts will be directed towards the building of a future Europe that is both prosperous and ever more closely unified. We support the steps taken by the Dutch Presidency and the programme that has been presented to us. Thank you.</p>
