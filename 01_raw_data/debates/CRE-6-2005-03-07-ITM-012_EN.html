Our two readings have spanned approximately a year, and in that respect we might say that Parliament has worked as fast as it has been able to, given the current arrangement. We have achieved a satisfactory end result, and that is due to the excellent levels of cooperation shown by the various political groups.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I would have liked the regulation to include two important issues, which are now absent from it. When access to the natural gas networks is discussed at the Madrid Forum among all the stakeholders, I would have liked the Commission to continue to listen to all parties involved in the future when a proposal for a regulation is being amended or added to. The inclusion of such an article in the text did not succeed for legal reasons. The judicial services of all three Institutions, the Council, the Commission and Parliament, were of the opinion that the drafting of legislation should take place by means of the comitology procedure, and no hearing of any external agency can be written into the legal text itself. A wise Commission, having a monopoly in the presentation of laws compared to the Council and Parliament, will surely allow the Madrid Forum to remain a cohesive entity and will listen intently to all its interested parties. I therefore expect the Commission representative to assure us of this in this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The other matter regarding which I would have liked to add my own article to the regulation concerns the storage of gas. Preserving the storage monopolies will prevent the full-scale use of the networks for the benefit of all stakeholders and weaken competition in the market. As transmission networks are needed to carry gas from one country to another, the gas market can only operate effectively if the same pipelines can carry gas sold by a large number of producers and purchased by a large number of consumers. The shared use of the networks, which is to say access to the networks, is therefore important. As the price of gas has risen in some Member States this winter in a way that is out of proportion with trends in other countries, the Commission should explain what is at issue here.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament we are pleased that in the final stage of the second reading we have been able to present some proposals for the improvement of the Council’s common position, which we expect the Council to adopt. Our objective in Parliament has been that this regulation should enter into force as quickly as possible. Hopefully, it will help to persuade certain Member States to honour the commitments that, on the one hand, they have made to safeguard access to gas networks, but which, on the other, they have not put into effect. We think it is important that this regulation should enter into force as speedily as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thanks to the constructive approach of the rapporteur, Mr Seppänen, and his colleagues in all the political groups in Parliament, we arrived at a text that will bring about the desired results. For this, I would like to thank you all. Your commitment to this legislative proposal has ensured not only the quality of the text but also rapid and efficient treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The regulation, once effective, will provide a level playing field for conditions for access to the gas transmission networks across the whole European market, hence completing a crucial element of the Internal Gas Market Directive. Non-discriminatory and transparent conditions for access to the grid are essential if competition is to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has played a crucial role in the whole process. Most of the amendments adopted at first reading have been accepted by both the Council and the Commission. It is, therefore, safe to say that the European Parliament has already made its mark on the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Now we are close to finalising the legislative process, again with a recommendation amending the text of the common position. The Commission can fully accept the outcome of the compromise between the European Parliament and the Council. Its results finally pave the way for adoption of the regulation by the Council and thus add an important piece of legislation to the legal framework establishing the internal market for gas.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware that some of you would have liked to go further by including access to storage in the scope of the regulation. Like Parliament, the Commission attaches great importance to this issue. However, I am absolutely sure that this regulation would not be the right place to address such an important topic.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions on a voluntary agreement on guidelines for non-discriminatory conditions for access to storage facilities are nearing a successful conclusion. Such an agreement would be the most efficient way to bring about rapid improvements to the market from 1 April 2005, on condition that the industry sticks to the provisions of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that both the regulators and the Commission will closely monitor the implementation of these guidelines. Further action will be taken in due course if appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I would encourage you to adopt the recommendation submitted by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, as this represents the best way to promote our common objectives: a well-functioning internal market for gas, to the benefit of the consumers and the competitiveness of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add that the Commission will continue to consult all the stakeholders and the experience we have had with the Madrid Forum has been extremely successful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The object has been to give people in Europe the opportunity to exercise free choice as regards access to gas suppliers, with a wide range of services on offer, and to open up the market. We have attempted to define the framework conditions that will be required if this is to be achieved: the calculations of rates to be made public, the calculation of costs to be transparent, and wide-ranging requirements for information on the part of the network operators. All these things will play a quite central role.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there must of course be balance, and that is what we have endeavoured to bring about. Those who run the networks must be able to see that their interests are being safeguarded. There is no point in imposing conditions so stringent that all the network operators lose interest. Here, I think we have been smart in striking a balance by opening up the market and offering consumers new opportunities, while also, at the same time, keeping the operation of gas networks economically interesting. Who else is meant to do it?</p>
<p class="contents">We took as the basis for our deliberations the voluntary agreements and guidelines for best practice agreed on in Madrid in 2003. I think it was astute of us to build on a consensus of this kind, and so I agree with Mr Seppänen that it will be helpful to bear that in mind when voting on subsequent developments. Like the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats as a whole, I take the view that this means it was a good thing that we did not have this Regulation make reference to the storage of gas, on which there was as yet no consensus, and I am not persuaded either that there are any compelling reasons for there to be a legal regime on this. Voluntary agreements are preferable where they are in place. Not everything has to be adopted and made binding in law, and we should wait and see how this process progresses from now on in.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the gas market should be allowed a certain amount of time in which to develop. This presupposes that the national governments transpose what we specify into law. Only after a period of time has elapsed will it be possible to assess the regulation’s effectiveness, and so I ask that we, once we have adopted it today, allow that to happen and then review the way the situation develops. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has, though, indeed been a really complex business, and one that Mr Seppänen has handled outstandingly well. The debate has not, of course, only just started; we and a number of other Members already know each other from the previous Parliament and were there for the first reading, which was already complicated enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has now joined Parliament in adopting many of the things that we debated at first reading stage – initially with some acrimony – and then accepted, and we can actually be content with that. It just so happens, though, that new parliaments bring with them new people, with new ideas and new proposals. Our new Members did, of course, have new ideas, and the fact that a compromise had very largely already been reached with the Council meant that it was very difficult to take these on board. I know that Mr Seppänen was already in favour of our adopting the Commission proposal and the Council position without significant amendment, and so he has done a good job of getting Parliament’s interests across and successfully negotiating their acceptance by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will come to the point, though: neither on the energy market nor any other do we want competition for the sake of it, but we are well aware that competition is in fact a suitable means whereby a common market’s efficiency gains really can be maximised. This common market and the exploitation of these efficiency gains demand that we open up the national market segments and turn them into a single internal market in energy, and hence require transparent and discrimination-free access to the networks. We see this Regulation as making provision for the enactment of more specific, detailed and binding guidelines, thereby complementing the 2003 internal market directive on the complete opening-up of the gas markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, this Regulation is meant to bring in more explicit requirements with regard to transparency, also requiring network operators to offer third parties services providing access to the network and, in particular, less ambiguous structures for tariffs. It is this tariff structure that is essential if competitors are to enjoy transparent and discrimination-free access when using the networks, for such networks are monopolistic by nature, and it is only by regulating access to them that we will be able to get them under control and make them transparent and non-discriminatory. That is why it was important, in one instance that I want to draw to your particular attention, for us to again tighten up the common position on the tariff structure, having already got many other points accepted. The fact is that it is not sufficient to ensure that the tariffs laid down include relatively abstract efficiency incentives. Tariffs must be measured against the benchmark of the costs of an efficient network operator with a comparable structure; this is what this House devised and got accepted for cross-border trade in electricity, and it is also suited to the gas networks. That being so, it should be generally supported in the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wish to underline the importance of the directive concerning the completion of the internal market for gas. The directive, which was adopted last year, lays down fair and detailed rules for access to Member States’ gas transmission networks by third parties, taking account of the individual nature of national and regional markets.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the directive is analogous to the one on grid access for cross-border trade in electricity. It is important to bear in mind that the proposal has been drawn up on the basis of voluntary agreements made within the European Gas Regulatory Forum, which will become binding through this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The main changes introduced by the Council concern the guidelines referred to in Article 9, which have been reduced in scope, and the removal of the Commission’s power to adopt new guidelines through the committee procedure and its power to amend the guidelines laid down in the annexes. The guidelines concern third party access services, principles of capacity allocation mechanisms, congestion management procedures and transparency requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also inserted a new paragraph in Article 9 clarifying the differences between national gas networks, which must be reflected in the guidelines, in their implementation and in future amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the Council has put back the date for the regulation to enter into force from 1 July 2005 to 1 July 2006, except for Article 9(2), which will enter into force six months later.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my group, I should like to express our satisfaction at the agreement reached with the Council, even though at a personal level I should have preferred it if the Council and Commission regulation had also covered the need to regulate access to storage facilities. Ten per cent of our reserves have been used up in Italy during this very cold spell, and I therefore think it appropriate to mention this aspect as well, and also the cushioning effect that storage has on prices. In any case, I trust the Commission will also be willing to regulate this area soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Where gas is concerned, though, it will have scarcely any effect. Why is this so? There are two main reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, let us consider the producers, who, as far as we are concerned, at present comprise only Russia, Norway and Algeria, an oligopoly which determines what goes on in the gas market, and a market force which, for example, allows 90% of the price of gas in Europe to be tied to oil. Economically speaking, there is no reason why this should be so; it is about pure market clout, or, to put it with brutal frankness, it is nothing more than a rip-off. There is no sign of the producers competing among themselves; what is the use of regulating what happens down-stream, if, upstream, there is nothing more than an oligopoly made up of the Big Three. The situation is similar to that at a weekly market, where, if there are more strawberries, the price drops, and so, taking that as an example, the Russians ought to bring more gas onto the world market and start to compete with the Norwegians, thereby bringing the price down, but they will not do that of their own free will and accord. This is where the Council and the Commission must act!</p>
<p class="contents">It is the major national and international distributors who constitute the second obstacle, while our present measures affect mainly the small ones. Who, for example, supplies gas to a medium-sized town’s power network in Germany? The Russians would laugh themselves to death if a German town wanted to buy power directly from Gazprom and have the stuff delivered straight to it. This is where it is cause for concern that Europe’s major electricity providers are now also the main suppliers of gas.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want competition and liberalisation, then the industry must not be structured vertically, with everything, from extraction to the last distributor, being in the same pair of hands. We have to be active in preventing, for example, the Big Four in Germany forming themselves into a vertical and even broader structure and buying out all the smaller and medium-sized distributors.</p>
<p class="contents">Both in Italy, with its ENEL and ENI, and in France with GDF and EDF, exactly the same thing happens. In a business defined by network pipelines, there must be distributors who are independent of the major producers. Nothing else makes any sense in a field like this, in which capital links are detrimental to competition.</p>
<p class="contents">As good as they may be, our efforts today will, unfortunately, be largely without effect if we do not face up to these challenges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are also big differences in the conditions for access among the transmission system operators. Unfair conditions of access to the gas network are a hindrance to the market’s function in this sector. The internal market will not function without minimum standards regarding third party access to the network. We have to create non-discriminatory conditions for competition and make sure that everyone complies with the new guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate my colleague, Mr Seppänen, who has done much hard work to get this regulation through as quickly as possible, which was our objective. This regulation will test how willing the Member States really are to give priority to the Lisbon objectives. It is no wonder that the rapporteur had to engage in long and arduous debate with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Now one aspect of opening up the energy markets to competition that would benefit consumers in many Member States hangs in the balance, at least for the time being. Moreover, for too long certain big Member States have been ignoring internal market rules. As a result, their energy giants, protected from competition as they are, have been able to charge consumers higher prices and use the extra profits, for example, to buy out smaller competitors that are in a more difficult situation owing to the competition than those which evade it. The Union needs to show determination and open up all areas of the energy sector to fair competition, and that includes the natural gas transmission networks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very important piece of legislation which I hope will be adopted. This crucial piece of legislation on conditions for access to natural gas transmission networks is needed for the internal market to function.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards access to storage facilities, I would again like to draw to your attention that we will soon have a voluntary agreement on guidelines for non-discriminatory access conditions to storage facilities, and if necessary further action will be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Caspary touched on some important issues. This regulation represents one of the steps needed to create the right conditions for the internal market in energy. The Commission is doing a lot in this respect. We are trying to diversify sources and this will definitely make for changes as regards price policies.</p>
<p class="contents">By the end of this year the Commission will produce a report analysing the situation in the energy market, which will be prepared in conjunction with the competition authorities. This will enable us to address the questions you have raised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would again like to stress that the major progress made on this regulation can be attributed to the way in which it was prepared. The Madrid Forum has proved to be extremely successful, which is why access to storage should be handled in the same way. I wish to thank Parliament and the rapporteur for the good work done in preparing this piece of legislation on the energy market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
