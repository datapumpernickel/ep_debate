<p class="contents">The question of healthy food has given rise to a great deal of interest and that is not unwarranted if we think about the crises that have hit the food industry over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific dossier we are debating today concerns official controls on food of animal origin. The proposal contains special rules for controls on meat, shellfish, fisheries products and milk and dairy products, but of course the debate focuses on the problem of meat inspections. The proposed system of official controls which are carried out at the fresh meat production stage has the following characteristics:</p>
<p class="contents">First, it is based on scientific data. The official veterinarian has a central role in the overall supervision and inspection system. It consists of official controls of the systems applied by the business itself and official inspection activities. In other words, it concerns both the business and the public authorities. It has espoused the ‘from farm to fork’ approach, it addresses both matters relating to health and the treatment of animals and it concerns the frequency and the intensity of official controls, which are dependent on the risks. I know here that certain Members of the European Parliament will express concern about possible trends towards privatising official controls. I should like to be absolutely categorical about this; there is no such danger. The basic responsibility always lies with the public authorities and the objective is for there to be better allocation of the human resources of the public authorities, depending on the risk presented by the businesses, by which we mean their record of compliance with the rules. Similarly, this system to which I refer, by which I mean official controls, is aligned with the authorities responsible for food legislation in general, especially as regards the question of responsibility, and provision is made for flexibility for small businesses as and where it is needed. Similarly, I should like at this point to refer to the discussions and concerns of Members of the European Parliament about the required flexibility which small businesses need to have in comparison with large businesses, and to say that provision really is being made here for flexibility in relation to traditional methods of food production, businesses in remote areas and the need for structural changes within the businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">To leave the meat area, to which the basic comments I made earlier apply, let us say that the rules relating to shellfish have also been revised on the basis of scientific opinions. These new rules mainly aim to protect consumers from risks associated with the consumption of these products. I shall refer to the proposed amendments in my second intervention at the end of the debate, following the Members' comments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schnellhardt (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span>–<span class="italic"> (DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by thanking those who did such an excellent job of helping me with this report – Members in the political groups, the Commission and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I was pleased to hear the remarks of the Commissioner as well, because they seem to go in the same direction that we wish to take. The proposal for a regulation is an integral and important part of the overall endeavour to improve food safety within the EU, product quality in third countries exporting to the EU and to establish European food legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Its primary aim is to achieve better protection for consumers in relation to food products of animal origin for human consumption, and, as the Commissioner mentioned, the official veterinarian is at the heart of the system of official controls. I think that he has the right technical qualifications and this approach is therefore to be welcomed. The very detailed demands made on official veterinarians will have to lead to changes in study courses in the Member States. They are also necessary to ensure that scientific knowledge can be transposed into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We should however be careful that official veterinarians, who have been carrying out their responsibilities conscientiously for many years, do not have to take more exams as a result of this proposal for a regulation. The veterinarians are assisted by official auxiliaries in carrying out their inspections. For this to work successfully, it is important that both groups of people can work independently.</p>
<p class="contents">Monitoring bodies that are in some way dependent on the business that is being monitored cannot, with the best will in the world, take an independent decision. This is why I am firmly rejecting the idea that the establishment’s own staff can be used or deployed in inspecting the slaughter of pigs and bovine animals in place of official monitors. Ladies and gentlemen of the Commission, you have plainly been guided by financial constraints on this point. We have set out to increase food safety in the EU and with these measures you are going to achieve exactly the opposite, which is why we have to reject them. We should remember that only precise independent findings through official controls focus more on the new concept of national, and ultimately European, risk analysis and are a key element in risk management. This is also the basis upon which the effectiveness of the European Food Safety Authority depends.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is different with the mandatory application of food business operators’ own controls as an element of strengthening their individual responsibility for the wholesomeness and high quality of their products. It should therefore be possible, where there is a reduced risk and own controls are taking place, to restrict official controls to checks on the findings of these own controls. This should be a free decision for the competent authority to take and not compulsory. A risk-based flexible approach in official controls, based on the wholesomeness of the business’s products, should always be the most important factor. This is much better than an approach based on the intensity of production and also serves to strengthen the position of the competent authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are again different when traditional production methods are used on farms with lower production and in outlying geographical areas. Here, the possibility of implementing the regulation is often restricted. Exceptions to the rules should, however, be limited to flexibility in the attendance of an official inspector and the forwarding of information. A reduction in hygiene levels cannot be accepted under any circumstances. The concept of 'from stable to table' is an important basis for a high level of food safety. The effectiveness of the system is dependent upon the quality of information going from the farmer to the shop, but – and I would like particularly to draw your attention to this – also back to the farmer. This is essentially a new approach, one that requires constant emphasis. The information should, however, be limited to criteria that are important for inspection of the slaughter and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Information about medical treatment which does not have food safety implications, for example the administering of iron tablets to piglets, does not have to be provided, reducing the amount of information involved. I think that the greater inclusion of scientific competence in the food production process guarantees that the necessary information is submitted, which may well turn out to be different in each case.</p>
<p class="contents">A contentious issue in the EU until now has always been the number of staff for inspections, particularly in slaughterhouses. I think that we should ask the Commission to make an objective proposal here along the lines of regions and farms. I know that it is very difficult, but it cannot be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that the new approach will, in any case, lead to an improvement in food safety in the EU. I am grateful for the cooperation I have enjoyed, and I thank all of you for your attention.</p>

It is essential for the sake of consumers and, indeed, producers and suppliers that we have a sensible regime for the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to fisheries and aquaculture products, there are some very particular challenges. It may not always be appropriate simply to transpose controls which are designed for farmed animals to fishing and aquaculture products. For example, some of the issues and challenges relating to fish diseases, dioxin levels and so forth are very specific and require regularly updated and verifiable scientific advice on which to base controls and toxin levels.</p>
<p class="contents">Bivalve molluscs by their nature pose particular challenges and perhaps the testing regime for scallops, for example, ought not to be identical to that for mussels or other species. We have to look to species-specific controls in relation to bivalve molluscs. The current proposal in relation to toxin levels was based on studies carried out in Canada and Japan on mussels, and the effects on the scallop industry of the type of controls which have been envisaged could be very significant. We need to look <span class="italic">very</span> carefully at ensuring – for the sake of consumers but also those who depend on these industries for their livelihood – that risk-based measures are imposed which are reasonable in relation to the problems involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although, as I am keen to remind you, the European food chain is one of the world’s safest, we deemed it necessary to take steps to improve traceability and labelling. Admittedly, all the decisions taken testify to the European Parliament’s political will, but they will bring no benefits if they are not correctly applied. What is often lacking in terms of food safety, as in many other areas, is effective control over how existing legislation or regulations are applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Schnellhardt, on the quality of his work in this area, which seeks to set up a rigorous monitoring system for both European and imported products. We will not reap the full benefits of the new concept developed by the European Commission and often discussed in this field, ‘from farm to table’, without continuous, adequate monitoring of the food on the market, from when it is produced to when it is consumed.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to restore consumer confidence, consumers must be able to say to themselves, when they buy meat or any other food, that they need have no qualms about believing the information provided on the product label. Consumers must be able to feel sure that the products they are about to consume are healthy. To achieve this, as the rapporteur has explained, it is essential to develop independent official inspections and also to increase the responsibility of operators in the sector. I would highlight here the role of vets and the vital importance of independent inspections. It is also helpful to show common sense by adopting rules which take into account the size of businesses and do not penalise smallholdings, since this problem occurs with SMEs. I am pleased, therefore, that some such amendments have been adopted, just as I am pleased that the Commissioner has mentioned the flexibility required.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, these changes should not be to the detriment of consumer safety. Effective communication of information and regular updating of lists of accredited establishments will make inspection and coordination between Member States much easier. I believe that the aim of all this is to restore consumer confidence, and the system should ensure that safer products are placed on the market for each and everyone one of us consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start by warmly congratulating the German veterinarians. They have proved outstandingly capable of defending their professional interests. Let me also thank Mr Schnellhardt. In a number of respects I do not agree with his approach, but he has worked openly and conducted consultation in a very pleasant manner. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said of all German veterinarians. There is some misinformation about the content of the proposals in circulation. The question therefore is whether the outcome of the vote today reflects Parliament’s views. To be perfectly clear: I am not speaking now on behalf of my group. Mr Staes has already described it aptly: the flesh is weak. To put it in even stronger terms, part of the meat sector is especially weak when it comes to dealing summarily with abuses itself. Hormones, foreign proteins, water injections, impurities and harmful bacteria – they will all sound familiar to you.</p>
<p class="contents">We have collectively made food safety one of the cornerstones of our mandate. We have succeeded in laying down the general principles of European food safety policy. We have all decided that the producer has primary responsibility for his products. That is a clear and good principle. Today we are taking a decision about the way in which we in Europe organise our system for controlling products of animal origin. In other words, where are we controlling, what are we controlling, and who is doing the controlling? In the light of the general food legislation this question seems easy to answer. The producer ensures that his beef steak, his pork steak and his fillet of chicken are in order and the government takes care of final control.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also wants to offer meat producers, and in particular the pig and calf farms, the scope under strict conditions to accept their responsibility themselves. Part of the meat sector is indeed keen to accept responsibility and itself bring abuses to an end. It is a pity that the rapporteur intends to nullify the opportunity that the Commission’s proposal is presenting. It is of course strange that we first decide to place general responsibility with the producers and that we are now, today, going to reverse it again. For that reason alone I argue against Amendment No 135.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the German veterinarians and the British meat inspectors have still to accustom themselves to the idea that the meat sector can take responsibility for itself. They think that staff of meat farms have no capability or are not in the position to monitor quality. To be honest we think that we must in any event move away from authoritarian farms unwilling to tolerate any criticism of the quality of their products from their employees. But separately from that, I ask everyone to think carefully. The meat sector is a highly regulated and well-controlled sector, but there is no sector that is talked about so often on account of scandals. The BBC recently showed a documentary about abuses in the Dutch poultry sector.</p>
<p class="contents">More government control will unfortunately not help to purge the sector of malpractice. On the contrary, it will be counterproductive, because it removes responsibility from farms. I think that we must place the responsibility with the producer in a way that is recognisable for consumers. I therefore ask you to consider Amendment No 127. We must remove meat from anonymity, for that is the most effective way of improving safety and quality. If pork steak or fillet of chicken are placed on the market under a clear brand name, it is of the greatest importance for the producer to handle meat very carefully. Currently farms that fiddle can carry on regardless, because the consumer has absolutely no idea where his fillet of chicken comes from. Which means that we keep having complaints and incidents. Naming and shaming is an extremely effective way of improving food safety and quality. To be perfectly clear, the individual responsibility of farms does not of course replace public responsibility and public control.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like the meat sector to take a critical look at itself. We must of course take a critical look at ourselves as well. Our way of working is not very transparent. The quantity of amendments is too great and too many of them are simply technical in nature. It is absurd that today we are voting on the position of the health stamp on the rabbit leg, on the testing of meat from hermaphrodite pigs and on the suitability of the udder for human consumption in the event of brucellosis infection. If we fail to concentrate on the political outlines, our work can only be judged by the meat sector and the veterinarians themselves. It is therefore very easy to spread misinformation, but, as this is of no help to the consumer, this is where policy itself comes into play. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are certain small details about which we do not agree, but these are so insignificant that I do not need to list them. I think you have done some incredibly constructive work on all three of these reports, which are technically difficult and which are incredibly important for everyone in Europe. The fact is that we normally eat at least three times a day.</p>
<p class="contents">Scandals crop up again and again. As Mrs Corbey said, adding things to meat is the big thing right now. Water and artificial proteins are injected, as if meat were not protein in itself. In the light of this, there is only one route to go down, and that is one of total openness in our systems. When we come across fraud and when labelling and declarations of content are not in accordance with the contents of the package, we must make the public, that is to say the consumers, aware of the fact. There must be a system of naming and shaming for those businesses that are careless. In financial terms, the EU is at present in danger of benefiting the ‘bad guys’ and penalising the ‘good guys’, and we must be extremely careful not to do this. I shall appeal once more for complete transparency. For example, our ordinary food law is extremely transparent. Let us not therefore be deflected in our course. There is a lot to be said for the view that the best inspector is the person who is to buy and eat the product.</p>
<p class="contents">Clear and focused legislation is needed, because we all know that the real inspections take place on the ground, locally and regionally. Whatever titles and job descriptions the inspectors may have, they need to be backed by very clear and robust legislation that leaves no one in any doubt as to their authority and rights.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to small businesses, I must ask that we turn some of our attention to my own report, which will be appearing shortly and which deals with the costs of the inspections. It is not right to exempt small traditional businesses from the rules governing hygiene. They must, however, be exempted from unduly high costs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has just been said that we have to distinguish between businesses on the basis of size. I would be cautious about this though, as it is a question of transparency rather than size. We talk about creating transparency through the ‘from stable to table’ concept. Well, small businesses are transparent precisely because consumers understand them and have direct contact with them. If something is wrong, they report it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schnellhardt, you write that ‘confidence is good, control is better’. I would agree with this, but nevertheless, confidence has to be discerning. We have to know in whom we can put our trust. The big problem is that meat is marketed anonymously and no one actually understands how. This anonymity is a cover for business deals that are criminal and practices that only just border on legality and of which the consumer would certainly not approve.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard about water with protein being added to chicken in order to sell something cheap at an expensive price, and protein so subverted that it is not possible to detect the DNA or determine from which species of animal it comes. These examples show how the ethics in food consumption – if I may use this expression – are being abused as a result of this anonymity and at the cost of the consumer’s health. And that is why it is a question of increasing not just confidence, but legitimate confidence. This has to do with making consumers more discerning. Of course, producers do have responsibility, and we have talked here about their individual responsibility, but so do consumers, who have to take responsibility for their health by informing themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mathieu (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the key point in food safety is official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, which is the subject of the Schnellhardt report that we are considering today. The four annexes to the regulation concern fresh meat, molluscs, fisheries and milk and milk products. I will just mention the few points that I see as most important.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, regarding primary production, an exception should be entered in the regulation. I think that primary production of foodstuffs for private use, and the direct supply by the producer of small quantities to the final consumer or local shops and restaurants should be considered as traditional food production which should have specific sales rules. I therefore support Amendments Nos 11 and 12 by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Moreover, the competent authorities within each Member State are, in my view, best placed to assess the situation and decide on the restrictions that will best protect consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I also feel it is essential to include the notion of small, traditional establishments in the regulation, allowing sufficient flexibility without endangering or diminishing food safety for consumers. This notion of the small establishment will ensure the survival of the small abattoirs spread evenly across the territory. Let us not, therefore, move towards regulations that are too strict and too difficult to implement, which will lead to the closure of local abattoirs. Maintaining these abattoirs would simplify matters as there would be no need to legislate on maximum distances and times for transporting livestock heads by lorry. Let us be honest: the only way we are going to make progress is by shortening the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, it is important to compensate the producers and farmers who achieve better results when assessed by granting them a reduction in the costs arising from official controls. This should not, of course, be done to the detriment of food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The approval of establishments is another difficult question. Who should be responsible for it? Should it be at Community level or national level? Where does subsidiarity fit in? I prefer the option of dual responsibility, which would oblige the Member States to keep an up to date list of approved establishments, while putting forward their own national regulations on controls. However, I think it would be counter-productive for the Commission to oblige the Member States to provide the names of the establishments in a single electronic format. It is sufficient for the Member States to exchange lists. There is also no justification for administrative sanctions for failures to comply with the hygiene principles. Administrative closures of abattoirs and publishing sanctions are solely the responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The thorny issue of imports of products of animal origin from third countries is effectively dealt with. The Member States will have a list of approved, inspected and certified establishments, taking into account the hygiene, production and storage rules applied in the third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, however, more concerned regarding animal welfare, which should not come before food safety, and regarding the pre-eminent role of the inspecting vet. I think that official assistant vets should be able to take part in ante mortem inspections in abattoirs. This is already the case in France and I do not see why this should be questioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the rapporteur on Amendments Nos 111 to 114 on game, which propose the analysis of residues not resulting from the actual hunting process.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the subject of game, I do, however, have reservations regarding the Commission’s proposal, and in particular the presence of aged open fractures. In principle, if they are aged, these fractures are no longer open, and are therefore healed. There are no longer any risks in terms of food.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, regarding the formation of gas in the gastro-intestinal tract, you will be aware that hunters eviscerate the game immediately as a food safety precaution and I do not see how the inspecting or official vet can therefore monitor the presence of gas in the gastro-intestinal tract.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the presence of the listed parasites that are dangerous to health, I think that it would be good to attach the list as an annex, in order to prevent difficulties with interpretation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Adequate food controls are important in order to guarantee the greatest possible protection of consumers. They ensure the safety, for example, of raw meat, game, molluscs, milk and dairy products. In future, therefore, food producers and processors will have to reveal all the different steps involved in their work. Details will have to be noted about the feedingstuffs used and the state of health of the animals. It will then be possible to trace food and its component parts back to the place of origin, in accordance with the transparent production chain. This is the only way for food authorities to react faster when there is a problem or to detect shortcomings in quality as soon as possible and to remove them. In the Commission’s proposal, it is emphasised that small- and medium-sized enterprises are most affected, and, for them, the new hygiene rules represent a huge burden. The increase in expenditure will, however, result in a significant increase in food safety for the consumer, provided that the demands on businesses are bearable and affordable.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, the rapporteur and I have jointly tabled some amendments, which take into consideration the flexibility that is essential for artisanal small businesses without, however, reducing the hygiene requirements. I think it is important that these artisanal small businesses should be recognised in the definition of the Regulation. We do have large slaughterhouses in Europe, but we also have a host of small butcher’s shops. That is why there has to be some flexibility to adapt official controls to the size of the business. Inspecting a large slaughterhouse, in which thousands of animals are slaughtered and processed on a daily basis, is in nature and intensity different to inspecting an artisanal small business, in which fewer animals are processed. There also has to be flexibility with regard to the frequency of controls on smaller businesses. We need a rule stipulating when a business is to be inspected and by whom. An inspection plan from the competent authorities, which has been preceded by a risk analysis, should be sufficient. Health-based requirements should only be involved if they are actually relevant for people’s health.</p>
<p class="contents">What I expect from this Regulation is greater individual responsibility for producers and processors. European consumers will benefit directly from this. However, I am also very concerned that we, as legislators, should give consideration to the traditional small-business structure in Europe, in order to guarantee that both the production and supply of food is sustainable, adequate and safe, even in the less-populated areas of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Food safety is a key priority for consumers and this regulation will lay down specific rules for the organisation of official controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">Food scares are only too familiar to European Union consumers. Just a few weeks ago the BBC TV programme <span class="italic">Panorama</span> exposed a scandal connected with poultry. It found that chickens for human consumption have been injected with beef and pork protein. The programme revealed how processors were pumping chickens full of water in an effort to make them look bigger. There is still much to be done to protect consumer safety throughout the European Union and in the enlargement countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want proper European Union rules for the organisation of controls on products of animal origin intended for human consumption, we need a directive which will promote consumer confidence and prevent scandals from happening. However, it is widely recognised that these controls are carried out differently in the different Member States. In some they are carried out by a veterinarian, in others by highly-skilled and qualified meat inspectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There is growing concern, of which the rapporteur is very much aware, that the independence of meat inspectors in the UK could be put on the line with this report. As their representatives have said, at the moment their independence gives them powers which they would not have if they were employed by the firm where they are working. For example, one meat inspector told me that she would stop a production line if a chicken head had not been cut off properly – something which should be welcomed given the importance of this House places on animal welfare. Similarly, if there is a problem with the quality of meat, the inspector has the power to stop that piece of meat moving from the production line to the supermarket. If the inspectors lost their independence and were employed by the firms in which they worked, food safety would go out of the window to increase profit.</p>
<p class="contents">This report should be welcomed; but we must recognise the difference between Member States in terms of controls and the importance in the UK of retaining the independence of the meat inspectorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report covers animal products other than meat, including aquaculture. As we have had particular problems in Wales concerning the testing of cockles, this is very important for us at this time. The harvesting of cockles is a long-standing and much-valued industry in coastal areas of Wales, such as the Burry Inlet and the Welsh Dee. About 3 000 people are employed directly, mainly small businesses and self-employed people. However, for two years the major cockle fisheries in these areas have been closed, causing significant hardship and even bankruptcy. The cause of the closure was the discovery of unidentified toxins during testing, even though not a single case of illness has been reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 2002/225/EC allows for either of two different test methods to be used to detect toxins, and the method used in the UK has been seriously questioned in recent months. As an earlier speaker mentioned, public and producer confidence is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The main issue here, and the one relevant to this report, is that to date there is no standard toxicity test for bivalve safety within the EU. This has meant that during the period when the cockle beds have been closed in Wales, cockles from other EU countries, which have not been subject to the same tests, could be, and have been, imported into Wales and sold.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of this report is to improve controls under the food hygiene package, and our first priority is the health of the public. To do that we need very clear and detailed rules, but there must be a level playing field across Europe, and in this case that means a harmonised and more effective method of testing. This report will take us in that direction and it is very welcome. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand that there is now to be no debate on the Malliori report. Mrs Malliori's report has been parodied and attacked in some countries, including my own, and we are owed a small debate on it. I am sorry that is not possible, and I know Mrs Malliori will want to speak about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I salute Mr Schnellhardt for his report and diligence. I agree with almost everything he says. On the margin, there are some areas – for example the attendance of veterinarians, fallen stock, etc. – where there might be too much regulation. However, when it comes to the inspection of the premises where foodstuffs are being prepared, there must be independent examination. In my own country audits conducted by our Food Safety Authority have shown frequent evasions and omissions in terms of the way in which food is prepared, specific risk materials are dealt with and other matters are looked at. We are told that nowadays we can relate everything to safety within the plant, the employees and so on. Who would dare to question the right and power of the employees to report on devious practices within their own plant?</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, as has been referred to in this debate, the preparation of some foodstuffs – as shown, for example, in the <span class="italic">Panorama</span> programme – has been quite disgraceful. I do not believe that employees in those plants would be courageous enough and willing to report these practices to authority. Therefore, we need independent inspectors; we do not need to remove them from the meat and veal sector. If we are wise in this regard, we will stick to the principle that beyond the HACCP system there always needs to be independent inspection of last resort.

The Commission is demonstrating progressive insight, that is, you can increase the control of food and certainly of meat by placing greater responsibility with the people who have to carry out the control. On this point I should like to echo the words of our group spokesperson, Mrs Grossetête. On the basis of Christian Democratic principles you could say that you want to place more individual responsibility where it belongs. This means that farms that are well organised, that have a good branding system, can do more themselves and that at the same time there must be scope for small enterprises to continue their work. It also means that the present way of working in poultry meat will have to be extended to veal and pork. It further means that responsibility as regards the from-the-land-to-the-plate guarantee must be made good and at the same time that no deviations can be tolerated in the so-called INR system. I do not entirely agree with the rapporteur’s position that a veterinarian should have the final decision as to whether or not an animal is safe for the food chain in cases where there is no question of airtight administrative processing. After all, you cannot see everything on the outside. I am against Amendment No 135 and in favour of Amendment No 127, and I anticipate the vote with confidence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Schnellhardt’s education makes him an expert, which is why his reports are extremely sound and often, perhaps, even a little too technical for the layman. But that probably says more about him than about us! I would like, therefore, to start by congratulating him on the document we have before us.</p>
<p class="contents">We need food safety. This is something that we are all aware of, and that we support. This report is even more significant, though, because meat, milk and fish are basic foodstuffs. Professional controls are of crucial importance here. To adopt highly comprehensive standards is not enough if, at the same time, we either ignore controls and sanctions or take insufficient notice of them. Official controls are in the safe hands of veterinarians here and I hope they are duly appreciated, even by the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, of course I completely understand that fellow Members coming in to the room might not give much attention to the subject under discussion. I am frequently in the same boat as them. But if you could at least see to it that the noise level improves, I might even be able to hear myself speak above this terrible din. I had hoped that you might at least listen to me, Mr President, as Mrs Diamantopoulou is doing.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President cut off the speaker and called for quiet in the Chamber)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of the size and transparency of businesses has been touched upon many times. Commissioner, I think that we simply need more flexibility for smaller businesses. We cannot treat large slaughterhouses like artisanal small businesses. I would ask you, therefore, to give appropriate consideration to creating the conditions for small- and medium-sized businesses to survive, whilst, at the same time, taking into account the vital matter of consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let us start with the question of flexibility for small businesses raised by the last speaker and by numerous other Members of the European Parliament. We totally agree on the need to safeguard the flexibility of small businesses, in accordance with the guidelines laid down in the first and second package of health rules. I referred in my first intervention to special cases in which flexibility is addressed with particular sensitivity. Thus, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3, 11, 12 and 138, provided that certain changes are made to their wording.</p>
<p class="contents">A new definition of artisanal small businesses, however, as proposed in the amendment, is not considered necessary. A second basic element to which numerous speakers referred concerns the role of the official veterinarian in abattoirs. The Commission can support the introduction of flexibility in risk analysis. I referred to this in my first intervention and this will apply to both large and small businesses. The Commission can therefore accept Amendments Nos 134, 141 and 142. Amendments Nos 85 and 86 are not accepted, because we believe that they will restrict flexibility without any justification. As far as the use of the business's staff to carry out certain control duties is concerned, the Commission expresses its satisfaction because there is agreement with the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Point 6 of Amendment No 21 on poultry meat and rabbit meat is not in keeping with the approach which has been adopted for fresh meat, as provided for in Annex I to the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in Amendment No 87 to separate production and control responsibilities within the business is considered particularly constructive. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 127, 135, 136, 139 and 140 because they are not in keeping with the line taken by the Committee on the Environment or the line taken by the Commission and the authorities responsible for European feedingstuffs legislation. I would therefore ask you to re-analyse the content of these amendments and not to proceed to vote for them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the information which must be provided when animals are slaughtered, the Commission can also agree to allow flexibility. However, the relevant arrangements must not undermine the system as a whole. Consequently, Amendments Nos 71, 72, 73, 101, 102, 103 and 107 are not accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the question of marine biotoxins in shellfish. The Commission text is based on scientific proof. This applies to the serious risks affecting food safety. The introduction of excessive flexibility at this point is of no benefit to consumers; consequently, the Commission does not accept Amendment No 6, the first part of Amendment No 122 or Amendment No 123. Amendments Nos 4, 25 and 70 repeat the requirements already provided for in our proposal for official controls to be carried out on feedingstuffs and food which the Commission submitted last March.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the recurring question of comitology, the Commission considers that one major issue is its having the possibility to take measures to implement or adjust annexes, so that they can take account of current scientific developments. I would say that the Commission does, in fact, have a problem with the proposal by the Committee on the Environment proposing that this order be abolished. Consequently, we do not agree with Amendment No 38 but we do agree with Amendment No 130. The Commission's position on all the amendments may be obtained from the secretariat.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the recommendations on health are some of the most important action points in the White Paper on food safety. My thanks to Mr Schnellhardt and all the members of this committee who helped with this dossier, which is especially important to producers and consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I spoke on this subject about a week ago, to be exact on the last day of the part-session. The problem is that the agenda is adopted on Monday, but not adhered to by Thursday. I believe it is inaccurate for Mrs Malliori to say that her report is being postponed until this afternoon. Today’s agenda states that the time allocated to all reports – from Mrs Jöns’s through to Mrs Fourtou’s – is 10 a.m. to 4.30 p.m., which gives us until 4.30 p.m. to discuss this report. If it becomes the accepted thing to request that reports are dealt with without debate in order to be finished by 12 noon on Thursday, then people should say on Monday that a debate is not required when we are adopting the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Last time, I said that this was a dangerous precedent, and indeed it is one. We have had two hours for the topical and urgent debate on the reform of the Rules of Procedure taken away from us for nothing, on the grounds that this time was needed for other work, and leaving us with just one hour. This time should then either be used or given back for the topical and urgent debate.</p>

Firstly, in future we should decide on Monday whether a matter is important enough to require debate or not. On Monday, we scheduled this matter for Thursday afternoon, so why are we cancelling it now? If it is important, it makes no difference whether it is discussed in the morning or in the afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly – and this is a crucial point which I last brought up during another debate on a Thursday afternoon – you have, or your predecessor has, just taken a vote which is not permissible. According to our Rules of Procedure, only the President of Parliament can decide whether to cancel a debate. It is his decision alone, and there are extremely important reasons for this. We voted to establish the agenda on Monday and I have to clarify whether or not this decision to change it is the President’s.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to the Rules of Procedure, this decision is his alone, but in this case he has not taken on that responsibility.</p>

In my opinion you have misread the Rules. The term 'President' applies to the individual who is in the Chair at that time, so it is 'President' or 'Vice-President'. Mr Vidal-Quadras Roca rightly applied Rule 145.
