<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olsson (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we have just concluded a debate on the problems involving BSE – problems connected with food production in which profit interests may be very important and drive production tremendously hard. We must remember that, in a globalised food market, there is a requirement for political limits upon how food is produced so that other social objectives are not forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the European Union, we have had rules about not using hormones to promote growth. We have had complaints about this, mainly from the United States, and a WTO panel has been set up which has said that our proofs are inadequate. This was the background to the Commission’s having an assessment made of those hormones which have been used. There are six of these. According to that assessment, there were different levels of risk factor. All the hormones involve certain risks. Above all, they are carcinogenic. One hormone, oestradiol 17ß, was worse than the others. The Commission is therefore now proposing a change to the legislation so that oestradiol 17ß in particular is completely banned – both for use in feed or as a growth promoter, and for therapeutic purposes. Where the other five hormones are concerned, an extension is proposed to the provisional, temporary ban that applies.</p>
<p class="contents">I and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy fully support the Commission’s positions. It is extremely urgent to take this matter further. Naturally, it is also important to continue investigating the other five hormones to see how hazardous they may be, but it is constructive that oestradiol 17ß is now banned once and for all. With this investigation, we have therefore obtained clearer arguments which hopefully mean that those who hold other views will respect our position, our ban and the import ban that at present applies.</p>
<p class="contents">There is something of a variety of arguments, and I should like here to discuss a number of arguments which I have contributed to the report and which have been approved by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. It may be that, from a legal point of view, they do not carry much weight, but they carry a great deal of weight politically. Firstly, there is the environmental argument. It is dangerous to use hormones in this way. In the United States, where they are used, it has been discovered that they are disseminated in the environment beyond the confines of animal production. Secondly, there is the argument on the grounds of animal protection. We must consider whether it is reasonable to give animals feed supplements which cause abnormal growth. Does that not cause them stress of a kind which creates a conflict for us when it comes to caring for animals and our ambition to treat animals well?</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of such considerations, there is a general obligation to make an ethical assessment. This will be all the more important in a society in which knowledge is increasing and in which science is discovering more and more about different production methods. We must therefore reflect upon whether hormone use accords with the basic ethical rules we human beings have. The issue is, of course, that of whether change as far-reaching as this means that the very conditions of life for human beings or other biological creatures are being transformed. We should probably have no right to effect such a transformation.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the changes that have been made. At the same time, I want to emphasise that there is a crucial difference between the committee’s and the Commission's proposals, for we in the committee do not wish to apply the committee procedure proposed by the Commission but want to arrange for any amendments to go back to Parliament for approval because there is so much by way of politics – and not only of science – in all of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Food safety must take priority in all our decisions because consumers have a right to safe, risk-free food. Substances with a hormonal or thyrostatic action and beta-agonists as growth promoters in beef production have long-term effects and may therefore have repercussions on human health. The main persons affected by hormone residues are high-risk groups such as pre-pubertal children and pregnant women.</p>
<p class="contents">During the WTO dispute settlement procedure, the scientific committee came to the conclusion from its evaluation of the risks of the six hormones that oestradiol 17β clearly had a carcinogenic, tumour-initiating and genotoxic effect. If there is the slightest suspicion that an individual substance may have harmful effects, as is the case with oestradiol 17β, then we must react with a definitive ban. We are also duty bound to be cautious with the other hormones at issue if we are to have a high level of food safety and health protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Compliance with the hormone ban must also be strictly controlled within the European Union. European consumers are also extremely sensitive when it comes to imported products, which is why the monitoring system for meat imports from third countries must be reviewed. Only if we apply the precautionary principle can we show consumers that we mean business when we talk of food safety in Europe. That is how Parliament can send out a clear signal and pave the way forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of the opinion delivered by the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health, the SCVPH, we have called for moves to ban oestradiol 17β, a recognised carcinogen. In general, our amendments to the Commission’s proposals are designed to encourage the Commission to adopt a more dynamic approach by seeking and developing its own scientific information with a view to avoiding any impression that the EU is seeking only to gain time and intends to continue using the current lack of adequate scientific information to maintain its provisional measures in force indefinitely. It is therefore important that the provisional ban on the five other identified hormones, namely testosterone, progesterone, trenbolone acetate, zeranol and melengestrol acetate, should apply until the Community finds more complete scientific information from any source – particularly by means of a research programme of its own in this field – which could shed light on the gaps in the present state of knowledge on these substances and enable the EU to take a sufficiently well-founded decision to continue or lift the ban.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as these substances too are concerned, we also want the Commission to accept the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee which was established by Article 1 of Decision 68/361/EEC and to make every effort to obtain further information in order to resolve this problem within a reasonable time.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that these proposals are designed to promote a European agricultural system which is respectful of the environment, of animal welfare and of human health. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, the statement made by the Commission on the state of progress in the fight against BSE clearly demonstrates that, where prevention is possible, it is always far more effective than intervention after the event; as the saying goes, prevention is better than cure. So we must be particularly vigilant with regard to the substances that are administered to livestock. This vigilance must be practised across the board, from veterinary treatment to husbandry practices. Recent studies have shown that oestradiol 17β is carcinogenic. It is therefore imperative that the use of this substance should be strictly prohibited in any livestock intended for human consumption and that all imports of meat from non-EU countries should be monitored. Long before the BSE crisis we are now experiencing, I vigorously upheld two principles in this House: the first was the precautionary principle, as the best means of protecting consumers and preventing panic, which, as we have seen, has disastrous effects on human behaviour and on the farming sector, and the principle of supporting scientific research in order to acquire within the shortest possible time the most accurate data on which to base our decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that the honourable Member, Mr Olsson, has presented to us focuses on these two principles, and I find that gratifying. There are indeed doubts about five other hormones, and it is important that the scientific research in this field should be undertaken without delay. However, in the absence of definitive findings, it is absolutely essential that the temporary ban on the use of these substances for the treatment of livestock should be renewed and that the utmost care be taken with any derogations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, first of all a thank you to Mr Olsson for a really good report which is very much along the lines of what I think is a good proposal from the Commission. I believe we all agree that using hormones in this way to promote animals’ growth is unacceptable in itself. As Mr Olsson said, it is unethical. It has serious consequences for animal welfare and the environment, and the six substances we are talking about here also damage human health. The definitive ban on using oestradiol stands to reason. The substance is carcinogenic. I also think it is important, however, that we now obtain a provisional ban on the use of the other five substances. This would, in actual fact, be an example of a very proactive and commendable application of the precautionary principle, which I should very much like to support.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to support the rapporteur’s view that it ought not to be possible to lift or weaken the bans without the Council’s or Parliament’s approval. It is important for us to retain political responsibility on this matter. Let me also say finally that I find it quite incomprehensible that the American authorities should close their eyes to the risks involved in this production method. If they were to look at the development of certain types of cancer in the United States and the development of obesity in the American population, the American health authorities would surely hear all the alarm bells ringing. I therefore hope that the renewed adoption of a ban on the use of this hormone-treated meat here in Europe might capture the attention both of American consumers and of the American health authorities so that we avoid having to have further discussions of this matter under the auspices of the WTO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur Mr Olsson for his report and also the committees who gave their opinion on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Council Directive 96/22 on the prohibition of the use of hormones in stock-farming. The main purpose of the Commission proposal is to increase our level of food safety and to comply with our international obligations deriving from the sanitary and phyto-sanitary agreement of the World Trade Organisation, the so-called SPS Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This assembly is well aware that the current ban on use of hormones for growth promotion was challenged at the World Trade Organisation and that the final ruling in 1998 criticised the risk assessment on hormones used in food-producing animals presented by the European Community. As you are aware, the Commission initiated a complementary risk assessment on these hormones in the light of the clarifications regarding risk assessment provided by the appellate body of the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">In April 1999, the Scientific Committee on Veterinary Measures relating to Public Health issued an opinion on the potential adverse affects to human health arising from hormone residues in bovine meat and meat products. This opinion was reviewed and confirmed in May 2000. The main conclusion was that no acceptable daily intake can be established for any of the six hormones evaluated when they are administered to bovine animals for growth promotion.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards to the hormone oestradiol 17-B, the scientific committee found that it has to be considered a complete carcinogen insofar as it has both tumour and tumour initiating affects. For the five other hormones under consideration, the need for further information was identified.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of these conclusions the Commission proposed firstly to ban definitively all the uses of oestradiol in farm animals in the light of the finding that this substance is a complete carcinogen. Secondly, the Commission proposed to maintain provisionally the current prohibition on the five other hormones until more complete scientific information is made available. This measure will be kept under regular review and is thus fully compatible with our international obligations. I am most satisfied that the report supports this approach.</p>
<p class="contents">With this proposal the Commission has also provided the necessary legal basis for adaptation of the lists of definitively and provisionally banned substances by the regulatory committee procedure in order to allow for rapid reaction to new evidence and thus further to enhance consumer safety. I regret very strongly that the introduction of the regulatory committee procedure for the adaptation of the lists of substances has not been supported by the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you here know my view on this issue. I have discussed with you in bilateral meetings on a number of occasions the question of the use of the comitology procedure and I note that request by the Commission is not being accepted in the amendments that have been put forward. I would ask Parliament to reconsider its view on this issue, because I believe that it is of considerable importance that the question of comitology be seriously addressed in this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that if Parliament insists on the adaptation of the annexes to be done by way of codecision rather than comitology, that Parliament will be guilty of not properly looking after the safety of the consumer health in this issue, an issue that Parliament has discussed in this debate earlier today, both in the BSE context and on this particular issue. How can we possibly justify a delay of a year and a half in the adjustment and adaptation of the annexes in circumstances where a scientific committee may have advised the Commission to add for instance a further hormone to the list of annexes? How can that be justified? Someone said that this is a political issue. I emphatically reject that proposition. It is a scientific issue. That is the very reason why this issue was considered in the WTO. It comes as some concern to me that there is a risk if Parliament adheres to the view that it appears to have on this issue, that we are going to have a situation whereby comitology will not be accepted in this way but rather there will be an adherence to codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been through this before. I have had this debate with Parliament and I know what is going to happen later in the day. Members of this House will arrive in here to vote on this issue and they will follow the whips. The vast majority will not know the detail that they are voting on because they are not informed on this particular issue. It is also a major concern to me that so many people today will vote on an issue which is of considerable importance to consumer without knowing that they are putting in place a procedure which would put at risk consumer health by delaying the procedure under which I can, on the basis of clear scientific advice, put something into an annex which will protect consumer health.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely ask you ladies and gentlemen, to revise your view on this issue, give consumer health a greater priority. Consider the question of consumer health as more important than the interinstitutional wrangling between Parliament and the Commission on the question of whether there should be a full codecision in cases such as this. This is a scientific issue, based on scientific advice: it is an executive decision which will be taken by the Commission and put into an annex in circumstances where there is a full <span class="italic">droit de regard </span>by Parliament on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said here before when debating this issue that I will not lightly disregard the view of Parliament on any issue where comitology arises. So I sincerely ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to give serious consideration to the rights of consumers, to the question of the proper protection of consumers and also bear in mind we are going to have a food and safety authority in operation hopefully next year. It will have a role to play in rapid reaction. If it identifies an emerging risk, it can advise that there should be an executive response to that risk immediately. Sometimes that will mean a legislative response introduced by the Commission. If that can be done by comitology we will get the kind of speedy response that the consumer requires. But if it can only be done by codecision we will have a delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Now allow me to address in detail the amendments which have been proposed in this report as well as the amendment tabled by Mrs Grossetête. I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 as far as comitology is concerned for the reasons that I have already identified. Nor Amendments Nos 12, 13 and 14 which reject the introduction of the regulatory committee procedure for updating the lists of provisionally and definitively banned substances and which re-introduce the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 focuses on a well-founded decision on maintaining the ban. The Commission cannot accept this amendment as it prejudges the outcome of any possible future research. Under Amendment No 2, the Commission would be committed to fund research on the five provisionally banned substances. This is not acceptable. There is no legal obligation under either Community law or the WTO framework for the Commission to finance research. Rather the WTO requires parties to evaluate the risk on the basis of all scientific data. Nevertheless, such studies are not excluded from the European Union’s programmes on food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 and 11 which insist on the need to introduce effective monitoring systems to protect health. I would like stress that monitoring systems already exist both in the Member States and at Community level. For instance meat imports are already controlled, notably according to the directive on controls and residues, Council Directive 96/23.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission proposed that the provisions in the directive concerning oestradiol would not apply to animals treated for technical or therapeutical purposes before 1 July. Amendment No 15 by Mrs Grossetête proposes that this provision be linked to the availability of suitable alternatives. The Commission cannot accept this amendment on health grounds given the clear scientific evidence as regards oestradiol. In addition, a recent study indicated that there is no lack of alternatives to oestradiol for therapeutical or zootechnical use in the Community. This study should be made available to Parliament in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand the Commission can accept Amendment No 8 as well as in principle the part of Amendment No 10 dealing with scientific data because they introduce useful clarifications to the text.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish once again to thank Mr Olsson for the excellent report and his support on this important issue. In summary, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 as far as the point of comitology is concerned, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. On the other hand it can accept Amendment No 8 and in principle the part of Amendment No 10 dealing with scientific data. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, what we are aiming at is not to delay the handling of this matter but to be able to conduct a debate here for, on this issue as on many others, there is a lack of scientific clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday in Stockholm, I met a representative of the American Department of Agriculture, who did not take the European view of science. In this Chamber, we need, then, to debate issues which are not only scientific but are also about ethical stances and the precautionary principle. It is not, then, about postponing dealing with this issue. Rather, the aim is to obtain a more thorough political debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
