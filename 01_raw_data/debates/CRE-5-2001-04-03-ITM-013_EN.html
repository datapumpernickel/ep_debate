And under the auspices of this Communication, the Commission has to date begun legal actions, if our calculations are correct, against nine of the fifteen Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody questions the Commission’s duty to pursue alleged infringements of Community Law. The Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats’ criticism is that, by means of an interpretative communication, the Commission has unilaterally set the rules of the game in such an important area, and this is proved by the fact that the Stockholm European Council has dealt with it, thereby side-stepping, in our view, the legislative competences of this Parliament and of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I assume that Commissioner Bolkestein will be aware that the Court of Justice has already set the precedent of annulling an interpretative communication similar to this one, on pension funds, precisely because the Commission exceeded its authority. But it is also the case, Commissioner, that this Communication of 1997 has become obsolete because of recent economic developments. For all these reasons, it is very important to this House that the Commissioner replies clearly whether he intends, in accordance with his competences, to present a legislative proposal on intra-Community investments to Parliament and the Council. My Group, of course, believes this to be essential, given the current circumstances, and I am certain that, at the end of this debate, the Commissioner will be convinced that this presumption is agreed on by the enormous majority of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Of these new circumstances which I have just referred to, I am going to expand on the opening up of national markets in key economic sectors, in which there still exist within the European Union monopoly systems which create asymmetry. In fact, in accordance with Community guidelines, certain Member States have made great efforts to open up their telecommunications and other sectors to competition. However, other States have not taken equivalent measures and their markets therefore remain closed to external competition.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the PPE-DE Group believes that we should permit prevention mechanisms such as the "golden share", because otherwise objective discrimination may arise. I would therefore ask the Commissioner what measures the Commission intends to present in order to allow the Member States which are working to open up and privatise their economies to free competition to preserve the objective of that privatisation?</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, on Thursday, this Parliament will vote on a resolution which will establish its position at the end of the debate. I am convinced that the Commission will at all times apply the interinstitutional agreement which binds us and that you, Commissioner, will therefore act in accordance with your powers of legislative initiative and consequently present this House with a specific proposal immediately. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are therefore in an unbalanced situation in which companies which still have the characteristics of public companies, and therefore have a monopoly in a Member State, take advantage of the openness of the external market and indulge in unfair competition in relation to companies which have entered into what we may call the free game of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Galeote has said, disputes have arisen, and are arising, in Belgium, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal and the United Kingdom, and infringement procedures are under way in Denmark, Germany and Holland. This is therefore a widespread situation, which demonstrates that the principles guiding the 1997 Communication referred to earlier, are no longer valid. We therefore urge that the relevant legislation be updated, with the due participation of this Parliament, and that this should take place, on the one hand, to eliminate these positions of privilege and, on the other hand, to safeguard the actions of the Member States, which have behaved in accordance with the process of the opening up of markets, which are liberalising them and which need the relevant guarantees so that the companies which enter into this European internal market have all the safeguards resulting from being a part of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">May I begin by saying that the communication of 19 July 1997 on certain legal aspects concerning intra-EU investments to which both speakers made reference was adopted by the Commission, as was the case for a series of other communications, on the basis of its exclusive competence stemming from its role as guardian of the Treaties. As is specified in the communication itself, its objective is to indicate to national authorities and economic operators in Member States how the Commission interprets the provisions of the Treaty on capital movements and the right of establishment in order to reduce the risk of divergent legal interpretations.</p>
<p class="contents">The principles set out in that communication are essentially based on the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which remains, of course, the sole competent institution to provide a definitive interpretation of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with Article 56 of the EC Treaty all restrictions on capital movements between Member States, be they discriminatory or non-discriminatory, are prohibited. The communication, being devoted to intra-Community investment, goes more deeply into the respect for this fundamental principle insofar as two specific forms of capital movements are concerned: the acquisition of domestic securities and direct investments. All restrictions applied to these capital movements can pose compatibility problems with, in particular, Article 56 which deals with the free movement of capital, and Article 43, which deals with freedom of establishment. The communication to which I referred a little while ago states that, in conformity with the very notion of direct investments, nationals of other Member States of the European Union should be free to acquire controlling stakes, exercise their voting rights attached to those stakes, and manage domestic companies under the same conditions as are laid down in a given Member State for its own nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">While the freedom of establishment and the free movement of capital are among the fundamental freedoms of the Treaty, certain exceptions to the general rules exist which allow Member States to impose certain restrictions. As far as the freedom of establishment is concerned these restrictions may be motivated by the exercise of official authority or on the grounds of public policy, public security or public health – Article 46. As far as the free movement of capital is concerned they may be justified on the basis of requisite measures in the field of taxation, prudential supervision, or the use of declaration procedures, or by considerations in relation to public policy or public security – Article 58. Finally, Member States may take measures which they consider necessary for the protection of the essential interests of their security which are connected with the defence sector – Article 296.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice it is necessary to interpret those exceptions narrowly in order to satisfy the criterion of proportionality. All interpretation based on economic criteria should be excluded. An exception should not constitute a means of arbitrary discrimination or a disguised restriction on the freedom of movement of capital. In the light of the principles which I have just set out, and taking into account that the Treaty is neutral insofar as the private or public nature of companies is concerned, it clearly appears that all restrictions aimed at preventing subsequent purchases by investors of other Member States of controlling rights in privatised companies under the pretext that the capital of these investors is to different degrees in public ownership cannot be justified by the exceptions of the Treaty in the area of capital movements or the rights of establishment, exceptions which I delineated a few moments ago.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I say that as Members of this Parliament may be aware, the Commission will shortly have a debate on restrictions on intra-Community investment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the problem of Community legislation. If we examine the Community's legal sources, we have the original Treaty law, on the one hand, and directives and regulations, which are adopted with the involvement of Council and Parliament, on the other. But between the two, there is something else, which is often regarded as a source of law, namely the communications. We are discussing one of these communications today.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have rightly pointed out that this communication is merely an interpretation and is based on the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. But it often seems as if the Commission is the only body to interpret the law, without any involvement by the Council or the European Parliament. The Commission acts as the sole legislator, as in the Byzantium of ancient times under Emperor Constantine. My law lecturer in Freiburg sometimes described the Commission's methods as the Imperial Byzantine approach to law-making as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I think it is absolutely crucial, in these very important cases, that directives or regulations are submitted and – as is right and proper – adopted with the participation of Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem which we are addressing raises a second issue, namely competition in the European Community. Liberalisation – i.e. the abolition of monopolies – is one of the EU's success stories. In telecommunications in particular, we have seen that cutting costs and prices has genuinely benefited citizens. But there is a substantial danger here. We face a situation in which some are liberalising and opening up to competition, but others are not doing so. And we see that those who have not done sometimes win out, even with a monopoly, as long as the others are buying up, until the old public monopoly has been replaced by a private monopoly. The citizen then still faces a monopoly, as before, and derives no benefit from liberalisation. I think that the Commission needs to pay greater attention to this fact in its activities in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Katiforis (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure Constantine was Byzantine, after all he was borderline between Byzantium and the Roman Empire. Were it Justinian, of course, it would have been a different matter. Anyway the issue we are addressing tonight is the extent to which a Member State is permitted under a treaty to place restrictions upon nationals of other Member States or its own nationals, I suppose, from conducting intra-EU investment within the sphere of its economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is particularly relevant to investments in privatisation conducted by Member States. The issue is of fundamental importance for the correct functioning of the European single market and I would like to thank colleagues for raising the subject this time given the number of cases the Commission has referred to the Court of Justice over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty establishing the European Communities under Article 43 on right of establishment and Article 56, as mentioned by Commissioner Bolkestein, on free movement of capital, clearly creates a regime whereby nationals of any Member State have the right to invest in other Member States. This is a right that a very large number of individuals and enterprises have availed themselves of as the European Union has developed.</p>
<p class="contents">Intra-EU investment has been increasing by staggering proportions over the last few years. In 1998, such investment totalled over EUR 132 billion; in 1999, it had increased by over 80% to over EUR 240 billion. We can reasonably expect that these figures will be easily surpassed and the rate of increase maintained as the establishment of the euro reduces intra-Community transactions, eliminates exchange risk and exchange cost for enterprises whilst at the same time increasing intra-Community investment opportunities. Such is the success of the European economic project and the establishment of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one can always seek improvements. There are still many tasks for the completion of the European single market and one of these is, of course, the gradual dismantling of state involvement in enterprises. This dismantling has only been pursued with great political courage and with grave political risks. Often it has only been achieved through the legal assurances that governments gave about their continued supervision and special interests in the strategic directions of the enterprises being privatised. Such legal assurances came in many forms, such as the golden share, so that there is a case, I suppose, to argue that the golden share has not always been an impediment but may have actually helped politically the privatisation process.</p>
<p class="contents">In its 1997 communication, the Commission established its guidelines for the existence of these legal assurances. It did so in a rather non-transparent way through a communication that was not discussed either in Parliament or by the Council. The legal assurances that governments had created, on the other hand, were established in the full glare of publicity and public debate that necessarily exists in the privatisation process. It really is rather an uncomfortable situation that such a dichotomy has been created between the establishment of fundamental Community rules and Member State regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, using the communication as its operational guide, has since taken legal action against six Member States before the Court of Justice and opened infringement proceedings against the others. None of these cases has, as yet, come to a conclusion. It cannot be justified that the Commission has set up its own framework of rules under which it has been bringing actions against Member States, which have gone through enormous difficulties in bringing forward necessary privatisation programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission, when it states that the national interest argument used to justify such legal assurances by Member States, as has frequently happened, cannot be accepted as an adequate justification for such measures. The national interest argument is simply not sufficiently transparent since it can cover a particularly wide range of economic and/or non-economic criteria. I can, however, also agree with those of our colleagues who argue that the Commission too has been acting in a particularly non-transparent manner with regard to breaking down the barriers for intra-EU investment. I join with them in requesting that the Commission update its policy in this area with a proposal for a directive, not only for the sake of intra-institutional transparency, but also to provide guidance to Member States so that lengthy procedures before the Court can be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (TDI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, in my opinion, the speeches I have just heard, particularly that of Mr Galeote, could be misleading, for they imply that Parliament is, in some way, calling upon the Commission to consolidate the golden share, to strengthen the special powers of States so that they can, to some extent, protect markets being liberalised against markets in which monopolies with a high degree of liquidity operate which might take over the liberalised markets. In my view, this would be an erroneous impression, for Parliament must speak out, loud and clear, in protest against the golden share and against all the instruments preventing the establishment of a genuine, dynamic internal market in the sectors which have traditionally, in recent decades, been occupied by the State in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I am speaking on behalf of the Italian radicals. In 1997, we introduced a referendum in Italy against the 1994 law which established the special powers of the golden share in Italy. Eighty per cent of those who voted in that referendum – almost 10 million Italians – said yes, calling for what we wanted, the repeal of those rules which were hampering – as they still do today – the establishment of a genuine competitive market on the capital market for privatised companies. I regret to say that, as often happens, those votes were thrown away, destroyed in the Italian climate, where the Constitution and expressions of the citizens’ will often count for no more than waste paper.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1998, the government headed by Romano Prodi, the current President of the Commission, was subjected to an infringement procedure by the Commissioner for the Internal Market at the time, Mario Monti, for using this golden share. In 1999, a decree was issued which – in that typically Italian way – modified the golden share without making any substantial change. Well then, in my opinion, the articles of the Treaty should be sufficient to prevent a State company operating a monopoly from taking over a company on the liberalised market. This would be abuse of a dominant position, State aid. There is no need to provide for companies to have the golden share to prevent them from being taken over by a State-owned company from another Member State. Otherwise – as frequently happens – this excuse is, in actual fact, used to consolidate national governments and majority parties' power of veto over the free placing on the market of public companies; the financial markets are unable to establish the best, most efficient, optimum distribution of power and therefore of the management of companies in sectors which are highly important, key, crucial sectors for Europe, such as the telecommunications or energy sectors in particular. Moreover, the golden share means that companies which are being placed on the market bring less cash into the State coffers because a company is being bought over which someone who has not invested even a penny has the power to make strategic decisions: governments lose money by privatising the golden share. There is also the danger, with the golden share, of nationalising private investment: the citizens, the investors, buy companies which are under the thumb of the State, governments and therefore political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The golden share gives rise to a remarkable conflict of interests between the State which remains the manager and, to some extent, the owner of the liberalised companies, and the State which should have the sole role of regulator guaranteeing the competition which protects the interests of the citizens. This is one of the ways in which some of the European States – Italy, for instance – continue, in actual fact, to manage large parts of the economy of the country and prevent there being in these sectors – the telecommunications and energy sectors, for instance – efficient, competitive companies and markets, companies able to withstand international competition. The fact that <span class="italic">Enel</span> in Italy or <span class="italic">Deutsche Post</span> in Germany or <span class="italic">France Télécom</span> exploit positions of monopoly in order to go and grab areas which have been liberalised in the markets of other countries must be opposed as dominant positions, as State aid, but this cannot be used as an excuse to allow countries which are moving towards a market-based economy to keep powers in companies which are supposed to have been privatised.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the golden share has been in the past and continues to be a barrier to the creation of genuinely European public services companies. It removes companies from market dynamics and governments continue to interfere, continue to think they know best who should buy a company, following certain lines of reasoning which are not the most effective for the market, thus penalising the citizens. We must not advocate that governments use the golden share as a shield to prevent companies being bought on the market in order to direct the purchase of privatised companies towards preferred groups because, in the long run, this leads to non-competitive markets, as is happening now.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I have some reservations about the resolution to be put to the vote on Thursday. I believe that Parliament must speak out, loud and clear, if possible avoiding a compromise, with nationalisers and liberalisers fighting it out, and state clearly that the articles of the Treaty relating to the movement of capital and freedom of establishment must be fully enforced in the light of today's economic market conditions, not those of 40 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">There is the danger that the State monopolies, which still exist, will lord it over the liberalised markets in Europe, a danger represented by the abuse of the dominant position and State aid. This is the root of the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr von Wogau said, if I understood him correctly, that the communication which has been referred to by Members of Parliament, and which I myself mentioned, is a source of law. I cannot see it that way. The source of law is the Treaty. The Treaty is clear. The Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and universally recognised as such. It issued the communication in 1997 in order to clear up certain misunderstandings in connection with the relevant articles of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">It did not do so without reason. I shall refer to two particular instances. Firstly in 1991 the United Kingdom tried to use golden shares to oppose the acquisition of certain British companies which had been privatised by public entities, public companies, of other Member States. At the time, in 1991, this was known as the "Lilley doctrine". The Commission took energetic action. The United Kingdom changed its policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second instance is a more recent one. At international level my colleague, Mr Lamy, had to oppose an analogous American initiative which was taken against certain public European companies in the telecom area. So in both these instances one sees that the Commission has taken action against the attempts, whether by a Member State, or in the case of the United States by a third country, to block investments by companies, whether private or public from other Member States, in privatised companies of the home state.</p>
<p class="contents">To return to the main point at issue, the Commission has done no more than interpret the relevant articles of the Treaty – basically Articles 56 and 43.</p>
<p class="contents">That is what is laid down in the interpretative communication. So it cannot be said, as Mr Katiforis said earlier tonight, that the Commission is constructing its own framework of rules. Once again and for the last time, I will say that the Commission has been entrusted with the duty to act as guardian of the Treaty. In the years running up to 1997 there was uncertainty about the way Articles 43 and 56 ought to be interpreted. That is the reason for the interpretative communication. The final instance that decides on what is right or wrong, what is legal and illegal, is the Court of Justice. Naturally the Commission does not, in the end, decide what the legal situation is. That is the responsibility of the Court of Justice. But before the matter can be considered by the Court of Justice somebody has to bring the case to the attention of the Court. That is what the Commission has done. This Commissioner has played a certain role in this and has taken a number of Member States to court for making use of the golden share.</p>
<p class="contents">So I must reject the reproach made against the Commission that it has arrogated unto itself certain competences that it should not have, that it is framing its own system of rules. No, the Commission is merely interpreting and stating what the law is. That is the reason why it has taken some Member States to court. Hopefully we will soon see what the Court of Justice has to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I was asked if I would issue a directive. There is no need for a directive. We have a treaty. The Commission interprets the treaty and the Court of Justice decides. So we do not need a directive. Having said all that, the Commission is due to have a debate on this whole issue shortly. After that has taken place perhaps I can further inform Parliament, but at this moment I see no reason to change the opinion that I have just given. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
