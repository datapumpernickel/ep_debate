<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McNally (PSE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – As rapporteur for the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme, I would like to thank all three institutions for their cooperation in enabling us to reach successfully a second reading: the European Commission, of course, for coming forward with the proposals, the Council of Ministers and the three presidencies involved in this - the Spanish, Danish and above all the Greek presidencies - and especially the Members of the European Parliament and the staff of the European Parliament. I am pleased we have been able to find a compromise at second reading between the Parliament and the Council of Ministers by working very quickly and in fact by foregoing the normal full procedure for codecision matters. This is frankly not the best way to work, and I am sorry that the Council of Ministers is beginning to expect accelerated procedures as the norm. They are less transparent and less democratic and often lead to temporary misunderstandings, especially when negotiations are conducted – as they inevitably are – in only one language.</p>
<p class="contents">The title of this programme is self-explanatory. We need only imagine the contents of a programme called 'stupid' energy. In such a programme we would use fossil fuels, which we know to be finite and which emit CO2, as quickly as possible and would burn them just as inefficiently and profligately, in a way which the United States could teach us. 'Stupid' energy would use electricity and gas to heat the air outside buildings rather than insulating the buildings. It would encourage us to drive more and larger cars at high speeds so that we use more fossil fuels, preferably with only one occupant in each car. Despite its high economic costs, its failure to deal with radioactive waste and the need for very high safety and security standards, 'stupid' energy would insist on the promulgation of nuclear power, even in countries at very high risk of nuclear weapons proliferation.</p>
<p class="contents">Enough about 'stupid' energy. We currently do some of those things, which makes the current programme even more topical and even more useful. It is actually a modest programme, with EUR 200 million allocated for four years, which is frankly still inadequate. I hope that further funding will be made available during the programme, in particular when new Member States join. The programme has four objectives, all of which are indeed intelligent: the promotion of renewable energy sources, of energy efficiency, of clean transport and of all these three things in developing countries. All four objectives are important and I congratulate the European Commission on its intention to establish coordinating measures. I look forward to hearing the Commissioner's declaration, which is a declaration that I made clear was essential if we were to find agreement. Parliament's amendments to the Council of Ministers' common position encompass the budget – we insisted on an increase to EUR 200 million with a review clause – and numerous clarifications. I am pleased to say that 22 of Parliament's amendments were accepted in the common position and others have been accepted in subsequent negotiations. There is an unfortunate omission as regards the need for a strategic agency in the field of energy. Parliament will pursue that idea in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has done well to come forward with this programme. Its measures will help with protection of the environment, security of supply and with our industrial competitiveness. It will complement efforts by Member States and will encourage the laggardly Member States to do more. I will not name them to spare people's blushes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly pleased that the COOPENER Programme, which is itself modest, will serve as leverage for much better-funded programmes such as those foreseen in Johannesburg. Over 2 billion people in the world have no access to electricity. This programme will help.</p>
<p class="contents">One worrying aspect is the difficulty the Commission apparently has with the lead times for its proposals. These proposals were published so late that it is not going to be possible to commit money to projects until February 2004. I hope that the Commissioner will undertake a review of the timescale for preparing legislation to prevent problems of this sort, which I am sure are as disappointing to her as they are to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme will be of very real value and I look forward to its adoption following the Commissioner's declaration, and to a vote tomorrow which I hope will be very well supported by a European Parliament that will follow the programme with great interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that she has worked intensely with all our colleagues in Parliament and the Council to reach the position we are now dealing with. I believe it is extremely important that today, and tomorrow at the vote, we can conclude the approval of this programme once and for all. The present proposal for a European Parliament and Council Decision relates to a multi-annual action programme in the energy sector, to cover the period 2003-2006, and hence the urgency of concluding this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">We have four specific fields: the rational use of energy, the management of demand, which previously fell within the SAVE programme; new and renewable energy sources, previously known as ALTENER; transport aspects relating to energy: STEER; and the promotion at international level of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, known as COOPENER.</p>
<p class="contents">Before discussing the amendments, I would like to make a brief comment on an issue which I have noted causes concern in Parliament: the coordination of the programme and its relationship with other Community policies with an energy dimension, particularly in the field covered by the programme. This has just been pointed out by Mrs McNally, who wishes it to be made absolutely clear. I would therefore like to say that I share the honourable Members’ concern – in particular that of the rapporteur, Mrs McNally – and, in this regard, I believe that the inter-service consultations and cooperation are of great importance and should be common practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I have committed myself fully to increasing and improving these interrelationships with regard to the management of our programme. I am convinced that in this way the execution of actions in the field of energy will be carried out in a way which is coherent with the different Community instruments. To this end, Mrs McNally, I therefore propose to establish an interservices group, consisting of all those Commission services whose policies and programmes relate to the present programme. I am essentially talking about the services responsible for development cooperation, agriculture, regional development, the environment and technological research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments presented by the European Parliament, I am pleased to note that, following the recent discussions with the Council, a compromise has been reached with regard to the amendments which were still awaiting agreement. I would like to affirm and confirm the Commission's total support for the new text presented by Parliament. Please allow me therefore, ladies and gentlemen, to congratulate you on behalf of the Commission on the agreement reached with the Council, particularly with regard to the budget for the programme, that is, the famous EUR 200 million, which represent a considerable effort. As we know, Mrs McNally possibly wanted more. So did we, but I believe 200 million is a significant sum, which, over four years, represents a very considerable increase in the budgets when compared to what we have been using in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that you will approve the vote recommended by the rapporteur and that a speedy approval of the programme will allow it to be launched without wasting the funds corresponding to 2003; and that there will be a global approval at the end of the year, since we will have made sufficient progress in this regard, and that they will therefore be able to be used, including the funds corresponding to 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mrs McNally once again for her wonderful work and the honourable Members for their attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The discussions with the Committee on Budgets were of particular importance to us, as this is an area where the Committee on Industry considers it very important that programmes such as these should be adequately funded, and I also want to express my gratitude to Commissioner de Palacio for making it possible to include 2003 in these considerations and get these programmes up and running as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the international energy crisis, in particular, means that action is urgently needed. Europe is dependent on energy imports to a very great degree, with, at present, some 50% of its energy being imported, and we will very soon have to face rates of increase that we find utterly unjustifiable. That is why it is important that this programme should receive special emphasis. This multi-annual programme will enable us – or so I hope – to start to turn European energy policy around, and, in particular, the use of energy – a subject on which we have adopted many framework directives already – must be one of our priorities for the future. It is of course not only the benchmarks – which have recently been constantly improving – that help us to implement this at the national level, but primarily the models of best practice, and this is where the multi-annual programme is an extremely important gauge, enabling us to see in which countries, with which technologies and with which processes, we are achieving the greatest successes. I therefore believe that this programme sees us taking a great step forward in European energy policy, and so I thank you in advance for your good cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs McNally has come up with an interesting idea. She mentioned intelligent energy, in contrast to stupid energy, which, at times like these, reminds me of oil and of ‘stupid white men’, the title of a book by an author of whom some of us think very highly and who has won an Oscar. On the one hand, then, there are the stupid white men following a very definite principle of energy use – old and conservative – and we have an intelligent white woman<span class="italic">,</span> Europe and something else.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is a lot more to it than this<span class="italic">.</span> I believe that programmes such as this one give us a chance to make progress in formulating what is meant by the European way. I also think it smart to set up a European Intelligent Energy Agency, which has a chance of becoming what the USA’s Environmental Protection Agency was in the early 1970s in the eyes of the rest of the world. At that time, when there were as yet no Greens and our environmental awareness in Europe was underdeveloped, it was access to information and the EPA’s pilot schemes that made the development of exemplary projects possible. That is something this agency could do here. Certainly, though, it is also smart to take on board the point that we should not be giving this agency yet another new bureaucratic superstructure, but finding a place for it where capacity already exists.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that intelligent energy also includes intelligent transparency about the use of resources. This new agency could set an example by really showing how it manages the funds allocated to it, and by the absence of what is a cause of justifiable criticism of the European institutions, by which I mean lack of transparency in the way funds are spent and used, in the knowledge that without transparency, there is no democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur has already covered the main issues of substance, with all of which my group and I entirely agree. I only wish to make two additional wider points at this stage. Firstly, Intelligent Europe is not and should not be the title for this programme but, as the rapporteur herself suggested, should of course be the umbrella title for everything we do in the energy policy environment.</p>
<p class="contents">As many colleagues know, we are facing a glut of legislation in the energy field today, this week and next week, ranging from combined heat and power through to trans-European networks and to the all-important electricity and gas liberalisation package. Collectively we hope all of those measures together represent a real, intelligent policy. If you will forgive me for using this ghastly phrase, they represent a 'joined-up policy, joined-up government'. To that end the Commissioner's declaration today is very important and much to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is about the budget. We warmly support the rapporteur's success in raising the overall budget, but it is worth noting that the EUR 200m, which is of course a great deal of money to you and me, is actually extremely little when compared to the enormous range of tasks which the Intelligent Energy programme is supposed to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">EUR 200m could easily be absorbed in any one of the four titles and for that reason alone – and of course this is something we have seen in other areas as well, the trans-European networks for instance – the seed money being put forward by the European Union is massively dwarfed by the tasks to be performed. For that reason, we really do hope that procedures will be as efficient as possible, will avoid duplication, will avoid unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic checks and will give the taxpayers the right bang for their bucks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to start by personally thanking my friend and colleague, Mrs McNally, for the high quality of her report and for the way she has conducted negotiations with the Council. I have known her for a long time and I would like to pay tribute to her for her hard work, although I sometimes, or often, rather, disagree with the liberal lines taken by some of her friends.</p>
<p class="contents">Also on a personal note, I would like to tell Mrs de Palacio that, although she has never replied to my question on what I consider to be a contradiction between free competition seeking to force prices down and the undeniable need to save energy, I appreciate her work as Commissioner responsible for energy, her indisputable abilities and her willingness to listen.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn to the content now, on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group, I would point out that the ‘Intelligent Energy for Europe’ programme, covering the period 2003 to 2006, replaces a programme which expired on 31 December 2002. That explains the urgent need for us to come to an agreement and find the best possible compromise. It is no surprise that the most heated debates were on the question of the budget. I want once again to lament the fact that, all too often at European level, in very many fields, we are unable to provide ourselves with funding which is commensurate to our goals. I have said it time and time again in this House and elsewhere. In this case, it is all the more regrettable in that a mid-term assessment of the current programme has revealed that the current specific programmes have suffered from a serious lack of resources. In the end, after a number of tripartite meetings, the Council and Parliament succeeded in achieving a compromise of the sum of EUR 200 million, although the Council had been holding out for a sum of EUR 190 million. It is too little, even though it is better than nothing. As has been said, the sum will be divided between four specific programmes: energy efficiency, the promotion of renewable energy sources, energy aspects of transport, and the promotion of renewable energies and energy efficiency in the developing countries. I endorse these headings and I stress the need for action in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Again with regard to the content, the Council has accepted most of Parliament’s amendments: the inclusion of the candidate countries, the dissemination of the programmes and access thereto and the setting of transparent criteria for selecting participants. We welcome this. However, the Council has not accepted the creation of a European Intelligent Energy Agency. I for my part, like the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, regret this. I think it would have helped us. Nor has the Council accepted the establishment of a task force within the Commission to coordinate the different areas, but Mrs de Palacio has given us a certain amount of reassurance on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by stressing once again that energy is not just another commodity. It involves heavy, ongoing investment. It is in many respects a public service which must be protected zealously in the interest of all citizens in all senses of the word. In the future, we must save, diversify, increase security of supply and assess costs and benefits, and not just short-term costs and benefits. We must look far into the future. Demand will grow and fossil energies will decline. Public opinion is opposed to fission and so we must develop renewable energies and save energy. Lastly, and this is my last point, Mr President, we must implement what I personally consider to be the viable energy of the future, fusion, and thus launch very quickly indeed the ITER programme, very quickly indeed, Mr President. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, any mention of intelligent energy and request for renewable energy is likely to be met with derision rather than serious debate by the man in the street. For the man and woman in the street in my neck of the woods, this energy policy manifests itself in the growing scourge of wind farms – which are progressively blighting our treasured countryside – whose economic value far outstrips the notional value of this supposedly cost-free source. In fact, wind power is so costly that without substantial subsidy from taxpayers and energy users, its use would be prohibitively expensive. Since we are dealing with an intermittent energy source – as wind flow is far from constant – equivalent conventional generation must be supplied as back-up, which itself consumes as much energy as wind power is supposed to save.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that it is EU money and woolly thinking that sustains this programme – the two being largely inseparable – it is my view that the energy policy we are considering today is far from intelligent. As usual in EU nomenclature, the title conveys the opposite of reality. As always, I can only register my disapproval. However, I do so in the knowledge that my electorate, at least, is more intelligent than the policies produced in its name. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Intelligent Energy for Europe programme that is to replace it is only just now being discussed, we cannot accuse the Commission and the Council of acting too hastily. The previous programme, however, was a lot later in making its appearance, so there has been some progress, albeit slight.</p>
<p class="contents">The new programme includes fewer separate programmes, so that is good. In fact, resources for the previous framework programme had been chopped up into excessively small bits, and it has not been easy to achieve any visible results. The administrative costs of having many programmes, the consultants’ fees and the various seminars, of which there is no shortage in Europe, eat up resources, with the result that there are fewer left for concrete action.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new programme resources are being increased, the overall sums involved will increase and the fact that a five-year programme is being replaced by one lasting four years will mean that additional cash is available each year. The energy industry, however, is such a capital-intensive sector of production that not even additional funds will solve the problems EU countries have with regard to adequate supplies of energy, the security of supply or energy saving and environmental protection. The common objectives that have been set, for example regarding the use of renewable forms of energy, are so ambitious that achieving them depends crucially on the Member States. We cannot leave it just to the ALTENER programme to achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is being proposed that a new special Agency should be set up to coordinate cooperation in the energy sector. Experience has shown, however, that agencies do not always reduce bureaucracy – they tend rather to do the opposite – and special agencies are always harder for Parliament to monitor than the Commission is. Setting up new agencies does not increase administrative transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the work the rapporteur has done, I would like to join my colleague, Mr Caudron, in expressing my thanks to her on behalf of our group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs McNally knows that I too subscribe to the theory that the European Agency would have provided a method of administration and would very likely have had many positive features. I believe, however, that, by means of this intergroup system, or system of organisation within the Commission incorporating all the various services affected, we can overcome your worries.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish briefly to add that I fully concur with what Mr Caudron has said about the launch, as soon as possible, of the ITER initiative, as well as other initiatives. With regard to the EUR 200 million, I am thinking, for example, of the COOPENER programme through which the most appropriate technologies, including clean carbon technologies, together with energy efficiency and technological development, would be spread throughout the developing countries. We shall have to return to this subject one day when we talk about Kyoto, because Kyoto does not only affect Europe but addresses a global problem. If we imagine that developing countries will not make use of coal, we are mistaken. They will in fact make use of coal if that is what is most readily available to them. That is clear, and that is the direction in which we must move.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to invite you, as a thought for the future, to remember that the Community budget, set this year in anticipation of next year, will involve 0.99% of GDP, there being 25 Member States. In addition to having just 0.99% of GDP, we shall perform the miracle of being 25 Member States, with 500 more officials. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
