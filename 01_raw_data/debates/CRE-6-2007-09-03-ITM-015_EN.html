<p class="contents">The natural disasters we witnessed in Europe this year come to prove the need for two substantial changes in the way in which we tackle these problems. In the first place, there is a need for the establishment of more flexible mechanisms to assist countries in the process of recovery after natural disasters. Secondly, these problems reveal the need for the establishment of integrated European rapid response forces to supplement the capacity of nations facing such disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, my country Bulgaria suffered from both fires and floods. When massive fires had to be extinguished around one of the big cities, Stara Zagora, the government requested help from the Member States of the European Union but could not receive it because their capacity was busy. Instead, it received support from Russia on the basis of a bilateral agreement. That badly affected the image of the European Union in my country. Therefore I am asking all of you to appeal to the European Commission to make a thorough analysis and draft proposals for the establishment of joint European forces to assist the Member States in their response to disasters and accidents. Thank you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorists abuse the democratic freedoms granted by our countries, such as free travel, media coverage and citizens’ rights, to attain their aims through fear and violence against innocent people.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing this problem calls for an effort to fully uncover and understand the intimate mechanisms of terrorism, including its religious, societal and even civilisational roots. We in the democratic states start with a handicap in this area. While we strive to save lives, terrorists want to cause as many casualties as possible in the hope of being able to manipulate the emotion generated by the images of carnage shown on our television sets.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to distinguish between the suicide bomber and his or her recruiter. Very often, the suicide bomber is not driven by the hate which characterises his or her recruiter, but by the promise of perpetual happiness after an heroic death, which is politically exploited by the recruiter.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention is better than having to react. To that effect, we need to strike the right balance between the immediate and longer-term requirements of the fight against terrorism. We therefore need to strengthen intelligence, police and judicial cooperation between our states while simultaneously addressing the structural causes of terrorism, especially in the countries providing the most recruits for such acts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Adrian Ivanţoc, Tudor Petru Popa and Alexandru Leşko spoke tearfully about the torture they endured in the Transnistrian prisons, and about the repeated abuses and violations of human rights that occurred there. They called on the European Community to take more action, to solve the regional conflict with a view to implementing all international agreements, especially those providing for the retreat of Russian troops from Transnistria. In order to turn these legitimate wishes into reality, the European Parliament should rally and also rely on the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights when it proposes actual measures to support NGOs in Moldova, should encourage and support the publishing of newspapers and magazines in this area and should build a broadcasting network on the right bank of the Nistru in order to ensure that Moldavian national radio and TV channels can be received. Last but not least, there is a desire to radically change how the Transnistrian problem is being negotiated.

On Saturday, Scotland became the first country in Europe to implement a voluntary scheme of real-time closures of fishing grounds, with the aim of safeguarding cod stocks. That scheme, which was developed as a joint initiative between the new Scottish Government and the fishing industry, will hopefully provide a template for future marine conservation projects. I understand that the Scottish Government has engaged with its counterparts in Denmark and Norway with a view to learning from this particular project.</p>
<p class="contents">The common fisheries policy has been nothing but a disaster for Scotland to date, and I firmly believe that the future of fisheries management lies not in central control from Brussels but in direct cooperation between fishing nations.

On that occasion, the leader of the Hungarian Guard made some fairly shocking declarations, expressing his concerns regarding Slovakia and Romania, two countries with Hungarian communities, that could attack Hungary. I think that such organisations and extremist actions encourage separatist movement within the minorities that have already autonomous trends and such a situation is not in accordance with the proper conduct of an EU Member State. Such organisations should be dissolved and attitudes similar to those expressed by the Hungarian Guard should be forbidden and punished by law. Therefore, I take the liberty of calling on the leaders of the EU institutions to firmly condemn such attitudes and to ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to draw up a report on the facts and to monitor the situation faced by the minorities living in Hungary.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to welcome this initiative which will bring this sensitive and -for the most part- unknown issue to the attention of the European citizens , with around 2 and a half million victims every year. Therefore, I would like to draw the attention once again to the fact that in order to have successful results in the fight against this phenomenon, Member States should coordinate their efforts more efficiently. Currently, national laws do not allow this. Yet Member States have available to them the 2005 European Council Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, which represents the most comprehensive legal instrument for fighting this phenomenon. However, until now, only 18 of the 27 Member States have signed up to this Convention and only 3 Member States have ratified it. That is why, I am taking the liberty in asking the European Commission to request the power to sign the Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings on behalf of the European Communities from the Council. Mr President, trafficking in human beings is a serious breach of human rights. We now have to move from words to deeds. It is time to act in order to make it easier to punish traffickers , and to protect victims’ rights.

The Romanian Government unfortunately postponed the initial date for the European Parliament elections, that is 13 May, until 25 November. Analysts say that the main reason for this postponement was fear of certain political parties, including the governing parties, concerning the outcome of these elections. An old Romanian proverb says “you can run but you cannot hide”. The Romanian Government is afraid not only of these elections but also, unfortunately, is afraid of women. There is no woman in the Government and this is something particular in the EU Member States. Among the current 35 Romanian MEPs, 12 are women. After the November elections, the political parties should be able to change the gender ratio and they should designate at least 18 women in the European Parliament. I would like to assure you that the Democrat Party -as a member of the European Popular Party- will act in this way. Therefore, I would like to remind the Romanian Prime Minister that Romania is part of the European Union as of 1 January and that 2007 is the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In July the European Commission issued an ultimatum, giving Poland one month in which to submit plans to reduce the shipyard’s production capacity. The Commission is calling for the closure of two of the three slipways at Gdansk, if the shipyard is not to be required to return the State aid it has received from the Government of Poland since 1 May 2004. The EU Commissioners claim that the Commission’s intention is to modernise the shipyard, not close it. In fact, such a drastic reduction of production capacity with the closure of two out of the three slipways would make the facility unprofitable. In practical terms, it would result in the loss of a great many jobs and ultimately in the collapse of the shipyard.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gdańsk shipyard is not, however, simply an ordinary shipbuilding facility employing a great many workers. It is also one of the most important symbols of the contemporary history of Poland and of our united Europe, namely the birthplace of the <span class="italic">Solidarity </span>movement<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament ought to urge the European Commission to seek an appropriate solution to this situation, one that would give priority to the good of the facility and of its workers. In our role as the voice of European society we should express our solidarity with the shipyard’s workers, and insist on a solution ensuring both the shipyard’s stability and respect for this symbol of the history of contemporary Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last week I published my second annual report on that very subject. By calculating the direct and indirect costs, I established that EU membership costs Britain at least GBP 60.1 billion per annum gross, or GBP 50.6 billion per annum net. That equates to over GBP 1 000 gross, or GBP 843 net, for every man, woman and child in the UK. Put another way, that is GBP 114 000 per minute gross or GBP 96 000 per minute net. The majority of the British people realise that this is a colossal waste of money.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no wonder that UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown is refusing to give the British people a referendum on the new reform treaty. If he thinks that the EU is value for money, he should accept my challenge and commission an independent cost-benefit analysis to prove it.

The European Parliament building is not a meeting house for every group that wants to have a protest at this or that problem throughout the world.
