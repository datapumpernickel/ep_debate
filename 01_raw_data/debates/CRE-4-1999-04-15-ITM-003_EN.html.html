<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Peijs </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (NL)</span> Madam President, last November, the Commission put forward a proposal to extend the current Customs 2000 programme by two years. In September 1997, it wanted to allocate the programme an extra ECU 35 million, but Parliament rejected this – a codecision procedure was not required just for a budget increase. But there seemed to be more involved than just a budget problem: there were problems with the introduction of a computerised transit system which struck at the very heart of the work of the customs authorities. Deadlines were missed and the contractors failed to deliver the required quality of products.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament launched its own investigation and found that drastic policy changes needed to be made. The report on the discharge for 1996 which ultimately led to the fall of the Commission highlighted the problems with the computer system, and since then the Commission has cleaned up its act. A new design for the computerised transit system has been put forward which is more practical and realistic and less ambitious. Parliament is quite happy with the progress the Commission is making at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">In its current proposal, the Commission is proposing the following: to bring all customs operations, staff training and informatics projects under one budget heading; to set up another committee of representatives of the Member States to get the Member States more involved in the programme; and thirdly, to open the programme up to associated countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has a number of problems with this proposal. Firstly, we cannot accept the Commission"s original proposals about the new committee. In addition to the existing Customs Policy Committee made up of the directors‐general of the customs administrations in the Member States, the Commission wants to set up a new committee to implement the programme. Parliament wishes to have only one committee. A possible solution could be found if the Policy Committee delegated the implementation of the programme to a second committee – so there would be two levels of the same committee – but the directors‐general remained responsible for it. This would be sure to increase the involvement of the Member States, which is, after all, what the Commission wants.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to my own amendments, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy accepted many of the amendments put forward by the draftsmen of opinions, Mr Bardong and Mr Brinkhorst, on making the implementation of the programme more transparent for Parliament and for industry. The Commission has a great deal to gain from involving market operators more in the programme. It is often forgotten that they have a lot of in‐house expertise and could make the Commission"s work a good deal easier. Express delivery firms, for example, have been working for years with computer systems covering the entire globe.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently saw a demonstration of the new computer system and it looked very promising. But of course it still needs to prove its usefulness in practice, linked up to terminals in 3 000 customs offices and the firms that are to use it.</p>
<p class="contents">In one of the amendments, I have said that Parliament wishes to be kept informed of any delays that might arise in the development of the new computer system, and I would urge the Commissioner to take this very seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a financial problem in the Council. The Commission thinks it will need EUR 142 million for the programme up to the year 2002. Before the Berlin summit, Germany and the Netherlands in particular expressed doubts about the level of funding but without really justifying their hesitation, and Germany and the Netherlands are vitally important to the running of Europe"s customs services. You cannot send a parcel from Rotterdam, Europe"s biggest port, to anywhere in Europe without it passing through German territory. Hopefully both countries were sufficiently reassured about the funding at the Berlin summit. I will come back to this in a moment and then we can perhaps reach a solution fairly quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be voting for all the amendments, Madam President. Amendment No 5 is the only one that is out of the ordinary, and it is very topical after the Berlin summit. It concerns a point of principle for Europe and was tabled by Mr Brinkhorst as the draftsman of an opinion. As a Dutch citizen, I find his position difficult to accept, but as rapporteur I have to say that he is 100 % correct. It is not true that a growing proportion of the European Union"s already very limited own resources are disappearing into the pockets of the Member States. The Court of Auditors has established that the 10 % deduction as reimbursement of the collection costs is already excessive. This figure has now been increased to 25 %. It is thus basically a subsidy in disguise and is to be rejected on principle. When they themselves are not affected, the Member States always reject this kind of thing anyway, except for now.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Brinkhorst </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. ‐</span> The common customs tariff is one of the most concrete signs of the common identity of the European Union. There are about 120 000 officials in the Member States' administrations. The European Commission has about 120 – one thousandth of that figure – which once again shows how ludicrous it is to claim that we are working with an over‐centralised bureaucracy in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Against that background the Customs 2000 programme is absolutely essential to demonstrate that we are more than simply a group of individual countries working in a general area. Failing a common administration, Customs 2000 is an extremely important management tool for harmonised rules, automation and so on. It is significant that Member States sometimes find it difficult to improve on the Customs 2000 programme's efficiency. I refer to the transit inquiry which has given it a boost.</p>
<p class="contents">Speaking on behalf of the Committee on Budgets, I am very pleased with the cooperation with Mrs Peijs, the rapporteur, and very pleased that she has taken over our amendments. These amendments try to improve the action against fraud and she has pointed to the most important one, the question of how to relate collection costs to performance criteria. Indeed, after the European Council, 25 % is going back into the pockets of the Member States. But the idea of common performance criteria remains absolutely essential and it is against that background I would ask the Commissioner what impact he believes the European Council has on the attitude of the common customs authorities and whether they will now become even more relaxed than before.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also against that background that the Committee on Budgets' amendments to harmonise the Common Customs Committee, to have one overall committee to operate the common customs tariff, have been adopted. We must simplify, we must harmonise. This is the direction that has been taken by Commissioner Monti, whom I welcome here again today, carrying out what I suppose will be one of his last official duties, because he has supported this idea and I am very happy that he will also be able to defend it before the Council.</p>

With effect from the year 2001, they want to hold back 25 % of this revenue rather than 10 % as at present, even though these are traditionally the EU's own resources. I consider that unwarranted, especially since the Member States are not contributing much to the creation of a Community customs service. But we need the common customs tariff and the rest to lay the foundations of such a service. Even though Parliament, in the conciliation procedure, may have dropped its earlier demand for the development of a common customs administration, that nevertheless remains our goal.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussions, the recurring question was whether the Member States even merit the 10 % they retain for administrative expenditure, in other words whether the figure of 10 % is at all justifiable. Today we have to consider an amendment based on the firm belief that this percentage is too high. Moreover, an amendment has also been tabled which calls on the Commission to submit performance criteria that can be used to monitor the levying of customs duties by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">From the conciliation proceedings on the first Customs 2000 proposal, this lack of commitment on the part of the Member States has been plain to see. The Commission was not exactly able to record much progress either in its interim report of July 1998. Coordination with the Member States and development of the risk‐assessment system remain inadequate. Although the Commission praised itself in the report, a contrasting picture had emerged from the Court of Auditors' report of 1997. It does have to be said that, coming six years after the entry into force of the single market and 29 years after the entry into force of the customs union, this is hugely disappointing. The Committee on Budgetary Control is not satisfied with this state of affairs. However, we have refrained from tabling any further amendments so that some long overdue progress can be achieved. The adverse effects of irregularities, delays and fraud in this field are considerable and have made a very noticeable difference to revenue levels. This is certainly not a time when the Member States of the European Union could afford to make such sizeable concessions in terms of their own resources.</p>

How can we hope to combat tax fraud and organised crime or to protect the financial and budgetary interests of the EU if there is still no link between the various customs computer systems, despite the possibilities offered by the Customs 2000 programme or the IDA programme for computerisation of customs activities?</p>
<p class="contents">Six years after completing the single market, we have to agree that the results are disappointing. There is a lack of cooperation between Member States. The customs authorities in many countries are still in the age of paper and manual processing, having totally failed to make the technological transition to the demands of modern society. The rapporteur"s acquiescence in proposing that finalising computerisation of the Transit system should be delayed until 30 June 2003 reflects very badly on the apparent value of the results obtained up to now in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">These delays sit ill alongside the explosion in trade that the world will see in coming years, with a risk that the Union"s resources will be badly hit because they have been robbed of a significant part of their most important own resources: customs duties and agricultural levies. How can we explain the lack of effective and consistent training of officials in the different customs administrations, although the Matthaeus programme came into force over six years ago? When we talk about customs processing what comes to mind is a negative image of red tape, inefficiency and unnecessary duplication. So we cannot support the Commission"s proposal to set up yet another committee, which would overlap with the work of the Customs Policy Committee. We have had enough duplication already!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, I am very grateful to the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, for her contribution to and support for this Commission proposal amending the Customs 2000 programme. The rapporteur, Mr Brinkhorst and Mr Bardong, among others, have explained very clearly the scope and importance of the proposal, and I shall therefore leave it at that and simply set out the Commission"s position on the amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first say that the Commission is able to accept a substantial number of amendments – namely Amendments Nos 2, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12 to 17 and 19 – and I shall say no more about them. As far as Amendment No 1 is concerned, the Commission takes the view that a general provision, in the form of a code of conduct, exists already. The proposal does not therefore seem to be the proper place for that provision.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Amendment No 3, the first part of the text is acceptable, except for the final sentence reading: ‘whereas this will result in a four‐year delay compared to the initial target date". Not only does the Commission fully understand Parliament's concern about the delay in applying the computerised transit system, it has already had occasion to explain what it is doing in practical terms to bring the project rapidly to completion, and I am grateful to Mrs Peijs, Mr Kellett‐Bowman and Mr Herman, who did us the honour of attending an initial practical demonstration of the system on 31 March. The last sentence of Amendment No 3 is, however, inappropriate in a legal text. Nevertheless, I can assure you that both I and my staff are making constant efforts to ensure that the work is done as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 refers to Amendment No 16. The final part of the text, which concerns the performance of the Member States, the performance criteria, is acceptable, and I regard it as very important. Although the Commission understands the reason for the change, the first part of the text, which takes up a broader issue concerning own resources, would fit better within the framework of the legislation on own resources than in this proposal. Moreover, the text goes beyond the scope of the article to which it refers, Amendment No 16.</p>
<p class="contents">We are able to accept the substance of Amendment No 8 to the extent that the committee in question takes over the work of the Customs Policy Committee, and I shall return to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 9 is acceptable on the point of transparency in relation to Parliament and the customs authorities. However, it goes without saying that there has to be a degree of confidentiality in regard to economic operators, particularly for legal reasons bound up with combating fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 is in principle acceptable to the Commission, provided that the committee that is set up to administer the Customs 2000 programme takes over the current responsibilities of the Customs Policy Committee. That committee was in fact set up on the basis of Article 3 of the initial version of the Customs 2000 programme as an instrument of partnership between the Commission and the Member States. This amendment has also to be viewed in connection with Amendment No 18, and here the Commission believes it can accept the first paragraph, but it must be inserted where it most makes sense, in the text of Article 3 of the initial Customs 2000 proposal. Article 3, to which Amendment No 11 relates, concerns the application of the programme and the partnership between the Commission and the Member States. We therefore think it appropriate to combine the two proposed texts.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept the second paragraph of Amendment No 18. As far as the first sentence of the text goes, given the wide range of issues up for discussion in the context of Customs 2000, the Commission prefers to leave it to the Member States to decide whether to take part with more than one representative, so as to be able to discuss specific issues. That, moreover, is the approach consistently taken in relation to comitology, which cannot require Member States with different administrative practices to adopt a single organisational model. In any event, as far as expenditure is concerned, Community funding will be provided for a single delegate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to accept the second part of the text, because the current rules relating to comitology do not allow the applicant countries to attend the meetings. That point should, however, be viewed in the context of Article 19 of the new proposal which provides for the Customs 2000 programme to be opened up to the applicant states generally. The specific rules governing the opening‐up of the programme will be adopted within the framework of the relevant association councils, and those decisions will also cover participation in the meetings by the applicant countries. The final paragraph of Amendment No 18 is not acceptable: as I said earlier, the confidential nature of some of the issues to be discussed means that the Commission cannot agree to the committee's meetings being held in public.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the second paragraph of Amendment No 20 is not compatible with the general principles adopted by the Commission, the Council and Parliament in their declaration of 6 March 1995 on including financial provisions in legal instruments, and the paragraph cannot therefore be taken on board.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Madam President, summarises the Commission's view at this stage in the legislative procedure. Let me once again thank the committees, the rapporteurs and Parliament in general for the substantial and constructive work that has been done in this very specific area, which is extremely important, both symbolically and practically, to the operation of the European Union.</p>

We have already had very detailed discussions on this issue and I think we can manage without a conciliation procedure, because some of the objections are so minor that I hardly think my colleagues in the House will argue against them. We will take them into account in the hope of producing something that is generally acceptable apart from one or two basic points, and those will keep.</p>
