We are approaching second reading after overcoming a number of difficulties encountered recently with translations and amendments – even now, this evening, the facility for tabling amendments is open until 7 p.m; in fact, it is about to close. In any case, this issue is of such significance as to require some in-depth comments.</p>
<p class="contents">We have conducted a lengthy debate, both direct and indirect, with the Commission. I would like to thank Commissioner Bolkestein and all the members of his staff for losing no time in addressing the issue. We have worked on it together on many occasions, outside the Chamber, outside Parliament but within the institutions, in an attempt to achieve the best possible outcome. I would like to thank all the Members who have made useful contributions through their interest, their input and the amendments they have deemed it necessary to table. It is a major, important reform which is coming to the end of the Parliamentary process after a period which has lasted for almost the whole of this legislature. Simplification, the alignment of technological and social development and the completion of the internal market were and are still the imperative goals driving Parliament. Debate, dialogue and the diversity of political positions and national interests have stimulated and shaped the conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Public works, public supply and public service contracts account for EUR 1400 billion each year in the Union, which means and shows that this legislation concerns the very powerhouse of the Community’s economy. We are drawing up general, fundamental rules, on the basis of which specific national rules will be laid down. These general rules must contain principles which will be useful to all, not just to a few, which will be useful to the Community as a whole, not just to partisan lobbies; rules which will provide certainty, transparency, fair competition and an internal market which is open to all. Procurement rules cannot and must not differ according to the value: administrative procedures may differ above or below an appropriate threshold, but the principles cannot differ. At present, the thresholds mean that only about an eighth of the sum I quoted relates to European competitions. The rest is lost because of national or regional regulations. For this reason, I for my part acknowledge that the thresholds should be abolished. However, since that cannot happen, a requirement has been proposed which, moreover, already exists indirectly, according to which the basic principles of the legislation must, at any event, always be observed, including by independent territorial legislation. It is necessary for all possible procedures to be modernised and for the use of increasingly rapidly developing technologies to be permitted and codified. The awarding bodies will thus benefit from the proposals made, adopting electronic systems not just for the management of competitions and the receiving of bids but for the actual auctions too. Of course, auctions are required to be limited to the purchasing of codified, standardised materials. We want firms’ freedom of organisation to be accorded due value and made use of, with every possibility of subcontracting left open for that share of the work which, once identified, can be entrusted to firms for whom the principal contractor is answerable. In order not to complicate participation in the competition, it is appropriate for partners to be identified after the work has been subcontracted.</p>
<p class="contents">The complex issue – and this has been a very controversial point – of awarding design and execution contracts jointly, appreciated and appreciable for some specific categories of contracts, cannot be a hard and fast rule. It is clearly appropriate and natural to separate services and works, just as it can be clearly appropriate and natural to treat them jointly, subject to prior justification. By respecting this principle we are consolidating qualitative competition too, which would otherwise be in danger of being squeezed out in a purely economic and technological context, being moreover the prerogative of the company alone and therefore not always beneficial to the contracting authority. This principle is the basis for the rapporteur’s proposals. We must remember that we are dealing with a directive which is of high and singular economic importance and, as such, cannot and must not contain rules or principles which are governed by specific legislation such as specific social or environmental requirements. The environmental and social dimensions have processes which are defined and can be defined specifically and therefore made mandatory by means of other vehicles and in other contexts. However, some principles are laid down and proposed in the provision which refer particularly to respect for the needs of disadvantaged groups and the legislation on safety in the workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">The environment – the great victim of our time – is also dealt with exhaustively. Any further excesses in this area are to be avoided. With contracts being awarded on the basis of the most economically advantageous price, there has to be a weighting criterion properly defined in calls for tenders, in that, otherwise, there would be a discretionary power in the <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> application of parameters which has created many legal problems throughout Community territory in the past. The confidentiality of information which, according to the pre-established procedures, is provided to the contracting entity by the interested parties will be protected and safeguarded by specific rules. As regards ‘in-house’ contracts, there are conflicting points of view: the representatives of producers’ associations<span class="bold"> </span>are decidedly against reserving contracts for an enterprise of which the contracting entity is part, even if it has independent legal personality, without a competition, and your rapporteur agrees with them. It has been proposed to extend the causes of exclusion where there are sentences for subsequent offences relating to<span class="bold"> </span>the tendering company on grounds of bankruptcy, unfair behaviour, failure to respect collective work contracts or drug dealing. Lastly, it has been proposed to set up an independent agency to provide control mechanisms for contracts in the Member States. Without prejudice to the possibility of instigating legal proceedings, we hope that this agency will be able to verify the procedures followed and also be able to cancel awards which do not comply with the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the content of the rules under debate, because of their economic significance and because of their employment, social, environmental and economic implications, can be described without any shadow of doubt as essential to the organisation of modern-day society. Differing political positions and different political or bureaucratic points of view mean that a widely supported process is not possible. On the other hand, rejection and referral to committee or conciliation as the – not unproblematic – final stage in producing legislation is both possible and desirable. All this is in the interests of the Union and in the interests of an internal market which must become increasingly consolidated and transparent. The vote taken the day after tomorrow will confirm the democratic process, which there is no doubt that we must all follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I am happy that these two issues have now entered their second reading, as a quick but thorough examination is necessary to avoid the dangers of the proposals not being adopted before the end of this legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common task and aim is to modernise and simplify public procurement rules and in this respect I believe that the texts agreed upon in Council already strike a fair balance among the different interests at stake. Indeed, although there are a few issues that the Commission considers less than ideal, overall these common positions clearly represent an advance compared to the current legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at the substance of most of the amendments tabled to date by Parliament I feel even more convinced of what I said just now. I am therefore fairly optimistic that the vote due to take place later this week will preserve our chances of closing this file in a way that is satisfactory to all three institutions, indeed, in my view quite a number of amendments are already incorporated in one form or another in the common positions. I refer for example to the social aspects – other than social award criteria – where I understand that the main concern of this Parliament is to clarify that both contracting authorities and bidders respect the obligations laid down in social legislation. That concern was also explicitly debated with Council. It is therefore in my view appropriately reflected in the recitals of the current text.</p>
<p class="contents">I am ready to accept that it should be mandatory for contracting authorities and entities to indicate where information on the applicable social, fiscal and environmental obligations may be obtained. Equally, with some redrafting, the Commission could accept Amendment No 29 to the public sector – or classic – directive and Amendment No 26 to the utilities directive, which emphasise certain possibilities which already exist in the social field.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the environmental aspects and in general on the issue of award criteria, the amendments which Parliament has tabled clearly show some differing views. I am ready, as always, to debate further this interesting issue with Parliament through answers to questions, though in respect of the real aim of public procurement rules, as interpreted and confirmed by the European Court of Justice. Indeed, I have no doubt that we all agree that our priority is to make public procurement rules a simplified tool for public bodies to spend taxpayers' money as well as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">These differences of views have often meant that conflicting amendments have been adopted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which, if accepted, would make legislation incoherent. We should perhaps all keep in mind our common stated goal of 'better regulation'.</p>
<p class="contents">This inconsistency is well illustrated by the amendments to the utilities directive concerning award criteria. Let us start by looking at how the common positions deal with this issue. In full accordance with the current state of jurisprudence, the common positions already clarify that environmental characteristics may be used as award criteria and that it is not necessary to show that each and every award criterion taking individually provides an economic benefit for the contracting authorities or entities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sufficient that, taken as a whole, the award criteria meet their proper function: to allow an objective evaluation and comparison of the intrinsic qualities of the product or service and the award of the contract to the most economically advantageous tender.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, therefore, with some concern that I see amendments to the utilities directive that would go well beyond this. The effect of such amendments would be to allow vague, immeasurable elements, for the benefit of civil society in the broadest sense, to be used as award criteria. That would not only prevent award criteria from playing their proper role, but also introduce an unacceptable degree of arbitrary choice, or perhaps even discrimination to the detriment of potential contractors.</p>
<p class="contents">In respect of social award criteria, we should also keep in mind that the common positions already clarify that such criteria may be used where they meet the same conditions as environmental award criteria. However, these amendments to the utilities directive would permit social award criteria to be used to meet social policy objectives concerning the behaviour or the social responsibility of the tenderer, rather than the intrinsic qualities of the product or service in question. This could lead to the award of contracts on the basis of considerations which have nothing to do with the principal of better value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">On the amendments aimed at favouring small and medium enterprises, I should like to stress that information available to us does not show that SMEs currently encounter any major difficulty in gaining access to public tenders. Their European federation even told us that they would not support any positive discrimination in favour of SMEs vis-à-vis big enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, we should all be careful not to introduce changes which might <span class="italic">de facto</span> lead to national preferences which are incompatible with Community law and which might end up protecting economic interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me draw the attention of Parliament to the sensitive issue of thresholds, which may be the one where our divergence of views may be very hard to reconcile. My aim is to ensure effective competition at European level. If we increase the thresholds, not only would we breach our international obligations, but we would also reduce efficiencies. If we raise the thresholds we do not necessarily simplify life for local authorities, which are in any case subject to an obligation of adequate publicity under the current case-law of the European Court of Justice. That is why the Commission cannot accept those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with the interinstitutional agreement on better regulation we have recently reached, we all share the three objectives on modernising, simplifying and increasing the flexibility of the current rules. It is in this spirit that I have some reluctance in accepting some further amendments relating to different subjects such as e-auctions, framework agreements, dynamic purchasing systems, the competitive dialogue and the choice between separate or joint awarding of contracts for design and execution of works contracts. In fact, I fear that these amendments would multiply or complicate procedures unnecessarily or impose certain choices at Community level where the necessary flexibility could be better assured by making such choices possible at the national level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say something on some central issues specific to the utilities directive. Concerning the amendments to the mechanism for exempting contracting entities from the directive – Article 30 of the common position – let me stress that the common position is based on two principles, legal certainty and real, effective liberalisation. The Commission is therefore of the opinion that the presence of genuine competition should be established by a known procedure. Otherwise, neither contracting entities nor interested suppliers would be sure of their legal position.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also opposed to other initiatives regarding specific sectors, which would permit exclusion on the basis of free access alone, irrespective of whether or not this results in effective and real competition. For essentially the same reasons, the Commission cannot accept the proposed changes concerning postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, concerning the 'intra-group' exception of Article 23, the Commission already made it clear that it has major difficulties in accepting the extension of this exclusion to works and supply contracts. It does not however, want to make the directive less flexible than it already is. For that reason, the Commission can accept the fact that the extension to works and supplies contracts should be eliminated, but not that contracting entities should be deprived of the existing flexibility for services.</p>
<p class="contents">In concluding I repeat that I am confident that by focusing on our main common goals to modernise, simplify and ensure an effective use of public money, we can provide a happy ending to the long saga of this reform to public procurement rules. This result is impatiently awaited by European enterprises, public authorities and contracting entities. It will be of great benefit to the European economy as a whole.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will refer to Commissioner Bolkestein’s article in last Saturday’s ‘<span class="italic">Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</span>’ – an article, Commissioner, that you published under your own name – and from which, with your permission, I will quote just one extract: ‘It is important that authorities should get the highest possible return on taxpayers’ money, and that this important economic sphere should be fully opened up to competition in the internal market, as open and competitive procurement guarantees an improvement in services of general interest, ensures that public goods are used effectively, prevents corruption and stimulates both economic growth and the creation of jobs’.</p>
<p class="contents">On that, Commissioner, I can back you 100%; the only problem I have is that I am one of those who believe that what we have received from the Council as a Common Position fails to comply with these very requirements and conditions. I am one of those who take the view that the existing laws on procurement in the European Union have worked so far; they are written down in four directives, to which one must add the settled case-law of the European Court of Justice, which was handed down over many years, and which has proved its value. We have doubts as to whether this Common Position, this Council document, is indeed suited to maintaining the quality we have hitherto enjoyed.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us are concerned that the new elements in this directive have not reduced the danger of manipulation, but will end up increasing it. Many are worried that we will have, not more competition, but less. Referring back to this article, let me point out that the representatives of industry to whom I have spoken, were not concerned that this document might result in increased competition, but that there could end up being less of it. I believe that most of my group’s amendments had the specific aim in mind of improving a whole array of crucial points in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect I would like to address is that of the environmental and social criteria, which, as I am well aware, are matters of great contention in this House. I do maintain, though, that European legislation should be right in terms of the legal system, and what that means is that I deal with environmental issues under the heading of environmental legislation and use legislation on social affairs to deal with social issues. The law on procurement is not part of environmental law, or of social security law; it has to do with business law, which means to say that the only issues to be considered in the field of procurement law are those of economic viability. It is for that reason that I have my own grave misgivings as to whether it is in any way right to deal here with issues relating to the environmental and social criteria. It is, though, evidently the majority view both in the Council and – to judge by the outcome of first reading – in this House, that if these matters are to be dealt with, we have to ensure that they are taken into account, not as part of the awarding of the contract, but in the criteria applying when the contract is put out to tender. I regard as unacceptable anything that, in relation to the award of the contract – independently, as it were, of what the various service providers knew when the contract was put out to tender – can end up resulting in further decision-making, or can make it possible for that to be manipulated.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak not only for myself but also for my group when I say that I regret the fact that it has not been possible to come to a compromise beforehand between the groups on the issues raised by this proposal. The end result of this will be a political showdown between the political groups in this House, while the Commission and the Council of Ministers get their directives through; what I fear, quite simply, is that there is little prospect for qualified majorities on the reciprocal amendments. I question whether that is a good thing for this House or for Europe. That concludes the comments that I wanted to make on this proposal on behalf of my group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To our great sorrow, we find that the Council's common position has not accepted many of our amendments, which is why we need to continue our fight and stand firm by our initial positions. Respect for the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>on employment and environmental issues cannot be ignored in the procedure for concluding public contracts. It is not possible for the European Union to be indifferent to such commitments by the Member States in public contracts, when the quality of employment relations and, more generally, the quality of life is now a generally recognised aim of all its policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, just as we are willing to promote companies' social responsibilities in the private sector, it is inconsistent for Member States to be indifferent to issues that constitute companies' core social responsibilities when concluding public contracts. Thus, quality criteria can and must be taken into account by the contracting authorities as a matter of obligation. In the same spirit, infringement of the relevant obligations on the part of candidate companies must act as a reason to disqualify them from the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We would also stress that it is not enough to refer to social and environmental criteria in the preamble, they must also be included in the regulatory text of the directive. The area of public contracts is also an ideal area for taking account of people with disabilities. We therefore welcome the amendment introducing the obligation for contracting authorities to take account of accessibility criteria for people with disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, production agencies must understand that, by helping to implement European social policy, they do not incur an economic burden; on the contrary, they have economic benefits, such as subsidies when public contracts are awarded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore important that we bring about the simplification intended in the Commission’s proposal. I am afraid, however, that we may be in danger of failing in our task of ensuring that this is what happens, because the majority of the committee have voted in favour of a lot of restrictions that may cost European taxpayers dearly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party believes that there are no reasons for raising the threshold values. As has been said on a number of occasions, it would contravene our international obligations. Nor are we convinced by the argument for raising the threshold values on the grounds that there are now so few cross-border tenders. On the contrary, we may find ourselves with more cross-border procurement as a result of simplifying the directive, applying the simplified procedure and having a larger number of electronic tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group is concerned that Parliament’s amendments, for example Amendment No 20, might reduce transparency on the subject of procurement in most Member States. It is important, once a contract has been concluded, for competitors to be able to check that the procedure is being carried out correctly. Amendment No 24 must therefore be rejected. The eagerness with which the other political groups have endorsed Amendment No 20, aimed at increasing secrecy, sometimes leads me to wonder whether we are all aware of what we have decided when it comes to access to EU documents.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group, which is otherwise fairly satisfied with the common position, is, however, anxious that the Council’s position would be less effective than current legal practice in providing opportunities for taking account of environmental aspects. In our view, a procuring authority should be able to go beyond its brief, as narrowly conceived, and take account both of the value to the environment of what is being purchased and of the method by which it is produced. We have therefore again tabled an amendment to Article 53 that, at first reading, was supported by almost the whole of the Chamber. We also wish to reject those amendments by the committee that would shape the directive in such a way as to impede the reorganisation and modernisation of public administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also unhappy about the restrictions that the majority of Parliament have wanted to see imposed upon electronic tenders, involving even stricter regulations than those laid down in the electronic signatures directive. I am amazed at my fellow MEPs’ distrust of electronic signatures, but confidence in fax messages, which often lead to information leaking out.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group wants us, then, to make efforts in the direction of simplification and modernisation. We therefore hope that we shall vote wisely on these matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He urged us, in his closing words, to make sure that we modernise and simplify European Community law and endow it with appropriate flexibility. With this I believe we can all agree. The issue is: which exact text will best achieve that?</p>
<p class="contents">To establish the general orientation of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we thought that the Commission's original proposal was unduly timid and grudging on points such as the environmental and social points. We, and others in Parliament, urged a broader and more generous view – the one that was in due course confirmed by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki tramways case. That was a real advance. It was not just our view, but Parliament's view at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we have the common position. To us, the common position seems to be in some measure a retreat from the high-water mark represented by Parliament's first reading position. We would like to see some aspects of that retreat again reversed. I accept Mr Bolkestein's point that the text, as it came to us from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, is internally inconsistent. I would put that down to the fact that in committee we had an unstable and varying majority, which meant that there was no clear golden thread running through the text that came from the committee. But there is a way of restoring it to consistency, coherence and environmental and social sensibility, which is to adopt the string of amendments, which will pull it back towards Parliament's first reading position and again exhort the Council and the Commission to take a bold step that will continue to serve these valuable goals of modernisation, simplification and flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">My own group will put forward two amendments in particular relating to Article 53 where, for example, we will object to the idea that it must be a tender most economically advantageous for the contracting authorities. We are told that sometimes social or environmental criteria are vague. That seems to be fraught with vagueness – the insistence that it be, as it were, self-referentially back to the authority which is contracting. That would give rise to all manner of disputes. Leave it as we suggest: various criteria linked to the subject of the public contract in question. Do not leave out characteristics, including those relating to production methods or the tender as equal-treatment policy. If these are unacceptably vague then the whole of Community law is unacceptably vague because we are exhorted in the horizontal clauses of the Treaties to attend to these very values!</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be brave! Let us go forward, colleagues! Let us restore the kinds of values that we asserted in the first reading position. Let us get rid of the inconsistencies, but let us get rid of them in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What line is a parliamentary committee to take if the Council’s Common Position differs from Parliament’s position at first reading?</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that the key amendments, given this Parliament’s political vision, should be re-tabled. At present, the promotion of sustainable economic development is high on our list of priorities. We must also take subsidiarity into account, which means that we must not hinder municipalities and regions unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="contents">Studying the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I rubbed my eyes in disbelief. I had been used to a great deal, but the current product deserves to be marked down emphatically as a flop. Some arguments would be enough to make you laugh if they did not concern serious matters.</p>
<p class="contents">What should we make, for example, of the justification to Amendment No 63: I quote: ‘Giving a weighting to each criterion is unrealistic and too mathematical an approach’. It appears that multiplying and adding up are already higher maths for the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market has not acquitted itself of its task effectively, and it is up to plenary to undo the damage with regard to how this Parliament is represented.</p>
<p class="contents">A municipality should be entitled to take environmental criteria into consideration in the award of a public contract. It is with good reason that Helsinki won its case when it procured clean buses. It would surely be too crazy for words if it were not possible to draw a distinction between electricity generated in an environmentally-friendly way and other electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lower authorities should be able to acquire sustainable products and services. This obviously also applies to the governments of the Member States. With a market share of 16% of the GDP, it is precisely the government that should advocate a policy that promotes sustainable products and services. If we were to overlook this, that would give a totally wrong signal to private industry, especially at a time when the latter is starting to gain an understanding of the need for sustainable products and services.</p>
<p class="contents">The package of amendments, which I also signed on behalf of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities, makes the directive acceptable from an environmental perspective, and the subsidiarity principle is respected. With this, we place the responsibility for a policy of sustainability firmly with governments that take concrete decisions as closely to the citizen as possible.</p>

We have already had many discussions in this House which have highlighted the need to support small businesses and the self-employed, along with the need for bureaucracy in tendering procedures to be reduced at the same time as transparency and comprehensibility are increased. Further economic and social progress in the Member States will depend on the fulfilment of both these important demands. Parliament’s demand for threshold values for public contracts – depending of course on the utility involved – to be increased is absolutely justified if we want (a) to reduce the very high costs involved in tendering on a Europe-wide basis, and (b) to give small and medium-sized businesses better opportunities in the European Union. It goes without saying that this heading includes the amendments aimed at reserving 10% of the expenditure on public contracts for small and medium-sized enterprises and at increasing the threshold values in the event of authorities being parties to contracts for the work to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Bolkestein, I really cannot see what you are getting at! I think my group, along with the others, did the right thing in emphasising the importance of invitations to tender containing conditions relating to the management of the environment and guarantees of workers’ health and safety. In principle, this is in line with the sustainability for which the Council opted in Göteborg in 2001, with the economy, ecology, and the social dimension being given equal priority. That someone should argue against that is something that I find utterly baffling. This must apply not only to the way in which the main contractors meet the specified criteria; it goes without saying that it must be binding on the sub-contractors as well. If firms do not produce evidence of how they deal with finances and with their staff, their tenders should be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, though, have doubts about compliance with data protection provisions when contracts are put out to tender electronically. We also support the demand that enterprises or persons who have been declared bankrupt or against whom court cases are pending should be excluded from tendering for public contracts. Rather than this being merely a permitted option, there should be binding rules on this. It stands to reason that exclusion from tendering for public contracts should also be extended to enterprises that had breached the conditions of tender on previous contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">I also ask my fellow Members of this House, when plenary votes on Article 27, to adopt the version of the text included in the Council’s Common Position, for if we do not, then 98.5 % of German collective wage agreements would be excluded as a criterion in invitations to tender, which would put German workers at a disadvantage when competing for the award of contracts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am very grateful to the many colleagues who supported my report. We in this Parliament called for the speedy completion of the internal market and particularly recalled that an effective internal market is a major weapon in the European Union's competitiveness. I want us to return to that in looking at the context of what we are examining here. We want this new proposal – if it goes through in a final form as agreed by ourselves and the Commission – to be the most effective instrument we can devise to, firstly, encourage public authorities to obey and use it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody here has pointed out that the problem with the regime at the moment is that a significant number of contracts that ought to be included in this public procurement regime are not. Why are they not included? It is because the procedures are complicated, because they are being evaded. Also. the counterpart to that is that we want the maximum number of small and large firms to participate in the process. That is what an open and competitive market has to be all about. Therefore, the aims included in the revision of these directives – to make the rules clearer, simpler to operate and unambiguous, and to allow the incorporation of new technologies such as electronic auctions – have to be commended. We are basically satisfied with the direction that those proposals go in because they seem to me to be crucially important.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move forward in other areas as well. There has been a lot of discussion tonight about issues, particularly involving sustainability and ecological procurement. However, there is nothing whatsoever in these proposals that in any way outlaws sustainable or environmentally friendly procurement. Provided that public authorities clearly specify the environmental criteria that the product or service must meet in an unambiguous and non-discriminatory way, then there is nothing to stop them from doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an instrument of internal market and competitiveness policy. It is not a fresh instrument of social or employment policy, nor is it a fresh instrument of environmental policy. We may want to ensure that those criteria are applied in a non-discriminatory way, but companies that comply with all the European rules on environment and on employment criteria must be able to tender in a non-discriminatory way. This is not an instrument for adding new provisions. Therefore, we must be very clear in rejecting any amendments that try to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that colleagues on this side of the House are about to subject us to a whole raft of fresh amendments tonight, so we shall probably have and look forward to looking at a hundred amendments tomorrow for a vote on Wednesday. That seems to me to be an entirely unrealistic thing to do. However, unfortunately, we are forced to do that by the constraints of the timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just wish to draw the House's attention to the merit of Amendment No 68 concerning monitoring. We want the member governments to monitor the application of public procurement rules better and to encourage local authorities to comply with them, because compliance with these new rules will be the test by which this proposal is finally judged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the brief time available to me, I would like to consider two aspects of it.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is that we must fix the threshold values at the level that Parliament wanted at first reading stage. Having them even higher would have been desirable, as experience shows that Europe-wide tendering brings with it a lot of bureaucracy and higher costs that bear no relation to the relatively few offers that are put in. What I particularly want is for the costs and administrative burdens that international tendering entails to be kept down for public contracting authorities, primarily in local government. It was regrettable that, at first reading, we managed an increase only from EUR 5 million to EUR 7 million, for example in building contracts, and the governments in the Council now want to reduce this at second reading. Our second reading amendments in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market held out for at least these EUR 7 million. I very much regret the fact that the demand for a higher – and actually reasonable – threshold value than EUR 7 million is unlikely to be possible in the final reading of the Procurement Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">What is every bit as important to me as playing for millions with the threshold value in the directive on European procurement is the protection of small and medium-sized enterprises from unfair competition. Our self-employed, who abide by the law, must not have life made difficult for them by competitors who keep neither to collective wage agreements nor within the current labour law or health and safety provisions, and who do not give a fig for protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">In so doing, we would be attaching a high value to local self-government, and rightly so, for it is clear that local authorities are the political level closest to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein, you were right to say that taxpayers’ money must be spent in the best way possible. I agree with you on that. However, that does not necessarily mean the cheapest on offer. ‘Best possible’ carries connotations of quality and sustainability, in other words, due regard for social, environmental and other issues.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Bolkenstein thought we could look forward to a happy ending to the long journey towards sound legislation when it came to public procurement. Yes, we can agree upon the fact that the process is coming to an end, but how happy it will be is, I think, something that will be decided in the vote. The Council too has a big influence in this area, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about the amendments tabled by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, because they run directly counter to what we said at first reading. We are all agreed that public procurement is a major economic factor in the EU, accounting for 14-16% of gross national income. When account is taken of the economy, account should not, however, only be taken of the financially most advantageous tender. What is needed is a broader economic definition, also embracing the conservation of natural resources, clean water, clean air and biodiversity. That is precisely what the Commission and the EU in general have said, for example in Johannesburg, namely that public procurement must contribute to sustainable development. It is odd that this has passed certain people in this Chamber by. I heard Mr Lehne say that environment issues must be handled in their own terms and economic issues likewise, but that is to miss the whole point. Public procurement, in which our common resources and common tax money are used, must contribute to sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore of the very greatest importance that we amend the proposal before us from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and remedy the ways in which it has deteriorated since the first reading. The Council’s common position contained incompatible elements and was unacceptable at least where Articles 53 and 55 were concerned. Together with MEPs from other groups, we have tabled amendments concerning the environmental criteria, production methods and the whole life-cycle perspective upon products, environmental labelling and certification. I think that the European Parliament should be ashamed if we did not adapt our view of public procurement to the prevailing view of sustainable development in the EU as a whole. This must become a natural part of public procurement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Sweden, these authorities are used to being regarded as competent economic actors with quite extensive freedom of action. They believe that the Commission’s proposal would, in a number of respects, reduce their efficiency without increasing either competition or legal certainty. They refer to matters such as the right to enter into framework agreements, of which they often make use, concerning intellectual services and building contracts. They mention the new Article 41a, to the effect that award procedures can only be cancelled under very special circumstances. They wonder what would happen, for example, when there was a change in the political majority and wonder if it might not in those circumstances be possible to cancel an agreement entered into. They also refer to a number of other points on which Swedish practice is much more efficient than what is proposed in these directives.</p>
<p class="contents">It is said that public authorities are bureaucratic and inefficient. If that is the case, then it is, in general, due to the fact that we politicians devise exaggeratedly detailed legislation. I think that the Commission’s proposal for a directive on the award of contracts is one such example – I am tempted to say nightmare example – of legislation that creates public sector inefficiency and that gives rise to more problems than it solves. I really do think that the whole proposal for a directive should be withdrawn. The closest I can get to bringing about such an outcome is probably to support an amendment by Mr Manders of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, in which the Commission is called upon to reflect on the situation and reconsider whether the proposal does not create more problems than it solves.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that the situation is different in different countries, but I find it strange that the lowest possible price is a consideration with such a dominant role to play in the Commission’s proposal. When private businesses award contracts, they make an overall assessment of a number of factors, of which price is just one. Why cannot public bodies be viewed in the same way and be given the same freedom to make a complex assessment of tenders submitted? Why, in a legal text, should a list be drawn up of which capricious considerations should, or should not, be taken into account? These lists are arbitrary. Why is the Commission so restrictive when it comes to certain factors such as, for example, social needs and environmental and employment considerations, which have more to do with the quality of the products than with purely quantitative relations?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the Commission should consider tabling instead a directive laying down general principles and guidelines, that is to say one that does not go into details in this way but is instead more interested in how the public administrations are to be made more efficient and democratic in the Member States. It would then be possible to find significantly more flexible solutions to these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Denmark, the supply of water is decentralised and based on a principle of solidarity where accessibility and prices are concerned. In Denmark, the water supply is owned by the consumer and managed locally, and those are very important prerequisites for being able to guarantee that water sources and the environment continue to be protected. Water is a public good. It must not be part of a strategy for the internal market or a means of promoting European industry. In the future, those who control the water supply will be those who wield power over people and money. The multinational companies are exceptionally aware of this, and there is money to be made in this area. It is estimated that, in the EU alone, the market is worth EUR 80 billion per year and that, in 15 years’ time, large monopolies will control 65-75% of what are now public water supplies.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of directives, including the two we are debating today, have now incorporated water as a commodity and are in the process of standardising countries’ water supplies with the purpose of liberalising them and guaranteeing that drinking water is subject to free competition throughout the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Experience in the UK and elsewhere is frightening. It demonstrates that, when the water supply is turned into a commodity and privatised, interest in the protection of resources also disappears. In fact, London’s private water suppliers lobbied enthusiastically, and on equal terms with the European chemical industry, for our simply allowing larger quantities of crop sprays in drinking water when the EU negotiated limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">The world’s total accessible fresh water resources are scarce. There are now already countries in which it is drinking water, rather than food, that is in short supply. Liberalising the water supply would mean that the fight for water would overtake that for oil. That is a frightening prospect.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the EU is impeding Denmark’s efforts to safeguard our groundwater against pollution, while the EU is in the process of lifting a number of the bans on pesticides imposed in Denmark. The EU must not also destroy the Danish principle according to which the water supply must be public and always owned by the consumer and managed by the owner – an important and crucial prerequisite for security of supply and the protection of water sources. It must be up to the individual country democratically to decide which model they wish to adopt for the supply of their water.</p>
<p class="contents">Another little thing that naturally pleases me, since I live on one of Denmark’s many small islands, is that it has now been realised how completely useless it is to invite tenders for the running of our little ferries and that the process has now begun of drawing up a specific directive exempting these small ferries from the awarding of contracts. This is something I of course very much welcome, but it illustrates the fact that there is something fundamentally wrong with the EU’s demand for tenders to be invited in connection with every task. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It appears from this debate that the opinion-forming process is not yet complete. In committee, too, we were constantly arguing whether it is possible to modify the Council’s Common Position, or whether, in order to improve it, we first have to reject it.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a case in which I have to say that, for my own country, Austria, the advantages of this directive outweigh its disadvantages, not least because, on 1 September 2002, we implemented a new procurement law which owes much to the directive and to the draft directive. Whilst, on the one hand, the new rules modernise procurement legislation, the directives also incorporate important clarifications for their practical implementation, and the result is meant to be more transparent and fairer invitations to tender.</p>
<p class="contents">I want, briefly, to consider four points. Firstly, the provision for the possible use of electronic media strikes me as being particularly important. The introduction of <span class="italic">e</span>-procurement is one of the new directive’s key elements, and from the new electronic procurement instruments we can expect sustained good progress. These instruments should, however, apply solely to standardised goods and services.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that, in Austria, there is in fact opposition to the increase in threshold values, as this would go against the opening-up of central, regional and local markets for procurement and, even today, covers only a small percentage of the contracts awarded under the EU’s procurement system. We take the view that any further increase over and above what was proposed in the Common Position would restrict the scope of the directive, which is, after all, aimed at producing greater transparency and more fairness in invitations to tender.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention, thirdly, the newly introduced procurement procedures and rules for central procurement offices, which make it possible to have a system of procurement organised on modern lines.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, let me say something about the disagreement on secondary purposes. One reason why I have no problem with these is that Austrian procurement law takes secondary purposes into account, although there is no target set by law. I see it, however, as a requirement that all secondary purposes should be relevant to the contract, which means that they have a direct connection with it; any alternative is a recipe for arbitrariness on the part of the body awarding the contract and for the foreclosure of the market. If there are to be secondary purposes, they must be clearly defined, and that cannot be done anonymously.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I do not know what the outcome of tomorrow’s vote will be, I do believe it to be important that we should get this procurement law, and as quickly as possible, as it will benefit the internal market, bring about greater transparency, and make for more fairness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is public funds – taxpayers’ money – that is being used, and procurement must therefore, of course, be carried out in such a way that taxpayers get the best possible value for their money. It is also important that the quality should be good. All this could be summarised in the words ‘high-quality goods and services at the right prices’.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, this is not all that simple because it is not only the price that is decisive. It is important that whoever produces the goods or services should do so under fair conditions. It is also important that they should do so in a way that is environmentally correct. Current laws, regulations and collective agreements concerning social protection and health, both at national and Community levels, must be applied when goods and services are purchased. The working environment must be good and the salary conditions fair but, at the same time, this decision must not create rules that interfere with labour law as applied in the Member State concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I have tabled amendments on the same lines as those tabled by, for example, Bill Miller, who addresses this issue. It is also important for the procuring authority or administration to be able to cancel a contract if it no longer needs the goods or services in question. A new municipal or national government may want to conduct a policy that does not require as much in terms of purchases as that of the previous political leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision we are now to take must not restrict democracy or people’s ability to change direction following general elections. Public procurement is about making provision for the needs people want to see fulfilled by the society about which they have made decisions in political elections. An exaggerated ambition to look after the interests of the market must not take precedence over the needs of people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

State money attracts them. How could the great construction and public works consortiums have built their financial empires, indeed, without state contracts? How would armaments consortiums survive if there were no public money?</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called market economy is on a life-support machine, kept alive by the state on a saline drip. It is no coincidence that public market harmonisation is progressing so slowly. The big industrial cartels would like to keep access to their own state’s money hostage even as they lay their hands on the public money of the country next door. As to the conditions for award of markets, the rules which are beginning to emerge reflect, in their desiccated bureaucratism, a cynicism bordering on sincerity. Under these conditions for the award procedure, the monetary value of the offer is the only thing that matters. Environmental and health requirements have been forgotten, to the justifiable indignation of Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth. The same fate has befallen working conditions and workers’ remuneration in the companies which are pocketing public money. Also forgotten are so many other aspects, such as archaeological research. Forgotten, last of all, are the interests of society in general. Returns are all that counts. Social organisation has been reduced to a balance sheet.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, under the pretext of coordinating procedures in the water, energy, transport and postal service markets, the Council is trying to enshrine these as intrinsically no more than that: markets, rather than vital services for the whole of society. No! Those water, energy and transport services, those postal services, must be and remain public services. They cannot be surrendered to these private groups, who are concerned with their own profits and not with the interests of users.</p>

<p class="contents">We are of course in agreement with you on the aims of simplification, modernisation and proper use of public finances. Who would not be? You forget other aims, however. My fellow ecologists and I have reminded you what they are: the aims of sustainable development. We feel that public markets and the means by which they are awarded are extremely important levers for realising those aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do you reject, as you have pointed out, the amendment introduced by us to Article 53(1) of the classic directive, in which we allude to environmental characteristics, but also to modes of production? Why refuse to allow the contracting authorities to give preference to modes of production based on rational use of energy, for example? That seems incredible to me.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in Article 23 of the directive, why refuse to refer to another aspect of Community legislation, European eco-labels, justifying yourself by arguing that these are a non-mandatory set of guidelines? Very well, then. Make the aforesaid guidelines into one of the criteria for awarding public markets and encourage businesses to respect this type of eco-label. That would fit in perfectly with the aim of introducing an integrated sustainable development programme, an aim promoted by the European Parliament and the European Council. The tool of public markets could help us towards that aim.

<p class="contents">The first concerns paragraph 2 of Article 27 in the classical directive and the equivalent text in the utilities directive. It is important that we leave out the phrase 'collective agreements declared or deemed to be generally binding'. That phrase would create difficulties and legal uncertainty, most particularly in Germany and the Scandinavian Member States. I have worked very closely with the European Trade Union Confederation and with the public service unions both at first reading and second reading and I have received – and a number of Members here will have received – a large number of representations from concerned individuals in those countries. I hope, via split votes, that we can leave that text out of the finished text at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern applies to Article 53 in the classical directive. Several amendments will probably be on offer to align this text with that of Article 55(1), in the utilities directive, as it now stands following the adoption of an amendment by Mr Karlsson in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">I disagree with what Commissioner Bolkestein said earlier on this point. If we align the classical directive with the text of Article 55(1) of the utilities directive, we would be bringing them into line with the emerging jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. Not to do so would be a retrograde step. The Commissioner and his services have consistently given far too negative an interpretation of ECJ jurisprudence on this point and that is why we have such clear difficulties emerging in our debate here over applying environmental and social considerations.

We want to create innovation. Would you agree with me that we will not create innovation by imposing standards on ecological or social issues? This is only the lower level. In a market economy there are factors wish push the market and factors which pull the market: the stick and the carrot.</p>
<p class="contents">What we want, when we speak about introducing ecological criteria or fair-trade criteria, is to create a market for innovation in ecology, fair trade and social issues. Therefore we need clear criteria on this in the directive. That is the only thing we need. That is why we are pushing this so much. It has enormous leverage – 15% of the European internal product. If we are serious about sustainability we have to use this. It is not via fierce competition in the private sector that this innovation will come. It will be because the public sector takes more responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Bolkestein, why do we disagree on this point? Because your Europe is a Europe of big multinational companies where there is no ecology, no social rights and where the poor people live in their poor working conditions. My Europe is a Europe of citizens. I am proud of this. If we have to fight over this issue it is because you have a very new, liberal approach to Europe and we do not want that.</p>

<p class="contents">I think it is a huge problem when the Council adopts a common position that is not in accordance with current law as laid down by the Court of Justice. The fact that the Court lays down something of which the Council takes no account is a major problem, and matters are not made any better by our also having a committee that chooses not to take account of the Court pronouncements we have. I believe that we in the EU have a clear obligation to promote our own objectives concerning sustainable development and to comply with our social responsibility. That means that we must also be able to incorporate social and environmental considerations into public procurement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to some of those on the right wing who, in Parliament today, have accused us of being rabid environmental campaigners, that what is important in this case is that we in actual fact want to make public procurement transparent and to make it possible for social and environmental provisions to be incorporated into such procurement without, of course, disturbing the internal market. No one is talking about disturbing the internal market. We are all of us concerned that the internal market should operate properly, but we just want to make it possible for those who invite tenders to attach importance to things other than just price, that is to say to a broadly-based labour market, social conditions and the environment. It is in actual fact very simple, and fortunately we have a decision on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing I have to mention is that, during the first reading, we tabled a number of amendments to Article 27, in actual fact emphasising the aspect of labour market conditions. As Mr Hughes said, a curious change has, however, again crept into the amendment whereby it has been made conditional upon the aforementioned agreements being made law in the Member States. It is therefore essential to have that clause removed before we vote on the recommendation for second reading on Wednesday. There is no reason for interfering with the collective agreements we have in certain countries, and that is what in actual fact would be happening if the small clause in question were not removed. I recommend to the House here today that it consider adopting Amendment No 40 but that it avoid also accepting this clause. I hope we can in that way support the split vote proposed by Mr Hughes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Philips and Daf were in dire straits. It was a time of high unemployment as a result of all kinds of developments in international industry. In those days, there was a covenant involving industry and the municipality on building in a sustainable manner. There was little employment in the building industry. Then, we discovered that in Groningen, there was a model for European contracts which was able to meet a number of criteria, for example with regard to equal working conditions and social legislation, but also to the regional labour market’s employment criteria and to environmental criteria. We found this valuable and subsequently applied it.</p>
<p class="contents">This would, to a large extent, be allowed on the basis of the current proposals. However, the problem that is causing anxiety for many is that the Christian Democrats, and particularly the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, have accepted a number of amendments on the basis of which it would no longer be possible to spend public funds in this transparent, non-discriminatory way that serves regional causes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about socially responsible entrepreneurship to ensure that financial, social and environmental objectives are integrated into a strategic policy. We should, however, be fighting for socially responsible government even more than for socially responsible entrepreneurship. We could then, if we take transparency into account, also avoid the likelihood of fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, we agree to a number of the objectives that Mr Bolkestein mentioned, such as legal certainty and effective spending, but integral policy means that we should also include a number of other criteria, and that is what, in my view, we should vote for tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Together with Mr Bill Miller, I was trapped on a Strasbourg city bus, the driver of which could not find the way, initially to Frankfurt and then back to Strasbourg, and got us to Strasbourg via many German autobahns and with something of a delay.</p>
<p class="contents">Belatedly, but not too late, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the great deal of work he has done and, in particular, for resisting his first temptation, that of giving in to quite understandable disappointment that the Council has taken up so little of what Parliament has proposed and therefore going all out for a rejection of the Common Position. This was something we discussed in the committee, where a majority of us took the view that – even if it proved a wearisome exercise – we should attempt to make improvements to the Common Position.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, of course, that the debate about rejection of this Common Position is far from over. I do not know if, perhaps, another amendment has been tabled this evening with this in mind; that there is a great temptation to do so has to do with the fact that, whilst the Council took on board quite a bit of what Parliament had proposed, this tended to be harmless technical points, whilst the major issues of substance were utterly ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">What still counts from my point of view is that, in both draft directives, I can see substantial improvements over against the current legal position, and certainly as regards modernisation, simplification, the introduction of electronic tendering procedures or the use of electronic media in the tendering process, and the ways in which things are made easier for specific sectors. For example, I am very glad that this Parliament’s initiative has succeeded in getting postal services included in the utilities directive.</p>
<p class="contents">If though, on the one hand, we can speak in terms of progress, we should beware, at the same time, of ending up going backwards. There has already been much debate about the award criteria, and I would like to again shed light on something that is obviously not yet clear, namely that the text now provided in the Common Position represents a retrograde step <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the current legal position and removes the legal basis on which the Court of Auditors could make very favourable judgments. The result is that these award criteria will be more restrictive in future. Being more restrictive in this area does not mean merely that I do not want options – of an ecological nature, for example – that are currently available to me; my concern is, rather, with the issue of democracy. Local authorities are among the most important bodies in Europe as a whole when it comes to awarding contracts. Mr Bouwman mentioned an example from the one where he lives. As institutions, local authorities enjoy direct democratic legitimacy, and if, for example, they come to realise that – even if it comes rather more expensive – they want wooden window frames produced by sustainable forestry, then let them in future be able to have them. They are responsible to their own citizens and to their auditors, and nowadays they do not exactly have much money sloshing around.</p>
<p class="contents">That is also my objection to what Mr Karas said. If we are struggling to make improvements, our primary concern here is with restoring the current legal position rather than with going back to what preceded it; secondly, this is not about mandatory criteria along the lines of every contract-awarding body having to apply every conceivable criterion; rather, it is about them being able to do so if that is what they would like to do and if they are transparent in the way they do it. As it is at present framed, the obligatory part can have only one meaning, that these options are restricted. Although the recitals reintroduce the possibility of a number of things, I find that rather unpleasing from the point of view of legal policy, and I do not think it does much for legal certainty either.</p>
<p class="contents">As reference has been made in this debate to the inconsistencies that remain, there is an offer I would like to renew. Perhaps we could, by aligning our voting lists tomorrow, recover something of what the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market produced? I can also announce that we will no longer be supporting all the amendments that we supported in the Committee on Legal Affairs; this will enable us to take with us rather fewer amendments into the conciliation procedure that now appears, unfortunately, to be unavoidable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to give a clear lead to our local authorities or to our public – in some cases private – utilities. Above all, it is important that we give a clear lead to the workforces operating within those contracting authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market unfortunately did not provide that transparent, workable directive. What we have is two directives, which are not in line with each other. In fact, in certain areas, they are actually contradictory. The Legal Affairs Committee missed an opportunity to advance the social provisions to workers. It has advanced – to give it credit – the case of workers with disabilities. But we could have gone further.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am reintroducing my Amendment No 166, which was adopted at first reading by a large majority. Now certain groups seem to have gone cold on it. Amendment No 166 to Article 53(1) and (2) reintroduces the flexibility contracting authorities require when deciding on awarding contracts, not just being bound by the lowest price.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be made clear to all those companies that intend to tender for these contracts that they have to introduce social and environmental conditions for their own workforces or they will not get the contracts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, thank you for giving me the floor a second time on this important matter. I would like to reply to some of the points raised. I would like to elucidate what I said earlier so that no misunderstandings remain between what this Parliament would like to see the Commission do, and what the Commission itself intends to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly I refer to what Mr MacCormick said right at the beginning of this debate, which was also repeated by other speakers. Mr MacCormick referred to the current state of jurisprudence. In accordance with that jurisprudence, the common position already clarifies that environmental characteristics and social clauses may be used as award criteria and that it is not necessary that each and every award criterion taken individually can be shown to provide an economic benefit for the contracting authorities or entities. It is sufficient that taken as a whole the award criteria can carry out their proper function, which is to allow an objective evaluation and comparison of the intrinsic qualities of the products or services offered and by the award of the contract to the most economically advantageous tender. Here I would also refer to Mr Harbour's remarks, with which the Commission agrees.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mrs Thors and Mr Junker referred to production methods. I should like to reply that regarding the amendments which aimed to insert explicit references to production methods, the Commission is of the opinion that it is superfluous to do so since production methods are a part of the environmental characteristics which, as I have just said, are already allowed for. Furthermore, they are explicitly referred to as examples of legitimate technical specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">I then come to my third point, which was also raised by Mr MacCormick. In Article 53 the words 'for the contracting authority' are explained by recital 44 as meaning that the best tender will be assessed according to what the contracting authority will have defined as its requirements. Recital 44 further clarifies that this encompasses requirements addressed to satisfy the needs of the public concern in the case of the ruling about the need to limit air pollution for the population of the City of Helsinki.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Koukiadis gave us a further example of valid award criteria under Article 53 – the needs of handicapped people, which should be taken into account. In the case of transport services – for example better access to buses for handicapped people – would certainly be a valid criterion. There is no doubt about that.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point refers to the phrase 'economically most advantageous', which Mr Herman Schmid and a number of speakers mentioned. In reply to those comments, the most economically advantageous tender would be the result of a combination of economic but also qualitative criteria, and the latter would serve not necessarily to calculate the costs for the contracting authority, but would certainly help that contracting authority to make up its mind.</p>
<p class="contents">My penultimate point refers to labels, which Mr Jonckheer mentioned. As the common positions clearly show, the Commission is in favour of clarifying the role of eco-labels in public procurement and the possibility of referring to them when defining technical specifications. It should be kept in mind, however, that unlike 'ordinary' European standards, European eco-labels do not replace other competing eco-labels such as pluri-national ones. The Commission's proposals on eco-labels had foreseen such replacement, but this was not accepted during the legislative process.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation is, therefore, that different eco-labels may exist side by side even if they cover the same aspects. It would therefore not be appropriate – indeed, it would be contrary to established policy in the environmental field – to introduce a preference for European eco-labels over other eco-labels. The Commission is conscious that references to the performances underlying eco-labels rather than to simply require the labels themselves may be more complicated for purchasers. This task has been rendered easier through a database created by the Commission which lists the different performances defined in eco-labels that can be used in connection with award procedures. I can add that a practical guide to green procurement will be published later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to deal with the questions put by Mrs Thorning-Schmidt and Mr Hughes as to why the Commission is going back on current law as interpreted by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki buses case. My answer quite simply is as follows: it is simply not true that the common positions are more restrictive than the interpretation of current law given by the Court of Justice in the Helsinki buses case.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, through the combination of recitals and Articles, the common positions consolidate and clarify the possibilities offered by current law. They do not add anything to or subtract anything from current possibilities, but they have the merit of setting these out explicitly instead of having to rely on interpretations of jurisprudence with all the ensuing possibilities for different use and consequent legal uncertainty on this crucial issue. Moreover, they clarify that under the same conditions as set out by the Court of Justice, the use of social award criteria is also legitimate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to end by expressing the hope that in its vote Parliament will support the common position so that we can get these directives onto the statute book as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
