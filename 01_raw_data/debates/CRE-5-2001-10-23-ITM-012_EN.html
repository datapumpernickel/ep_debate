<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rühle (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, I am today proposing that the Commission should be given discharge in respect of the financial management of the sixth, seventh and eighth European Development Funds for the 1999 financial year. Unfortunately, we had to postpone the discharge in the spring, because I as rapporteur had received insufficient information from the Commission. This information is now available and I would like to specifically thank the Commission for its cooperation. I can recommend discharge today without any reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I hope and indeed expect that the fruitful cooperation which we have had with the Commission since the spring will continue when it comes to future reporting relating to the Development Fund, because such cooperation is needed to jointly solve problems in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my report is still a very critical one. It refers to 1999, and 1999 was the first budget year for which the new Commission was fully responsible. However, full responsibility does not mean that the Commission can be blamed for the mistakes of the past. We all know that reforms take time and we can see that the necessary measures have been initiated. Despite that, I would like to briefly reiterate my criticism. It is implementation that is at stake here. For example, there was a gap between commitments at EUR 2.69 billion and payments actually made in 1999 at EUR 1.27 billion. Unfortunately, the same also applies to the implementation of the debt relief initiative for the poorest countries in the world. I am, of course, aware that this reflects the general crisis in development aid, and that this situation is not unique to the Development Fund or to the Commission's work, and that all the Member States, together with the Commission and the Parliament, need to consider new approaches to development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is a failure of political will to provide aid on a generous scale, combined with a lack of instruments to effectively implement the available funds. That is the problem in a nutshell. In view of the lateness of the hour, I do not want to go into great detail, but I would like to emphasise that the Commission's approach to solving this problem is a step in the right direction. It involves strengthening local delegations, providing them with better equipment and preparation, in short, making local delegations more competent. However, I would also like to make an appeal to Parliament in this context. In the Committee on Budgets, we had protracted debates on the need for higher staffing levels, particularly for delegations, and the Committee on Budgets put pressure on the Committee on Budgetary Control to make these posts available and not to play spurious political games with a view to making the Commission deliver reforms before we approve staff changes. This is absurd of course, because these posts in local delegations are needed above all else so that reforms can be made in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">The further efforts at reform described in the Commission's internal audit report are also important and need to be discussed in detail between the Commission and the Parliament. I would like though to briefly mention a couple of expectations following on from the report of the Court of Auditors. I hope that in future these will be the hallmark of the discharge process and of cooperation between the Parliament and Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point is that we need an ongoing assessment of progress in implementing measures to reform public administration in the ACP States. We need to monitor progress achieved in the key sectors of health and education, using meaningful indicators such as the increase in the number of teachers or doctors, thus providing more qualitative checks instead of quantitative checks. This would also mean the discharge process in the Parliament itself having to change. In order words, we would have to shift our examination towards quality control and refrain from making a great hue and cry about points of detail. We would also have to carry out an annual audit of accounting and sound management of resources on the basis of samples and, lastly, apply clearly defined sanctions – such as the reduction or suspension of payments – in cases where the agreed reform measures are not complied with. If we implement these measures together, then I believe that we will be jointly taking an important step towards enhancing the structure of development aid, and that we will be better placed to convince the EU's taxpayers and to secure approval for the necessary expenditure. I say this because the situation prevailing since 11 September has demonstrated how important development aid is. It will be a pivotal factor. Furthermore, the EU has now become the world's largest provider of development aid. That is why we urgently need this joint reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the Socialist Group, the good management of the European Development Fund is not only essential for reasons of correct and transparent accounting, but because this fund and all Community aid resources are essential if we are to contribute to reducing poverty, which is one of our priorities. We are therefore closely monitoring the Commission’s action in this area. The eventful journey of this report through the competent committees, leading to its approval, is a testimony to this interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we made our 1998 discharge conditional upon the orientation of Community spending towards reducing poverty and we improved the structure of the budget in this respect, in order to reduce the risks of dispersal of aid funds. This year we have delayed, on one occasion, the discharge, while awaiting a series of reports from the Court of Auditors. We are now in a position to approve it, now that the Commission has adopted a series of measures to improve the effectiveness of aid, in particular the creation of Europe Aid, but at the same time certain data leads to some reservations: in 1999 the level of payments from the EDF was disappointing when compared to the level of commitment appropriations and payments achieved in previous years, as Mrs Rühle has said. Initiatives such as the reduction of the debt of the least-developed countries are not being complied with in accordance with the commitments the Commission has made. Contracts funded by the EDF essentially benefit companies in the Member States, to the detriment of local companies and organisations. The Commission is not yet sufficiently directing its aid towards reducing poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">We want simplification of procedures, integration of the cycle of cooperation, transparency in management, assessment in such important sectors as health and education. We will monitor compliance with the recommendations of the resolution we are debating today. The Commission knows that it has the support of the Socialist Group in its efforts to improve the management of the EDF and the Socialist Group trusts that we will see these improvements during the coming financial years, so that we are able to discharge the budget with fewer problems and conditions than has been the case so far. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, there are complaints that we are not willing enough to make generous development aid available, and, on the other hand, it is undeniable that the money actually made available is often only disbursed very slowly.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be something wrong with a system under which at the end of 1999 resources of almost EUR 10 billion had been promised and made available without any specific deadlines, but had not been taken up. The Commission will, of course, say that since then there have been signs of improvement here and there. Nevertheless, it is a fact that we need to fundamentally review our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The aid we offer through the Development Funds is reaching its limits, because it is geared towards supporting states that in some cases only exist on paper. There is often a lack of an even semi-functioning public administration, there is a lack of democratic control of those in power, and many countries are in a state of open civil war or on the verge of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In a civil war situation, we first need to concentrate aid on conflict resolution and on humanitarian aid. In other cases, we should concentrate our efforts to a greater extent than before on establishing properly functioning public administrations, which are a prerequisite for meaningfully applying aid from the EU or other donors in the international community. Such administrations are also a prerequisite for ensuring that countries use their own tax revenue responsibly and in the interests of their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aid must therefore always be linked to reform programmes for public administration. If these reforms make progress, aid is given, but if they do not progress or if there are setbacks we should not be afraid to turn off the tap. I know that is a difficult thing to do, but it is precisely in such circumstances that the Commission needs to stand firm and adhere to its principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say one more thing about this discharge procedure. The discharge had to be postponed because the Commission did not initially provide the necessary information. Furthermore, there was again the problem that certain confidential information was only forwarded to the committee chair and to the rapporteur. As I have often said before, and I shall say it again now, this leads to two classes of Member of the European Parliament – those with and those without access to information.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee made it patently clear in its report that this situation should not be allowed to recur, and that the provisions of our Rules of Procedure in respect of the discharge procedure should be fully implemented in future. In other words, all Members of this House should have access to all confidential information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has been pressed to take initiatives it would not otherwise have wished to take. I think the rapporteur has delivered a splendid piece of work, but I also think the Commission deserves to be warmly congratulated when it makes progress – as, I believe, it has in fact done. I would therefore recommend, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, that we grant discharge for the development fund. At the same time, I want to assure the Commission that all the outstanding problems will be followed up in the discharge for the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has carried out a major investigation of the counterpart funds and of the roles and responsibilities of the delegations. An investigation has been carried out into whether the delegations have complied with their responsibilities, and it would appear that they have done so, for disciplinary enquiries are not to be carried out. I can, of course, ask Mr Nielson if the Commission will confirm that disciplinary enquiries will not be carried out on the basis of its investigations. I can also – perhaps rather teasingly – ask if the Commission will confirm this report, which will not be sent to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The internal audit service has done good work from the start with its investigations of the counterpart funds. It is a good report which is critical about the way in which the system operates. The counterpart funds amount to direct budgetary support, and neither the Commission nor the delegations in the beneficiary countries have any direct control over the money. The report emphasises that direct budgetary support is risky, irrespective of what is done. Mr Nielson has said that that form of subsidy should nonetheless be maintained. How, though, does he think that control over the funds can be improved? The Commission must also be praised for sending this report to Parliament immediately. It shows it has learned something from this whole course of events. Discharge was postponed primarily because there were problems with the supply of information. Reports were sent to the wrong people, were seriously delayed or never arrived. I think, however, that it is a good result we have achieved, and I therefore recommend discharge for the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that her instincts were good when she postponed the discharge for the European Development Funds back in spring. We in the Committee for Budgetary Control had at that point not received any substantial information at all on follow-up measures in connection with cases of fraud discovered in 1999. However, we now very definitely know what we could only assume at that point, and that is that both the Commission and the European Anti-Fraud Office, OLAF, have had to lower their sights. For example, fraud in the health sector in the Ivory Coast was discovered in 1998/1999. Medical equipment including disposable syringes and baby scales had for years been claimed at many times their actual value. The loss was estimated at around EUR 27.4 million. When this case came to light, the, at that time, newly appointed Commission said that this money would of course have to be repaid. We now know that this money has not been returned to the European Development Fund. According to the Commission the reason for this is that it was legally impossible to demand the money back!</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to go into any further detail here, but this demonstrates how difficult it is to take corrective action once money has been transferred. Furthermore, in the ACP States, OLAF does not have the same powers of control as it has in the EU Member States, not to mention the fact that it purely and simply does not have the staff to run a comprehensive anti-fraud operation out of Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital for us to exert pressure to ensure that there is a general improvement in the way public money is looked after in the recipient countries. Countries that cannot protect their own tax revenue against fraud, corruption and waste are unlikely to be able to provide effective protection for EU funds. However, for the Commission this also means that it should step up its presence in the recipient countries – and on this point I am in agreement with the rapporteur – but not only by increasing the number of officials in the delegations, but, also, by giving those local delegations more authority. It should not, after all, be possible to circumvent local delegations in practice by coming to special arrangements direct with Brussels. Once again, my heartfelt congratulations on your report, Mrs Rühle. We are very happy to vote for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the closure and the reduction of the status and the staff of twenty-odd delegations in ACP countries, recently decided by the Commission, deals a harsh blow to the commitments to development given in the Cotonou Agreements. If there is one lesson that we have learnt about monitoring the Community’s external action for development, it is that the key to its success is the existence of a strong, responsible, independent and credible presence in the recipient countries. The arguments of budgetary neutrality used by the Commission are fallacious, because opening a delegation in countries such as Saudi Arabia cannot be compared with the overall costs of maintaining a European presence in those countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore this is not only a question of looking at the cost of a delegation, but of looking at the very real damage done to the effectiveness of public spending as a result of not monitoring such spending. The European Union cannot do without an autonomous and meaningful policy for the less developed world and replace it with a form of regionalisation undertaken in agreement with some of the former colonial powers. I hope that the Commission rethinks this course of action and treats the ACP countries and the management of the EDF with the importance that they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that I feel especially responsible for the last four months of that year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blak mentioned that Parliament has gained much by having this discharge delayed. I think this is true, but it should be noted that the Commission feels equally pleased with the outcome. This is like a good love story – it is always worth waiting for. But it was wrong that the delay had to do specifically with information being held back in contradiction to the agreement between the Commission and Parliament. The main reason for the delay was that the report from the internal auditor service was not finished and could not be finished because we, on both sides, found it necessary and a good idea to broaden its scope in order to get a serious and deep study of how to handle this method of development cooperation. So we have solved problems that went beyond what is normally dealt with in the discharge process and this is what we can congratulate each other on tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">One remark to Mr Bösch concerning the Ivory Coast – we did get full recovery even though they had a military coup! We grilled them. We stuck to what I told Parliament: that we wanted to maintain a position of zero tolerance, and the new military dictators in the Ivory Coast accepted their obligations within the deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not, in my time as Commissioner, experienced any case so far where we did not manage to get full recovery when the audit results indicated the need for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Our cooperation through the EDF has kept growing, while the support of other major donors for developing countries and especially for the least-developed countries has been declining. The Funds constitute an increasingly important source of finance for these countries and so, of course, we owe it to them, and to our European taxpayers, to use these resources as effectively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the Commission should be concerned to verify that the beneficiary countries are doing all they can to improve their own capacity for effective budgetary and financial management. This has been a major theme of this discharge exercise, and it has succeeded in focusing attention on an important area of development cooperation. The question of sound financial management of budgetary support is, I think, better understood, as a result of the work carried out by the Court of Auditors and the Commission’s internal audit service, in cooperation with the various Commission services responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see any need to amend the Cotonou Agreement to reflect this. I am confident that there is a clear consensus between the Commission, the Court of Auditors and Parliament on the right way ahead, and in particular on the importance of budgetary support. This is a key tool to enhance stability and economic governance. By doing this in cooperation with other main donors and in a manner that emphasises the responsibility of the recipient government, we are playing a very important role. I am deeply grateful to Parliament that this perspective has been understood for this budget period. We need to continue to do this. No other donor is able and willing to meet this challenge as we are.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we cannot turn a blind eye to the cases of corruption or of negligence in the management of public funds, and I can reassure you that we will continue this policy of zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption. But we have to be aware, as you must, that the strengthening of financial control systems in these countries is a long-term process. It has to be tackled with realism. We have to make an assessment of the risks involved in each action that we consider for EDF finance, and go into action with a clear understanding of those risks. It has to be based on a common approach with other donors. An isolated approach by the Commission would be unrealistic. It must rely on the development of internal accountability. Cooperation with other donors in this field is better than ever. We all need improvement, and this is definitely being pursued in good cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This covers the discharge for 1999, and the performance for 2000 is in several ways somewhat more encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the main objectives of the reform of the management of the Community’s external assistance programmes is, of course, drastically to reduce the gap between commitments and payments. The Commission has been implementing measures since May of last year to tackle this problem. For instance, we pressed ahead with the closure, wherever possible, of old and dormant commitments, and we proposed also the introduction of a so-called ‘sunset clause’ to limit the time during which funds allocated to an action can be used for contracts. We, therefore, have reason to hope that the situation will gradually improve.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the slow rate of payments, the figures already available indicate that payments in 2000 increased from EUR 1.27 billion to EUR 1.55 billion. We still have incredible inertia in the pipeline, in the way in which these figures move. We have been increasing the total volume of what we do in this area and this is something that will gradually occur as a result of more and more activity year by year. This is, of course, the challenge we are facing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have said, on several occasions, that the lack of comprehensive data about our operations is a real embarrassment. We have made some progress towards more effective management information systems. I know that Parliament, and particularly the Development Committee, is anxious to see us make progress in this area, and we are doing our best. Nevertheless, there is still much to do and we are very conscious of the need to press on with reforming the management of our programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we are concerned that the process of deconcentration, or delegating to delegations as I prefer to call it, should move ahead smoothly. The Commission has been asking for additional staff, but the numbers required have been assessed on a very conservative basis and we need every single post.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that Parliament in its decisions on the budget for 2002 will support us in this effort. It was encouraging to listen to Mr Casaca in this respect. I thank you for your enthusiastic support and hope you can deliver. We are determined that the deconcentration exercise should not end by simply exporting from Brussels to the delegations the problems caused by inadequate staffing. This is serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Concern is expressed in the resolution about the percentage of EDF contracts going to companies from the ACP countries, and it requires the Commission to increase this from some 25% to 40% in five years. The ACP countries win a much higher percentage of contracts under the EDF than from almost any other major donor. This should not be forgotten. ACP companies already benefit from a substantial preference margin in cases where offers are technically equivalent. If it is to operate a transparent and fair tendering system, the Commission cannot envisage any kind of fixed quotas which would discriminate against European companies, and which would be contrary to WTO rules. Nevertheless, we share the political intention of Parliament to maximise the benefits of our aid for local economies, particularly where there is a technically competent and well-structured private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point to the new investment facility, part of the Cotonou Agreement, EUR 2.2 billion, which is architectured in order to stimulate the emergence of this activity in our partner countries. This is a way in which they may improve their position in exactly this respect. We have already identified this as an area where we should push forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am anxious to reassure Parliament that the Commission is strengthening its monitoring procedures on the follow-up of audit. This is an important part of the reform of the Commission’s financial management and control. We also plan improvements to the presentation of the accounts, in response to the comments from the Court of Auditors. We are ready to enter into a direct dialogue to find out how this is best done.</p>
<p class="contents">I will say a few words on the points in the resolution which refer to the transmission of confidential documents. The respect of confidentiality and the application of correct transmission procedures remain crucial. The 1999 discharge procedure showed that the framework agreement provides an effective and satisfactory framework for cooperation between the Commission and Parliament. What we are discussing tonight has been following that set of rules. I want to make that perfectly clear.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1999 discharge procedure was the first to which this framework agreement was applied. The Commission sought to apply the agreement fully and loyally throughout that procedure. In the Commission's view the framework agreement has proved to be an effective mechanism, one benefit being that it allows Parliament to receive confidential and similar information. The understanding of the importance of development aid seems to be growing as we understand more and more about globalisation. And in the light of recent events we have come to better understand the reality and urgency of interdependency in this world. We cannot act alone. The challenge of reducing poverty is one in which the whole international community is involved and we share with others the framework for providing aid and for assessing the results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
