<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Κaramanou (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, my report does indeed concern the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Finnish Presidency on the relations and obligations as between the Member States for the readmission of third country nationals inside the European Union. I am really sorry to have to say, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, that the proposal for a regulation has not been given the due attention, study and careful preparation needed when handling such a delicate and complicated matter. This lack of preparation has resulted in serious reservations, rejection or a lack of interest in the proposal for a directive by the European Commission and the Council and by the parliamentary committees responsible, i.e. the Committee on Freedoms and the Committee on Legal Affairs, as well as on the part of non-governmental organisations, which the Finnish Presidency does not appear to have consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere conclusions noted that the Union needed a comprehensive approach to the phenomenon of immigration, which is clearly linked to a whole series of political questions which have remained unanswered. It is linked to respect for human rights and to the economic, social, political and cultural conditions in the person’s country of origin. As far as the question of readmission is concerned, the Member States already have the experience of agreements under European Political Collaboration and Schengen-type cooperation. This is a sensitive issue which calls for diplomatic collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the content of the Finnish initiative is concerned, there is no explanatory statement attached to the draft regulation. The initiative does not show any strategic vision. The draft seeks to lay down a Dublin-style system for illegal immigrants, following the model of the Convention on asylum seekers, the application of which, as we know, has proven to be highly problematic and ineffective. Priority is given in the proposal for a regulation to send back foreigners illegally present on the territory of Member States under a system of compulsory readmission operating between Member States. The regulation aims to determine which Member State is obliged to readmit a third country national in order to implement the agreement in question. The draft regulation does not debar a Member State from sending a foreigner who does not meet the conditions of entry or residence in a Member State back to his or her country of origin or another third country. This provision seems to empower Member States to take more severe decisions outside the scope of the proposed regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Other points which deserve criticism are the fact that any kind of solidarity between Member States is precluded, in particular as far as illegal border crossings and responsibility for the external borders of the European Union are concerned. The proposal is perhaps a way of exercising indirect pressure for the borders of the European Union to be fortified.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, absolutely no consideration is given to the particular circumstances of persons who may have spent a long period of time in a Member State before being classed as illegal. Residence permits for asylum seekers are not included in the documents provided for in the regulation, thereby creating the possibility of undermining the protection afforded to them. The regulation permits readmission to another Member State to be requested within six months from the time when the authorities of the requesting Member State became aware that a third country national may be (not “is”) illegally present. In other words, the proposal allows entry to the territory of a Member State to be proven on the basis of hypothetical evidence. The way in which the data required to identify persons to be readmitted is determined is open to every kind of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the basic problem appears to be that no strategy or European policy has been devised on immigration. I consider, Commissioner, that we urgently need to prepare legal tools for the immigration directive, rather than confining ourselves to suppression and policing measures which are not subject to democratic control. We urgently need to implement the Tampere conclusions and devise a common European policy on asylum and immigration based on European humanitarian values and respect for fundamental human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we call on the European Commission to take the necessary legislative initiatives on all the issues which touch on immigration and, of course, to define the mutual obligations as between the Member States. We are aware, Commissioner, of your personal interest and of the difficulties facing the Council and assure you that any initiatives which you may table in this direction will have our undivided support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that we all had to work very quickly on this document, and at that time she was under additional pressure because of commitments at national level. She has already mentioned very many points, and I would just like to say that, as regards content, the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market was in agreement, as it was with the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. We only differed on a formal detail.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs, we are also requesting that this Initiative of the Republic of Finland should be withdrawn. I am certain that it was very well intended, but it has not been thought through sufficiently. Legally speaking, it has thrown up more questions than it has supplied explanations. I would like to add a few important points. An initiative of this kind should not mean that people can just be shipped back and forth within our territory. Furthermore, as Mrs Karamanou has just said, this represents a programme singularly lacking in solidarity between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to readmission agreements, they should not be used as a possible way of twisting the arms of countries in receipt of development aid by saying that they will only receive development aid and funds or cooperation if they also sign readmission agreements. This is bordering on blackmail.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, I would like to say that the readmission of persons illegally residing in our territory is another problem that can only be solved jointly, by working together to fight the root causes and to finally address the issues of integration and asylum in cooperation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have had the opportunity to work with the rapporteur in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs and it has been an honour for me to chair the committee that voted for Mrs Echerer’s excellent opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we are facing a situation which is real problem: the progressive disappearance of internal borders means that non-EU citizens in both legal and illegal situations are moving freely amongst the Member States. If we are going to be realistic, this is a problem which, as the two rapporteurs have stressed, we must deal with fully, and, I might add, as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">My view of the Finnish initiative is much less critical than theirs. I believe we should stress the fact that the Finnish initiative was a very significant step forward from the moment it was put on the table, because it led the Council to get involved in a very urgent issue. In other words, at the time, the Finnish initiative played a fundamental role, and we might say that it has died as a result of its own success. The thinking behind the Finnish initiative means that its proposals no longer have any point, because they have now been fully adopted. What we need now is not a provocative initiative which points its finger at the problem and starts a debate, but rather we need to get down – calmly but immediately – to resolving this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I agree with many of the criticisms that have been made. I also agree with one which has been made implicitly but which has not been stated directly. We, as a legislating institution, cannot amend just any text; there are texts which are not amendable and texts which require a complete amendment. This is what we have done in the case of the Finnish initiative, at least in the PPE Group. We welcome the courage of the Finnish initiative, but we believe that this initiative will not seriously enable us to carry out the responsibilities that the European public has entrusted to us. Why not? For the reasons which have been expressed, and which I would probably just be repeating: this initiative takes account of one aspect, the most repressive one, but that is only one aspect of the problem. What we need now, given the developments since Tampere, is a more global vision. The rapporteur is absolutely right to point out that this initiative does not take account of questions of procedure, or fundamental guarantees for the procedure, nor does it provide the necessary protection for the fundamental rights of those people who will be caught up in this type of procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it has not been pointed out – and I think it is important that it is – that what we do in this area must be coherent with the Member States’ principles regarding readmission of third country nationals. All these types of bilateral agreement that are required are being negotiated.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE has presented two amendments which I hope this House – to take up what the two previous speakers have said – will support in tomorrow’s vote, thereby sending a political signal, and we ask the Commission to present a complete and coherent text sooner rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to say on behalf of my Group that we fully support the proposal to refer this initiative back. We did not come to this conclusion because we wanted to make things easy for ourselves and not table any amendments, but because – as emerges from the explanatory statement, which is very comprehensive and convincing – too many fundamental requirements have simply not been met. We have heard about these shortcomings in the debate as well as reading about them in the reports.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not because of these shortcomings that we are recommending that this specific initiative should be rejected. What is at stake here is whether it makes sense for the Member States to have the right of initiative in these areas of competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals on which Parliament has been consulted up to now under this right of initiative have not, on the whole, been very convincing – including an Austrian proposal that had both technical shortcomings and problems in terms of content. What these proposals have had in common has been a failure to fit in with a coherent set of measures. Something else they had in common was that they either conflicted with existing legal instruments or duplicated them. The advantage of the Commission alone having the right of initiative is surely that this ensures a systematic approach and guarantees that we have documents that are more precise and free from technical and legal contradictions. This applies in particular to matters for which Commissioner Vitorino is responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">Another clear indication of the shortcomings of Member States’ right of initiative is that they are seldom received with very much enthusiasm, even by other Member States. This also applies to the initiative before us today, which the Portuguese Presidency is no longer treating as a priority. So, as a Parliament, we have more reason than ever before to be sceptical about this right of initiative on the part of Member States. This is not only because this right skews the balance between the institutions but also because, up to now, it has never really been convincingly exercised.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to touch upon another problem connected with this, which might perhaps warrant a joint initiative by the Member States. Officials working at the Schengen external borders are constantly telling us that the residence permits presented by third country nationals and issued by other EU Member States still vary widely and are often difficult to identify as such. This does not seem to fit in with the Joint Action concerning a uniform format for residence permits. The Member States should take the initiative here and act in compliance with the EU format in their own administrative area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would thank the rapporteur and the draftsperson of the opinion for the frank, direct and sincere words they have written about Finland’s initiative. </p>
<p class="contents">The report states that the initiative was poorly planned, that it contains no justification section, that it was prepared without organisations such as ECRE or UNHCR being consulted and that the relationship between the principles of readmission between the Member States and the principles of readmission to third countries is not made clear. Furthermore, the report states that there is a lack of strategic vision, something which the rapporteur also said. No distinction is made between those who do not fulfil and those who no longer fulfil the conditions in force for residence here. It is all too reminiscent of Austria’s initiative on that famous first day of Austria’s Presidency. </p>
<p class="contents">There are also no procedural safeguards, which does not surprise me because, less than two months ago, the same Ministry of the Interior which is behind the present initiative proposed that Finnish immigration law be changed to include rapid repatriation. My party, the Swedish People’s Party, voted against this initiative, really for the same reasons that Finland’s constitutional committee had when it considered that the same proposal was unconstitutional because, in the case of rapid repatriation, no one has the right to be heard. </p>
<p class="contents">It would be wisest, therefore, if Finland were to comply with Parliament’s proposal and withdraw the proposal, as both the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs propose. I would point out that, of all the members of the Committees, only two supported this initiative. I regret that the Council’s and Parliament’s time has been used in this way. I think, like Mrs Berger said, that it could have been used for other things, for example, purely administrative procedures. The issue of women as asylum seekers might also have been reflected upon, because we need to look at the Tampere decision in its entirety with a view to improving the asylum process. I would emphasise that I am speaking as a Finn and as a representative of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

According to this initiative, a Member State which arrests illegal immigrants in its territory could return them to the Member State through which they entered, with the expectation that the latter would probably return them to the third country from which they originally came.</p>
<p class="contents">This idea is interesting for three reasons. Firstly, it responds to a genuine problem caused by the abolition of internal borders within Europe. It therefore fills a legal void by establishing a system for the return of illegal immigrants based on the Schengen <span class="italic">acquis</span> and modelled on the Dublin Convention of 1990 on asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it forces the Member State which is negligent in monitoring its borders to take responsibility for illegal immigrants who use it to get into neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it shows the usefulness – whatever the previous speakers may have said – of the Member States’ right of initiative which the Treaty of Amsterdam retained as a transitional measure in matters relating to immigration and the movement of people. In these areas, it is important that the national governments, which are still closer to the people than the Commission, should retain a full right to make proposals and, of course, decide on these.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights totally rejects this Finnish initiative however, and, in so doing, shows a tendency to exaggerate. It uses the pretext of legal shortcomings to reject the whole proposal whereas it could very easily, in a more positive spirit, have itself proposed corrections. However, this initiative is disliked by the federalists who would prefer a less intergovernmental and more Community-based approach, in other words granting more power to the Commission and the European Parliament. It is also disliked by the pro-immigration pressure groups whose influence is apparent in the explanatory statement which highlights the positive contribution of immigration and rejects a supposedly repressive initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">This reasoning is, of course, diametrically opposed to ours. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since we completely agree with her analysis and conclusion and share the view that it cannot be adopted, as it stands, I shall be very brief.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Karamanou’s report has clearly demonstrated that the subject of readmission rules between European Union Member States, although a very technical and specific issue, touches upon some very sensitive policy issues that simply need more thorough reflection and preparation before they are again tackled by the Union. I recognise that this initiative has drawn the attention of the Council to the necessity of drafting a coherent and consistent approach to immigration policy. That is why I stated to Parliament the Commission’s intention of presenting to the Council and Parliament in the autumn of this year a communication on immigration policy, precisely to give us the broader picture within which these partial and sectoral issues can be fully and properly integrated.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission thinks that we should not start with this question of readmission. We think that though questions of readmission are no doubt relevant, they should be mainly addressed in the readmission agreements that the Union is now negotiating with third countries. Nevertheless, for the time being, it is better to see the whole picture before we start discussing small details. So the Commission can subscribe to the approach of the rapporteur and, apparently, the large majority in Parliament, in the sense that this initiative, as it stands – and I am not passing judgement on the intention behind it – is unacceptable.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
