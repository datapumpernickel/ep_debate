<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a regrettable fact that, although five years have passed since the European Summit held in Lisbon in 2000, we are still a long way from reaching the goals set for the EU economy at the time. Growth rates have fallen far short of projections, and the number of new jobs created has not been enough to achieve the desired employment rates. Growth and employment are therefore priorities for the Barroso Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Two months ago, we presented our proposal for a revision of the Lisbon Strategy, in favour of which Parliament had voted by an overwhelming majority. The key features of this revised Strategy include a clear definition of priorities and the establishment of a partnership between the Community and the Member States geared towards implementing the planned measures. The European Council approved the Commission’s proposals three weeks ago, which means that the stage is now set for us to implement our goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The package we are presenting to the House today is the first phase of our implementation strategy. The proposal for integrated guidelines is a practical means of making the new Lisbon Strategy simpler, more transparent and more manageable in political terms. The guidelines for economic and employment policy, which have now been summarised in one document, are both a roadmap for more growth and employment and a basis for the Member States’ national Lisbon programmes. This is the crucial point; what we are establishing is a Community framework within which the Member States will be able to devise tailor-made national solutions to the problems that we have identified together.</p>
<p class="contents">A first set of guidelines urges the Member States to continue pursuing stability-oriented macroeconomic policies. Given nearly all Member States’ experience of the problems associated with an ageing population, budgetary discipline is the only way to achieve long-term sustainability of public finances. We must make sure that public spending is targeted at activities that contribute to long-term growth, in particular in the fields of education, science and research.</p>
<p class="contents">The second set of guidelines deals with structural reforms, the aim of which is to facilitate the transition to a more knowledge-based economy and to make Europe a more attractive place to work and invest in. I should like to elaborate on a number of structural guidelines that are of key importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the internal market. We need an internal market that functions well, and this requires the removal of the remaining barriers to market access and a more rigorous implementation of competition policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need better regulation, and there must be a systematic assessment of the economic, social and environmental impact of legislative proposals at both national and EU level. Legislation generates costs for businesses, and these costs can weigh particularly heavily on small businesses. It is for this reason that better regulation is one of the key building blocks of a business-friendly environment and a strong entrepreneurial culture.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I wish to address is innovation. Europe’s future lies in knowledge-intensive and innovative sectors of the economy, and both the public sector and the economy itself must therefore step up investment in research. The guidelines call on the Member States to facilitate innovation by promoting technology transfer and establishing innovation clusters, as well as by encouraging the uptake of new technologies such as information technology. Innovations in the field of environmental technologies are a factor not only in boosting growth and employment, but also, and in particular, in achieving sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The guidelines for structural policy are followed by a final set of guidelines for employment policy, which Mr Špidla will discuss shortly. Their aim is to create jobs, boost investment in education and skills, make the workforce and businesses more flexible and modernise social security systems. Particular attention must be paid to improving the situation of young people, since unemployment among this group is twice as high as among the general population.</p>
<p class="contents">The full potential of these reforms will only be realised if they are implemented as a package, the individual components of which complement one another. Implementing all these measures will give a significant boost to growth and employment, and so we need a strong and solid partnership based on trust to drive forward these much-needed reforms. This must not and will not be a technocratic process; instead, it must be viewed as a highly political process, which will deliver results only if it is endorsed by European society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Your House will play a key role in this process, and it is crucial that we maintain the political momentum generated by the revision of the Lisbon Strategy and by the decisions taken by you and at the Spring Summit in Brussels. The time has come to capitalise on this momentum by taking the first steps towards implementation. The Commission would be most appreciative if Parliament could give particular and timely consideration to the guidelines that have been presented today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Naturally, the broad economic policy guidelines, an instrument enshrined in the Treaty, together with the review of the Lisbon Strategy, have growth and employment as a priority: to grow more and to create more jobs in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week I presented the Spring economic forecasts, which are produced by the Commission’s services and, as you are aware, we believe that there will be a recovery during 2005, a revitalisation of economic growth, which will continue during 2006, and employment will be created, but it will not be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth must be more intense in order to create the necessary employment to allow us to achieve full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, the macroeconomic chapter of these broad economic policy guidelines, which are integrated into the package approved today by the Commission, reiterate the need to establish stable economic conditions that can create confidence. Because confidence amongst consumers and economic agents is needed in order to increase consumer demand, in order to increase investments and in order to increase internal demand, and that is the basis that should lead us, with sustained recovery, to more growth, more employment opportunities and thereby to greater guarantees that we can preserve and enhance social cohesion and the sustainability of our model of growth and of society.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the broad economic policy guidelines for 2005-2008 take account of the review of the Stability and Growth Pact, based on the agreement reached by the Spring European Council, and, in this regard, they recommend avoiding pro-cyclic budgetary policies and maintaining the medium-term budgetary stability objectives throughout the economic cycle, and also taking account of the differing levels of indebtedness and the differing growth potential of each country when establishing those specific medium-term objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">For the euro zone, the specific need is stressed for the countries that share the single currency to achieve those mid-term budgetary balance objectives, and those countries are called upon to pay special attention to fiscal discipline and their budgetary situation.</p>
<p class="contents">As Vice-President Verheugen has just pointed out, the microeconomic chapter of the guidelines makes particular reference to the need to create the appropriate framework for attracting more investment to the internal market, to enhance innovation and, by means of greater investment, enhancing innovation, research and development and better functioning of the markets and increasing the growth potential of our economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, of course, this macroeconomic and microeconomic strategy, integrated into the broad economic policy guidelines, is consistent with the employment guidelines that my colleague, Commissioner Spidla, will explain next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The integrated guidelines are based on the premise that if the European Union wishes to create more and better jobs, it needs a range of interrelated measures that will make Europe more attractive and more innovation-friendly. These measures must apply not only to the labour market, but also to the market for goods and services and to the financial market, and structural reforms must be founded on a growth-oriented macroeconomic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">No real progress has been made in the area of employment in recent years, something that has mainly been due to sluggish economic growth associated with weak demand and global imbalances. After a period in the late 1990s when employment rose sharply, the number of new jobs has levelled off over the past three years, and the only reason why we have not suffered a drop in employment similar to that of 10 years ago is because the labour market is now more flexible. At the same time, growth in labour productivity has slowed, limited progress has been made towards improving the quality of work and the economic slow-down has exacerbated related problems of social inclusion, in particular among young people. Long-term unemployment rates have started to rise again after several years of decline.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing major problems. On the one hand, Europe must rise to the challenge of accelerated economic restructuring on the basis of increased economic integration, both within the enlarged EU and on a global scale. If Europe wishes to succeed, it must improve its capacity to anticipate, bring about and cope with economic change. On the other hand, Europe needs to tackle the problems of an ageing population. Demographic changes mean that we must modernise our social welfare systems, and that our labour market must change and will have to adapt to an ageing and soon-to-be shrinking workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe will only remain prosperous if it achieves faster growth in both employment and productivity. In order to do so, we need a new approach to life-long work and renewed efforts to develop human capital in Europe. The new set of guidelines for employment policy responds to these challenges and acts as a roadmap for the employment policies of the Member States, as well as reiterating the EU’s objectives of full employment, improved quality and productivity of labour and greater social and territorial cohesion. Emphasis is given to a number of key measures, which are targeted at three priorities. The first of these priorities is to ensure that more people enter and stay in employment, the second is making workers and businesses more flexible and the third is boosting investment in human capital. At the same time as implementing the guidelines, Member States must also implement the recommendations on employment policy, and commit themselves to fulfilling the full scope of the European Union’s ambitions and goals. It is also essential to continue putting the open method of coordination to full use in the field of social inclusion and social welfare, as outlined in the Social Agenda, and for the relevant parts of this strategy to be incorporated into the national Lisbon programmes. The European Social Fund must be directly utilised by means of support measures at Member State and regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">The preparations that are carried out in the run-up to the presentation of the national programmes in autumn 2005 must be used as an opportunity to win over all parties concerned to the cause of developing and implementing employment policy. The experiences gained with the European Employment Strategy in this regard were extremely positive, as the involvement of all affected parties helps the Member States to be more transparent and to formulate policies, as well as ensuring that policy measures are both legitimate and effective. This is the key feature of the new framework for growth and employment presented in the shape of the relaunched Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will, and indeed already does, play a key role in this process, not least by setting out its position on the guidelines for employment policy that the Commission proposes. I believe that these new guidelines for employment policy, which form part of the integrated package we are presenting on behalf of the Commission, adhere to the basic principles and new objectives of the Lisbon Strategy, namely growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to address an issue linked to the second and third parts, namely structural changes. At present, we very often see structural changes as a threat, but I think that they ought to be seen as a challenge. Firstly, it is a question of whether we are to make full use of our human capital, that is to say train the work force. Secondly, it is a question of whether we are to have security in the labour market, because people made to feel secure can also participate in the work designed to produce change. Thirdly, it is a question of involving employees not only when something has happened, but throughout the whole process of change. It is then that there can be talk of influence in the work place. Do you have any comments on this, I wonder? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the integration of the guidelines will lead to more cohesion. I have to say, though, that Lisbon was about three different aspects; there was also social cohesion, and as far as I am aware, social cohesion covers more than employment alone. It was also about driving back poverty substantially and about guaranteeing proper pensions. How will we, in the absence of the entire ‘social leg’, be able to prevent any forthcoming debate on pensions from once again becoming a debate on their fundability? That is my first question.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is procedural in nature. I have noticed that the Economic and Financial Affairs Councils will deal only with the economic dimension and the Social Affairs Council with the employment guidelines. This is not, to my mind, a good example of integration. Why do the two Councils not comment on the entire package?</p>

A closer look reveals quite clearly that this is a pseudo joint paper, or, to put it another way, that it is falling apart at the seams. It is by no means clear whether these will be joint efforts, or in other words whether attempts will in fact be made to improve social policy in all areas. It is also far from clear whether the employment goals that have been set have any relevance at all now, as it is certainly true that the 2000 figures have ceased to apply. </p>
<p class="contents">Gender mainstreaming is a key concept that should underpin all policies, yet no mention has been made of it whatsoever. Even though it had a whole pillar to itself in the 1997 employment guidelines, it has since disappeared from your document. It is my belief that this is one aspect of the package that it is essential to revise, as it is well known that we face far greater problems in connection with the employment of women than with that of men, and that women are substantially worse off in terms of wages and social security. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will answer the questions from Mrs Andersson and Mr Goebbels, Mr Špidla will answer Questions Nos 2, 3 and 5 and Mr Almunia will answer the question on the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to start with a few comments in response to Mrs Andersson’s question on structural change. Needless to say, we also agree that what matters is bringing about the necessary structural changes in Europe, a task it would be futile to try to avoid. After all, the aim of the strategy as a whole is to improve the long-term competitiveness of Europe’s economy so that it can compete successfully on the global market. We will only achieve this goal if we pursue a policy that places Europe at the cutting edge of environmental, economic and technological progress in all fields, and this is the basic idea behind our strategy. Europe cannot join in the race for lower standards, lower wages and poorer quality; it must compete to offer the best products on the market. It is obvious that this will not happen without structural change.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to Mr Goebbels’ question, I am sure that someone as familiar as he is with the revised Lisbon Strategy will be aware that we are at the start of a new cycle. In essence, this first integrated guidelines package has but a single purpose, namely to provide a Community framework for the drafting of national action plans. The true nature and extent of the package will only be revealed next year, when the national action plans will be on the table for us to evaluate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that the ageing of the population will result in millions of people dropping out of the workforce, it appears to me to be quite clear that the supply of workers must be increased, and that a greater proportion of the population must participate in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Something else that is quite clear, and which is a problem that all employment policies have come up against, is that early retirement has not proved to be a useful weapon in the fight against unemployment. Instead, early retirement has played a major role in the collapse of welfare systems, in particular the pensions system. This would make it extremely difficult for us to guarantee stable living conditions in retirement for future generations, even though there can be no doubt that everyone is entitled to such conditions after a life spent working.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to quote a few figures that make it clear how grave the situation is. The average person is only ready to start work after approximately 22 years, and is unable to work for around 5 years of his working life. He then spends between 20 and 22 years of his life in retirement. The end result of this is that 50 years of our lives are spent out of employment, which is untenable in the long run. This is a further reason why the supply of workers must be increased and it must be made easier for older people to remain in the workforce, in order to ensure the overall stability of our welfare systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also asked why the integrated package does not deal more explicitly with social policy. The answer to this question is to be found in the overall structure of our legal system, as the Commission is not competent to present a document of the kind the Member wishes. The Treaty sets out the only alternatives open to us with regard to the guidelines, which cover economic policy and, in a separate section, employment policy; this is the legal framework within which we must operate, and there are no other alternative means by which a document on social policy could be presented. Gender mainstreaming is used to address the issue of equal opportunities in all policies and all recommendations on employment policy, including those that seek to make it possible for a greater number of women to work, those that introduce the concept of a new balance between employment and family duties, and those that endeavour to reduce the gender gap in wages. In my opinion, it is quite clear that the principle of mainstreaming is rigorously implemented in these directives and guidelines, or in other words that equal opportunities feature in all EU policies. There is no question that this applies particularly, although not exclusively, to employment policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reform agreed at the March European Council basically consists of placing more emphasis on anti-cyclic policies at good times in the cycle, of placing more emphasis on multilateral monitoring of the economic policies implemented during good economic times, on paying more attention within budgetary monitoring to the problems and challenges of mid- and long-term sustainability and, as a trade-off, with this greater attention to anti-cyclic policies and policies aimed at improving sustainability and greater flexibility in the application of the instruments in the Treaty, which are still there for the purposes of enhanced budgetary monitoring in the excessive deficit procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference values in the Treaty, however, the budgetary limits, the need to maintain budgetary discipline, the role it must play in creating the necessary conditions for the proper functioning of the Economic and Monetary Union, for stability of prices and for creating the conditions for economic growth, are still there. Furthermore, I can tell the honourable Member that it is going to be applied rigorously, but more effectively, because the new Stability and Growth Pact is going to allow for better coordination and more compatibility amongst budgetary monitoring policies and growth policies, as well as the introduction of structural reforms, such as those included in the Lisbon Strategy, in order to improve the growth potential and the sustainability of our growth model and hence its capacity to generate employment and increase social cohesion. That is the true purpose and content of the reform of the Stability Pact. Caricatures are for those who make them. Neither the Commission nor the European Council deserve the caricatures that have been made of the Stability Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address a final comment to Mrs Van Lancker on the relative roles of the Councils. It is the responsibility of the Council to organise its discussions. But just this morning, I took part in the meeting of the Ecofin Council in Luxembourg, I saw the document which was being discussed simultaneously in the meeting of the College of Commissioners, and I discovered that the ministers of the economy and finance intend to debate all the macroeconomic and microeconomic aspects of the broad economic policy guidelines, and also – by means of the integrated package approved by the Commission – the relationship between economic policies, the situation of the labour market and employment policies. So this Commission proposal now facilitates discussion in the Ecofin Council, the Social Affairs Council and the competitiveness Council, of the specific issues, but taking a coherent global view. That is one of the most important attributes of the Commission’s proposal approved today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
