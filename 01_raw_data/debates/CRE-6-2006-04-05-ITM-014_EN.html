<p class="contents">We will take the following questions to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">Part One</span></p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 1 by Boguslaw Sonik (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0213_EN.html">H-0213/06</a>)</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Violation of the freedoms of conscience and religion in China</span></p>
<p class="contents">I must voice my deep concern at the persecution of Christians in China. In spite of the fact that the Chinese Constitution guarantees freedom of conscience and of religion, Chinese Christians are persecuted, imprisoned and tortured by the Communist authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies and reports by numerous human rights organisations show that, since 2001, persecution of Christians has become commonplace and has been carried out on a large scale. It is particularly widespread in the provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangsu and Hebei. The number of Christians in China is estimated to be as high as 70 million, which demonstrates most clearly the weight and extent of the problem. Tolerating such behaviour by the Chinese authorities or remaining indifferent towards human injustice and suffering because of religious beliefs is not acceptable in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps does the Council intend to take to defend the freedoms of conscience and religion in China? Will the issue of persecution be raised at ministerial level among EU and Chinese representatives? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also the reason why, several years ago now, the Council outlined a number of key areas in which the European Union is seeking to make progress in the dialogue process.</p>
<p class="contents">These include in particular the unrestricted exercise – both in public and in private – of the freedom of religion and belief and respect for cultural rights and religious freedom in Tibet and Xinjiang. Religious freedom has therefore been clearly highlighted on the agenda at meetings between the EU and China, not only at dialogue meetings but also at higher levels.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm from my own experience, both in my former work as a legal adviser who was also responsible for human rights and in my present position, that these subjects are in fact being raised at a great variety of levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with this conclusion of the Council, the European Union has regularly raised not only the persecution of Christians, the restrictions on house churches and the distribution of Bibles in prisons, but also the persecution of Buddhists, Muslims and members of the Falun Gong movement, a subject that the EU brings up on many occasions. We have also made it clear that in our view these practices are in breach of China’s international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite recently, freedom of religion was discussed in detail at the dialogues in September 2004 and October 2005, and the EU Troika has visited Tibet and Xinjang in connection with the dialogue. The EU has regularly called on China to comply with the recommendations of the UN special rapporteur and the UN committees relating to freedom of religion and belief. It has also continually raised specific cases and called on the Chinese authorities to investigate reports of torture and provide information on sentencing. The outcome of these talks up until now has been that while the EU has welcomed the opportunity to hold detailed talks with relevant ministers, authorities, etc, it found many of its concerns about restrictions of religious freedom in China confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, China sent an official invitation to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion or belief, and the EU looks forward expectantly to the confirmation of a date for the visit. It has to be said that this invitation itself is a major step forward. The European Union will continue to press at all levels for genuine freedom of religion and belief in China, not least as part of the process of ratification and implementation of the International Pact on Civil and Political Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Sonik also wished to establish whether the Council was satisfied with the response by the Chinese side, however. After all, this is not a new problem.

That is also the reason why we will continue to raise this question at all levels.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are calling on us to apply more pressure, then I must ask you, honourable Member, what pressure the European Union is supposed to bring to bear on China. Political pressure, that is bringing forward questions and repeatedly reminding them of them? Yes! Other opportunities, where the European Union does not confront China directly – and I believe they are important – are international bodies, the United Nations, hitherto the Human Rights Commission. It will certainly continue to be a matter for the UN Human Rights Council. I have already mentioned that the UN special rapporteur has a particular role to play here. These are all levels and channels through which this question can be raised. We will only ultimately be satisfied when complete freedom of belief and religion has been achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Freedom of religion is a human right that applies to all religions moving within the democratic framework. Falun Gong is a special case, especially because we know, as you mentioned, that degradation and torture are used. We are of course following this with great concern and are also raising it repeatedly.</p>
<p class="contents">You mentioned the re-education camps. We have raised them as well, not only in connection with religious freedom but generally. The Chinese side has known for many years that re-education camps have long been a thorn in the flesh of the European Union, because they certainly do not meet the normal international standards of human rights. You can therefore be assured, honourable Member, that we are also seeking to end the suppression of the Falun Gong faith and its adherents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Greece has been rocked by a scandal involving mobile telephone tapping.

There are also a host of other Community rules.

Infringements of civil rights must always be a matter of concern to us, not only abstractly, but quite specifically, whether it is the illegal tapping of telephone conversations or anything else. The rules that we have, both national and European rules, are there to prevent that. If they are unable to prevent it, we must draw the appropriate conclusions.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Turkey's new national security philosophy and the EU-Turkey customs union protocol</span></p>
<p class="contents">In his recent interview with the Austrian magazine Profil, the Turkish Prime Minister, Mr Erdogan, reaffirmed his government's refusal to ratify the additional customs union protocol, linking that issue once again with the adoption of the regulation on trade with the Turkish Cypriot community. At the same time, the newspaper Hürriyet has revealed the new national security philosophy adopted by Turkey's Council of Ministers following its approval by the National Security Council. According to this authoritative source, the Turkish political leadership now accepts as 'grounds for war' the exercise by Greece of its right, recognised under international law, to extend its territorial waters in the Aegean to 12 miles, while continuing to oppose the re-opening of the Theological School of Halki.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that the above positions are a flagrant violation of the EU institutions' decisions and the obligations of Turkey as a candidate for accession, and in view of the army's continued intervention in politics, does the Council intend to take the unanimous decision required and instruct the Commission to launch accession negotiations during the Austrian Presidency by opening the initial chapters? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ratification and subsequent application of the protocol adapting the Ankara Agreement to take account of the accession of the 10 new EU Member States is also a priority, and indeed a short-term priority for the revised Accession Partnership agreed in January 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Community and its Member States noted in their declaration of 21 September 2005 that the Union would be monitoring whether the additional protocol was being applied to all EU Member States without restriction and without discrimination and would make an assessment of the matter in 2006. As you know, the application of the protocol is a precondition for opening negotiations on the relevant chapters. If the protocol is not fully implemented, that will no doubt be detrimental to progress in the negotiations as a whole. The Council will be reviewing the progress made on these questions in the course of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Now so far as the unresolved border disputes are concerned, I should refer to the corresponding conclusions adopted by the European Council at its meeting in Helsinki in 1999 and at its meeting in Brussels in December 2004. There can of course be no doubt that if Turkey is seeking accession it must share the European Union’s values and objectives as enshrined in the Treaties. It must show undoubted commitment to good neighbourly relations and settle unresolved border disputes in accordance with the principle of the peaceful settlement of disputes enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">These questions form part of the scope of the negotiations, are short-term priorities of the Accession Partnership and are systematically raised in political dialogue meetings with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the reopening of the Theological School of Halki is concerned, this is a demand that the Union continues to raise forcefully with Turkey. Freedom of religion generally, of which we have already spoken today, is one of the areas in which further progress must be made as a matter of urgency and where concrete measures must now be taken. The enactment of a law that will deal with all the difficulties of non-Muslim religious minorities and religious communities in accordance with current European standards is one of the Accession Partnership’s short-term priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I met with the president of the Turkish constitutional court only two days ago and I also raised this question then. She assured me that the constitutional court has taken measures concerning the legal personality of religious communities and their ability to acquire property and that those measures have actually obtained or will obtain legal force. It is certainly a matter that we regularly raise.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, the Council can assure the honourable Member that we are continuing to pursue these questions in the ongoing reform process in Turkey and in so doing will take full account of the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised Accession Partnership. The extent to which progress is made in the reforms and Turkey complies with its Treaty obligations will naturally affect the negotiation process.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand at present, however, I cannot of course anticipate the conclusions the Council will reach in its further deliberations on these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Siniora’s visit to Brussels, which was very brief, was an opportunity to stress the European Union’s support for the independence, sovereignty and democracy of Lebanon at an important juncture in that country’s history. That meeting, with all the foreign ministers present, was not the right occasion to raise Dr Mugraby’s case.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not mean, however, that the Council is not pursuing Dr Mugraby’s case closely. It has already raised it with the Lebanese government on several occasions; one such occasion was an approach to the Lebanese authorities on 22 December expressing the European Union’s concern about the charges brought against Mr Mugraby.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to make it very clear here that the Council is convinced that it is unacceptable for a person to be prosecuted for peacefully exercising his right to freely express his opinion, especially before an institution of the European Union like the European Parliament. We will therefore continue to pursue this case closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council has also expressed this in legislative acts and programmes, as for example the framework decision of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism and the EU Counter-Terrorism Strategy of 1 December 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">The foreign ministers discussed the question of the camp in Guantánamo during their dinner on the occasion of the 22/23 March European Council in Brussels, noting among other things that Guantánamo remains a cause for serious concern. They noted that the Heads of Government of some of the United States’ close allies have called for Guantánamo to be closed and that those calls were right and came at the right time. Some EU ministers also pointed out that they had already voiced their concern at meetings with the US Secretary of State in Brussels. I should also point out that the Council President, Foreign Minister Plassnik, stated publicly on 22 March that EU Member States and US allies had already called for Guantánamo to be closed on a number of occasions. She went on to say: ‘Those calls were good and important, but they were not enough.’</p>
<p class="contents">On the principle that no one can be above the law, the EU has for some time been conducting a purposeful legal dialogue with the United States with the aim of ensuring that humanitarian international law and human rights are applied in the fight against terrorism. We assume – and I quote again – ‘that Guantánamo will soon be a thing of the past’. This was said in recognition of the fact that terrorism must be fought in a manner that is credible and consistent with human rights and that we have to insist on that, especially as the European Union, which is offering possible solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council welcomes the fact that the Court of Justice found that examination of the questions referred by the national court for a preliminary ruling revealed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Articles 5, 6 and 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also point out that Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council gives passengers certain rights if they are denied boarding or flights are cancelled or delayed. Article 16 of the Regulation (‘Infringements’) requires every Member State to designate a body to be responsible for the enforcement of the Regulation on its territory. Where appropriate, that body takes the necessary measures to ensure that the rights of passengers are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">It also stipulates that passengers may complain to any such designated body about an alleged infringement of the Regulation and, finally, Article 16, paragraph 3, provides that the sanctions laid down by the Member States for infringements of the Regulation must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore primarily up to the Member States and the national bodies responsible for implementation to ensure that passengers actually enjoy the rights granted them by the Regulation when they make a complaint.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President cut off the speaker)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, under Article 211 of the EC Treaty it is the Commission’s responsibility to ensure that the provisions of the Regulation are actually applied. The Council is monitoring the application of the Regulation attentively. In particular, it will be carefully examining the report on the operation and results of the Regulation, which, under Article 17, the Commission is required to submit by 1 January 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with Mr Ryan’s question in particular, the Council would point out that, together with the European Parliament, it issued the above Regulation on assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding under the codecision procedure in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention that the Council, also under the codecision procedure with Parliament, will shortly be adopting a Regulation on the rights of passengers with disabilities and with restricted mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">It should finally be pointed out that the European Commission has the right of initiative to propose legislative acts to strengthen the rights of air passengers and that no new proposals have been presented. The Council does not therefore intend to adopt further legislative acts in this field in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does it share the view that this significant cut by two thirds of the original provision will hold back the transport sector more broadly defined, particularly since some of these projects are already encountering problems, and how does it intend to deal with this matter during the current six months? Does it intend to seek a solution in the revision and/or suspension of some of the priority programmes?</p>

<p class="contents">As regards the requested funding, the Commission has made a start, following the agreement reached at the December European Council, on assessing the prospects for Community financial aid within the new framework. When this assessment has been completed, the Council will resume its discussions without delay, so that agreement can be reached as soon as possible on the definitive adoption of the proposal by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the field of transport in general, it must be emphasised that Community financial aid in the field of the trans-European transport networks is intended for cofinancing projects that are often carried out within the framework of cooperation between national, public and also private authorities in the Member States. The Community financial aid has the potential to, as it were, leverage funding from public and private authorities at national level and promote coordination between various national measures, particularly with regard to cross-border sections. However, responsibility for implementing the projects remains with the Member States concerned – and also the participating actors, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">If the implementation of a project of common interest is considerably delayed, the Commission may, pursuant to Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network, consult the Member States concerned and adopt suitable measures, with due regard to the division of competences. As regards the re-examination of the list of priority projects set out in the Decision, the Commission may, by virtue of its right of initiative, present legislative proposals within the framework of the report on the implementation of the guidelines that it has to present every two years.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the funding for the TEN budget heading in the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013, I should like to make the general point, as regards the funding of TEN projects from resources for the trans-European networks in this period, that I have already advocated – when I appeared on behalf of the Presidency in Parliament’s Committee on Transport and Tourism on 25 January – that the resources for the trans-European networks be increased still further in the Financial Perspective if possible. Accordingly, I have also made the decision-makers and negotiators aware of the importance and urgency involved and pointed out that it is not possible to disregard mobility and sustainability – for which the extension of the trans-European networks is an essential precondition – when announcing growth strategies and job creation at European level. I was pleased to note that a compromise was reached at yesterday’s trialogue. It is to be hoped that, by making use of all possible scope, we can now at least moderate the reduction of the TEN resources for the 2007–2013 period. As President of the Transport, Telecommunications and Energy Council, I myself have constantly pointed out the importance of realising the TEN priority projects and, as I have already mentioned, have also made the responsible parties to the negotiations aware of this and applied pressure where this was possible and helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that agreement has been reached, at least for the time being, and hope, as I say, that we are now able to tackle at least the most important projects as a result. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, there is no doubt that we shall have to establish priorities and, after a few years, shall be able to determine that the projects that are ready for construction the quickest are also likely to have the best chances of being realised. For this reason, it will be the overriding task of those with relevant responsibility in the Councils to ensure that those priority trans-European networks that have been identified as important to employment and economic development have the necessary, relevant approval and are thus ready for construction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These are large-scale projects that aim to create a balance between the various modes of transport and to contribute towards a sustainable transport system in the EU. In addition, these cross-border projects improve economic integration in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the honourable Member has specifically enquired about the timescales, I can say that the construction of the two axes is expected to be completed in 2015. However, the final decision on these large cross-border projects and their swift implementation naturally depends on the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013 and partly – as I have already mentioned – on the necessity of finding private funding.</p>
<p class="contents">Once there is agreement on the necessary budget, a long-term implementation plan is required for the completion of these ambitious projects. By way of conclusion, I should like to emphasise that it is my firm personal conviction, particularly as regards the North–South transit route of axis No 1: Berlin – Munich – Verona – Palermo, that the first sod will have been turned by the end of this year and we shall be able to begin. I myself turned the first sod for the heart of the project, the Brenner Base Tunnel, and, over the last three-and-a-half years, together with my fellow Minister Mr Lunardi, I have done my utmost to bring this project to where it is now. I believe that a concerted effort is appropriate and necessary in respect of these two important axes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the honourable Member is no doubt aware, Parliament and the Council have adopted the Decision on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network. This assumes that the work on railway axis No 23 – the said Gdansk – Warsaw – Brno/Bratislava – Vienna axis – will be completed in the 2010–2015 period. The Council Presidency is of the opinion that this railway axis is of paramount importance, as it contributes towards the establishment of commercial enterprises along the axis and promotes a shift to alternative modes of long-distance transport, but is also intended to take account of the mobility requirements of those making regional journeys.</p>
<p class="contents">In July of last year – 2005, that is – six European coordinators were appointed to advance the realisation of five priority transport axes and the introduction of the European Rail Traffic Management System. Railway axis No 23 is not one of these initial priority projects, but at this stage the Presidency cannot anticipate a decision on which transport axes will be classified as priority projects in future and whether a second group of European coordinators will be used – my apologies for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The transport projects of railway axis No 23 form part of the National Reform Programmes (NRP) of the Czech Republic, Poland and Slovakia; preliminary economic studies have already been conducted, and the design studies and environmental impact assessments have begun. I should like to add that large-scale investment in the Vienna–Venice section, which was also mentioned in this question, is planned in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also reiterate that, as has been mentioned a number of times already today, a final decision on railway axis No 23 also depends on agreement on the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013, and on the mobilisation of private capital. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation with the Brenner Base Tunnel, the heart of the Berlin–Palermo transit route, is as follows. The Commission has promised to cofinance the pilot tunnel to the tune of 50% – a large sum. The investment volume for this pilot tunnel amounts to approximately EUR 450 million. We are currently in phase 2, the preparatory stage, and, in the summer of this year, we shall start boring this pilot tunnel and do our utmost to implement phase 3 – the phase of constructing the Brenner Base Tunnel itself – in no more than two-and-a-half to three years, so as to guarantee its completion by 2015 at the latest, as envisaged by the international treaty between Italy and Austria. As I have always said, if we are ambitious in our pursuit of these objectives, it is quite possible to save a couple of years, so that, in the best-case scenario, the heart of this transit route – the Brenner Base Tunnel – could be completed in 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise here, however, that, if the countries concerned are in agreement and the Commission gives them maximum support – as Vice-President Barrot, who has also been enquiring about the situation on site, has just done – there will be progress to match.

To take three questions together and only get through ten questions is really a reflection on this House. Something has to be done about this. I am sent here by people to ask questions. There are 700 of us. To get through that few questions is really quite an appalling reflection on the House and the system. I would ask that this be communicated to the Bureau because something needs to be done about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
