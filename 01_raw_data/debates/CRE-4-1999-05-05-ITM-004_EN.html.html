I would like to know if this is correct, and if so, can you tell me on what basis this decision was taken, as it is a totally abnormal procedure?

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span>  <span class="italic">Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Berlin Agenda 2000 package, which accounts for a volume of more than EUR 680 billion, probably contains the most comprehensive reform of EU policies in the history of the Union. It includes a solid financial framework up to the year 2006, substantial reforms to the common agricultural policy and to structural policy, as well as changes to the own resources decision that take greater account of the Member States" financial situation and help distribute the burden more fairly.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 was concluded in accordance with the timetable fixed by the European Council in Cardiff, which demonstrated that the European Union is able to act under increasingly difficult conditions. This prompt agreement paves the way to enlargement eastward. It is also an important precondition for the seamless continuation of structural policy as from 1 January 2000. Let me briefly repeat the key elements of the reform. On the common agricultural policy: the Berlin package contains the widest‐reaching reform ever of the common agricultural policy. The gradual approximation of support prices to the world market price level, flanked by direct payments, prepares our undertakings for the further liberalisation of world trade that is taking place now. Among the key elements of the reform package are the further development of the rural development policy, including improved support for environmentally compatible farming methods.</p>
<p class="contents">On structural policy: the distinct tightening up of structural policy through internal concentration, which means fewer objectives and fewer Community initiatives, and through concentrating the range of supports will increase efficiency. The structural resources will be concentrated on the genuinely needy regions, especially by giving clear priority to Objective 1 regions and by continuing the Cohesion Fund. An additional priority will be to combat unemployment. To that end, the Objective 3 funds, intended to support employment measures, will be increased substantially. For the years 2000 to 2006, a total of EUR 24 billion will be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">On the financing system: the European Council has recognised that there are still budgetary imbalances in the financing of the Union and has provided for changes to the existing own resources system in order to take more account of the Member States" ability to pay and thus make their contributions fairer. In the Council"s view, it is particularly important that in spite of these comprehensive reforms it proved possible to stabilise expenditure. The ceiling of EU expenditure remains 1.27 % of the European Union"s gross national product, and we will continue to remain below this ceiling.</p>
<p class="contents">In the year 2006, expenditure will account for 1.13 % of the EU"s gross national product. That is equivalent to the 1999 value. The resources allocated to enlargement up to the year 2006 are included in this figure, in this 1.13 %. The expenditure for the EU of 15 members is to be EUR 686 billion up to 2006 and will be kept constant in real terms, which means that for the first time we will now also be achieving at European level what the Member States have already achieved, namely strict budgetary discipline, strict expenditure discipline and keeping budgetary increases in line with economic requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In real terms, agricultural expenditure will be restricted to an average of EUR 40.5 billion a year for market measures plus about EUR 13 billion for rural development over the period 2000 to 2006. That means that agricultural expenditure will be stabilised at the 1999 level. The Agenda 2000 reform package represents a major step towards enlargement. In agricultural policy, by placing more emphasis on the world market and the environment, we will now be giving agriculture in the accession countries a good basis for agricultural policy planning. That will make it easier for them to integrate in the European single market.</p>
<p class="contents">A sum of about EUR 22 billion is being made available for pre‐accession aid, together with a further EUR 58 billion for enlargement‐related expenditure, which means that over the financing period a total of EUR 80 billion is available for enlargement, although it can only be spent if enlargement actually takes place. These resources cannot be transferred for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards financial precautions, as I have already pointed out we are still below the own resources ceiling, which means we have a quite considerable financial margin of 0.14 % of the EU gross national product to provide for unforeseen expenditure. What is crucial now is for the political decisions to be implemented rapidly by the adoption of the necessary legal acts, i.e. the prompt conclusion of the legislative procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress that we are all responsible for the success of this historic reform package. It is now up to the European Parliament to decide on Agenda 2000. Let me point out that the conciliation procedure agreed between the Austrian Presidency and Parliament has proved to be extremely successful and useful. Parliament was kept fully informed on a regular basis of the progress of work on Agenda 2000 and the Commission and the Council took account of Parliament"s views in their deliberations. There was not just an exchange of ideas but a genuine process of mutual influence, which I felt was extremely important and which also went a very long way to meet Parliament"s view of itself as an institution with a genuine say.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am confident that the European Parliament will take a responsible approach in exercising its rights to participate in the decisions on the regulations on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund. Let me point out again that the presidency has made considerable efforts to achieve a result that pleases and satisfies all parties concerned, not just Parliament but the Member States too. If you will allow me, I will make a personal comment now – after all this is probably also my last appearance in the European Parliament. It is interesting to note that an agenda such as Agenda 2000 is of course also a fight between the Member States for the money available for distribution. Indeed a very large sum of money has to be distributed. That is why it was not really surprising to find that prior to the Cologne summit there was criticism from various sides about the presidency"s strategy, about the way the negotiations were conducted; but since the Berlin summit, the situation has been assessed quite differently.</p>
<p class="contents">All the European capitals have voiced unanimous praise and agreement, which shows that we have achieved what we wanted to achieve. Nobody won in Berlin, and nobody lost either. Everyone made their contribution to the compromise and everyone gained something from this compromise. In that respect I think I am entitled to say that it was a successful summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all the committee members, the chairmen of the committees involved and Parliament"s rapporteurs for their good cooperation over the past months. I do not think I need at this point give a detailed list of the many amendments proposed by Parliament and which the Council accepted. You know all that.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to mention the most recent example of the Council"s willingness to compromise with Parliament, namely the fact that the URBAN Community initiative is now being continued thanks to Parliament"s pressure. We also managed to find a compromise solution on the question of the financing of URBAN. Moreover, the Council stated that it was prepared to negotiate at a given time about making up to EUR 200 million available from the budget"s flexibility reserve to offset the cost of innovative measures. That is a good example of the successful cooperation between the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I also had a strong personal commitment to the success of this agenda, which is why I appeal to you to approve the package before you. I believe that both sides, the Council and Parliament, have done as much as they could. There are still some wishes that have not been satisfied, nobody disputes that. We, I, the presidency, still have some wishes that were not satisfied. But we must never forget that this kind of negotiated result simply represents what 15 Member States can do together at a given time, and given that we were 15, we could do no more. We could perhaps have achieved more had we been 14, or 13 or 12, but not with 15 Member States. What we have before us is what the 15 can achieve at this point in time. Parliament can do more, I know that, but when you take your decision please do not forget that the Member States are firmly convinced that they have reached the limits of what they can do.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary in the interest of the people, of the citizens of Europe, for the necessary regulations to be adopted and for there to be no delays. Many European regions have to adjust to the changes resulting from Agenda 2000. We should not ask them to accept a period of insecurity and uncertainty. Thank you for your attention!</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Wulf‐Mathies, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President‐in‐Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Agenda 2000 is being adopted against the background of the Kosovo crisis. Nothing could make it clearer how important it is to safeguard and deepen European integration. As European history has shown, it takes far more than the absence of war for societies to develop peacefully in the long term. Democracy, respect for human rights, tolerance, security and economic and social stability form the basis of the success of the EU and the personal welfare of each individual.</p>
<p class="contents">The humanitarian disaster in Kosovo makes enlargement eastward and the democratic and economic stabilisation of the Balkans even more urgent, in the interests not only of the people in Central and Eastern Europe but also of our own security. Against this background, we cannot overestimate the importance of financially safeguarding the enlargement process through Agenda 2000 and of the positive signal the Community is thereby giving the states applying for accession. But we must do more than this, which is why it is right and necessary that over and above Agenda 2000 the Council has also declared itself willing to cover the additional resources needed for the Balkans by, if necessary, reviewing the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">So far Europe has been able to develop a social system that broadly guarantees democracy, cultural diversity, competitiveness and solidarity. The various pillars – the single market, economic and monetary union and promoting economic and social cohesion – have helped achieve that. Agenda 2000 safeguards these pillars and allows us to further develop the European system for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption by the European Parliament of Agenda 2000 will conclude a two‐year process of intensive discussions and negotiations. By in a sense anticipating Amsterdam, if I may put it that way, the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament have proved through a process of increasingly close coordination and positive give and take that it is possible to achieve results that will help the EU as a whole to make progress. It makes no difference that this is a genuine compromise, meaning that not everyone could obtain all they wanted, and that it is a compromise that produces more satisfactory results in some areas than in others.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank the presidencies involved, and in particular the presidency of the Council and Chancellor Schröder, for the fact that they managed, by persevering with the negotiations, to bring about agreement between the Member States. That was a success for Europe during a difficult time. And let me thank Parliament not just for the numerous improvements to the original proposals but above all for its constructive approach and the great flexibility it displayed, which made it possible to reach agreement so quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already said that not everything has been resolved in an equally satisfactory manner. Mr Fischler will talk about this in detail later in relation to agricultural policy. The Commission regrets that it did not prove possible in Berlin to adopt at least those reforms that the agriculture ministers had already decided. The watering down of the reforms in the cereals and milk sector raises a number of questions. The review clause in the cereals sector shows that the Heads of State and Government have not even excluded the possibility, perhaps indeed the necessity, of further improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">With the postponement of the milk reform to the end of the 2000‐2006 period, the costs of the reform were merely postponed to the next financing period, without removing the market imbalances. But one positive aspect I would like to emphasise is that the Council has adopted the Commission"s proposals on the second pillar, on the consolidation of rural development policy, almost unchanged. That not only underpins sustainable development in the rural regions but also gives the European Parliament a new power of codecision on agricultural matters, for in future this expenditure will be shown as non‐compulsory. So that too satisfies a major demand by Parliament. The division of the traditional agricultural guideline into two sub‐headings that this calls for will in fact require stricter budgetary discipline in the organisations of the markets. But overall, the agricultural reform is an important step towards a competitive agriculture in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major pillar of Agenda 2000 is the reform of regional and cohesion policy. It is a sign of the close cooperation between all concerned that this reform strengthens the policy of social and economic cohesion in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if the financial resources for the next funding period remain a little below what the Commission originally proposed, one major success is that the level of Community solidarity with the poorest and structurally weakest regions of the Union is being maintained without any cutbacks and that the Cohesion Fund is being continued. In this context I think it is important to point out that the Structural Funds, with their declining expenditure profile, make an important contribution to consolidating the budget, although Community solidarity with the structurally weakest regions remains fixed at the highest level of the last funding period, namely at the level of 1999. That was only possible because this time the principle of concentration really could be applied successfully. The structurally weakest Objective 1 regions will receive not just two thirds but this time as much as 70 % of all Structural Funds resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The criteria relating to eligibility for aid and to the level of that aid are not just objective and transparent, they are also being observed strictly and without exception and I believe that is an important point which will also be significant for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to implementation and management, we will in future look to decentralisation, a clear distribution of tasks and responsibilities, building up partnership at all levels and substantially improving monitoring, control and evaluation. Since the European Court of Auditors and Parliament"s Committee on Budgets have taken a very positive view of these aspects of the Commission"s proposal, I am confident that this has created the conditions for better control in future than in the past by the Commission, the European Parliament and the Court of Auditors of the financial settlement and efficiency of the resources allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">But above all, the principle of concentration means concentration on the Union"s political priorities. So all the Structural Funds will now concentrate on creating secure jobs for the future, which means employment‐intensive growth, strengthening the competitiveness and innovative power of the regions, sustainable development and promoting skills and equal opportunities. That applies in particular to the European Social Fund, which Mr Flynn will be discussing in more detail later on.</p>
<p class="contents">As an instrument of labour market policy and of the development of human resources, it will also form the core of the European employment strategy, an active labour market policy. Equal access to the employment market for all, lifelong learning, the adaptability of workers and undertakings and positive actions in favour of women are key elements here. We cannot have an effective structural policy unless we establish closer partnership. Here the Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament and I am sure that Parliament will ensure in future too that adequate attention is paid to this in the everyday implementation of the Structural Funds reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Partnership between the Commission and Parliament also includes the code of conduct that we have agreed. Parliament has also succeeded in its call for all the structural measures for fisheries to be brought together under Category 2 and for unified horizontal planning. At the last minute, as Mr Verheugen pointed out, it even proved possible to strengthen the urban dimension of the Structural Funds through the fourth Community initiative, URBAN, called for by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Agenda 2000 is also the necessary condition for the enlargement process. With its pre‐accession aid and the gradual inclusion of the Central and Eastern European countries, the agenda is mobilising a package of EUR 80 billion for economic development in Central and Eastern Europe. Here it is drawing on proven instruments to reduce infrastructure weaknesses in transport and the environment and it will try to ensure that these instruments are effectively linked to the existing PHARE and Interreg instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to the implementation of the Agenda 2000 package for the new interinstitutional agreement to establish a solid, seven‐year financial framework. Agreement was reached on the following points during the negotiations. By limiting expenditure, the EU is contributing to budgetary consolidation on a Europe‐wide basis. At the same time, the financing of Community policy is guaranteed in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the financial distribution system is fairer. I know that not all Members are convinced of the merits of the proposed interinstitutional agreement. That is why I would stress that it is also in Parliament"s interest that the implementation of Agenda 2000 is not jeopardised by annual budgetary conflicts. Mr Liikanen will be confirming this when he gives his views later.</p>
<p class="contents">At any rate the Commission believes that it is very much thanks to the European Parliament that the necessary budgetary discipline will not create a burden for the poorest members of the Community, that at the same time this expenditure discipline enables us to tie up an important enlargement package and that we have achieved additional margins for manoeuvre in internal policy areas and in regard to administrative tasks, which will enable us on the one hand to underpin the emerging economic and employment upswing and on the other to put the administration in a position really to shoulder the additional new tasks. In light of the debates we have had here in past months, I believe that is an important common aim.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agenda 2000 reforms encompass EU policy areas that directly concern the people of Europe. These proposals open up new personal prospects for many people. It is your privilege, by the adoption of the legislative proposals on Agenda 2000, to lay an important foundation stone not just for fulfilling the expectations of our people but also for the Europe of the future. That is why I hope they will find broad support and on behalf of the entire Commission let me say that I am grateful for the excellent cooperation with the European Parliament on the Agenda 2000 package.</p>
