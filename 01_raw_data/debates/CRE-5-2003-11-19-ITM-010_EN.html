This is a contrast in which, as a Member of the European Parliament, I take no pride.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I wish, of course, to express my thanks to my colleagues from the other political groups for the spirit of cooperation and collaboration that I was shown from the outset in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. This approach enabled us to adopt a balanced, coherent and, therefore, credible report. The only reason I cannot claim to be totally satisfied is because the amendment I tabled to have the report’s fifteenth and final paragraph removed was not successful.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament would do well to acknowledge that defence is an enormously sensitive field in political terms and currently falls directly within the competence of the Member States. Calling for codecision for industrial policy in the field of defence equipment is not realistic and affects the balance reached in the committee. I would therefore ask my fellow Members to accept the proposal that I tabled to have the paragraph removed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, despite the fact that the European Union has already demonstrated its willingness to assume, in addition to the financial contribution it makes, further responsibilities for managing and undertaking peacekeeping operations – as we are currently seeing, for example, in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the Democratic Republic of the Congo - weaknesses and shortcomings still remain. Like the conflict in the Balkans, the war in Afghanistan clearly demonstrated the disparities that remain between the United States and Europe in the field of military capability and of defence technology.</p>
<p class="contents">This difference in capability must, therefore, be reduced, in order to achieve a more balanced transatlantic cooperation, thereby increasing stability and security in the euro-Atlantic area. Increasing the Union’s military capability does not, however, mean that we need, straightaway, to create new structures and devote more financial resources to developing this policy in practice. We all know that the overall spending by Member States on defence is around half of what the USA spends, but that, in terms of military capability, this percentage falls to around 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, one might conclude that the budgetary resources the Member States allocate to defence capability are insufficient. On the contrary, because the Union does not have the same needs or the same strategic objectives as the United States, it is in a position to meet its needs with the financial means it has currently. This is primarily a question of Europe’s making better use of the financial resources available to it, and I will tell you how this can be done. Major changes have already taken place or are now taking place in the national defence-related industries in various European countries, in a concerted effort to improve the management of their industrial arms policies. The European Union, therefore, has an obligation to promote these attempts at approximation with the aim of ensuring the interoperability of means both at intra-European and transatlantic levels, in order to avoid pointless and wasteful duplication and overlapping. Furthermore, prudent harmonisation between regulations for the defence equipment market and for the civilian market is desirable, particularly in the case of the countless companies that produce for both markets at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, however, that defence equipment is not a product like any other and should be treated differently. A first step in this direction could be to simplify the administrative formalities governing intra-Community transfers of defence products, and gradually to harmonise national licensing systems. If these attempts to streamline are to succeed, there must be better coordination between Member States. Therefore, as I said at the beginning of my speech, we welcome the decision that has just been taken by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Defence to accept the objective of making the European Arms Agency operational as of June 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">To bring my speech to a close, I shall take this opportunity to summarise the main conclusions of the report that we will be voting on tomorrow. These are: increasing European military capability, so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives; improving the interoperability of defence equipment, at both intra-European and transatlantic levels, with a view to guaranteeing the security and stability of Europe and of the Atlantic area; establishing, in this framework, conditions favourable to developing a competitive and viable European defence equipment industry; better use of public monies in this field, in particular to prevent overlapping, by promoting industrial and technological interdependency and research linked to this sector; involving the new enlargement countries in this process of industrial reconversion; promoting adequate rules governing competition and security of supply while taking account of the gradual opening up of the arms markets; creating financial support measures for new defence equipment, in particular to develop equipment to protect the Union’s external borders, including its maritime borders; and, finally, the need to improve parliamentary monitoring and follow-up mechanisms for security and defence policy at both levels at which it is implemented - the European and the national levels - with the appropriate involvement of the respective parliamentary representations.</p>
<p class="contents">In today’s world, which is threatened by terrorism, security has become a global and indivisible concept, quite different to traditional concepts of security. The obligation incumbent on the European Union and on its Member States is, consequently, in cooperation with their allies, to streamline their military and arms capabilities and at the same time increase resources for diplomatic cooperation, for the information services and also for police and judicial cooperation in a genuine synergy of national and trans-national policies. This report on the defence industries seeks to contribute to enhancing the climate of collective security that we would all like to see. Support from my fellow Members of this Parliament will give it the political clout needed to bring about the changes it recommends. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In its resolution of April 2002, the European Parliament urged the Commission to address industry- and market-related issues in the context of the European defence industry. Developments in recent years, such as the gradual piecing together of a European security and defence policy, and changes in the industry itself have set the scene for a re-evaluation of the issue, which a few years ago was considered premature. The Commission is perfectly aware of the sensitivity of this area and of the specific characteristics of the defence sector. Consequently, we adopted a cautious approach, focusing on the prospects for developing Europe’s industrial and technological potential in the long term and stating our determination to make a substantial contribution to the efforts of the European Union, wherever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As everyone knows, we presented proposals for practical action, in particular on research in the field of security and defence and on developing a European defence equipment market. Our proposals were well received by the Member States and I am pleased because the Commission has now been implementing some of these decisions since March of this year. In this context, I should like to emphasise that an impact assessment study is currently being conducted on the issue of simplifying intra-Community transfers of defence equipment. As regards the issue of calls for tender, a Green Paper is being prepared to open the debate on a set of adequate rules for the profitable acquisition of goods and services by the Member States’ defence procurement agencies and by the future European Agency in an entirely compatible and integrated way.</p>
<p class="contents">The joint efforts in the field of standardization with the European Committee for Standardization (CEN) in order to draw up a European manual that can be applied to defence contracts are continuing; the principles for undertaking economic control of the defence industry and market in the enlarged European Union have been delineated; and there has been a change of approach to controlling the export of dual-use products, in the broader context of European Union strategy and of the action plan to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to research issues, I should like to inform you that the Commission is putting the finishing touches to a communication on preparatory action for increasing European industrial potential related to research in the field of security for the period 2004-2006. At the beginning of next year, a call for tender will be published. A group of experts has been set up with the aim of advising and assisting the Commission in this task, which we hope will contribute to a substantial European research programme in the field of security, from 2007 onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Queiró’s report broadly supports the Commission’s approach of strengthening the European defence base in industrial and technological matters, by gradually establishing a European defence equipment market and by promoting research in the field of security. He welcomes, in particular, the proposals for standardization, the rules for public tenders and for intra-Community transfers, emphasising as regards the latter the link with controlling arms exports at the Union’s external borders and, in particular, Parliament’s proposals for an EU code of conduct. The report welcomes the idea of pilot projects to be undertaken in research and development in the field of security. All of these suggestions encourage the Commission in its action and we also feel encouraged by the favourable opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy on the creation of the common European market for defence equipment and its explicit support for various proposals by the Commission in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the creation of an agency in the field of defence is concerned, following on from the mandate given by the Thessaloniki European Council, the Member States, through the Council, asked the Commission to clarify how the Community could work with and/or within the future agency so as to maximise synergies in pursuing common objectives. The Commission reacted favourably to this request and can today confirm its desire and willingness to contribute to this task, using the means already presented in the communication of March of this year, which is the subject of today’s debate. In this spirit, the Commission plans to be involved in the Agency’s development and operations, to help it to achieve its objectives, as defined by the European Council. To conclude, I should like to emphasise the Commission’s appreciation and hopes for the European Parliament’s support for Mr Queiró’s report, and for close collaboration with the Member States, in order to move ahead in an area that presents many challenges. European citizens and taxpayers are entitled to hope that we are moving towards greater effectiveness in the defence sector and towards greater credibility for European security and defence policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thanks to the impact of the Iraq crisis, we have in fact been able, throughout last year, to see a new convergence between Parliament’s, the Commission’s and the Council’s approaches to common foreign and security policy. We may therefore begin to hope that, in this area at least, the progress made by the Convention will not be fundamentally called into question by the expected decisions of the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, I include among these instances of progress the resolution to make a better job of spending the funds allocated by the various Member States to their defence, avoiding the present dissipation of effort in terms of research, development and the production of equipment necessary to the modernisation of the armed forces. With this in mind, we must hope, Commissioner, that, as our rapporteur requests, the Commission communication entitled ‘Industrial and Market Issues – Towards an EU Defence Equipment Policy’ will present – as I hope, and am sure, it will do – a favourable framework for increased cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it important to emphasise the fact that the opening up of national markets, which will thus have been made necessary, must be aimed not only at bringing about greater savings – which goes without saying – but also at guaranteeing security of supplies at national and European levels. I am well aware that this is a difficult need to satisfy, particularly for states which – like my own country, France – have so far made sure they retained as much independence as possible in this area. One of the Agency’s priorities should consist of proposing, for this purpose, the necessary changes to the current Treaty provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, let us be very wary of being satisfied with the impact of creating this much-vaunted Agency. Let us not forget that, prior to this, there existed OCCAR – the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation – which, at least to my knowledge, has never been able to be very active, for want of possessing the minimum Community budget needed for it to be effective. Let us be aware, ladies and gentlemen – particularly those of you in the Committee on Budgets – that, if we wish to progress beyond vague desires, we must lose no time in reflecting upon these issues and amending the 2004 budget to include the sums required if the Agency’s activities are to take off. Nor must we forget to provide our High Representative with the resources he needs in order to take action since, according to the Council’s proposal, it is he who will assume the direction of the Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">I was happy to hear, Commissioner, that, like ourselves, you are convinced of the need to give priority, in the area with which we are concerned, to research and that it is perhaps at this level that we could undertake the type of pilot project you mooted.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to give our enlarged Europe the place expected of it on the international scene, it has, finally, to be given the resources for taking action. As we have said, we need, therefore, to make a better job of spending, but we shall also definitely need to spend more. It is not easy for someone with political responsibility to acknowledge this truth, particularly at a time when it is so difficult to balance the budgets. I would therefore take this opportunity to salute the courage of the rapporteur and of all those within the committee who have backed his report by having written, or agreed, that the persistent refusal of many Member States to increase their defence expenditure is in danger of jeopardising the European Union’s military capability and the very coherence of its action within NATO. As I have said before in this House, Mr President and Commissioner, let us not forget the old French adage about false economy, widely heard in pre-Revolutionary France: no money, no Switzerland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission communication and this report have come at a good time for continuing the progress it has already been decided should be made by the ESDP, notably since the Cologne European Council in June 1999. Since then, new bodies have indeed been put in place: the PSC (Political and Security Committee), the Military Committee, the Military Staff and others placed variously alongside the High Representative responsible for foreign policy. It has been decided to set up a rapid reaction force of 60 000 men. Several conferences have been held to evaluate our military capability and deficiencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this period, a lot has therefore been done, but an observation, remarked upon many times, has also been made, namely that our defence industries are in great need of reform, without which we shall continue to waste funds by using them to no purpose. I shall not refer again to the various analyses and wishes expressed both by the Commission and by our rapporteur. I share them unreservedly, Mr Queiró, apart from your desire that we vote in favour of your Amendment 1. I cannot help but like paragraph 15, and I shall therefore vote against your wishes, for which I am sorry.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise one point, because it is important and also because it is topical, as pointed out before me by Mr Queiró and Mr Morillon. It concerns the creation of the European Armaments Agency. For a long time, the European Parliament has – inevitably, given what has just been said – expressed its support for creating such an Agency. We shall again express our support tomorrow by voting in favour of this report and of an excellent amendment tabled on this subject, that is to say the Agency, by Mr von Wogau. Matters have, I am very pleased to say, proceeded quickly, however, especially since good news from Europe is pretty rare at present. Last Monday, a joint decision by the foreign ministers, including those of the new Member States, in fact launched this Agency, which had been decided upon in principle at the Thessaloniki Summit and which must therefore begin its work in January 2004. That is good news. Let us hope that, despite the inevitable obstacles and resistance, this Agency will be a success. It should, I hope, go beyond the OCCAR – the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation – which was a big disappointment. This European Agency will have a broad range of tasks. It will have to concern itself with military capability, in terms of armaments and equipment, but also – and it is my turn to be emphatic – with research, which is a vital sector, to say the least, but one that has been rather neglected, not only by the European Union but also by its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened to you very carefully just now, Commissioner. I hope that the Commission will continue in the vein you have just indicated. In its favour, this Agency has the political will of those who are creating it and placing it alongside the Council of Ministers. What it also has in its favour is support from industrialists, who are perfectly aware of the need to work together at European and intra-European levels and who have already, moreover, begun to combine of their own accord. The Agency is supported by the European Parliament and the Commission. In short, a lot of good fairies are present at its birth. It will need their help in order to grow and have the prosperous life we wish for it, as well as for European security and defence policy as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We feel it is totally unacceptable to propose that European citizens should be asked to pay even more for military expenditure, when we should be going in the opposite direction and ensuring that European citizens' money is used for the good of society and mankind as a whole, not for destruction. We have tabled amendments to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">We firmly believe that this report, and the Commission communication on which it is based, are being pushed forward by the vested interests of the European military industrial lobbies, who are clearly the real policy makers. They have the unquestioning ear of the EU institutions, which appear to jump to their commands and do what they want.</p>
<p class="contents">This report supports the European Arms Agency, established last Monday by the Council of Ministers. The military industrial lobby has even succeeded in having this agency included in the draft EU Constitution. The inclusion in any constitution of a military agency whose aim is to promote common military procurement and to improve the arms industry's efficiency just beggars belief. Regardless of whether one is in favour of or against an EU Constitution, there is absolutely no justification for the inclusion of an agency that promotes the tools of death and destruction. There is also the question as to why this particular agency was selected for inclusion in the draft Constitution rather than, for example, a conflict prevention agency, which my group would have supported.</p>
<p class="contents">At the EU summit in Thessaloniki, the Irish Prime Minister, Mr Ahern, gave his backing to the establishment of this EU arms agency. I was shocked that the leader of a so-called neutral country, in which there is strong public opposition to the immoral arms trade, could give the go-ahead for such an agency. The decision could not have been adopted without the agreement of all the Heads of State. Our government clearly failed to stop this very dangerous and unacceptable decision, even though it had it within its power to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It was clear from the presidency's conclusions that one of the main objectives of this decision is to strengthen the EU arms industries and make them more competitive on the global stage. It beggars belief that, at a time when EU leaders are talking about reducing the threat of weapons of mass destruction and making the world a safer place, they could agree to such a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency conclusions stated that this agency, which will be subject to Council authority and open to participation by all Member States, will aim to develop defence capabilities in crisis management, promote and enhance European armaments cooperation, strengthen the European defence industrial technology base and create a competitive European defence equipment market, as well as promoting, in liaison with the Community, research activities, where appropriate, aimed at leadership in strategic technologies for future defence and security capabilities, and thereby strengthening Europe's potential in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">This is heading in totally the wrong direction. It is clear that these decisions are geared towards the vested interests of the European arms industries and that progress and research are going to be diverted away from useful aims towards products that kill and destroy people, rather than products that make the world a better place. The Irish Government's failure is a national scandal and one of the worst decisions that any Irish government leader has taken since 1990, when our Minister for Finance backed increased low-interest loans to the nuclear industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I would like to raise during this debate is the issue of low-frequency active sonar. My Group tabled two amendments on this report to underline that, apart from being against the development of weapons in general, we are very much against the development of military technology, the use of which is damaging to the environment. We firmly believe that, as was proposed last year, a ban should be put on the use of high-frequency sonar to detect submarines, but this very advanced technology is currently being used by the navies of NATO countries and the US in European military exercises. There are major problems, even at the experimental phase. The noise of these sonars kills whales and other species of marine life because it disturbs their orientation systems. This is completely unacceptable. EU research money should be used for ecologically responsible peaceful projects, rather than for this.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish with a comment on the EADS, which is the European Aeronautics Defence and Space Company, the second largest aerospace and defence company in the world. Its CEO bemoans the fact that the US already invests six times as much as Europe in armaments and research. Whilst research budgets in the US continue to rise, those in Europe remain stagnant. Why people have to criticise this is beyond me. This is something we should be welcoming. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the Commission's communication of 11 March 2003 on this subject is disappointing for three main reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it deals with the issue of the arms industries essentially from the point of view of the market and competition, because it is obviously in this field that it has a degree of competence. This is, however, an extremely reductionist point of view, because in this area security concerns are and must remain predominant. Lower costs in the acquisition of equipment is an important consideration, certainly, particularly in a period of budget deficit, but it is not the only one, far from it. For the sake of their security, the States must remain the sole masters of their considerations. This has always been recognised within the meaning of Article 296 of the EC Treaty, which is retained in the same form, I would remind you, in Article 342 of the third part of the draft European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission communication shows an excessive tendency towards communitisation, with codecision, and also by creating a Community framework for defence equipment which would apparently centre on the Arms Agency. Such communitisation is in no way in the interests of cooperation in the field of defence, which requires intergovernmental relations and variable geometries, under the control of national parliaments, so that the Member States are not discouraged from participating in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased, incidentally, that this Arms Agency, which is in the process of being launched, finally, on the basis of Article 17 of the EU Treaty, is of an intergovernmental nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I have found in paragraph 6 of the report by Mr Queiró – and I congratulate him very warmly on this – a key notion, which is absent from the Commission communication, and also from the draft European Constitution, which is the notion of Community preference. Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not understand how we can both want a European arms agency, intended in particular to promote and coordinate harmonisation of military equipment, and not at the same time commit the Member States to buying this equipment. This European preference must clearly remain flexible, since high-tech military equipment is not the same as agricultural products and, as I have already said, the States must retain control of their security. Therefore, even if this cannot be laid down in a strictly legal sense, there should at least be a statement of intention to this effect somewhere. I would thank Mr Queiró once again for having stated this clearly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder if this might not prove to be a contradiction in terms, as I see little evidence that many European countries have the political will to improve their defence capabilities or to provide the necessary additional financial resources for this.</p>
<p class="contents">As so often in Commission communications and reports in this House, the solution that is offered to a particular problem is to extend EU competence. That is our fundamental objection here. The emphasis, as always, is on creating the institutions of an EU defence industrial policy, rather than meeting military equipment needs and industrial requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The consistent failure of many European states to spend more on defence not only undermines the transatlantic alliance, but also damages our defence industries. Our armed forces need the best state-of-the-art interoperable equipment for their difficult tasks. Defence industrial link-ups and collaborations should be with the most advantageous partners, wherever they might be. I am therefore very suspicious of any mention of Community preference when it comes to activities by European countries in this field. There are serious deficiencies in the equipment and organisation of the armed forces in many European countries. The argument that there is duplication of effort among individual European countries and that economies of scale, as well as improved interoperability, would inevitably follow from a more harmonised EU defence procurement system is therefore seductive. But where is the reassurance that this is the motivation for an EU role in defence procurement, rather than - in terms of Western solidarity - a divisive intention that lies at the heart of ESDP?</p>
<p class="contents">Given that just six countries in Europe account for more than 90% of Europe's defence industrial capabilities and 98% of all R&amp;D expenditure, it is a peculiar logic to suggest that the representatives of 15 countries - let alone of 25 - should be involved in decision-making and monitoring in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Queiró report insists on the need for the EU to endow itself with military capabilities so as to ensure the credibility of its foreign and defence policy objectives. Is this not the true aim of the agency and an EU defence equipment policy, rather than the improvement of European defence industries and the development of our military capabilities?</p>
<p class="contents">Heaven forbid that the British armed forces should come to rely on obtaining their vital munitions and combat equipment needs from sources under the direction of Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am pleased that the report reaffirms that NATO is the cornerstone of Europe's collective defence, recognising that 11 of our existing EU Member States - 19 in the enlarged EU from next year - are members of both bodies. But if we want the EU to make a serious military contribution to the Petersberg task of peacekeeping and peacemaking, the European security and defence policy needs to be underpinned by a credible ability for EU nations to conduct military operations when NATO as a whole is not engaged. For those who want a greater EU role in global affairs vis-à-vis the United States, it is absolutely right to state that Europe is tied to US support for every military initiative and operation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is important in this debate to support the creation of a European Defence Agency, an agency that should be primarily focused on developing European military capabilities and establishing a framework for measuring them. Importantly, in the context of tonight's debate it will also have a wider commitment to promote cost-effective procurement and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the previous speaker from the British Conservatives, who sees in every action a conspiracy to increase EU competence, that it is in Britain's as well as in Europe's interests to create a truly competitive, internal defence market. British industry has always been one of the most competitive and open. There are many examples, such as the recent A 400 M contract, where simpler and clearer administrative procedures for procurement would have been welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to firms and employment in Britain, including in my region, the east of England, which is the second most defence-dependent in the United Kingdom, benefiting from this opening up of markets.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my final point. Although tonight's debate focuses on defence equipment industries and procurement, we must not forget the importance of increasing civilian capabilities for the prevention of conflict. The importance of trying to build a sustainable peace also requires serious action on conflict prevention and post-conflict strategy. I am very pleased to see progress on this aspect too and its inclusion in the Council conclusions from Monday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, then, we act from a European protectionist standpoint, the risk is even greater. The objective should be to draw up, as Europe, an innovative security and defence policy promoting stability and peace and opposing dictators: this should be our policy. The rapporteur mentioned the need to control the export of arms to third countries, and I am thinking in particular of dictatorships. This type of control is not being carried out at present in Europe: on the contrary, we are giving arms to dictators the world over.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point regards civil expenditure. The European Union is not doing enough about this; indeed, it is doing almost nothing. The Commission maintains that we must not copy the United States. Of course, but so as not to copy the United States, it would mean seeing if we could convert our military expenditure and structures into civil expenditure and structures, which could, perhaps, complement – not compete with or be an alternative to but complement – those of the United States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must recognise one fact: sooner or later Joe Public in the United States is going to wake up one morning and ask why it is that 3.2 cents of every dollar he pays to Uncle Sam goes to European defence. It is a good question. If I were an elected representative in Washington I would find it hard to answer.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems we are all agreed that we have to take greater responsibility for our defence, whether as independent nation states, or under the banner of Europe, or as partners in NATO - which I favour. Whatever the route, we will have to increase defence spending. If we were to continue procurement as we do now, we would have to increase tax by between 3% and 4%. As an elected politician, I would prefer not to have to tell that to my voters.</p>
<p class="contents">It comes down to more bang for our buck. In order to do that we must rationalise our defence spending, as Mr Queiró's report has pointed out. However, we must face two realities: first, the best and biggest bang may involve buying outside the EU. For example, the A 400 military transport may be a worthy successor to the Hercules, with a greater capability, when it flies, but the only long-range heavy lift aircraft in Europe today are the Boeing/McDonnell Douglas C17s leased, not owned, by the Royal Air Force.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that all the various attack helicopters have their good points, but spending money on developing four of them wholly or in part is folly. And the list goes on: communications equipment, next generation missiles, remotely piloted vehicles, etc. But the worst example of duplication is the next generation fighter.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eurofighter Typhoon is a superb aircraft. Millions of euros have been invested by four European countries and the weapons systems built around it. But it is not the only European fighter on offer. Dassault is selling the Rafale. Why am I not surprised that it is the Rafale that meets the requirements of the <span class="italic">Armée de l'Air</span>? I am sure that it has nothing to do with supplying the many air forces of the world that have purchased Dassault Mirages with the next generation fighter, at a price that would not be so low were it not for the purchase by the French Air Force.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be honest. We must have a proper evaluation of the role and requirements of our armed forces before we can develop a capability to meet them. It is only under NATO that this honesty and lack of national partiality can be achieved. Of course cooperation and economics go hand in hand, but we know that for our troops the equipment and the training are what count.</p>
<p class="contents">Hard training makes for easy battles. We must give our troops the best, both in equipment and training. We owe them nothing less. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The offensiveness of this claim does not deserve a response, but the slur on my good name that it represents forces me to protest.</p>
<p class="contents">I have nothing, of course, against Mrs McKenna’s opinions, which are bound to differ from my own. What I cannot accept, however, is her insinuation that I have supposedly acted subserviently to the interests of this sector or even that I represent these interests. I am quite aware of what to do in the event of a conflict of interest. Apart from being offensive, this insinuation is false and completely inappropriate to the serious political context in which this debate has taken place. Mrs McKenna’s claim and the disgraceful lack of ethics that it reveals therefore reflect on the person who uttered it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to stress that the Commission's initiative in this field relates to 1996 and 1997. At the time it failed precisely as a result of certain arguments that I have heard once again today in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention, however, to the fact that the initiative taken by the Commission following the request from the European Parliament and the Council must be based on the Treaties as they exist at the moment. While it is true that we are concerned to stress the importance of an economic and industrial basis for the development of this sector at European level, it is also important to stress the responsibilities of the Commission in the field of research and, above all, that this research strategy hinges on the concept of security. It is not therefore a form of research hinging on the concept of defence. This is why the Commission is rejecting certain considerations concerning the nature of this research.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that even when the debate involves crisis management or conflict prevention, we must not forget that the credibility and effectiveness of crisis management action within the framework of a conflict depends to a large extent on the capacity for military support allowing crises to be managed.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not live in an ideal world in which everybody would welcome humanitarian action just like that. No, humanitarian action, in order to be successful, requires the support of force and it is on this basis that we are in the process of creating a foreign security and defence policy. The Commission's initiative takes this precise approach, which is our approach, which is the European perspective and which is taken up by the Convention in the draft Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
