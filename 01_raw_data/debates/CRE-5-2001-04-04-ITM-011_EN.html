<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too should like to welcome you this evening to the House. We have an important item on our agenda today. It is about fighting money laundering and there is a close connection between money laundering and international crime. International crime – especially organised crime – is not worth the trouble if the money cannot be laundered, which is why waging an intensive war against money laundering has been the House’s concern from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">I recall that, in 1995, – when I first reported to the House on this matter – we called in our report on the Commission report on the application of the first money laundering directive for the Commission to table a new proposal for a second money laundering directive, because the first one was inadequate and only set a minimum standard. We confirmed this once again a few years later in Mr Newman’s report – at that time I was acting as shadow rapporteur for my Group. We therefore thank the Commission for initiating this legislative procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried, as requested at the Tampere Summit, to complete this legislative procedure as quickly as possible. Parliament made a huge effort, as did I in my capacity as rapporteur, to get the directive finally adopted in a single reading using the procedure provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam. This proved to be impossible because the Council was unable to decide on exactly what it wanted until the summer of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">We then concluded our first reading at the Council’s request and negotiations continued. Unfortunately, it was impossible to reconcile Parliament’s and the Council’s positions up to the Council’s common position. That was mainly because the discussion in the Council was being chaired not by the ministers of justice and internal affairs, but by the finance ministers, who failed to approach a whole series of fundamental questions with the required degree of sensitivity.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we have to retable 27 proposed amendments from the first reading at second reading because, to all intents and purposes, the Council has taken no notice of Parliament’s views. It is therefore an utter mockery to state, as the Council does in its explanatory statement, that Parliament’s arguments and positions have basically been incorporated.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the core problems? The core problem is not the question of banning money laundering. That was decided long ago. All the Member States introduced legislation many, many years ago banning money laundering, be it by criminals, lawyers, bankers, whoever.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the reporting obligations which are at issue here. Obviously, when we include new groups of professionals in the scope of money laundering, we sometimes encounter problems because these groups of professionals are obliged to take certain measures. For example, lawyers have a duty of professional secrecy as regards the information entrusted to them by their clients. This is a fundamental right of the clients, a fundamental right which is also set out in the Charter of European Fundamental Rights which was solemnly proclaimed in Nice recently.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, all I can say is that, what has been decided here by the finance ministers is far too much and goes far beyond what can be reconciled with fundamental rights. The Committee on Fundamental Freedoms therefore had no choice but to ensure that the relevant amendments were tabled to plenary at second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that the provisions of the current version of Article 6(3), which relate to an evaluation of the legal situation, have been interpreted very differently by the individual Council delegations and by the Commission and need urgent clarification. The identification obligations contained in this directive, as it stands following the common position, are overly bureaucratic and unusable. For example, it makes provision for complex identification obligations even in cases of little consequence and even where the lawyer and client are hundreds of miles apart.</p>
<p class="contents">All Parliament is concerned with is preventing money laundering and all that is needed therefore is to trigger identification obligations above a specific threshold as and when financial transactions are involved.</p>
<p class="contents">One last point on the question of equal treatment. We have a situation in which the common position treats the various liberal professions completely differently, despite the fact that there are Member States in which they may sometimes work in partnership. It is unthinkable to have to apply rule X to certain members of a firm and a stricter rule Y to other members of the same firm. This sort of arrangement would not work and corrections are therefore needed in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will endeavour to adopt this directive quickly. But we expect cooperation from the Council at long last, not obstruction by finance ministers at conciliation.</p>

We also know that, in the meantime, organised crime has earned billions of euros in various sectors. For example – and these too are figures from confirmed sources – human traffickers alone launder some EUR 1.1 billion from their work, namely getting illegal immigrants over the border, and some EUR 51 billion are laundered in the European Union from drug dealing in eastern Europe every year.</p>
<p class="contents">All this money – and this is the worrying thing – gets into legal circulation. Once it does so, it damages the legal economy and undermines our whole social system. Organised crime does all this by using the instruments of money laundering. New methods have been introduced, because the old ones do not work any more. New professions are being used, or rather abused and involved in all cases. As a result, the situation is now such that we need to create a new instrument, because we can no longer manage with the old 1991 directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the proposal for this new directive, where the list of offences no longer refers to drug-related crime and has been extended to all forms of organised crime, taking account, of course, of all professions and branches of the economy which run the risk of becoming involved in the business of money laundering.</p>
<p class="contents">But, in creating this new directive, we must bear one thing in mind: the objective is to fight organised crime and the instruments which we create must be practicable, which is why I emphatically support what Mr Lehne has done in his report, because he is pursuing precisely these objectives, unlike the Council, which has left certain aspects out of consideration; at any rate, it appears to have lost sight of the practicability factor. The Lehne proposal – as Mr Lehne himself has pointed out – is a proposal which does not affect normal citizens looking for an apartment somewhere; on the contrary, it gets to the crux of the matter: only when a transaction is completed need identification be requested. It refers to orders of magnitude which are relevant to the money laundering business and which do not affect the man in the street when he pops into a bank somewhere. It includes all professions which use services such as banks. In other words, it is a practicable proposal. I therefore hope that it will receive Parliament’s full and broad support because it will allow us to create an efficient instrument in the fight against organised crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schmid, Gerhard (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, money laundering means concealing the origin of the proceeds of crime so that they can be presented as the income of a legitimate company. Anyone who can hinder, interfere with or prevent money laundering hits organised crime – I agree here with the previous speaker – right where it hurts, i.e. in its quest for profit. The European Community adopted a directive to fight money laundering very early on and this triggered laws in the Member States, which previously had no such legislation. At the time, this was a good law; now it needs renovating, like any old building, because nothing is as inventive as the criminal mind.</p>
<p class="contents">If the directive is adopted as Mr Lehne and the Committee have drafted it, we shall have the best, most modern and strictest anti-money laundering law in the world, the implementation of which in fact only gives rise to two problems. The first problem is a degree of uncertainty in the House as to how to deal with the special relationship between lawyers and their clients, because we are calling for a reporting obligation if money laundering is suspected. The proposal developed by Mr Lehne and the Committee is a good proposal. It is a simpler and more manageable proposal. It basically runs as follows: if a lawyer is giving legal advice, then the confidential relationship between the lawyer and the client continues to be protected. If he is somehow involved in the transfer of money – buying, investing or whatever – then he no longer enjoys this protection and has a full reporting obligation. This both protects the confidential relationship and meets the demands of the fight against crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is the Council and, at present, there is no solution to it. The Council has rejected fundamental proposals. The reason may be – as Mr Lehne indicated – that the finance ministers are responsible and have too little experience in legislating under the codecision procedure and absolutely no experience in fighting crime. The only way left open to Parliament is as suggested, namely to maintain the amendments proposed at first reading. We shall have a conciliation procedure. As Council representatives are here, I say to you: dress warmly for this conciliation. We have no intention of allowing an excellent bill to be ruined for the sake of an amateur law in the fight against crime!</p>

The rapporteur has worked hard and I am therefore particularly sorry to say that my Liberal Group cannot unfortunately support most of his amendments. It is time to match the rhetoric about fighting money laundering with tough action.</p>
<p class="contents">As someone who represents London, including the City of London, I am naturally supportive of financial services liberalisation. However, freedom of capital movements must not be exploited for undesirable purposes. Criminal money could give liberalisation a bad name. This means financial firms have an interest in making the safeguards work but so do other professionals such as accountants and lawyers who are vulnerable to being used as inadvertent conduits for dirty money. The European Parliament has itself made a strong call for the extension of a ten-year-old existing directive to cover non-financial activities and professions. As the money laundering defences of banks have strengthened, criminals have sought new ways of hiding their money. Therefore it is reasonable to call for other professionals to identify their clients properly and report suspicious transactions without narrowing too much the scope of the relevant activities. We cannot therefore follow Mr Lehne in his amendments on accountants and auditors.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to lawyers, they rightly get special treatment. The obligations of the directive would only apply in respect of certain financial and company law activities. My Group believes that the safeguards for the lawyer-client relationship, which is absolutely crucial, is adequate in the Council common position. The lobbying of lawyers' organisations against this common position has been somewhat exaggerated. Therefore we, in the ELDR Group, will not be supporting the Lehne amendments because we are extremely keen not to weaken the rules. There are some of Mr Lehne's amendments which are entirely sensible and we will support them but, I am afraid, not the majority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council does not seem to realise that the fight against money laundering practices must, first and foremost, be aimed at fighting organised crime as a matter of urgency. National sovereignty has to be suspended in this connection. After all, criminals do not operate with national borders in mind, and without a strong, united front, Europe does not only condone organised crime, it even encourages such practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The advent of the euro is also an absolute godsend for crime. Europe is also clever enough to issue notes of EUR 500. Money laundering becomes so much simpler because there is no longer any need to change the money into dollars. It will soon all be possible in euros. In the words of a journalist, Geoffrey Robinson: if organised crime were to be granted a wish from a fairy, it would wish for Europe. Europe will witness an enormous increase in international criminal activity in the next couple of years. Europe is only at the start of the process. It is virgin territory waiting to be explored. Organised crime is a multi-headed monster whose financial heart and lungs need to be ripped out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the European Parliament remains firm over the basic issue, I think that the Council will ultimately change to the extent we require. The persistent breach of the professional secrecy of lawyers and those in similar professions is unacceptable. The authorities have no right to touch this type of secrecy. Furthermore, the Council, which is crippled by this obsession with entering the private area of professional secrecy, is continuing to move away from what must be the fundamental basis for revising the directive, which is to prioritise the fight against international organised crime. This issue is not being paid the attention it deserves. The professional secrecy of lawyers and those in similar professions is not a secondary issue. It is a basic question of culture and civilisation. It is quite unacceptable under any rule of law that is worthy of the name that lawyers should be forced by the law to become informers. It is surprising that the Council, at a time when so many fundamental rights abound, is vacillating on this issue and dares to attack one of European citizens’ basic guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">The new proposal is not as bad as the previous one, but it is still not good enough. Professional secrecy is untouchable, not just in the context of trials in process but also in the context of legal consultation. There is no question of giving any privileges to lawyers, who can and must be prosecuted if they are directly involved in criminal activities or are suspected of being so. What cannot be allowed to happen is for lawyers to be prosecuted because of clients that hire them and much less become, in turn, the persecutors of clients who hire them. As a matter of fact, the proposal also contains other little traps, such as the open door to Member States to extend the type of information supplied by lawyers to other areas, which makes the Council’s text particularly dangerous and perverse. What the directive must do is to guarantee to protect professional secrecy, which is not a guarantee for lawyers but for society, for the rule of law and for Europe’s citizens. The directive must also distinguish between what is advocacy in the true sense of the word, including legal consultation and other types of activity in which the lawyer can act but in which, materially, the activity is not one of advocacy in the true sense of the word. In one, secrecy is inviolable, and in the other the lawyer can always be prosecuted for withholding information, like any other citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the first point, the joint document puts forward a text that defines organised crime, including in the definition of alleged money laundering offences those related to organised crime. I fully support this extension. However, I cannot support the further extension to other offences – fraud and corruption, at least serious – as the existence of seriousness is made clear insofar as these offences affect the financial interests of the European Union, if, therefore, they are <span class="italic">covered by the provisions of Article 1(e) of the Second Protocol to the Convention on the protection of the European Communities' financial interests</span>. The reference to ascertaining the seriousness of the offence is, indeed, not very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: the text proposes, once again, a procedure for the remote identification of clients, now that the provisions introducing a complex procedure which is difficult to implement have been appropriately removed from the text of the previous common position. The new wording appears exaggerated, while the issue of standards to be related to the different practices in use should be the responsibility of the individual countries. On this point, the concern is that specific, binding European standards might be issued, requiring the application of rigid procedures which are difficult to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: the confidentiality of information received. All too often, the information provided on suspect operations is not treated as sufficiently confidential, which is clearly dangerous for the person who has provided it. Therefore, stringent confidentiality rules on information on suspect operations need to be issued. In this connection, excessive passing on of data for information purposes, for example, in banks to intermediary bodies, or in the professional categories to auditors, is eliminated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the best efforts of the rapporteur, there will still be those who will seek to get around it and to look at every way to carry on with their dirty dealings. Baroness Ludford spoke quite rightly about the effects of this on the City of London and the legal profession. She is a lawyer or barrister by profession and perhaps she should have declared an interest. She will know that all of these professions and their associated professions – accountants and auditors – will look at any possibility to help their clients. Those clients may be involved in all sorts of dodgy transactions. They should be covered. Only by concerted effort by all those parties concerned internationally will we be able to tackle the industry of money laundering. I would like to tackle money lending as well, but that is another issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been seriously lobbied by the British banks about Amendment No 17, which they do not like because it tries to prevent people they do not know from paying in huge amounts of cash. This is just the sort of thing we have to tackle if money laundering is to be challenged properly. If it affects Internet banking, as they suggest, then there must be other ways that they can verify the credentials of people who are applying for accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Money laundering is linked to organised crime. We know that. It is linked to drug smuggling, terrorism and forgery of bank notes. I agree with Mrs Sörensen. Those who are developing the euro plan to bring in a EUR 500 note – approximately GBP 300, well over ten times the face value of the largest note in common usage in Britain. We have a GBP 50 note which is worth about EUR 80, but that is very rare. So if I were a forger I would start out now forging EUR 500 notes and have a field day for the next few months until people come to terms with it. There are loopholes in this system. We must do everything we can to counter them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If there is no guarantee of confidentiality, there can be no trust. For this reason, professional secrecy is both a fundamental right and a fundamental duty of lawyers. This fundamental duty, which applies, mutatis mutandis, to all members of the legal profession, is also a fundamental right of anybody in need of advice, i.e. potentially every single one of us.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, this subject rightly commands a lot of attention, both in this Parliament and elsewhere. I should like to assure Members that these proceedings attract a lot of attention in institutions outside this Parliament which are engaged in fighting money laundering. Perhaps the money launderers themselves are also following these proceedings with a great deal of interest since it would be a happy outcome of our discussions if their life were to be made more difficult.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from that, I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Lehne, and also the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for their sustained efforts to achieve a rapid adoption of this important but highly sensitive proposal. The fight against money laundering, as several Members have stressed, is a top political priority and is now an integral part of the campaign against serious and organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">International pressure is increasing on third countries and on offshore financial centres considered insufficiently cooperative in this area. At the same time, the European Union, which has always been at the forefront of international efforts to fight criminal money, must continue to show the way by developing and refining its internal anti-money laundering defences.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the reasoning behind the clear calls from this Parliament and the Member States for a proposal to update and extend the 1991 anti-money laundering directive. The Commission believes that the common position adopted unanimously last November represents a reasonable compromise on the question of the criminal activity covered – the matter of the so-called predicate offences – and also on the safeguards for the inclusion of the profession, in particular lawyers, within the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to concerns in Parliament about cases where the lawyer is defending or representing a client in legal proceedings or helping the client to determine his legal position, I should like to stress that there is no question of any obligation to report suspicions of money laundering. It seems to me that the fundamental human rights mentioned are protected. They will not come into play when this proposal becomes reality. I agree with Baroness Ludford when she says that in this respect the proposal is a good compromise between protecting fundamental rights when lawyers defend their clients in court or help the clients to determine their legal position, but not when they are participating in preparations leading up to an activity covered by this directive. I would also like to recall that our work is the subject of considerable international attention, for example within G7 or the Financial Action Taskforce (FATF). The international community is looking to the European Union to find solutions to those difficult questions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the individual amendments in the draft second reading recommendation. Amendments Nos 1 and 10 deal with predicate offences and would mark a major step back from the ambitious common position. The decision was made to move gradually to the coverage of all serious crime. Having agreed on this wide coverage, the Commission cannot accept these amendments. Numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 13 and 22 deal essentially with the treatment of the professions. The Commission is regrettably unable to accept the amendments as worded. In its view, the legal profession constitutes a special case and requires special treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, therefore, does not accept the principle of giving all the professions exactly the same treatment as that envisaged for the lawyers and notaries. This relates, for example, to the activities which bring the professions within the scope of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also reluctant to envisage a Member State option to allow all the professions the possibility of reporting their suspicions to a professional body, but it firmly backs this possibility for the legal professions. On the difficult question of advice, the Commission continues to believe that financial investment and corporate advice should fall within the scope of the directive as long as it is unrelated to current or potential legal proceedings or to the wish of the client to establish his position under the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the Commission concedes that drawing this line may not always be easy. Nevertheless it also insists on this point. I ask Members of this Parliament what they would think if a lawyer had a suspicion that his client was preparing some money laundering activity? What would Members think if that lawyer decided not to report his suspicions, for example, to the bar association of his country? That has nothing to do with human rights; it has everything to do with an efficient campaign against money laundering activities, which is a serious matter. I would like Members to keep that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 11 relate to the role of the competent authorities. The Commission believes that the text of the common position is clear and satisfactory and so, cannot accept those two amendments. Amendment No 9 would extend the definition of financial institutions to include certain market authorities. The Commission does not believe that such an inclusion would be appropriate. Amendment No 14 would change the coverage of non-financial activities in a way that is unacceptable to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 15 and 16 deal with client identification. Some remarks were made earlier this evening to the effect that client identification might be unduly cumbersome and bureaucratic. I should like to read out Article 3 of the proposal where it says that: "Member States shall ensure that the institutions and persons subject to this directive require identification of their customers by means of supporting evidence when entering into business relations". This is not about a client ringing up for a prospectus or something like that: this is entering into business relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Can anyone here imagine that a bank or some other financial institution would enter into business relations without ascertaining the identity of his client? I cannot. If I were to enter into business relations I would want to make very certain that I knew who I was dealing with, where they lived, their nationality and so on. I cannot see at all why that is unduly bureaucratic or cumbersome. The Commission therefore believes that the common position in this regard provides the necessary scope for flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 17 and 28 – the latter of which reached us today – are concerned with identification where there is no face-to-face contact. The Commission is afraid that Amendment No 17 would make the text too inflexible with possible negative repercussions for e-commerce. Amendment No 28 retains the flexibility sought by the Commission, but the precise wording still poses certain problems. Therefore the amendment, as it has now been put forward, is regrettably unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 18 seeks to amend the exemptions from client identification for certain insurance contracts. In the Commission's view, a detailed technical examination of this question would be necessary before these amounts could be revised. Amendments Nos 19 and 20 deal with identification requirements for casino customers. The Commission considers that these amendments do not improve the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Commission's view, Amendments Nos 21 and 24 breach the basic anti-money laundering rule that the customer about whom a report is made should not be warned. The Commission could not accept this breach. Amendments Nos 23 and 25 amend the provisions of the 1991 Directive on suspicious transaction reporting, which have not given rise to any problems in the past and, in the Commission's view, do not need to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendments Nos 26 and 27 refer to OLAF. In deleting all reference to OLAF in the common position, the Council invited the Commission to make a separate proposal under Article 280. The Commission is currently preparing this proposal. The Commission considers, therefore, these amendments unnecessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
