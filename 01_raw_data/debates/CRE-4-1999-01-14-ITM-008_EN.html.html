<p class="contents">European direct investment can and must be a force for good in the developing world. But this European Parliament records our deep concern at the cases of corporate abuse, where local regulation is inadequate or human rights are not upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">I have met children as young as six in northern India who have been liberated from bonded labour because of initiatives like the rugmark code, which has helped these children out of what is a 20th century form of slavery and back into school. Such a code is beginning to be effective, not simply because the companies involved sign up to a proper declaration of principles, but because this is matched too by a practical system of monitoring and verification which guarantees that those principles are upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">That is quite simply what we are debating tonight: better standards for European companies worldwide and practical mechanisms to ensure that these are implemented.<br />I commend these proposals to you because we seek to better enforce existing internationally agreed standards in the field of employment, environmental protection, and social and human rights. Not a new or different set of requirements, nor a substitute for national or international regulation. I commend these proposals to you because they result from intensive consultation with over 100 businesses, trade unions, NGOs and academics, to whom I offer my thanks and from whom I have seen the growing consensus for systematic dialogue and agreement between companies and all those who their business affects.</p>
<p class="contents">I commend the report to you because these proposals arise too from discussions with governments and civil society in the developing world, from Ecuador to Nigeria to the Philippines. We have already consulted the ACP, and the firm conclusion is that what is needed is a developmental approach. Not one based on yet more bureaucracy, in which companies will always have the advantage, but one which gives a voice to, involves and empowers communities in developing countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now deal with what I know are some of the main areas of concern which have been expressed by parliamentary colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">Some are concerned about extra‐territoriality. Why should Europe not take more responsibility for its own companies? We are willing to do so in agreeing international rules against bribery and corruption and against those who engage in child‐sex tourism. Too right we are! Since 1968 Member States have already agreed the legal convention which allows companies to be brought before the courts for the most extreme breaches of the duty of care in their work in third countries. Let us use these already existing powers more effectively, and please note our commitment to multilateral agreements with the governments of developing countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Others have been concerned to restrict any proposal to voluntary action alone. Yet our resolution makes explicit that voluntary and binding approaches are not mutually exclusive. There will always be some bad companies, and no company should profit from any competitive advantage resulting from disregarding basic labour laws and social and environmental standards. Binding rules ensure minimum standards. Voluntary codes assist better standards. The two go together.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that some of my colleagues are concerned that a European monitoring mechanism could put our companies at a disadvantage compared to those based in America and elsewhere. Yet 42 of the top 100 multinationals are based in Europe, only 35 in North America. In NAFTA a complaints resolution system on labour and environmental practice already exists. When this European Union decided to offer enhanced trade access to countries respecting core labour standards, when we agreed a code to prevent arms sales to countries responsible for torture and aggression, we did so because we felt the European Union could give a lead to the world. In the field of better standards for multinationals we can do so again.</p>

The cases you describe relate to glaring and despicable abuses. We shall have to make every possible effort to scrutinise international law for ways and means of developing a code of conduct that will justify the conviction on moral grounds of the European firms which violate these principles of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we shall have to take care – and this is a point that has frequently come to my attention here in Parliament – to exercise our responsibility for keeping our reports within the legal bounds we have set for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the involvement of non‐governmental organisations in the development of the existing guidelines for an international code of conduct, such as those followed by the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">We must realise, however, that it is Utopian to call for a European legal framework governing EU‐based companies with worldwide operations, and that such a framework would even be illegal because of its extraterritorial character. We cannot condemn the Helms‐Burton or D'Amato legislation for claiming extraterritorial jurisdiction, and then think that we can introduce the same sort of thing here. The law is the law!</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I rather regret that there are four, five or six other cases which will be relevant to tomorrow's vote and which deviate from established legal standards. For that reason, Mr Howitt, I should be glad if you would exercise some flexibility and tolerance at the vote in plenary tomorrow, otherwise I believe the form in which you wish to organise the vote will be unacceptable to many Members, at least to those in the European People's Party, even though you undoubtedly have a legitimate case.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Vecchi </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> ‐<span class="italic"> (IT)</span> Madam President, first, on behalf of myself and my group, I want to thank Mr Howitt for pressing for this own‐initiative report from the Committee on Development and Cooperation and for having done some excellent work courageously, correctly and diligently. The report is the result of serious analysis of the international situation and of listening to the opinions of representatives of civil society, and is distinguished by the creativity of the proposals put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject of the report is not simple, because of its obvious implications in dealing with the presence and activities of European firms operating in developing countries in terms of respect for the principles, standards and aims linked to recognition of fundamental human and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">First let us say what it is not about. It is not about wanting to impose rules artificially which make European firms less competitive or hamper them more in international competition. It is not about wanting to invent new rules, nor does it propose to.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simply – although we are well aware that this is not a simple thing – a matter of wanting to guarantee effective respect, by European firms, for international and European standards which already exist but are often simply ignored or actually violated.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of creating a solid European political and legal base which strengthens and increases the credibility of the Union"s commitment and that of its Member States to affirm those standards at international level without hiding behind the easy alibi of always leaving it to other authorities to shoulder the burden of taking action.</p>
<p class="contents">We think the European Union has something to say and a lot to do here, starting with itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that, on this subject too – and here I would like to reassure Mr Kittelmann – the Group of the Party of European Socialists has worked to secure a wide consensus with the other groups in the European Parliament, even though they often started from very different points of view. I hope we have succeeded and that the vote on the Howitt report, which should take place tomorrow, can be as positive and consensual as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the fundamental factors underpinning this report?</p>
<p class="contents">First, there is the conviction that, especially in the age of globalisation, it is necessary to promote and integrate different intervention instruments to guarantee and promote human, social and economic rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the conviction that the actions of the various players operating on the international scene – regional and international organisations, national and local authorities, civil society organisations, companies – while differing, perhaps profoundly, in motivations and aims, are equally important in terms of their real impact on the actual situation of individuals, the local community and the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Research into optimising the action taken by the various players – public and private – in the different sectors and regions of the world is fundamental to pursuing the objectives of development and justice which ought to characterise the world of tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context it is very important to support the process, already underway, of companies operating in third countries setting up their own voluntary codes of conduct.</p>
<p class="contents">But these codes cannot take the place of the obligation to respect principles, standards and rules ratified by law. They can anticipate or supplement action by the public authorities to protect individual and collective rights.</p>
<p class="contents">So there is no contradiction between voluntary codes of conduct and codes with a legal basis; instead they should be complementary.</p>
<p class="contents">For codes of conduct – voluntary or not – standards, principles and instruments of control to be realistic and effective, they must necessarily be based on the direct involvement of all those concerned: institutions, companies, trade unions, NGOs, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, development cooperation policy and economic cooperation policy in general must be able to respond to principles and aims which are diverse, yet consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the various proposals contained in the report being debated today, the one I consider central is the European Parliament"s request to the Commission and the Council to put forward proposals on developing an appropriate legal basis for establishing a European multilateral framework governing companies" operations worldwide and to organise, for this purpose, consultations with those groups in society which would be covered by that code.</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in doing that, I think the European Parliament will have made no small contribution to promoting a vision of the world and of international relations which corresponds to the expectations of the citizens of Europe and the developing countries, who are right to look to Europe as a positive factor for fairness and development.</p>

If we look at these flagrant abuses that have been allowed to occur on the one hand and the many valuable global contributions of European companies on the other, we must surely have reason to hope that we can reach a solution in the end and bring about a reduction in the number of cases that we have been so loudly lamenting today.</p>
<p class="contents">I also see this whole thing in the context of our noble aim of supporting good governance, wherever it exists, through our development cooperation. In my view, this also involves encouraging the countries of the third world to ensure that their own legislation, their jurisprudence and the implementation of their statutes and case‐law create the sort of standards and provisions which would more or less eliminate the issue of extraterritoriality raised by Mr Kittelmann.</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to view the report in the context of a number of agreements, standards and conventions. I believe we should really focus on the need to ensure that the decisions which have already been taken are actually implemented, and that we monitor the way in which promises are being honoured. The numerous declarations that have already been made in this area were one of the reasons why the committee members from my group did not necessarily see it as a priority for the committee to produce this report on its own initiative and why we were initially opposed to dealing with this subject at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, these codes of conduct are absolutely acceptable to us if they are adopted on a voluntary basis and if there is scope for us to publicise the involvement of companies in such schemes, including details of their compliance or non‐compliance with the code of conduct, so that pressure can also be exerted by public opinion, which is certainly a very potent instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already indicated that we are opposed to the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction. I am not entirely convinced of the cogency of the examples cited by the rapporteur, because the question of arms exports concerns the Member States, which deal with such matters on the basis of their own export regulations. We should not create a situation in which the appearance of weapons in any country legitimises some kind of recourse against the country of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also beware of bracketing the infringement of social and environmental standards with child abuse, of all things, because the latter involves a paramount legal interest which is unquestionably eligible for extraterritorial protection, whereas I cannot see that the same applies to the former.</p>
<p class="contents">The third critical issue in this report was the question of a so‐called monitoring mechanism. All manner of bodies were to cooperate within this mechanism, which would be coordinated by the European Parliament. We cannot see any legal basis for such a mechanism. During the negotiations we arrived at a number of compromises, and I hope that the report is acceptable in its present form and that we are all flexible enough to steer it successfully through the final vote.</p>

<p class="contents">It would be extremely serious if the Howitt report were to be read in a light unfavourable to business. As liberals, we are far from opposing the involvement of companies in developing countries, and believe it is an absolute and essential condition for that economic development which is the logical premise of all human development.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is necessary to prevent certain extremely negative cases from ending up polluting the climate and causing foreign involvement to be considered unsuitable. From this point of view the Howitt report is undoubtedly helpful. So ‘yes" to the voluntary code of conduct for companies; ‘yes" to a European code of conduct which would have to be largely based on existing international standards; ‘yes" to clear, precise and agreed procedures for identifying any infringements or violations of the established rules backed by verification guarantees. But an equally strong and clear ‘no" to the kind of temporary platform suggested in the Howitt report for the interim period, under the auspices and the aegis of the European Parliament, which, in our opinion as liberals, carries the risk of turning into a kind of people's court, without adequate guarantees, and is liable to be counterproductive at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">So we rely on Mr Howitt's good sense as regards the amendments we have tabled on this.</p>

We are in favour of the principle of codes of conduct adopted on a voluntary and non‐compulsory basis. We are in favour of the multilateralism that would allow these codes to be defined within appropriate bodies, such as the OECD and the ILO, and that would make these codes applicable to all European and non‐European multinationals. Finally, we support the guarantee of impartiality of the bodies responsible for verifying compliance with the codes thus defined. This is why our group is tabling several amendments to ensure what, in our opinion, is a more balanced position, along the lines of what this House adopted in January 1998 on relocations and direct foreign investment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot support certain proposals in the report. The rapporteur measures with extraterritorial effect covering human and workers" rights, the environment and the prevention of corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the European Union and Parliament are fighting against extraterritorial laws that the United States are trying to impose, such as the Helms‐Burton Act. It is therefore not appropriate to go down the same road.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the European Monitoring Platform, if such a body were created at some point, the proposals relating to both its composition and its tasks should be seriously reconsidered. Our group has therefore tabled an amendment aimed at establishing transparent processes for the operation of this body and, in particular, for the appointment of experts of recognised competence and authority. This would involve processes to identify complaints, the guarantee that all parties would receive notification of complaints and the proof accompanying this, and the guarantee of possibilities of recourse.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of Parliament"s role, we are not in favour of a temporary European Monitoring Platform under the auspices of Parliament, nor of the appointment of special rapporteurs within this as these proposals seem to involve activities that do not fall within the competence of a parliamentary assembly.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Telkämper </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, we welcome Mr Howitt's report on EU standards for European firms operating in developing countries. The development of a European code of conduct is a very important aim which we must pursue vigorously. It is an excellent idea to create a legal basis for this, Mr Howitt.</p>
<p class="contents">A model code of conduct is a necessity. It is important that a European monitoring mechanism should be created, but a crucial factor from our point of view is the form that the monitoring and verification are to take. Without monitoring and verification, a code of this type is an irrelevance. The principle of voluntary action is important to us and must also underlie the legal basis in this domain. Each firm must be free to commit itself as far as it feels able. There must, however, be some compulsory minimum standards. This reflects the ethics of our Community, and these ethics must also be applied in our dealings with the rest of the world. So there should be binding standards as a minimum basis, supplemented by voluntary undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">The cooperation you propose in the new global agreement with the ACP countries is important, and represents another addition that we support. We are also in favour of stepping up the initiatives at European level. I did not entirely understand what Mr Kittelmann was saying. He spoke of morality and said that we shall find ways and means of developing this at some time. I do not know how he intends to accomplish that. He also seemed to make a slip of the tongue. He was speaking on behalf of the Committee on External Economic Relations, yet he said in conclusion that the PPE Group could not accept the report. Mrs Günther then seemed to say the opposite. To borrow loosely from Brecht, first bellies are filled, then comes morality, and we know that capital is a great shark, and when it makes a killing in international business, the leftovers are few.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that this cannot be compared with the Helms‐Burton Act. Helms‐Burton is a repressive measure on an international scale. The aim of the present initiative is to create our own code of conduct for European firms. We have other versions of this in the Basle Convention, in the Rhine Agreement within Europe, and in connection with the toxic waste that is shipped from Europe to South Africa, for instance, as the British example illustrates. So we already have self‐imposed codes of conduct to which we have committed ourselves. That is why it is right and important that this initiative should be taken. We support it and hope that a large majority of the House will do likewise.</p>

Unrestrained globalisation cannot guarantee such development and can only, at best, provide a chance of achieving it. But striving for maximum profit can also derail sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this week, we debated the Sainjon report which is along the same lines. Poor countries cannot force people to adopt a code of good conduct, nor can wealthy countries. Many multinationals have a budget many times greater than that of many developing countries. It is difficult, even for international organisations, to get a grip on these developments, yet they remain the greatest challenge that we face as a political community. Our failure to create an international legal order based on internationally accepted rules, such as when the World Trade Organisation was founded, was in many respects a missed opportunity as far as I am concerned, because then we could have achieved a great deal.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are going to have to make do with the possibilities we have. We are going to have to maintain a sense of moderation and realism, and the whole thing will have to be monitored very closely, because it will not work on its own.</p>
<p class="contents">We naturally welcome voluntary codes of conduct, but they are not enough. We think we can count on the increasing awareness of Europe"s consumers, who will not want to be party to exploitation. This is why I would call for binding agreements and warn against hypocrisy. I would like to finish here, because this would not be the first time that the countries of Europe, in claiming to support fine principles, were actually just protecting themselves against developments in developing countries.</p>

Operating standards deserve constant attention, particularly when they relate to trade with developing countries. We need to put an end to exploitation in these countries. European undertakings must be held responsible for establishing dangerous industries in countries where there is no labour inspection, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, increasing attention has been given to codes of conduct in European firms, and a large number of multinationals have – perhaps under pressure from international pressure groups and public opinion – voluntarily undertaken to respect human rights in business and to publish an annual social report. The European Union must support these developments, and this is why I am in favour of a voluntary European code of conduct, which will make it easy for businesses to trade ethically and responsibly, and will ensure that responsibility stays where it belongs: with the firms themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The work we do with international organisations is another way of promoting compliance with international codes of conduct. I do not think it makes sense to introduce all manner of European legislation and authorities, which would simply add to Europe"s bureaucracy, and after the debates earlier this week, I think we would all agree that this is the last thing we need.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I have to say that I agree with Mrs Maij‐Weggen that the developing countries must be involved as much as possible in the development of codes of conduct, but I see no reason to postpone the vote on this report because of this.</p>

At Mr Howitt"s request, I would like to mention six points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what would the developments now being proposed mean for small and medium‐sized firms? After all, many of these also operate in developing countries, so should not the same or similar measures apply to them?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, should we not look at what we are already doing for environmental protection, in other words the covenants? What does the type of covenant we are looking at mean for firms here? Is there not work to be done in this field? And the same applies for quality marks.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I sympathise with the argument which businesses put forward that if only European firms are affected, their competitiveness could suffer. Take Shell in Nigeria. We were right to put pressure on Shell, but in the end we have to accept that Canadazen and other non‐European oil companies have reaped the benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourth, what are we doing about the informal sector? This is not covered adequately in the report, because the informal sector also supplies to businesses, and this is where help must be provided.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already dealt with my fifth point, which was that only European firms would be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixth, how to involve the firms themselves in the discussions. This too was not covered in sufficient depth, and in future I think it is important to involve firms both large and small in the debate. I shall finish here, but I think that we are going to have to have a much broader debate on this issue in future.</p>

Although we do not agree with all the points he makes, we support the main thrust of his report and the principle of the need for a code of conduct for multinational companies, though I agree with the previous speaker that this does not mean that SMEs should not be included. The need for such a code has become obvious from the large number of incidents or even disasters in the third world for which a number of firms have been responsible in recent years. Think of the environmental pollution in Ogoniland in Nigeria, the problems of slave labour used in laying oil pipelines in Burma – which the European Union punished by taking away the preferential system – and the use of child labour in India, Pakistan and the Philippines. These are all problems that we can prevent from happening in western Europe because we have legislation and a reasonably good inspection system, but the developing countries do not have this sort of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This gives <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> not just to the good firms, which some are, of course, but also to the bad firms, which then flout social and environmental legislation that they would have to respect in their own countries. The developing countries, it has become clear, are the ones that most desperately need our help. I would also point out here that this is also a good thing for the decent companies too. Shell now has a code of conduct, but it has also told us that the Canadian and American companies in Nigeria do not follow it, and this has led to distortion of competition. So we will have to be careful that goodwill on the part of certain companies does not itself lead to bad practices because codes of conduct are not universally accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why a European code of conduct is both useful and necessary, and I support the idea. What we do not think would be useful is an institution such as a monitoring platform that would result in far too much bureaucracy. It would also not be a good idea to grant extraterritorial powers, and it would not be possible either, because the WTO would not allow it.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have preferred this issue to be put to the ACP Assembly again, but I understand that the rapporteur did not want this. Perhaps we could approve the report tomorrow and still put it to the Assembly? I think this would be a good idea. I intend to support the proposal. Of course we shall have to wait and see how the vote goes, but I hope that there will be broad support for this excellent report by Mr Howitt, for which I would like to thank him once again.</p>

If things were so simple that it was possible to increase prosperity quickly in developing countries by means of conventions, declarations, international conferences and sanctions adopted by third countries, then there would be no poor countries and no conditions for workers which we would consider substandard. Unfortunately, however, things are not as simple as that.</p>
<p class="contents">Many countries are interested in attracting foreign investment to increase the availability of capital, enterprise and technology and thereby boost growth and employment. Growth provides the real opportunity to improve working conditions, increase wages and extend social benefits. Of course there are some irregularities in many places, but there are already rules to deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are considering the fundamental problem, it should be pointed out that countries which have relied on international investment have achieved far more progress than countries which have shut themselves off behind all kinds of socialist regulations. That is why the economic development of Thailand has been much faster than that of Tanzania; poverty reigns in Cuba, but not in Taiwan; North Korea is characterised by exploitation, but South Korea is not. Foreign entrepreneurs have contributed to improvements in wages and social conditions. I think that this is still what we must use as a basis for judging what further efforts need to be made. However, I think the report lacks sufficient understanding of this process; instead, it portrays international investment more as a means of exploitation which needs to be regulated. If it is the case that host countries do not know what is best for them, then the EU should use extraterritorial measures, which we otherwise oppose, to ensure that our objective is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">All reports have their good points, and this one is no exception. However, it does not make a sufficiently constructive contribution, because in my view it is based on the wrong premise.</p>

Ironically the European Union can take pride in its achievement in improving health, safety and working conditions through the implementation of the social chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">We also strongly support the protection of human rights and we are always strengthening legislation to protect the environment. It is not acceptable that at one and the same time as we improve the quality of life internally within the European Union that some EU firms are breaching health and safety rules or exploiting labour and are causing serious and permanent damage to the environment in developing countries. It is totally immoral that we should increase the prosperity of the European Union at the expense of the people of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the adoption of a code of conduct and the establishment of a European monitoring platform. We must ensure that EU firms operating outside the EU treat their employees fairly, both in terms of the remuneration they receive and adequate health and safety standards in their workplace.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also prevent the construction of projects or the manufacture of products that have devastating consequences for the environment in these places. I agree with the rapporteur's comments when he introduced his report that voluntary codes of conduct and binding agreements are not necessarily mutually exclusive. They are in fact complementary to one another and should form the basis of our strategy in this particular area.</p>

But coordinated support is needed to ensure that governments of developing countries can incorporate standards that are already accepted internationally into their own national legislation. So supporting European firms in this context is fundamental, because they are the major direct investors in developing countries and play a decisive role in sustainable global socio‐economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">In contributing directly to the economic development of the poorest regions, business has a great social responsibility, especially as regards human rights. This is why I think it would be useful to draft a European code of conduct which could help to ensure the better harmonisation of voluntary national codes of conduct on the basis of international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of this code would be to guarantee the application of minimum standards relating to the environment, health and safety at work, the abolition of child labour, the protection of women's rights and, obviously, respect for basic human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We must provide for an evolving and gradual approach to the rules of this code, identifying positive incentives for companies undertaking to observe the new arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not agree with setting up a European Monitoring Platform, as already proposed by some trade associations, to monitor the situation and assess reports empirically. Not only can it not determine wages in developing countries but, as it stands, it will certainly not improve working conditions and, above all, there is no legal basis for European monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is important to recognise that the impact of liberalisation on the international community has both positive and negative effects. Progressive expansion of social awareness, international recognition of human rights and free movement of goods, persons, capital and services could be counted among the positive aspects.</p>

<p class="contents">The ILO, the UN, the OECD, the FAO, the WHO and the World Bank can provide a suitable ethical and legal supply of standards as the starting point for determining a European code of conduct intended for European enterprises operating commercially in developing countries. Unfortunately, the profits of many European and American multinationals are stained by connivance with authoritarian regimes in which practices of oppression, abuse and exploitation of workers completely undermine the basic rules on fair competition. These practices are an attack on the rights of people in fragile social situations, and involve, in particular, women and children who are subject to actual practices of forced labour.</p>
<p class="contents">The governments of developing countries must be made take responsibility for the implementation of standards that respect fundamental labour principles and rights. However, the problem lies in the difficulty of imposing effective sanctions to penalise transgressors. One practical solution may be positive discrimination, by providing special support and incentives to those countries that demonstrate good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Specific initiatives must be undertaken. We agree with the establishment of the European Monitoring Platform, bringing together trade associations, trade unions, NGOs and public bodies, with the initial impetus being provided by the European Parliament acting as a catalyst. However, it should do more than this in order to stay within its competence. Although sharing some of the concerns of our colleague Mrs Günther, we congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Howitt, on the report he has presented. It gives expression to the idea that the practice of fair trade is essentially a different philosophy from that of being in the world for a share of the spoils.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Madam President, I would first of all like to thank Mr Howitt and Parliament for their initiative and their action to increase the protection of the rights of workers throughout the world and, in particular, those in developing countries who work, either directly or indirectly, for European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Over recent years, public opinion has been very sensitive towards these issues and progress has been achieved, thanks to the action of the European Parliament at times. I am thinking specifically of the initiatives – which were then implemented by the Commission – always to include a system of incentives as regards, for example, the Generalised System of Preferences in the so‐called social and environmental clauses. A certain amount of progress has certainly been made in that area in recent years within the European Union and in its trade instruments and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now more specifically to codes of conduct and social standards, following the technical meetings held in the European Parliament, with experts invited along to discuss the issue, the Commission considers that the voluntary nature of these codes is important and that, along with this, it is above all important to try to find ways of encouraging cooperation. Thus, with social pressure and incentives, European firms will gradually come to accept that when they work abroad they must meet certain basic standards in terms of labour and social rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background of this generally positive philosophy, I would like to make a few more specific comments.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, the Commission has supported the voluntary initiatives of companies, industries, trade unions and NGOs to promote codes of conduct, and has particularly encouraged dialogue between the various partners. Thus, in February 1998, a joint conference was held in Brussels in conjunction with the North American Department of Labour, where companies, trade union organisations and NGOs came together. The aim of this conference was to analyse the possibilities and limits of codes of conduct and social standards, and to consider what role public authorities might be able to play in this process. The conference was followed by a seminar in November, which looked at issues involving the monitoring of codes of conduct and social standards, and by a visit to the United States in December 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not forget that codes of conduct – and this is something I want to make clear on behalf of the Commission – can under no circumstances replace national and international labour regulations, which, at the end of the day, are the only way to guarantee universal respect for the fundamental rights of workers. What do I mean by this? What I mean is that a code of conduct can be important and positive and can apply a great deal of social pressure, yet it is also very important for a country receiving development aid to incorporate the international conventions on the protection of workers into its own national legislation. In other words, it must be a combined effort, as not all countries receiving aid from us have incorporated certain basic regulations on protection into their national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the legal basis for establishing a European framework governing companies" operations worldwide, the Commission believes that priority must be given to incentive schemes and measures involving a participative rather than a repressive approach. In other words, we have never agreed with the idea of certification. We have always thought more in terms of positive discrimination and incentives rather than sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission – and the European Union as a whole – believes that multilateral agreements are more important than unilateral rules with an international element. I do not need to explain the Helms Burton dispute to you. The European Union does not support such measures with extraterritorial effect.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, to maintain some degree of logic, since we opposed the extraterritorial measures advocated by the United States Congress, it would be difficult for the European Union to apply extraterritorial laws even if they have what I believe to be noble objectives, such as social protection and the protection of the environment. We must be consistent and we must therefore introduce this type of approach internally through dialogue and through incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the possibility of creating a European monitoring platform, it is true that the Commission had not included this in its conclusions of the November seminar. However, we are prepared to help the partners involved to come together to create links through the various initiatives and we are equally prepared to encourage exchanges, to promote and share experiences, and to increase the visibility of the companies who apply these codes. In other words, the Commission can collate all the experiences, all the codes and all the actions taken by each company, not only in Europe, but also in the United States. Indeed, some US companies have already introduced codes of ethical behaviour when working abroad. In this respect, we are open to whatever Parliament decides.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission is also willing, if the partners so wish, to set up a network that will allow us to work on the content of the codes and pool the various elements involved. It would also deal with the delicate question of independent monitoring. This is a very sensitive issue because if we establish a monitoring system, it will have to be extremely objective and neutral in order to prevent situations from naturally being judged according to economic interests, a company"s interests or simply political interests.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, as has already been mentioned, subsidies have been requested by the European trade union federations for textiles, clothing and leather. And, in principle, the Commission"s response will be to work with the trade unions and federations for the textiles, clothing and leather industries with a view to providing them with financial mechanisms that will allow them to form their own networks.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the financial resources required, which you asked about, line B7‐6000 is available to cofinance a large number of NGOs, so we should be able to encourage this method of increasing awareness. In any event, we are already taking action here, and I hope that we can continue to do so. Last year, funding was granted, in particular, to those NGOs who worked under the ‘fair trade" slogan, which I am sure you have heard of. On a practical level, a ‘fair trade" campaign was run in all the supermarkets in Europe involving products from this type of trade, for which an amount was credited at the checkout. We can continue with these sorts of awareness‐raising measures.</p>
