However, after studying the Commission's progress report on the incorporation of equality of opportunity for women and men into Community policies, I should say with a touch of irony that I hope in fact it is an exception – a positive exception.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides the Commission's report, I have also examined other documents from the Council of Ministers and the United Nations, amongst others. However, I decided to compare the report with the Beijing Declaration. It is true that we have not signed this declaration. Nevertheless, since 1995 we have been stressing the importance of ‘gender mainstreaming" in policy making and other areas of work. I think that Chapter V, in particular, has most relevance for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In comparing the Commission's report with the Beijing Declaration, I see that there has been no fundamental change: there is still a lack of clearly defined objectives and accountability mechanisms, and changes in the internal dynamics – including the introduction of different values, behaviour, rules and procedures – have not been implemented. The European Union is not pursuing an active and visible policy on equality of opportunity accompanied by such things as follow‐up and evaluation procedures to assess its performance and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission rightly notes that there has been progress, but obstacles and shortcomings still exist. The measures taken up to now have not had an effect in all areas or on the direction in which Community policy is going. In the Commission's view, the most serious obstacles are a lack of awareness of gender equality issues at the decision‐making level, a lack of human and budgetary resources, and a lack of gender experts. However, your rapporteur believes that the first of these is the key point, namely a lack of awareness of the need for gender equality at the decision‐making level. Unfortunately, this lack of awareness does not only apply to the Commission, it also permeates large sections of society and, I would also contend, Parliament itself in large measure. We know that for only 28 % of the Members of Parliament to be women is hardly representative of the European population a whole, but that is how things stand in this particular decision‐making body.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, something has to be done. In our view, the committee, through my report, lays down some constructive proposals. In order to make everyone happy, let me assure you that these proposals do not increase costs by one single euro.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can and should show the way by deciding on the objectives and accountability mechanisms, cooperating with new policy players, strengthening the methodological framework, overhauling its own structures and introducing gender equality at the decision‐making level. Of course, the same also applies to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is still the case that women in the workplace are held in lower esteem than men. This state of affairs has not changed in more than 100 years, but hopefully at some stage – and perhaps soon – change will come.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, this is one of the issues on which the committee hopes to be able to cooperate with the Commission – as an ongoing and balanced committee.</p>

For me today is a day of remembrance, not a day of celebration. It is a day of remembrance for those women who led the struggle for equal rights and equal opportunities. 8 March is a symbolic day for this unending struggle. It is a day on which to render an account of women"s achievements, a day of raising awareness and debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to stress once again that we are fully behind all those women who, at great danger to themselves, are fighting against totalitarianism and against any plan to create a society in which women are marginalised. They are fighting against violence and racism, they are fighting for democracy and human rights, they are fighting for their survival in many parts of the world where poverty is still rife or where wars are being waged.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank Mrs Eriksson for her excellent report and for what she has told us. It is significant that, in its progress report, the Commission resumes its stance and expresses its desire to promote a policy of equal rights in relation to other policies. This progress report makes it clear that incorporating an equal rights policy is a long‐term measure. As the Commission correctly points out, there are obstacles to implementing this policy. Nevertheless, I fervently believe that the Commission must create or strengthen special mechanisms to incorporate equal opportunities, for example in the new technologies and information technology, and in research where access for women is especially limited. The gender issue must also be incorporated into all legislation and into all action programmes and action plans. The Commission must continue to urge Member States to take initiatives to promote and implement mainstreaming and we too must push our governments in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stress once again the need for gender relevant statistical data for the purpose of assessment and programme planning, in relation to which the Commission"s progress report exhibits certain weaknesses. The message of this progress report and also of this House must be twofold. Firstly, there must be systematic implementation of the analysis relating to the gender issue and its impact on all the policies and actions of the European Union. We must also press on with and strengthen the special positive action measures to promote equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, Madam President, I should like to say that, of course, for all this to happen, we need the necessary resources and the right people, as an analysis of the gender issue can only be undertaken by people with the appropriate training. It requires knowledge and information. I should also like to stress that a fifth action programme is necessary and I hope to hear the Commissioner announce one.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lulling </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span><span class="italic"> – (FR) </span>Madam President, it most certainly augurs well for us that today, on the occasion of International Women"s Day, we have the opportunity to review this much talked‐about mainstreaming, this great concept which consists in incorporating equal opportunities for women and men into all Community policies and activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years after the communication on mainstreaming was adopted by the Commission, it seems clear that progress has been rather modest, and that we still have a long way to go both internally and externally.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, in spite of the good intentions of which we are assured, the results seem to indicate some disparities, and numerous barriers and shortcomings still exist as regards the balanced participation of women and men in both the decision‐making process and the implementation of Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I consider it necessary for the Commission to now reassert its firm commitment to the promotion of an active and visible policy on equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty and the stronger legal basis for equal opportunities for women and men must be turned to good account in order to envisage positive action and take ‘all‐out" measures, if I may use the military language used by General de Gaulle, in order to achieve equal treatment and equal opportunities for women and men, which we have still have not achieved in many areas.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is my duty to point out here that mainstreaming does not render unnecessary the specific equality policies that have so far been developed by means of directives and Community action programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also take this opportunity to remind you once again that we are hoping the Commission will finally propose an amendment to the watered‐down 1986 directive on equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self‐employed capacity, including assisting spouses. Apart from two round‐table discussions, no action has yet been taken in response to the report I produced in 1996, in which Parliament unanimously proposed a framework status for assisting spouses in Europe; there are millions of these invisible workers in our societies, and the overwhelming majority are women.</p>
<p class="contents">This status – the framework of which needs to be outlined in the 1986 directive that is to be amended – will need to provide for compulsory registration of assisting spouses, independent social security entitlement and, in particular, compulsory pension insurance. It will need to put an end to all forms of discrimination which assisting spouses are subject to, for example in companies and professional organisations, especially in the event of divorce, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Rest assured, Commissioner, that the Committee on Women"s Rights will – within the scope of its political responsibilities, which will need to be redefined and strengthened following the elections on 13 June this year – keep an watchful eye over the action taken by the Commission in response to this debate and our report. Madam President, I also hope that Parliament itself and its political groups will not ignore the conclusions reached in paragraphs 19 to 22, particularly with regard to strengthening the political responsibilities of the Committee on Women"s Rights, and not abolishing it, as advocated by some of our colleagues.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Larive </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I made my maiden speech in 1984 on emancipation and here I am now giving my ‘old maid"s speech". I have three points to make. Firstly, after seven directives on emancipation, I think the cornerstone of European legislation has to be the burden of proof directive. A fair distribution of the burden of proof between employer and employee makes it possible for women to enforce the rights which these seven emancipation directives give them. For the rest, I think we should hold back and leave any law making to the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have to straighten out the things that are crooked. In other words, positive action is still needed until the barriers left over from the past have been removed – until the crooked is made straight.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must strive manfully – or perhaps womanfully – to see that new obstacles do not arise. The biggest challenge of the 21st century for emancipation is mainstreaming, the integration of equal opportunities into all areas of European policy. The Amsterdam Treaty provides a good legal basis for this. It is a splendid concept, but a dangerous one too: splendid because it is more effective, if properly applied, than constantly introducing new pieces of legislation; and dangerous because it can serve as a lightning conductor, a sop, a paper tiger. So extreme vigilance, healthy suspicion and the measures suggested in Mrs Eriksson"s excellent report are called for. She rightly asks for a breakdown by gender and statistics, as Mrs Hautala does too, whose report is better than that by Mrs van Dijk, though that is not to say it is a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">We want more women involved in decision making. Commissioner Flynn, incidentally, has no women at all in his private office. The Commission and Parliament have five women officials in lower‐ranked policy‐making positions. Mainstreaming means building without obstacles, not first erecting obstacles and then solemnly dismantling them. Mainstreaming also means emancipation impact assessment. As suggested in paragraph 21 by our Liberal colleague Mr Cars – a man at that – we need an interinstitutional working party for Parliament and the Commission and a monitoring board within the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Can we wind up the Committee on Women"s Rights? No, we still need it as a watchdog, to see that mainstreaming actually happens. And I think it means one must be able to sit on the Committee on Women"s Rights in addition to being a full member of another committee. We cannot have one cancelling out the other, or we shall have an underuse of resources, we shall have fanaticism operating in isolation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hyland </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Madam President, I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this report incorporating equal opportunities for women and men in all Community policies and activities. I want to refer specifically to the need for such integrated policy for women in rural society, for until now suitable employment opportunities have been limited, with women having to migrate to urban growth centres to find employment. This is an unsatisfactory situation and has contributed significantly to the depopulation of rural areas. It is a serious social and economic problem which everyone, including this Parliament and national governments, now recognises – late in the day, perhaps – and that we are now endeavouring to correct through rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Committed as I am to rural policies, I now believe they will not achieve their full potential in the absence of integrated national and regional policy. Unless we create sustainable employment at regional level and, in the context of this report, employment suitable for women, then the economic and social viability of rural communities will be put at further risk. If rural society is not economically and socially attractive to women it will be impossible to retain living and vibrant rural communities.</p>
<p class="contents">While such policies are relevant to all rural women, I want to specifically refer to the often forgotten role of women in agriculture. I am sure Parliament will agree that in the context of the present discussions on Agenda 2000 the viability of many family farms will be put at risk. If we are serious about retaining the European farm model referred to in the Santer proposals then we must provide suitable off‐farm employment for both women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to acknowledge and pay tribute to the significant contribution of women to the work of voluntary community organisations. Their role, however, must not be confined to voluntary community work. They are entitled to participate, if they so desire, in the work of nation‐building and to meaningful and rewarding employment opportunities.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kerr </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Madam President, as the coordinator for the Green Group on the Committee on Women's Rights, I should like to stress the importance of having men support women in achieving equality in the European Union. I, along with my colleague Mr Mann and one or two other men, are active on the Committee on Women's Rights in support of those objectives. I only wish we had the wholehearted support of many of the other men in this Parliament including those who tried to abolish the Committee on Women's Rights earlier in the year. I am glad we have resisted that so far and we must resist it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Eriksson on her report. It shows clearly that equal opportunities and mainstreaming are good objectives. However, we have moved very little towards them. Until the men in the European Union take them seriously we will not achieve them. And that begins at the very top, in the leadership of the Council of Ministers: all those male leaders who are not taking it seriously. I include my own government in this. Its record is rather poor. Tony Blair forgot to appoint a Minister for Women, then called Harriet Harman back in and gave her the job of Secretary of State for Social Security as well and finally sacked her because she had to carry out unpopular decisions. He has now given the job to the Leader of the House of Lords and women's issues have tended to sink without trace.</p>
<p class="contents">By effectively deselecting three of our women colleagues – Sue Waddington, the Labour Spokesman on Women's Rights, Christine Oddy and Veronica Hardstaff – the Labour Party has made a poor contribution to getting women re‐elected to the European Parliament. We should look at the record in the Member States if we want to achieve our equality objectives.</p>

Seven directives, that is no mean achievement. Women in Europe can see that the Commission is sympathetic to women"s concerns. But much still needs to be done on jobs and equal pay, for example. I would say that men are still lagging behind when it comes to care, both in and outside the family.</p>
<p class="contents">What worries us most at the moment is the continuing inequality of power. This is an injustice which we must battle against. The Nordic countries have quite a good record, with 37.6 %, and the European Parliament too, with 28 %, compared with the 13.1 % of women involved in the highest levels of decision making worldwide. But it is a long way from the democratic parity we dream about. It is after all a democratic right that the bodies taking decisions which affect society should reflect the make‐up of that society. In any event, the Commission should continue to press the Member States to take steps to ensure that this is indeed the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Women will then recognise their role, will feel more involved, will see their problems acknowledged as political problems and will also feel more attracted to the political arena. That reciprocal effect is by no means commonplace at present.</p>
<p class="contents">Many good things have of course already been said about mainstreaming. I echo them. We need equal opportunities at all levels, in all undertakings, and we need to study gender effects in all areas, devising instruments to monitor whether or not progress is in fact being made. But this must not form an excuse for abruptly halting a number of positive actions in favour of women which are still desperately needed. That is not only the case in Europe; I can think of certain cases in the developing world where actions in favour of women are simply being stopped because all attention has now switched to mainstreaming. Slogans are no use to us. We want women to be given the real leg‐up they sometimes need in order to make full use of this splendid mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Committee on Women"s Rights will remain vigilant, because we need that committee. And that is one of these positive actions.</p>

I hope that the term ‘non‐working female population", which I find shocking in connection with the subject of equality between men and women, will be eliminated both from Commission texts and various other European documents. There are probably tens of millions of these women in Europe and they should not be described in this way simply because they are engaged in unwaged work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like Mrs Keppelhoff"s report – an assessment of the economic value of women"s unwaged work which dates back ten years or so – to be taken up again. We should broaden our economic concepts so that the contribution made by this unwaged work to a nation"s wealth is taken into account in the GDP. This would seem important with regard to the subject which we are dealing with here.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the complete marginalisation of the various aspects of pregnancy and motherhood also seems a great injustice with regard to the matter we are dealing with at present. I think there are some avenues here which we need to explore at all costs, in order to achieve greater justice between men and women in the different countries of the European Union.</p>

This recognition is reflected in the Amsterdam Treaty, in which equality between men and women is set out as a goal of the Union, and in the fact that the principle of equal opportunities is enshrined as the fourth pillar of EU employment policy.</p>
<p class="contents">But the Commission"s first progress report shows up the very wide gulf between demands and reality. For instance it states that the measures taken to date have had no tangible influence on the various policies. That should give us food for thought. Of particular importance is the awareness raising, awareness changing and sensitisation of all the various decision‐makers in all the various areas of society. But specifically as a woman I would not want to see the baby thrown out with the bathwater. Will a call such as that for a balanced participation of women and men in the decision‐making process really achieve any added value for women? Are we talking about quantitative or qualitative equal treatment? If I manage to succeed in my job, it is not because I am a woman but because of the good work I have done. I know that many women agree with the view I take of the policy of positive discrimination.</p>

I would point out that the European Union actually introduced the principle of mainstreaming into its actions and documents prior to the Beijing Conference. As we all remember, this was first done in the regulation on the Structural Funds in 1993. Therefore, from the point of view of intentions, but also of directives implemented, we can say that much has been done, helping to change our conduct, actions and culture. It does not, however, mean that no problems exist. The first evaluation report, which was the subject of Mrs Kokkola"s report, made it very clear that the statements and documents were by no means being implemented in practice by the Commission and the Member States. As regards the Structural Funds, for example, even though the policy of mainstreaming was introduced as long ago as 1993, the latest progress report reveals that only 1.6 % of their resources have been used for this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a long way from the practical implementation of equal opportunities in all policy fields! That is why we, as a Parliament, urge that mainstreaming should not merely be reasserted as a principle in the renewed Structural Funds, but that the Member States and the Commission itself should be subject to some form of sanctions if this principle is not translated into tangible measures. With regard to the European Social Fund, we call for 15 % of project funding to be targeted at women, since much still remains to be done in terms of their employment and pay. In our view, the action plans submitted by the governments following the Luxembourg summit are very disappointing. There are still too few countries where equal opportunities are deemed to be an across‐the‐board principle to be applied in all policy areas. The real problem, however – and I can say this because I come from a southern country, Italy – concerns the presence of women in decision‐making positions. In Italy few women are to be found, whereas in northern European countries there are more. Where women are present, the political agenda of governments and institutions really does change, and the policies introduced really do change as well.</p>

But we will have to wait a few more months before the principle of equal opportunities for women and men is also strengthened. It is stipulated as a principle and a goal of the Community in Articles 2 and 3 of the Amsterdam Treaty. Today, on International Women"s Day, I recall other articles, such as those on equal treatment in the workplace and on the labour market, on equal pay for equal work and on combating discrimination on the basis of sex.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has established that there are considerable shortcomings as regards incorporating equal opportunities into the Community programmes. The main reason, according to Mrs Eriksson, the rapporteur, is the lack of awareness of the decision‐makers, and this is a view that the Group of the European People"s Party naturally shares. Effective individual measures cannot replace an integrated general concept. However much cooperation there is with the NGOs, with the committees of other bodies, there are no adequate organisations to promote awareness‐raising among the political players. When they do exist, it will become possible to check the incorporation of equal opportunities in draft legislation, ensure a balanced gender participation in decision‐making jobs and finally prepare statistical material that can be broken down into gender‐relevant data.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a benchmarking procedure to make it easier to evaluate programmes and projects and we must continue vigorously taking positive measures in favour of women. However, the working party between Parliament and the Commission that is called for in paragraph 21 already exists! Its members include two representatives of the Committee on Women"s Rights and two representatives of the Committee on Employment; I am one of them and we hold regular meetings with the representatives of the European women"s lobby on the one hand and the responsible Commissioners and heads of cabinet led by Jacques Santer on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We have always reported on their outcome in the committees. We will have to do so in more detail and certainly also in writing. I believe that is one message that comes across from today"s International Women"s Day.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Madam President, I think that, as has already been mentioned here tonight, the key is to have women in decision‐making roles and in positions of power. That is the only way we are going to get any change. You only have to look at the European institutions themselves. Look at the number of women Commissioners. I know that my own country has yet to appoint a woman Commissioner, and I hope that when it appoints a new Commissioner, the government will take this into account and appoint a woman Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Government has never yet appointed a woman to the Court of Auditors. In most of the key areas and senior positions of power, women are not visible. That is the reality. You only have to look at a photograph of the Heads of States of the European Union and compare the number of men and of women – it is just not acceptable. The only way we are going to get some sort of equality for women is when women actually occupy the key decision‐making roles. As someone said a few years ago in my own country: when there are as many incompetent women in roles of power as there are men, then we will have true equality. Women have to be two or three times better than men if they are to get anywhere, to actually achieve anything. This is the problem – the women who are here at the moment in this Parliament – the women who have actually achieved – who have got somewhere – are much better than the vast majority of men. That is because they have to be so much better to actually get there, and we really have to address this point.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also have to do is make it possible for them to get to that position. You cannot compare the position of men and women in society because first of all women have families, they have commitments; and it is only in countries where proper structures have been put in place that women can participate on an almost equal footing. That has not happened throughout the European Union, and we have to do something about it.</p>

But I must inject a strong note of protest into our joy at discussing many aspects of equality between men and women. If we look at the draft agenda for this part‐session, we find no mention of the existence of our debate about women. The three reports on women are mentioned once right at the end. If that is what the press and audiovisual services understand by mainstreaming then I must say I have good reason to fear that in the end all that will be left is the mainstream.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of our Parliament depends on it. Last Friday I held talks with colleagues from this House. Women represent 54 % of the staff working in this House. At first glance this figure seems fine, but if we take a closer look we see that women account for 80 % of category C staff employed in the lower echelons, 40 % of category B staff but only 20 % of category A, where staff hold senior positions, and 0 % of directors‐general! Women MEPs are fairly well represented in Parliament, making up 28 % – I thank Mrs Eriksson, who established this – but it is not enough. On 13 June Parliament will be re‐elected and then we women must be more strongly represented. We must move closer towards parity. I am pleased that in my party in Germany, the Social Democratic Party, 44 % of nominations have been for women. So we are approaching parity here too. But we simply must ensure that equal opportunities are enshrined in all policy areas, which means that we cannot just look at the gender mainstreaming aspect but need to accompany it with the dual approach, with special measures for women. We need the fifth action programme and regular checks of the results, especially by the Committee on Women"s Rights and Equal Opportunities, otherwise the whole issue will disappear from the agenda and women will no longer play any part in European politics.</p>

I am very proud to be able to add in a small way today to what our colleagues have said, particularly in my capacity as a member of the Committee on Women"s Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We may be surprised that in our society which is based on human rights, we still need to emphasise the need to incorporate equal opportunities for men and women into all Community policies and activities. I think Mrs Eriksson"s report is excellent, but she raises a number of points on several issues. I hope her questions will be answered.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a further point which I am concerned about. You will no doubt remember that of the priorities singled out by the hearing in Luxembourg on employment, the fourth and final priority concerned the problem of equality between men and women. It is not a coincidence that this priority has indeed been put in fourth place in the subsequent National Action Plans, whereas if it had been incorporated into all the other policies, it would have had to be in first place.</p>

You would have to look a long way to find more traditional gender role patterns than those found in the Commission. The higher you go in the hierarchy, the greater is the male dominance. Women make up 80 % of the people who carry out secretarial and office work, while men occupy 87 % of the managerial positions. The Commission maintains that it sets targets and draws up action plans to bring more women into managerial posts. I would therefore like to ask the Commission, and especially Mrs Gradin, whether it would not be a good idea to introduce positive discrimination for women in managerial posts within the Commission? Positive discrimination should not be used aimlessly and without thinking. There should always be individual assessment of individual candidates. But if a man and a woman are equally qualified, the woman could be chosen. Positive discrimination should not be a permanent solution, but as the situation stands in the Commission at the moment, it is necessary to resort to drastic measures.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (SV)</span> Madam President, I welcome Mrs Eriksson's report on mainstreaming. It sets out some valuable points of view on the Commission's progress report on the incorporation of equality of opportunity between women and men into all EU policies. We hope that in a few months" time the Amsterdam Treaty will be ratified by all 15 Member States, thereby making equality of opportunity between women and men an overarching goal in our Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainstreaming is an important policy instrument. The point was made most emphatically by the United Nations at the Fourth Women's Conference, where the EU was one of the driving forces behind the principle. Even more importantly, some progress has been made. In my view, one of the most significant achievements is that gender equality has been written into some of the common strategies for employment. It has also been mentioned during our discussion that gender equality should be taken into account in the allocation of Structural Fund resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now appointed officials within its directorates‐general whose remit is to ensure that equality of opportunity is respected in their day‐to‐day operations. I can assure Mr Blak that the Commission practises positive action. When two people with the same qualifications apply for a job, it is given to the member of the under‐represented sex.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, it is not just in terms of employment and structural policies that gender equality is an important factor; it must also be incorporated into all the policies that affect the daily lives of women and men. At the moment we are trying to pursue major initiatives in the health sector, but the same principle also applies in education, science and technology. A notable example in this respect is of course the communication recently forwarded to Parliament on women in research. We have already discussed my own particular areas of responsibility, namely the STOP and Daphne programmes, as well as violence against women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Eriksson, the rapporteur, also raises the issue of gender equality at the decision‐making level. We know from our research that only when one third of decision‐makers are women will they have any real influence on decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In its communication on women in science and technology, the Commission has established that the under‐represented sex should account for at least 40 % of those working in these fields. The same figure also applies to the proposals concerning advisory committees, evaluation groups and, more importantly, decision‐making bodies in the fields of research and technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, like the committee, I too am keen to see separate sets of statistics for women and men. It is particularly important for us to have clear data, so that we can formulate policies that take account of the needs of both women and men. We are also working on establishing criteria for measuring gender equality and its practical effects. At the same time I agree with all of you, and Mrs Eriksson too, that a great deal remains to be done in order to ensure that there really is gender equality. There is no shortage of work in this area for this House, the Commission or the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Earlier, someone alleged that my colleague Mr Flynn did not have any women in his office – he has one. And I can assure you that in my office I have four women and three men.</p>
