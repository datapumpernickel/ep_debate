<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hermange </span> <span class="bold">(UPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Madam President, Robert Debré, the renowned pediatrician, used to say that our children are our eternity. Now, in the construction of Europe, children and families are the ones who are most forgotten in the mechanisms that are being put in place for cooperation and solidarity. This is unacceptable, as our children face particular risks such as road accidents, drug addiction, sexual abuse, stress at school, illiteracy, instability, and paedophile networks.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable that 250 million children worldwide are at work, and that we in the developed countries buy, at a low cost, some of the products made by those same children. It is unacceptable that more than a million children are used for prostitution and for the perverse satisfaction of western tourists. It is also unacceptable that some families are tormented by distress. While we were having what is certainly an important political debate these last few days, a few Members among us have been considering a very delicate matter, that of the Lancelin‐Tiemann affair in which children were kidnapped by their father because procedures are not harmonised between two countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, on behalf of the committee, I am presenting to you today an own‐initiative report which has the sole objective of instigating a real political will to create a global approach to family policy based on giving the priority to children and on four principles: taking account of the diversity of family models, placing children at the heart of the European debate, going beyond the socio‐economic approach of policies geared solely to benefits, and respecting equal opportunities for men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, this approach means, as in the first measure in the report, drawing up family impact statements geared to the well‐being of children to accompany all proposals for Community acts. Secondly, at an institutional level, a series of measures should be implemented as quickly as possible, notably the extraordinary European Council meeting in order to debate the consequences of the demographic, family and child protection policies pursued by the various Member States. There should also be regular debate on family affairs and children in the Council of Ministers, and the unit within the European Commission that is devoted to those policies should be restructured.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would very much like the European Commission"s inter‐departmental group on matters related to childhood to be revived, especially as there are particular problems with the legal basis for budgetary headings concerning children. I would also like to point out that, in order to implement this European strategy, I advocate the adoption of guidelines for action in favour of children drawn up with the partners in government after consultation with Parliament and in close collaboration with family organisations and solidarity organisations working directly or indirectly to improve the social integration of children in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to child protection policy, certain proposals should be highlighted. In the field of health care policy, we want to set up a European perinatal epidemiological network composed of regional perinatal surveillance units for each set of data and a common European perinatal database, which is something that urgently needs to be put in place in order to combat infant and maternal mortality.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to parenting and education, which is a serious problem nowadays, we must implement strategies for relations between mothers and children from a very young age. Also, the establishment of schools for parents and out‐of‐school associations, which will improve children"s integration into social life, should be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of prevention and of protection from danger in childhood, I would like to encourage the Member States to appoint children"s ombudsmen with the task of reaching an amicable settlement in conflicts involving young people under the age of 18.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to prevent ill treatment and violence, I propose the creation of a European centre for children in danger, which would have the task of promoting the exchange of know‐how and making available a European register of children who have disappeared and of culprits who have received sentences, drawn up in cooperation with the national police and judicial authorities and Europol.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, events that are unfortunately too frequent highlight the need to design, on the basis of the consideration currently being given to the European judicial area, a coordinated mechanism among our countries in the area of family law, for the well‐being of our children.</p>
<p class="contents">These, Madam President, are the main measures that I would like to submit to the House.</p>

The committee feels that pursuing a family policy at European level is impossible and undesirable for the following reasons. Firstly, family policy is typically one of the areas where the principle of subsidiarity applies. The Member States do not need the Community in order to have an efficient family policy. Secondly, there is no definition of a European family, nor do we need one. Differences in culture and tradition make it impossible to find a common basis for formulating proposals for such a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Women"s Rights is therefore against the rapporteur"s proposals calling for a European Council of Ministers on family policy, and all the other proposals for a special family policy at European level. All that Europe can be responsible for is ensuring that, when new policy measures are introduced, account is taken of their effects on the situation of families in the Member States. More European interference in the family could mean that families would suffer. The Committee on Women"s Rights agrees with the rapporteur"s proposals regarding the protection of children and their rights, provided that they are consistent with the existing international legal framework and that they are cross‐border measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Liberal Group is against any European interference in family matters, and will therefore support only those paragraphs that are aimed at providing better protection for children.</p>

We undoubtedly had problems in the initial stages, because I need hardly say that many things have already been decided here by Parliament in a similar manner.</p>
<p class="contents">But we also had problems because Mrs Hermange's first version incorporated many elements of social policy that were completely unacceptable to us, such as the expression ‘Europe without Europeans' or the suggestion that Europe was committing suicide by letting its birth rate fall. These and other misleading statements certainly made us have serious doubts at the start of the process. There was also the fact, of course, that our committee became embroiled in an decidedly impassioned discussion on the enshrining of the traditional family model. I shall return to that in a moment.</p>
<p class="contents">And then suddenly we had a number of amendments from other committee members which would have totally distorted the report; moreover, I have to say that the committees asked for an opinion did not exactly make things any easier for us. The Committee on Civil Liberties and Internal Affairs even changed draftsmen, one draftsman having tried to refer the entire matter back on the subsidiarity issue. That was not the position of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our view that the family is definitely a matter which the European Union is competent to deal with politically at European level. What is more, we in the European Parliament are a more suitable forum than national parliaments for the discussion of this issue, since everywhere in the Member States there are ideological battles about the concept of the family, about what does and does not constitute a family. We in the European Parliament, with the mutual tolerance and respect we practise, are undoubtedly in a position to reach agreement on a modern family model, thereby setting an example for this debate in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I move on, let me examine some aspects of subsidiarity. I do not share the previous speaker's view that the subject under discussion has nothing at all to do with our area of responsibility. Of course, I would not wish to interpret our remit too broadly, because the family should naturally be first and foremost a matter of national and preferably local government policy. But as we know, policies on the family are also invariably associated with issues of sexual equality, which makes them a partly European responsibility. Let us recall the guidelines for 1999, which include a new pillar specifically dedicated to equal opportunities, and the call for modern forms of work organisation. What else does that mean but giving women and men, fathers and mothers, new opportunities to combine work with family responsibilities through changes in the organisation of workplaces and social structures?</p>
<p class="contents">This position, incidentally, has also been adopted by the European Court of Justice, which has delivered several relevant judgments on subjects such as part‐time work and equal pay. This is another argument in favour of the European dimension. We jointly adopted the European legislation on parental leave, which is another contribution to a modern, enlightened policy on the family. The fact that the amount of parental leave taken is so unevenly distributed between men and women in Europe should, I believe, provide some important food for thought in the Member States. Let me mention just three statistics: 30 % of all parental leave in Sweden is taken by fathers, in Germany the figure is 3 %, and when the data were collected in Greece, only three men – yes, three men – were on parental leave. That too is an indication of how we in Europe can learn from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish with a point which is of great importance to me, a point that should stir us into action. We have legally guaranteed freedom of movement for employees in the European Union, and that naturally extends to their families too. For that reason and because of the single market, we have a duty – a shared duty, of course – to pursue a European policy on the family.</p>

I really cannot identify any such violation. What could be more important to us than our children? That is precisely what makes this report necessary. The subject is so wide and touches on so many areas that several reports ought actually to have been devoted to it.</p>
<p class="contents">The term ‘family' is not a purely national or European one, but is a worldwide concept which means many different things to many different people. The only thing I am sure of is that we can talk of a family when children have been born and are being brought up. The subject can be described as European in scope, because families in Europe are in similar situations and have similar problems. There are two reasons why it is very important that Europe should provide answers here. The first is that Europe is growing old and grey. This has critical repercussions, and not just on social security systems. The second is that Europe is becoming lonely. There are an increasing number of one‐person households and elderly people living alone. Our society is becoming perceptibly more individualistic. The weakest link in the social chain, namely our children, are being exposed to more and more dangers. Television and the Internet without frontiers are bringing repulsive material into our homes. Organised criminals have long been aware of the potential of children.</p>
<p class="contents">The report deals with the protection of families and children. Both need protection and support. My last point relates to a welcome development, but one which has extensive ramifications. More and more women in Europe are going out to work and have to be able to juggle their occupational and family responsibilities. These developments have momentous repercussions, which must be reflected in political decisions. Europe has to provide answers here, because families are far more important than we tend to realise. We speak so often of social exclusion; the family is the most natural remedy. Where does a person spend the most important years of the social integration process? In the family! What is the most suitable framework for the care of elderly and disabled people? The family!</p>
<p class="contents">To express this in a simple formula, social policy begins with a policy on the family. In the age of the euro and the single market, the term ‘welfare' must not be entirely reduced to the growth of the gross domestic product. The family is an essential element of quality welfare. It is of inestimable value to us. At this point, let me thank the rapporteur once again for her constructive cooperation and for this excellent report. I hope that these ideas are followed up and that the report does not turn out to have been a mere paper exercise.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lindqvist (ELDR).</span>  – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, much of what has been said here makes good sense. The basis of a secure environment for growing up is often an upbringing in a secure family. However, families can look very different. They may have two parents or a single parent, which is often the case around Europe today. It is of course important for each of us in our own countries to ensure that people can combine work with shared responsibility at home.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many dividing lines and differences between children's chances of growing up in secure conditions. Not only are there the differences between families, but also substantial differences between large towns and rural areas. In rural areas, isolation is often a major factor in making children feel insecure, which we must of course combat by establishing more secure conditions for growing up by means of various kinds of support.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty, exclusion, the more demanding pace of work in our modern world and, not least, unemployment all have a strong effect on children. With 18 to 20 million unemployed people in Europe, our children are naturally affected. It is therefore important to ensure that we can give them the security which enables social problems to be avoided in the future. Several speakers have already mentioned this.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we in the Liberal Group believe that it is going too far to propose that the family ministers should meet regularly, that there should be a special unit within the Commission for family affairs, and perhaps a directive on childcare. These are issues which first and foremost concern the most private of all areas, the close relationship between parents and children. This should be handled within the family and in communities, in other words close to home. These are communal, social, regional and national issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden we have a children's ombudsman, which works extremely well. It is something we can imagine other countries introducing too. The task of the children's ombudsman is to look after the rights and interests of children. However, this is hardly something which should be regulated through a European family policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a major effort is required to combat violence against women and children, which is increasing precisely because social circumstances are difficult for many people today. Such problems stem from a hard working life and high unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Crisis centres are needed. These already exist in Sweden and the Nordic region, as well as elsewhere. We have talked about the sexual exploitation of children. Obviously this must be combated, but it should be done by proper methods at the proper level.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing which I believe we can do together here is to ensure that, in the negotiations with new Member States, we oppose in every way the abuse of children and the trafficking in children which is taking place, with children being exported from Eastern Europe and non‐European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">From a Liberal perspective, we would like to say that all of this is extremely important and has to be addressed. However, it must be done in a proper way and in the proper place. Family policy, childcare and raising children are first and foremost national issues which should be dealt with at national level. We must draw a line between what are children's rights and what are private matters of family policy and childcare. As elected representatives, we have an obligation to protect children through such things as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This is essentially a good report, but we cannot support the proposals designed to introduce a European family policy.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ribeiro </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, it is fortunate that we have reports to discuss in this House like the Hermange report, and I would say the same about the Sainjon report that we adopted yesterday. It is fortunate that this House still finds time to discuss these matters and to adopt resolutions like those resulting from these reports, on which the rapporteurs must be congratulated. It is fortunate that in discussing these reports and adopting these resolutions, we can find justification for some of the reasons for our presence in this House, having deserved – if this is what we deserve – the vote and representation of our voters.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding our general agreement, this does not mean that we have no comments and reservations to make or that we totally agree with the motion for a resolution tabled by Mrs Hermange on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. However, in order to express these comments and reservations, we have these debates which, through everyone"s contributions, aim to improve what would already be satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not totally agree with this proposal, not just due to the precise terms chosen but also due to the fact that we believe there is an omission or an aspect that is not sufficiently developed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that it would actually be very appropriate for there to be a closer connection between the subject of the protection of families and children and the social consequences of a specific economic strategy and the interests that this serves. It is true, as stated by the rapporteur, that ‘the reconciliation by mothers and fathers of professional life and family life is a key factor in a modern family policy". This same concern can be detected in paragraph 14. However, we believe that the extent of this connection is insufficient and that the wording is not totally satisfactory. We have therefore tabled two amendments in order to specifically strengthen this aspect, as we feel it is necessary, and to contribute in a small way to improving the motion for a resolution to be adopted, without causing any imbalance.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the honour of being the first signatory of the motion for a resolution on child labour that is contained in this report. We would like to highlight the connection between the deregulation of working relations and the employment of the labour force being made clandestine, the consequences of this for the protection of families and children and the promotion, tolerance and concealment of child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Our other amendment involves removing a value judgment from what can only be an objective reference. Although it can be said that the directive on part‐time work has the purpose of allowing, on a voluntary and non‐discriminatory basis, improved reconciliation of family life and professional life, it is wrong to state that the directive makes this reconciliation ‘easier".</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and to end as I started, it is fortunate that we have these opportunities to discuss such matters in this House, but much more is needed. We need to ensure that the requests, recommendations and demands contained in this motion for a resolution are not ignored or given less importance than the aims that are regarded as more important due to the fact that all political and social action is conditioned by the reactions of the so‐called markets.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kerr </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Madam President, the problem we have in this debate is to know what it is we are talking about when we talk about families. When I was growing up in Scotland we used to have an event called the Kerr Jaunt. This comprised two large buses going to the seaside once a year with 150 people aboard. That was an extended family. I suspect that when she speaks about the family Mrs Hermange means the nuclear family of two parents: one husband at work, a mother at home looking after one child – indeed, only part of one child, given the birthrate in Europe at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that picture of the family is a declining picture of the family. Families are a very disparate entity across the Union and therefore to try to adopt common social policies, legal policies and economic policies which deal with all families is probably a mistake. Instead, we have to look for the best practice and best policy to deal with issues which may impact upon the way in which people want to live their lives, bring up children and live together, which varies considerably across the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we need good policies for social security which, for example, include the notion of disaggregation, i.e. the notion of treating women independently from men, in their own right, with entitlements and access to social security, the question of children's rights, children's benefits and children's allowances, which relate to children and the cost of children, to the question of child care and the protection of children and to enshrining these rights. The Swedish model we heard about from Mr Lindqvist with its children's Ombudsmen is very good.</p>
<p class="contents">All these things are separate in a sense from family policies but may add up to the same thing. Whether we need the kind of policies at European level that Mrs Hermange suggests is open to question and although I am a federalist, there are areas here where subsidiarity has to operate. I suspect that many other Members may feel the same. We may achieve the same objectives by going about it in a different way. That may be the way we have to approach it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a slight moral overtone in the report, suggesting that single parent families are somehow deficient. The evidence is very clear from all my social research over the years that where single parent families are properly supported in terms of social security and legal rights and child care, they are just as successful as nuclear families. We have to encourage and allow that diversity across Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Maes </span> <span class="bold">(ARE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, it is clear from reading this report that it contains a lot of vague statements. Politicians are gradually beginning to become aware of the ageing of the population, and we might have expected this report to head off in this direction. But it would be naive simply to opt for a birth rate policy, particularly at European level. What we need to achieve is a society in which parents can have as many children as they want and children can develop their full potential. In our view this is primarily a task for the Member States, the regions and the local authorities, as other people have said. I would have preferred the report to have dwelt rather less on this point, but I would stress that it is an important task nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has a rather moralising tone, as if it were telling people what they should and should not do. Looking at our various initiatives, we can see that there is often a lot more happening than could ever be listed in this report. The protection of children is still a major concern, and I would point out that various countries still have serious problems here and that European and international measures are needed. I would simply mention the international networks for the sexual exploitation of children, sex tourism, child pornography and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The international Convention on the Rights of the Child requires reports to be produced at various levels, including European level, on how the convention is being implemented, and I am therefore very pleased with one of the practical measures in Mrs Hermange"s report calling for a specific unit to deal with child protection. Sweden has already set an example here, and Flanders too has a commissioner for the rights of children. I shall be putting forward a proposal on this subject to Parliament shortly, but it is still being translated at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The terminology used in legislation on the protection of children is also something that we should be able to harmonise. We approved the fight against child labour in the Sainjon report, so we do not need to keep coming back to it in other reports. I would make a special plea for efforts to be made to track down children who have disappeared and to combat child abductions. These are international agreements that Europe simply must subscribe to.</p>

Family policy is therefore not so much a policy in itself as a concern that should inspire all those who think about any aspect of economic, social and cultural life in the various countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I will leave the question of discussing a common family policy for the Community for the explanation of vote on 28 January, and I would just like to emphasise certain points that were watered down in the final report that was presented to us due to compromise amendments. I do think that you were right to stress the need for economic justice for families. Families are not charity cases for governments and their policies. No, families are at the very heart of the creation of national wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that here we can see a change of mentality to which your report could contribute, but we need to go further. When we consider the question of the cost of living, we have to take into account those who have family responsibilities and should not take an overly individual, or rather individualistic, view in our calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude with a point that I consider to be very important. Ladies and gentlemen, we have no hesitations about talking about a political model. In Europe we are referring to democracy. We do not hesitate to talk about models when we are discussing social issues. We talk about the European social model, which combines responsibility, personal initiative and solidarity. So I must ask why we are so reluctant to mention the existence of a European family model in which men and women, with equal responsibility, in a loving relationship, are capable of engaging with society and with the children that will be born of that union, and of taking on that responsibility.</p>

Should we therefore also agree on what we mean by a family and by a home?</p>
<p class="contents">The current trends in the development of morals are leading the very concept of the family to be devalued. I will not expand too much on this subject, as others have already done so before me. I would simply like to propose going to Brazil, for example, to see what becomes of children there who are from broken or single‐parent families.</p>
<p class="contents">Protection of the family and of children is a very broad subject. Today, Madam President, I would like to deal with only one of the many issues, but one that affects just about all children and that has a very profound influence on them. That issue is violence on television, and I am surprised that this serious problem has not been dealt with in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are a few figures: in a week chosen at random, the French weekly <span class="italic">’Le Point"</span> counted 670 murders, 15 rapes, 848 fights, 419 shootings, 14 abductions, 32 hostage situations and 27 scenes of torture. Scientists have observed a correlation, and sometimes even a causal relationship, between the violence in the images seen by children and their level of aggression in real life. Television is indeed guilty of encouraging violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Regardless of age, exposure to violence on television leads to an increase in childhood aggressiveness. There is more and more violence on television. In the space of 40 years, the number of murders has multiplied by one thousand. Also, you should be aware that in the days following the portrayal of a suicide, the rate of real suicides among adolescents increases by 13.5 % among girls and 5.2 % among boys.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand, Madam President, why I am particularly surprised that the issue of violence on television was ignored in this report, but maybe that would be touching on commercial interests that are beyond us. Unfortunately, it would not be the first time.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Cushnahan </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Madam President, in the context of this debate, I want to express my concern at the totally inadequate cooperation and coordination throughout the European Union in response to the increasing activity of international paedophile groups. The recent report entitled ‘Child Abuse on the Internet", along with other research, indicates the scale of paedophile abuse of information technology. It has recently been revealed that international paedophile groups are targeting child‐friendly sites on the Internet to trace potential victims. It has been estimated that some 20 000 paedophiles in Europe use the Internet daily. While I appreciate that this is a complex technical issue, there is more that could be done to police this particular abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned that recently in my own country we have seen an increase in a number of attempted child abductions, especially over the last couple of months. It is believed that this is the work of British paedophiles who have fled their native country. This illustrates the need for better cooperation between law enforcement agencies in various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">EU Member States need to consider ways in which we could harmonise our laws to exchange or compile registers of serious sex offenders. Certainly I, personally, would support the concept of an EU‐wide list.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to place movement restrictions on those who have finished custodial sentences. There are many ways we can tackle this problem. There are many ideas. I would like to see some attempt throughout the EU to coordinate activity.</p>

And in very many details too, it strikes exactly the right note and addresses reality in a very frank and open manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think the question of subsidiarity or competence arises here at all. The family and the protection of children are naturally a matter for local authorities, municipal administrations and civic and charitable associations. But the family is also a European and a global phenomenon, so why should European policymakers not concern themselves with the family, and why should there not be a special interest in the protection of children at European level? It is necessary to break down the walls of silence, because there is far too much maltreatment of children in disturbed family environments.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the many proposals in this report, those that deal with the subject of child abuse are very important. Where does the sexual abuse of children begin? Probably in the family environment. But a long time ago it began to assume a very global dimension, and what is happening on the Internet and in the domain of mass tourism may perhaps be termed the globalisation of perversion.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention two more points that I consider very interesting and constructive, namely the call for a special meeting of the European Council devoted to child protection policy and the suggestion for the creation of a European centre for children, one of the principal tasks of which would be to compile and maintain a database on missing children and convicted child abductors, in cooperation with the national authorities and Europol.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marín, </span>  <span class="italic">Vice‐President of the Commission. – (ES)</span> Madam President, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Hermange on having taken the initiative to draw up a report on the protection of the family and children in the European Union. This is an extremely important issue since the changes currently taking place in our society, be they demographic, sociological, ethnological or scientific, greatly influence the family.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission notes the requests made in the resolution, although it admits that issues relating to the family are still the responsibility of the Member States themselves. The birth rate is falling in almost all the Member States of the Union, fewer people are getting married, more couples are living together without marrying and more children are born out of wedlock, while the divorce rate is continuing to rise. These are the trends that are currently influencing the family unit and, indeed, society as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a constant interest in the situation of families and its implications for our social and employment policies. It is also becoming increasingly evident that we need greater international cooperation on issues relating to the family as part of the global effort to promote social progress and development. Although the Community has no direct responsibility in the area of family policy, it is paying increasing attention to the analysis and understanding of the social and economic repercussions these new trends and social changes have on families.</p>
<p class="contents">There are striking differences between the Member States as far as family policy is concerned. These are based on the different ideas of the role of the State in economic and social life, the family"s position in society, its rights and obligations, the roles of men and women within the family and the principle of the rights of the child. However, the family has always been highly valued and will continue to be highly valued in all the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is promoting a series of measures and policies aimed at reconciling work and family life: the challenge of finding a balance between these two areas is vital for a whole range of employment and social matters. Issues that directly affect the family include the changes in the composition of the workforce, the new forms of labour organisation, the restructuring of social protection, and the changes in the distribution between men and women of tasks involving the care of dependents.</p>
<p class="contents">The directives on pregnant workers, parental leave and part‐time work are all valuable examples of the European Union"s commitment to helping men and women in their family lives. The recommendation on child care suggests that we should adopt initiatives that aim to provide child‐care services for parents who work or who are still undergoing training, that pay greater attention in the workplace to the needs of workers with children and that encourage men to participate in caring for children.</p>
<p class="contents">The employment guidelines are also providing a great boost in terms of helping to reconcile family and professional life. The employment guidelines for 1999 put even greater emphasis on the issue of reconciling family and job responsibilities as an integral part of the European employment strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that the European Union must make substantial efforts to determine the similarities and differences in the way that the Member States react to the changes I mentioned, and to promote, at Community level, exchanges of information and the gathering of experience relating to all family issues.</p>
