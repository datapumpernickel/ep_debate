<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, and in particular their respective rapporteurs, Mr Nobilia and Mr Purvis, for their open and constructive work on this proposal. The nature and number of proposed amendments indicates that much thought and effort has gone into the examination of the Commission’s proposal. In this respect, I am sure that the public hearing organised in February – in which it was my pleasure to participate – served as a useful introduction to the very technical issues dealt with in the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The aims of the Commission’s proposal can be stated quite briefly. They are accurately summarised in Mr Nobilia’s report. They are as follows: first, to introduce more stringent tests for the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents; second, to expand the scope to include all four types of surfactants instead of covering just two types as at present; and third, to introduce labelling requirements to benefit the consumer and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The first two measures will significantly enhance the protection of the aquatic environment with respect to toxicity, and the third will also benefit the health of consumers with respect to allergies. In addition, the proposal brings all EU detergents legislation together in a single text to make it more user-friendly, so this is a major effort to simplify EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides presenting what is in the proposal, I would also like to say some words on the wider legislative context. I do this to explain why certain things have been left out of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, this proposal supplements, but does not replace, the horizontal legislation on chemicals, in particular the directives on dangerous substances and preparations. Indeed, detergents are not dangerous in the sense of the Dangerous Preparations Directive. We need to supplement the general horizontal legislation, not because detergents are especially hazardous, but because they are released into the aquatic environment in very large amounts. Legislation is justified even for a chemical preparation with a low hazard, if it can pose a risk to the environment through being released in sufficiently large quantities. We need a regulation on detergents to fill this sector-specific limitation in the horizontal legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation on detergents therefore needs to address certain specific issues, principally, of course, the biodegradation of surfactants. It is therefore important to see the proposal not as the final position on detergents, but as an instrument for bringing detergents within the harmonised area of the Internal Market, and as a tool for tackling the associated responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal provides a framework for addressing issues relating to detergents, as and when they arise. It also provides a tool for keeping the legislation up-to-date in response to technical progress and the increased understanding of, and concern for, the environment. Other issues relating to detergents that are not addressed by the proposal will, however, be addressed by horizontal legislation; for example, at the last session we had Mr Lannoye's report on Nonylphenol and the next debate today is on Mrs Schörling's report on CMRs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important feature of the proposal concerns derogations for those surfactants that pass the old biodegradability tests, but fail the new tests. Derogations will only be granted for surfactants that can demonstrate, by means of a complementary risk assessment, that they will pose no risk to the environment. In no case would such a derogation be granted for use in an ordinary laundry detergent. This will only apply to specialised industrial and institutional uses where the tonnages have been declared and taken into account in the risk assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">The complementary risk assessment has to provide sufficient information to enable the risk to the environment to be properly evaluated. At the same time, unnecessary testing should be avoided. In this respect, toxicity testing will only be required if a Member State specifically requests it in cases where doubts remain. The testing requirements are therefore judged to be the minimum necessary consistent with a reliable evaluation, while at the same time minimising the amount of animal testing, as well as limiting the overall expense of the testing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that its proposal represents an equitable and appropriate balance between the economic, social and environmental pillars of sustainable development. It will provide the high level of protection of the environment and of human health required by the Treaty, and it will do so at a reasonable cost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nobilia (UEN), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I do not want to use my speaking time to give a technical account of the work carried out and its significance because I believe you are all familiar with that; this is certainly not presumption on my part but an acknowledgement of the clearly prodigious efforts of the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, manifested, first and foremost, in the tabling of a large number of amendments. I can only thank them for this, for there is no doubt that, over and above the general intention of introducing one’s own ideas into a report, the ultimate goal is to improve the report itself and its effectiveness in the common, general interest. Likewise, I cannot fail to thank the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups for their sensitivity and for their goodwill in drafting at least eight compromise amendments to take account of concepts, objectives and proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">My personal opinion, therefore, is that the product of the work of the Committee on the Environment, which is now before the House, has much broader backing than might have been expected when the Commission first submitted its proposal to Parliament. As I said before, I am not saying this out of pride but in order to give credit to all the members of the committee who have worked on the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we cannot claim that the report covers all aspects of the issue of detergents. We still have to analyse and express a position on a number of points. We have to decide what line to take on phosphates, for example, what line to take on the anaerobic biodegradability of surfactants, and again, what level to set with regard to the biodegradability of other components of detergents. Incidentally, it therefore appeared necessary to all concerned to set a deadline within which to ask the Commission to express its opinion on the rest of the matter. It can be said, however, that our primary objective in amending the proposal in question was to make the text and related instruments more usable, more functional and more cohesive.</p>
<p class="contents">This, in any case, was the line we followed in our work. I must stress that, as well as seeking to make the rules proposed more usable, functional and cohesive, we took care to pursue two further objectives. The first was to employ practical sensitivity with regard to small and medium-sized enterprises, a particularly good example of this being the establishment of the derogation, without – we trust – giving any less consideration to the need to provide ever-increasing protection of the environment, public health and animal welfare. The second, in the context of the – at last binding – labelling system, concerns the goal of increasing the awareness of consumers when they make choices, without in any way detracting from the valuable work of consumer protection organisations but, on the contrary, enhancing it.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to focus briefly on the fact that the regulation in question certainly does not cover all the questions related to detergents, and I am not criticising the Commission’s work here but pointing out two further characteristic aspects of both this and previous provisions on detergents. The first – as I suggested at the start of my speech – is the underlying approach to the issue: the Commission took the approach of phasing in the legislation. The second, which almost justifies the first, is the need for recourse to a third body, in this case to a scientific committee, to implement the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">When amending the regulation in question, we have attempted to assess the tasks entrusted to the committee and bring those considered to be political rather than technical before the House for it to study and vote on. The rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs worked together to achieve this undertaking too. Since, however, there are both technical and political aspects – and there are – and since it is true that the work carried out in the Committee on the Environment has been productive and enjoyed remarkably broad support, then I find it difficult to understand why some of my colleagues, without wishing to undermine everyone’s individual right to do so, have tabled further amendments in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, in this regard, I have to say that I support Amendments Nos 47, 52, 53 and 60, which indisputably make additional important contributions which complement the current provisions. I also have to say that my feelings are essentially neutral as regards Amendments Nos 56 and 61, which merely change the position of points within the regulation itself, whereas I have to express firm rejection of the remaining amendments, certainly not – to conclude – because I disapprove of their content in principle, nor even because they partially belie the consensus expressed in committee, but because, should they be accepted, they would not achieve what is undeniably the desired objective of the text to be issued, namely providing better protection, but would compromise the cohesiveness, functionality and usability which I mentioned earlier, which is consistent with that phasing-in of the legislation that is based on the scientific approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will completely overhaul and modernise legislation concerning detergents. It is an advance for producers and consumers, as well as for the environment. We did, however, in our consideration of it, identify certain shortcomings which, I am glad to say, will be rectified by many of the proposed amendments in Mr Nobilia's report.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal does not differentiate between, for example, a laundry product made and marketed by an international company in large quantities for a mass consumer market, and on the other hand a niche product made in small quantities often by SMEs for specialised applications. Examples of the latter are cleaning equipment for dairies, or for operating theatres. The former can readily follow the provisions of the draft directive with its testing processes and derogation procedures, and there are always ample alternatives, but for the smaller specialised product this can be a brick wall which eliminates a useful, even a central, product. I am pleased therefore that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has accepted the gist of our proposal for a tiered derogation procedure which such producers can invoke.</p>
<p class="contents">We also proposed a sunset clause so that the comitology procedure will automatically lapse after eight years and be renewed only if appropriate at that time. This is based on the procedure first introduced in the financial services area in order for Parliament to keep some measure of control over the burgeoning comitology systems which are developing in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I am pleased to recommend support for Mr Nobilia's report but would suggest that Amendments 5, 15, 20, 33 and 40 unduly overlap with other relevant legislation and should be rejected. Nor can we support the amendments lodged by the Verts/ALE Group at the last minute. Otherwise we can wholeheartedly support Mr Nobilia's report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means that we want to motivate industry to move progressively to other products and, at the end of the line, no longer to rely on the catalytic converter or on the waste treatment plant or on big exhaust systems. Instead, right at the start of the process, we want to move on to new products that are sustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is a forward step in terms of the internal market, because its consequence will be that many national regulations current in Europe will be harmonised, the objective being to have equal and comparable criteria for approval, and especially to ensure the removal of distortions to competition in this area too. So, Commissioner, I am very glad that you were present at the European People's Party group's hearing, and that collaboration between environmentalists and your department has developed extraordinarily well in the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy will benefit not only consumers, but also the environment, water policy and, above all, the internal market as well, and to that I am especially committed. There is, for example, no doubt that biodegradability must be progressively revalued. Mr Nobilia has come up with a very good proposal, and I cannot do other than endorse it. If I may, very much on the spur of the moment, consider the amendments tabled by the Greens, I do not think that all of them are wrong, but, yet again, their tendency is to enable the big players to perform these services, so that the small ones inevitably go to the wall. That is a classic example of a policy militating against small businesses, because only really big firms will be able to surmount these obstacles. As Mr Purvis has already pointed out, there is the danger that legislation like this will do precisely what we must not do by driving into a corner those whom we are actually trying to encourage to make use of niches. It is these whom we have to protect, and so a degree of tolerance must be built up.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, detergents will not be the end of the story, and we have already declared war on phosphates. Every manufacturer should know that the end is drawing progressively closer, but within a fair timescale rather than overnight, enabling businesses to adjust. That is the vitally important and utterly fundamental strategy that we must pursue.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson I have had to learn is that those of us who sit in this House should not get above ourselves. As a legislator, or co-legislator, I am quite incapable of prescribing from what point the labels on detergents should indicate the presence of scents. Some suggest 50 milligrams, while others propose 500 milligrams. Mr Nobilia has taken the only wise decision in saying that this would be handed over to experts. If they can come to a decision, the European directive will be aiming in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I am shocked to learn from studies that the greatest hazards involving detergents have basically to do with our evident inability to use the right amount of them. The people concerned – and I number myself among them – seem to think that they should always put the same amount of detergent into the washing machine, with the result that, if the size of the wash varies – if, for example, it is less by weight – the amount of detergent used is excessive. There is work for us all to do here. I must admit that I have not all that often filled up a washing machine. I am keen to learn how to do it and want to motivate my wife to show me the ropes.</p>
<p class="contents">So this involves all of us; not just the legislator, not just industry, but the public too. We will be on the right track if we grasp that fact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The key aspects of this regulation are health, consumer safety and the protection of and respect for the environment. The amendments retabled on behalf of my group are intended precisely to provide greater guarantees of the achievement of these objectives and of the objectives based on the three principles which are the basis for the work of the Committee on the Environment: the precautionary principle, the ‘polluter pays’ principle and the substitution principle. The fact that the scope of the regulation has been confined to the biodegradability of the surfactants contained in detergents does not limit the application of these principles. Indeed, I believe that anaerobic biodegradation, the biodegradation of principal organic ingredients other than surfactants and the biodegradation of phosphates should be regulated specifically, for this would complement the regulation of detergents.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I agree with the principle that the possibility of introducing legislation on individual products should be provided for, with a view to imposing more stringent requirements in the field of safety, use and environmental protection than those already laid down by horizontal legislation. That is why we are all calling upon the Commission together to present a new legislative proposal seeking to phase out these substances or to limit specific applications within three years of the entry into force of this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that it would be appropriate to provide for a single labelling system for these kinds of products in daily use, for that would allow the consumer to recognise and the producer to promote products which are less harmful to the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members of the House have been criticised by the European Environment Bureau for being less than ambitious – in particular for not insisting upon a phasing-out of phosphates across the European Union. We have, it is being said, sold out to the detergent manufacturers. Depending on the eye of the beholder a bath of hot water may be half-full or half-empty; I compare the changes proposed by the rapporteur, with cross-party support, as representing very much the half-full option. They represent a significant step forward, tightening up on requirements for the use of specialist detergents, improving on the proposals for labelling of potential allergens, ensuring that consideration is given to the development of non-animal tests and setting the basis for proposals to eliminate phosphates, taking full account of scientific evidence.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are realistic and cautiously ambitious, they improve to my mind on the Commission's draft proposals. However, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that we secure cross-party support, if the powers of this House to improve environment legislation are to be brought to bear. We can sometimes make gestures at first reading, securing major amendments for radical reform, but they matter not at all if we cannot get agreement at second reading, if we cannot secure that qualified majority; and to make progress we need to take account both of our ambitions for the environment and of legitimate concerns for industry. On the day after we voted for the enlargement of the European Union, I am very conscious that this is going to be more difficult as time passes. We are at serious risk of having to move at the very slowest pace of the slowest Member, unless we can bring the House together at every opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">My biggest concern at the moment is that we have an increasing number of Member States who are simply failing to comply even with the legislation we already have on the statute books. In the United Kingdom there are currently nine environmental directives which should already have been transposed since the Commissioner came to office, not one of which has yet been put into practice. Ministers are going to the Council of Ministers, signing their names to documents agreed after co-decision and then simply not keeping their word. Playing the system, breaking the spirit of the rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem therefore is not whether the bath of hot water is half-full or empty, but that too many Member States are not putting the plug into the bath in the first place. That should be the number-one concern, not only of the European Environment Bureau, but also of those who care in this House and in the Commission about ensuring that we move forward together to improve Europe's environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very good to simplify the legislation, from five pieces of legislation to just one. But the Commissioner has also said that this is good for the Internal Market. This is unfortunately not so, because the Internal Market has to contend with very different things. Germany, Italy and a number of other countries have banned phosphates in detergents. In some other countries, such as my own, there is a voluntary ban. In other countries again, in particular the Scandinavian countries, the phosphates are eventually removed in the waste water purification system. In Southern Europe, and unfortunately in Eastern Europe as well, phosphates are permitted. You cannot therefore say that this is good for the Internal Market.</p>
<p class="contents">All the groups have however reached a compromise on eight points and this is one of them. I am very happy about it. We say to the Commission that they must take another good look at the scientific evidence which shows that phosphates do indeed cause a problem, not just in the classical detergents. There are after all sufficient alternatives to them. This was the big problem of 30 years ago, that all those detergents contained far too many phosphates so that soap found its way into the rivers everywhere, causing foam and green algae. That problem has been overcome. Now however we have tablets for the dishwasher, which did not exist 30 years ago and which still contain very many phosphates, even in those countries that have now banned phosphates. This is why I have associated myself with the compromise. Take another good look and give the industry three years to come up with alternatives. It really can be done. It proved possible for the ordinary detergents, so it must also be possible for these dishwasher tablets.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is another problem. It is utterly ridiculous that dangerous substances, carcinogenic substances, are permitted in detergents! I am glad that the majority of this Parliament will very probably shortly be declaring itself in favour of them no longer being allowed in ordinary, everyday consumer products that everyone uses. Of course we are running ahead of the legislation on chemistry that is still to come, but it is not our fault that the Commission has waited so long to table this legislation. Indeed, we still do not have it and we are hoping across the whole Parliament, in all the political parties, that the Commission really will table this new legislation before the summer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of odours. Substances that cause allergies, not in everyone, but in certain people who cannot resist them, simply have no place in detergents. Okay, that is not what we have decided. What we have decided is that the detergent manufacturers must state very clearly that these substances are present. This gives people the choice of using them or not and will probably in any event lead to the big detergent manufacturers not putting them in any more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In short I approve of the line that the rapporteur has set out. If we wish to assess detergents with a view to trade and use, we must look in particular at their environmental and health effects.</p>
<p class="contents">An exemption for the restrictions to trade and use can be granted if we are considering necessary applications for which no safer alternatives exist. With this provision we must however ensure that the volume of sale and use across the territory of the entire European Union remains at such a low level that there is no threat to the environment and health.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point concerns phosphates. In some Member States they have already been banned. An EU ban is rather premature at the moment as far as I am concerned, but does require serious consideration. If there are other aspects for which Member States have laid down stricter legislation, these Member States should not be forced to amend their legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to express my approval to the rapporteur regarding labelling. For lay people it is indeed often incomprehensible and confusing. Simple texts on products that have been approved following rigorous evaluation must be sufficient. If the curious consumer wishes to know more, they must consult the manufacturer by way of the latter’s web site and by telephone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, this clearly shows the links between these three competences or areas. It is also, however, an issue relating to the internal market, and – as Mr Florenz so clearly described – all the economic consequences of this kind of decision are thus evident. This is therefore an environmental problem since it involves exerting pressure on the various players concerned in order to significantly reduce the use of detergents, which, when excessive, has harmful consequences for water.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a matter of public health. Are we, in fact, really measuring the consequences for human health of water pollution caused by waste rinsing water containing detergents? We all want to significantly reduce the quantities used and the toxicity of the various ingredients in detergents. However, we need to set objectives in this area that are ambitious yet attainable. There, too, consumer policy is concerned, since it is up to consumers, in other words each one of us, to rationalise our use of detergents. This is achieved, in particular, simply by reducing the quantities used and using products more efficiently. In order to do so, consumers must be given access to better information concerning instructions and conditions of use, and genuinely become aware of their great responsibilities in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts have already been made at this level by companies in the sector, by means of codes of good practice or the organisation of campaigns to increase public information and awareness. These actions, however, are undoubtedly still insufficient in relation to the environmental issues at stake here and current results. That is why I support the rapporteur, Mr Nobilia, in this field, as he goes further than the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">While conscious of the need to respect trade secrets, naturally – we sometimes address areas that could be sensitive – we would like to request further information. We would like all possible information to be sent immediately to the medical staff, who could be under obligation to respond and take decisions in this field. Of course, I would point out that the medical staff are also bound by professional secrecy. It is essential to continue research in this sector in order to find substances that are equally effective in terms of hygiene but less harmful to the environment. We need to find products that are more biodegradable.</p>
<p class="contents">More specifically, with regard to the issue of animal experiments – we have already spoken about this enough in this House, amongst other occasions, when we had to decide on the cosmetics issue – we should encourage the use, wherever possible, of in vitro testing methods and other alternative methods. The various actions taken must, of course, be carried out in full consideration of European legislation, including the legislation we are preparing in the field of chemical substances, in order to adopt coherent policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is time that we did something on detergents as there is a major problem associated with detergents and their impact upon water quality across Europe. Throughout our water systems, our great rivers and even down to the sea we see the effects of these substances being pumped into the environment, on a daily basis. I therefore welcome the proposals extending the testing on biodegradability, making biodegradability regulations stricter generally and requiring clearer labelling and information. All of this is good, as it simplifies and clarifies the administrative procedures in the proposal. Indeed, the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs have worked well together to come up with a package that is worthy of the support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask one question, however. Has enough been done, in particular with regard to the issue of phosphates? Phosphates are the key question buried inside this proposal. Phosphates are the trigger and often the clear cause of eutrification in many different waters across the European Union. We know that detergents are a major source of phosphates. Taking phosphates out of detergents would probably bring down the level of phosphates in our rivers, lakes and oceans to the point where we would not have to be concerned about the problem of eutrification again. This proposal does not fully address that question. We may have to revisit it in future. We cannot leave it for another day. If we do, we will see that as a consequence of development in eastern and central Europe, there will be a continuing problem of eutrification caused by phosphates in rivers across the whole of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is a problem with this proposal as it stands, we have not done enough on phosphates. We must act on that issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like my fellow MEPs, I am of course very pleased that we are obtaining a directive that tightens up the rules on detergents, because this is something that is definitely needed. It might nonetheless be questioned, as it was by the previous speaker, whether it is sufficient. My answer is that a much more stringent statement than the one that has now emerged would of course have been desirable. It is mainly regarding two points that I think the amendments we have tabled may be of great benefit: environmental labelling, covered by Amendment No 48; and the threshold value for biodegradable substances, covered by Amendment No 55. The demand for biodegradability definitely constitutes an important part of this legislation, but the requirement should be for this to be laid down in an actual article rather than in an annex. That would also be appropriate in the light of the codecision procedure and the European Parliament’s influence on legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal states that if a surfactant passes the test for ultimate biodegradability, no further tests shall be required before the substance is released onto the market. I do not believe that that is enough. The fact that a detergent has passed the biodegradability test does not make it impossible for it to have generated <span class="italic">other</span> metabolites that are difficult to break down and that can cause very major problems for the environment. Swedish studies have shown that detergents contain more and more chemicals and other ingredients, such as they have not contained before. It is therefore not enough just to examine biodegradability.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few remarks on labelling, which is something I advocate. Consumers must be able to choose. Sound environmental choices, stoutly defended by the Swedish Association for the Protection of the Environment, have led to our having, I believe, absolutely the safest detergents now being bought and sold in the world. It is consumers who, through their choices, have given impetus to this development. I therefore want you to vote in favour of Amendment No 48. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A regulation, in particular in this field, must not be limited to ensuring the free movement of detergents within the internal market. In a word, Article 95 of the Treaty must not take precedence over prudent and rational use of natural resources. That would be to lose all sense of proportion.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation introduces many benefits. I shall only mention two. The improvement in labelling that guarantees consumers the most specific information possible due to clear, readable labels. The restriction of the use of dangerous substances known as surfactants, which are harmful to the environment as they are hardly biodegradable at all and are dangerous in terms of public health for those who handle these detergents on a daily basis. I am thinking in particular of carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic substances that are known to be harmful.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also raises the question of banning animal testing. My position on the subject remains unaltered. I am in favour of banning animal testing, provided, of course, that reliable alternative tests are available, in particular with regard to metabolites. We must avoid repeating the mistake made in revising the directive on cosmetic products, which banned such tests without ensuring that reliable alternative methods exist.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to derogations, the Member States alone must control marketing authorisations. On this point I agree with the rapporteur’s approach. We must also take care not to wrong small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in a detergent market dominated by four or five heavyweights, for which this new legislation will not cause any particular problems. On the other hand, SMEs that produce small quantities of specialised detergents, known as industrial and commercial products, operate in a niche market. It will be extremely difficult for these companies to comply with the standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like Mr Purvis, the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, whom I wish to take this opportunity to congratulate, I believe that this regulation represents progress for both producers and consumers of detergents. I wish, however, to make a few comments on two issues that I consider to be extremely important and on which I tabled proposals for amendments in the Committee on Industry.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I welcome the fact that the preamble to the regulation expressly acknowledges the need to undertake an evaluation of issues concerning phosphate content and the biodegradability of detergents and establishes the Commission’s duty to inform Parliament and the Council, within three years, of the results of this evaluation. We will consequently be in a position to assess the future need for regulation in this field. The second issue, which was unfortunately not adopted in committee, concerns the obligation on manufacturers to provide any health care professional with a datasheet listing all the ingredients of a detergent.</p>
<p class="contents">In this area, I think it is crucial to allow Member States, on the one hand, to appoint the body or bodies responsible for receiving this information and, on the other, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the bodies and health care professionals charged with receiving this information provide the necessary guarantees of confidentiality. This information can only be used when there is a medical need to take preventive and curative action, in particular, in cases of emergency, with the Member States being responsible for ensuring that this information is not used for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Information on preparations is extremely sensitive and can only be passed on to bodies or health care professionals bound by the duty of confidentiality. Furthermore, such information must be used exclusively for the purpose of treating sick people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for us to guarantee free movement for detergents, but I think it is still more important that the detergents we put on the market should damage neither the environment nor people’s health and that, as consumers, we should always know the nature of the everyday items we buy in the shops. I am able to support the proposals concerning bans on the use of carcinogenic and other poisonous substances in detergents, and I am also able to support the supplementary proposal to the effect that the ban should include those chemicals that are difficult to break down, together with hormone-disturbing chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that those Member States that have implemented restrictive rules governing the use of phosphates in detergents must be able to uphold these rules, and I think it is important for us now, at EU level too, to address the issue of phosphates.</p>
<p class="contents">Where labelling is concerned, it is naturally important for us, as consumers, to be provided with information about the characteristics of substances included in detergents, including substances that cause allergies. With regard to the system of EC environmental labelling, I would point out that these substances are covered by this system, but apparently not all manufacturers think it worthwhile participating in it. To a large extent, they use their own labels, and I am therefore able to support Amendment No 48, based on the idea that, if other environmental labels are used, it must be stated in what way they differ from the EC’s official environmental label.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say, on the subject of animal experiments, that I am fully able to support the amendments designed to restrict animal experiments. To the extent that there are any alternative methods at all, we must naturally try to use these and, ultimately, I also think we should put pressure on industry and manufacturers to develop alternative methods in those cases in which these still do not exist, so preventing as many animal experiments as is humanly possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is actually high time that carcinogenic substances were done away with. The removal of phosphates is in fact a necessity, and it is a tragedy that we have not succeeded in bringing it about. Moreover, when it comes to phasing out, the Regulation lags far behind other provisions, such as, for example, the water framework directives. Labelling is only an initial step. Although the highest priority must of course be given to freedom of choice, my criticism is that too little attention has been paid in this debate to examining the causal links between allergies, sensitivity to chemicals, and exposure to chemical substances. This Regulation does too much about the effects on water and far too little – hardly anything at all, in fact – about any exposure assessment covering consumers and those who work in the production process.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude, Commissioner, by putting a request to you. We were too late in submitting an amendment, but I ask you to consider it all the same. We know that a number of companies are already adding bitter constituents to washing-up liquid in order to prevent children accidentally drinking them. There are still far too many deaths as a result of children drinking washing-up liquids or cleaning fluids. I ask you to give consideration to this, even without an amendment on the subject, and to look into the possibility of asking firms to add bitter constituents in order thereby to reduce the number of child deaths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I myself have been happy to follow the line taken by my own group’s shadow rapporteur, my colleague Karl-Heinz Florenz. Good work from a man who has admitted he has only used a washing machine twice in his life. Quite a good, balanced report is thus taking shape. This might perhaps sounds unnecessarily solemn, considering that we are talking about washing detergents, but when you think about the effects on the environment, this everyday matter is important.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now making reasonable technical progress so that the use of detergents might constitute as small a burden on the environment as possible. Less attention, however, has been given to the role of the user of detergents. I believe consumer behaviour in the future will have the most significant impact on the environmental load caused by detergents. It is not enough to choose a packet with an environmental label off the shelf: people also have to be able to use the product correctly. That is not as easy as it sounds, though.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, how much to use depends on the hardness of the water. This may differ many times over between the hardest and the softest water areas. Of course, though, it would be very frustrating to produce many different kinds of package according to how hard the water is. The amount of laundry and how soiled it is also affects dosage. What is now given in Annex VIII, although improved by the Committee’s amendment, is still too approximate in this regard. Averages are not an adequate solution when just the right amount is crucial from the point of view of the consumer and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Another factor that makes the problem of correct dosage harder is the growing market in concentrates. It is more difficult to decide on dosages for concentrates if you are used to using greater amounts. There would be many advantages to the environment and the consumer, however, in using concentrates: there would be fewer packages in existence and significant sums would be saved in transportation costs. For this reason we should indeed support the switch-over to concentrates, but only if the consumer knows how to use them correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the directive on advice to consumers is only half complete, I think that detergent manufacturers could voluntarily increase consumer awareness and so also reduce the burden on the environment. The national consumer authorities could likewise run campaigns giving guidance to users of washing detergents. I hope that will happen. They literally cannot wash their hands of this matter now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Things can be cleaner and we must show the political will for this today. I should first like to extend my sincere thanks to Mr Nobilia and the shadow rapporteurs. They have done good work in improving the Commission’s proposal. As far as phosphates are concerned however there is still much to be done. There are four points I should like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we must provide for valid and adequate research to close the knowledge gap. Toxicity tests are desirable and cannot be skipped. Amendments to this effect are in keeping with the policy to eliminate the lack of knowledge about chemical substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the criteria must be clear. A degradability of 60% in itself is not enough. It is of course a matter of what the remainder contains. This remainder must not in any event contain any highly persistent or hormone disrupting substances. Amendment No 49 from the Group of the Party of European Socialists is very clear in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it must be clear that exceptions are only permitted under very strict conditions. It must of course be a question of industrial use and total sales must not constitute a threat to the environment or public health. The environmental benefit must also be demonstrated. Exceptions can only be made if the environment and of course public health are served. It must also be clear that under no circumstances may economic criteria come into play. Amendment No 47 is therefore far clearer than the other texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there must be clear, honest and transparent information available. No misleading green labels, but honest information. The manufacturers must as far as possible associate themselves with the European environment mark. The European environment mark must in any event be a benchmark. That is the only way to create clarity for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bowis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, when we came in this morning there was a distinct smell of cigars in this Chamber. For a moment I thought that this was some new ingredient that was being demonstrated in the detergents which had been used to clean the Chamber overnight. I suspect it is more to do with compliance with the parliamentary clean air directive, as opposed to the parliamentary hot air directive which very often informs our debates.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is detergents we are discussing this morning and we should remember, as Mr Florenz reminded us, what that industry is made up of: in particular, in the specialist area – the non-domestic area – some two-thirds of that area is produced by small firms employing some 20 000 people throughout the European Union. That is why everyone is right to congratulate Mr Nobilia, our rapporteur, on the skilful way in which he has struck a balance between environmental concerns, consumer choice and information and the industry's interests, so as to come up with a proposal that we can unite behind here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate him on the skill with which he has negotiated the eight compromise amendments that were passed in committee. These address a number of areas, including the complementary risk-assessments for surfactants that fail the ultimate biodegradability tests, so that a tiered approach can take into account exposure and risk. He was also right to tighten the Commission's wording regarding access to detailed ingredient lists for medical staff, ensuring not only access for medical professionals, but also confidentiality of data. He was right to bolster consumer access to information, ensuring that full lists of substances added to detergents are readily accessible to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we had the compromise on phosphates. I am incorporating a number of our amendments, including my own. I am sure he was right that we should ask the Commission to examine the arguments and come back with a proposal within three years. The arguments deserve careful attention, but we must also be aware of the benefits of phosphates. We know from our Scandinavian colleagues that, provided there is good water and sewage treatment, phosphates can result in lower volumes of detergents being used and also lower water temperatures being necessary. I do not know, Madam President, whether you are one of the many who now use the tablet form in washing machines, but there has been a movement towards tablets containing phosphate, which can improve the efficiency of use.</p>
<p class="contents">One should recall the research from both Sweden and the Netherlands. The Stockholm water authority found that with phosphate substitutes there were on average ten times more suspended solids in their effluent, leading to a substantial increase in sludge; whereas phosphate products were found to be less damaging in terms of eco-toxicity towards micro-organisms. Research by the Dutch Institute of Environmental Sciences showed that use of phosphate-free detergents resulted in no improvement in surface water quality and led to eutrification worse, in many cases, than that experienced when phosphate-based detergents are used. The reason for that is that the alternatives were found to be so toxic that they killed the vital zooplankton that feed on algae and phytoplankton in naturally balanced fresh water.</p>
<p class="contents">We have here a sensible proposal. I do not accept the amendments tabled by the Green Group, which go too far, not least on the somewhat absurd eco-labelling proposals. This is a measure we could have taken through in one reading. I wish it well and again congratulate our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also believe that Mr Nobilia – whom I congratulate – has done an efficient job, as Mr Bowis, who spoke before me, has said, displaying great sensitivity, and that the result is positive for all the parties concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that it is extremely important that we realise – and of this I am absolutely convinced – that much more still remains to be done on environmental issues. I know that the European Union is the driving force in this matter, although phosphates, for example, have already been banned in a number of countries for some time. Italy is one of these countries, and while I was a member of the Italian parliament, when I was actually on the committee responsible, I helped to draw up legislative texts to that effect. I believe that the other countries, who have not yet adopted legislation to this effect, should align themselves as fast as possible, not just in order to employ and display greater sensitivity but so as to ensure that there is greater focus on environmental requirements and, moreover, to provide the consumer with more information.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not agree with some of the objections raised in the House, including those raised by a Member from the Green Group, which, as usual, whenever it is not the instigator of proposals, sees only the negative points – a half-empty glass, so to speak – and not the positive points. I, however, feel that this regulation contains ever so many positive points, indeed where all parties are concerned, and, in my opinion, the question of toxicity tests is already addressed in the directive on hazardous substances, and so it is not necessary for those provisions to be duplicated in the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to a question that has recently been raised by a number of experts and scientists: the increase of hormonal substances in our waters and the significant effects on the aquatic fauna, with fish changing sex and finding it difficult to reproduce. I believe this is a matter which warrants more attention in the future. Lastly, I feel that knowledge in a range of areas is necessary in order to be qualified to give an opinion on these matters. Just knowing how to use the washing machine is not enough. They affect all consumers, and, even though this regulation is somewhat technical in nature, it ultimately concerns all consumers, in other words all the people of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I have listened with great interest to the debate and taken note of the different concerns expressed. Perhaps I could group the questions around six groups of amendments on which I can comment one by one.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a number of the amendments seek to improve the wording of the Commission's text and can be accepted. I will enumerate them later.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a number of amendments have a link to other legislation. As regards animal testing, the aims of the Commission and the Parliament are the same. It is on how such aims are to be reflected in the legislation that we differ. The Commission cannot accept amendments that introduce policy statements that go beyond the scope of this proposal. Many substances and preparations are already adequately regulated by the horizontal chemicals legislation. It is unnecessary and undesirable to refer to them again in the detergents legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there seems to be a desire to bring forward measures on phosphates, anaerobic biodegradability and organic ingredients other than surfactants. The Commission is of the opinion that these are matters where the urgency for action is not so great as to preclude the establishment of a firm scientific base for legislation. The extension of biodegradability testing to all substances and preparations at this stage would be a disproportionate and unjustifiable measure. I will come back to phosphates later.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, on labelling – detergents legislation is supplementary to the horizontal chemicals legislation and must therefore be compatible with it. Cosmetics and detergents need to be, and are, separately legislated for. The comparison between a washing-up liquid, which is a detergent, and a chemically similar shampoo, a cosmetic, is a tempting one to make, but it is an exceptional case. No surfactant in an industrial detergent would ever be used in a cosmetic and no cosmetic surfactant would be of any use in a laundry detergent, let alone in an industrial detergent.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the ingredients data sheet is to provide information to those who need it, e.g. doctors who treat patients suffering from allergies. Manufacturers have a legitimate interest in ensuring that confidentiality is maintained. Member States also have the right to request ingredient information from manufacturers for use by their poison centres.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, on derogations. The introduction of a lifetime limit for manufacturers for submitting the additional data requested by the Member States is a good idea. According to our legal experts the criteria for refusing derogations must be explicitly stated in the text, otherwise a decision to refuse a derogation may not be enforceable in court. A minimum data set is necessary to evaluate the request for derogation; this is what we have specified in annex IV; if, in addition, further data is required by a Member State for an evaluation, it can request as much or as little as is needed. In this way we provide for a tiered approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on phosphates. The Commission has promised in Recital 31 to take action on phosphates if there is a solid scientific basis for doing so. The Commission's priority in this matter is to establish a sound scientific basis for action at Community level. There is no urgent need at EU level on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Those Member States that feel particularly vulnerable to the environmental effects of phosphates have already taken national measures. In some cases this was done many years ago and the situation in those countries has stabilised. Any action at EU level needs to demonstrate clearly the added value of the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope to have a definitive opinion from the Scientific Committee on Toxicology, Eco-Toxicology and Environment on phosphates in detergents before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Commission can accept in whole or in part amendments 2, 4, 8, 17 to 19, 22 (partly), 27 (partly), 34 to 37 – but only a part of amendment 37 – and 53. The Commission can accept in principle amendments 3, 21, 31, 45, 46 and 52. The other amendments are not acceptable to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
