<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, I have raised this oral question on behalf of my group in order to bring once again to this House, and therefore to a public and transparent debate, a fundamental issue which is a constitutional one.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when in the Convention we are considering reforms of the Commission, the Council and all the institutions, being able to fulfil our mandate with dignity, honour and equality as European citizens is an essential issue which we have been working on for a long time. I would add something else: we must resolve this issue during this legislature, before it comes to an end, given the political importance it has.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled my question in the quest for greater support and consensus within the European Parliament because I believe it is necessary and I must say that my group believes that this is an issue which must be defined with the greatest possible transparency, both with regard to the constitutional aspects of the Statute and the rules which we have to lay down for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">What I regret at this point is that it seems that, in seeking the greatest possible agreement, disagreements have been highlighted. I have been faced with an open and systematic accusation; this morning, in a press conference, three parliamentary group presidents have publicly accused the Socialist Group of blocking the Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President is well aware, it was I who proposed the amendment to the de Palacio report which was approved by 455 votes. It was I who proposed, and this is in the joint resolution of the Liberal Group as a recital, that a group of eminent people had to be created, and Mr Haarder is well aware of this, and I proposed its membership, beginning with Mr Ersbøl.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I have done on behalf of the Socialist Group. I would like those people who have criticised us – and I do not mind the election campaign being brought forward, but it should not verge on slander – to explain in this House – which is where things should be explained – what it is they have done.</p>
<p class="contents">And I would say to Mr Watson, with the greatest of respect, that it would also be interesting – he has a golden opportunity – if he could explain why he feels surrounded by Germans. We are all equal here. I do not feel overly influenced by the Germans, it is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true, for example, that this system of allowances has been created to compensate the Iberians. I come from a parliament in which they gave me the ticket, I had never earned more. I was faced with this system and I do not know any parliament, even those which pay most, which has renounced this system. Why do we have to have this hypocritical and cynical argument? I believe we have to seek unity and not offend our fellow Members because we have to work together to find a way to move ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, you are well aware that I was the president of the group which most supported the idea of you being able to maintain exploratory contacts with the Council. Now, we are in a parliament, we have to apply the parliamentary method, not the plebiscite method, and I am glad that after I raised the question, you have written to give an account of your activities, and I am also glad that you have spoken with Mr Rothley.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Rothley, I must say one thing; with Mr Rothley as rapporteur, the Statute is very difficult, without Mr Rothley, it is impossible and we must all be aware of this and, therefore, instead of increasing divisions and offending many members of this House, what we must do is work together and bring this Statute forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the letter you have written and I have one hope, Mr President, because I believe that you also take this approach. I hope that today the Council will say that it is prepared to hold talks with us on the methods for approving the Statute. That is all I am asking of the Council today, and I am very grateful that Mr Haarder is here because he has been fighting with us for the Statute. I would like to mention one thing, and that is that the Treaty of Nice is now in force, which means majority approval, except on taxation issues, which will be decided unanimously. Today, all we have to ask is that the President-in-Office of the Council hold out his hand – not to me but to Parliament. We must do the rest through an open debate and joint work amongst us and, please, let us not increase divisions. Let us seek unity in Parliament because this is our responsibility and we cannot transfer it to others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lehne (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are dealing with a never-ending story here. This House has been considering the Members’ Statute since 1998. I think it is high time we brought it to an end. We are virtually at the end of a legislative period and we also have enlargement ahead of us. I believe the legal position of the Members of this House needs to be settled now once and for all. Of course, we also need an official response from the Council to the proposals made by official bodies of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Rothley report, which was initially adopted by the European Parliament’s Committee on Legal Affairs as an opinion for our President and the Conference of Presidents, is the only document in this House to contain a really comprehensive proposal for a Members’ Statute. We have been waiting for a response from the Council since April this year and that is why we believe this oral question is now necessary. It is high time.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal of Mr Rothley’s is a very balanced one. We were guided by the submissions made by the wise men who were appointed to make concrete proposals to us. We have come to the conclusion that we ought to receive as salary one half of the basic salary of a European judge. I believe everything about this plan is well balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it all the more regrettable that three group chairmen this morning issued a press release on this important question, which really depends on a consensus in this House; I think that was completely intolerable. There was quite an obvious contradiction between the claims that were falsely made there this morning and what is actually contained in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, point out that there is only one major difference between the motions before us here, namely the reference, in paragraph 2 of our motion for a resolution, to the Committee on Legal Affairs’ April decision, because we want the Council to adopt a clear position on this document. Everything else is virtually identical in content. I therefore fail completely to understand why it was claimed this morning that the large groups would oppose the statute and wanted to fill their pockets. That is certainly not the case and it is improper to say so in that way in this House or at a press conference. I would like to make that very clear at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">In this House, there is no room for cheap populism. The large groups have a responsibility for this entire House and we are trying to fulfil it. This oral question and this resolution have again been put on the agenda so that we can make progress in the debate about the Statute, not to hinder it.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we have been negotiating now for nearly five years, and we cannot continue any longer in a situation where the Council leads Parliament a dance like a bear with a ring through its nose in a circus arena. It must be clear by now what the Council wants. If we know what the Council wants, we shall also be able to arrive at a sensible Statute in the ensuing discussions in the Committee on Legal Affairs in the actual legislative process under Article 190 (5).</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Mr Haarder, who after all was once a colleague of ours, has sat in this House and knows the problems and who was also formerly involved in the work on drafting the Statute, will now be in a position to give Parliament a clear, positive signal on behalf of the Danish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">What I consider unacceptable is that we should have a repeat of what has already happened with the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies. Let me remind you. The contact group met and we were told that if we reached a compromise over taxation the problems would be solved and the Statute could come into force as proposed. What happened? We went along with the compromise, one that, incidentally, I consider illegal and that the European Court of Justice will never accept. We went along with it, however, in the interests of a common statute, and what was the outcome? The Council again raised other problems and issues and in the end we have made not the slightest progress.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this time I would like to see on our desks not only a well-meaning letter from our President, but also a definite statement from the Council. That is the purpose of this oral question and the resolution that accompanies it.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of the transparency of costs is raised again and again. But it is not the subject of this resolution. It is perfectly clear that we want transparency, and it is also perfectly clear that our presidency will of course submit fresh proposals for the reimbursement of costs if we get the Statute. I take that as read and that is the subject of all the motions for a resolution that are here on the table.</p>

This is of course a matter I personally was very heavily involved in as a member of the European Parliament, and I attach the very greatest importance to the decision concerning a Members’ Statute. I should like to say that, as has been pointed out, the Council wishes to help find a solution that guarantees the individual Member dignity and public respect. Regarding the way in which such a statute is to be implemented, I must of course point out that the rules governing its implementation are set down in Article 190, paragraph 5 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, in which it is stated that it falls to the European Parliament, after seeking an opinion from the Commission and with the approval of the Council, to determine its Members’ status and the general conditions governing the performance of duties. When the Treaty of Nice has come into force, the Council will be able to take decisions by a qualified majority and no longer only by acting unanimously, as has been the case up until now. That does not however apply to taxation arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if it is the case that Parliament adopted a draft proposal for a statute on 3 December 1998, that is to say before the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force, Parliament has since debated the new guidelines, namely in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. A permanent dialogue has been conducted between the Council’s successive Presidencies and the interlocutors designated by Parliament, namely in the contact group set up to promote the negotiations between the two institutions. As is well known, the Council has not adopted a position on a number of the central features of the future Statute. In that connection, I should like to emphasise a couple of crucial elements.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the positions laid down so far by the Council, there must, first of all, be concordance between the Statute and primary law, for example concerning immunities and privileges. Secondly, agreement in the Council on the tax issue must be respected and, finally, there must be transparency and respect for the principle of reimbursing expenses on the basis of expenditure that has in actual fact been incurred. In my view, the statement from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market from April of this year does not fulfil all these conditions, and I can understand why Parliament’s President has been given the same message in his informal contacts with the governments of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I also appreciate why, on the basis of his contacts with the Member States, Parliament’s President has drawn a number of conclusions regarding elements of a compromise which, once the Treaty of Nice has come into force, will be able to attract the necessary majority in the Council. In conclusion, I would therefore welcome all efforts aimed at a solution acceptable to both the Council and Parliament. I should like, on behalf of the Council, to urge Parliament not to let this opportunity pass by. It is Parliament that is to do the proposing and the Council that is to do the approving. The ball lies in Parliament’s court. I would call upon us now to agree to a proposal that can attract broad support in Parliament and that can attract broad enough support in the Council for its to be able to be approved in accordance with the new rules in the Treaty of Nice that will be in force by February. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I want to support Mr Barón Crespo because, quite frankly, Mr Rothley’s astute handling of the matter has made it possible to bring to a conclusion an initiative which we had been working on for some time and which has now been satisfactorily completed. We have endorsed a Statute, and a Statute means not just money – remuneration – but it also means something more fundamental for a Parliament and for its Members, in terms, as Mr Haarder said, of constitutional and paraconstitutional issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In establishing the rights and responsibilities of Members, we have highlighted the issue of Parliament’s autonomy, which, although not absolute because the European process is slightly different, is similar to that of most national parliaments. In establishing the Statute, the members are reinforcing that autonomy. We feel, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, that there is an inseverable link between our rights and our responsibilities, between the nature of our work and, of course, the nature of our remuneration too. Mr Haarder has shown that he is on our side. I have taken note, President-in-Office, that the Council has declared its intention to take what Parliament decides into consideration, over and above questions of majority or unanimity. In doing so, it will be giving due consideration to an issue which has been highlighted for the first time by the Committee on Legal Affairs and which will lead to Parliament having a much higher profile, much more autonomy and a much fuller role. We tabled the question, which was endorsed by the President-in-Office, in order to give you an even greater chance of finding a solution. I believe that, in adopting this text, Parliament will be increasing this possibility even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have made progress. Thank you also for the letter that you sent to Members, which has clarified a lot of things. Incidentally, I have not forgotten how you supported me in the Conference of Presidents in 1998 over the question of whether the Committee on Legal Affairs should prepare a draft statute. You were chairman of the Liberal Group at the time. That was a long time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">We intend the resolution as a spur to deeper discussion with the Council of the questions that remain open. We talk about strengthening democracy and not just about salaries, we talk about the dignity of Parliament, whose Members represent 380 million citizens of the European Union, and not just about reimbursement and allowances. Of course those questions need to be settled. I am convinced that the presidency, which is the only body competent to do so, will resolve the system of reimbursements in a way that is understandable and transparent for the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who speak only about money betray their deep contempt for this Parliament. We are not a gang of con men whose activities have to be stopped. When the European Council introduced direct elections in 1976, it failed to set out the constitutional rights of Members. The Council cannot, more than two decades after the first direct elections, expect us to go without a definition of Members’ constitutional rights. The rules on immunity date back to 1965 and were designed for delegates sent to the Parliamentary Assembly by the national parliaments. The Council cannot expect us not to change anything in those 1965 provisions in the year 2003. I am quite familiar with the legal problems. With a measure of good will on both sides they can be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a time for everything. <span class="italic">Omnia</span> <span class="italic">tempus</span> <span class="italic">habent</span>. I have the feeling that the time for a decision is drawing near. In 1999 the European Council itself called on us – we have quoted it – to bring the question of the Members’ Statute to a conclusion as a matter of urgency. We shall probably deal with the matter for good early next year. We are authorised to submit a report for the plenum. I know there are still problems with primary law, but they can be solved and I would be very grateful if the Council would concentrate on this question and send us concrete pointers for a solution. In any case, the Statute must be adopted before enlargement. It will be virtually impossible afterwards.</p>

There is no need for us to have this debate today. My group is in favour of equal conditions for all Members in a Members' Statute but this motion makes it harder and more difficult for us to achieve such a statute.</p>
<p class="contents">If the motion proposed by Mr Barón Crespo and Mr Poettering is adopted, it will block progress in our discussions with the Council. Those two gentlemen gave you a mandate for exploratory discussions with Council and yet their parties now want to force a vote on Mr Rothley's opinion before giving Parliament the chance to consider the outcome of your discussions. Mr Rothley's opinion wants to include in the Members' Statute issues of primary law such as immunities and privileges which require ratification by national parliaments. The message about reform that they are sending to the Council is ‘take it or leave it’. The message that they are sending to MEPs who want reform is ‘forget it’.</p>
<p class="contents">My party's joint resolution with the GUE/NGL and Verts/ALE Groups calls for a common statute, agreed with national governments in the Council, giving equality of treatment to MEPs and transparency in our allowances. Our question to individual members of the PPE-DE and the PSE, many of whom will be laughing all the way to the bank if they stop reform, is this: have you no self-respect? Have you no concern for the reputation of this House?</p>
<p class="contents">I am accused in Mr Rothley's press release of being unserious, of making dishonest accusations. Mr Rothley, I take seriously the accusations of dishonesty made by citizens against us. Mr Barón Crespo accuses me of heaping invective on the socialists. If I am heaping invective on you, Mr Barón Crespo, why are so many of your members, including all of your British members, going to support our motion in the vote tomorrow? The answer is that you heap invective on yourselves and you deserve it. Moreover, you heap invective on those of us who recognise the public concern, who admit that the expenses regime is unjustifiable and who seek to introduce the highest standards into the management of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we abuse the taxpayer at our peril and we demean democratic politics through not reforming. In calling on Members to support the resolution put forward by three groups, I call on them to reject the description of politicians put forward in the words of the poet, Hilaire Belloc, when he wrote:</p>
<p class="contents">‘With pomp and ridiculous display,</p>
<p class="contents">The Politician's corpse was borne away,</p>

It is a major political challenge to resolve this crisis, perhaps the most important political challenge to be tackled in the near future. All our actions must take this objective into consideration. As it happens, the Confederal Group of the European United Left–Nordic Green Left believes it is necessary to ensure total transparency in the conditions governing the exercise of the parliamentary mandate and to dispel any idea of privileges for Members. In my view and in the view of the broad majority of my group, that requires two things: the first is that we need a statute in the very near future, in other words, some time before the June 2004 elections. Therefore, in the proposals that will be negotiated with the Council, we must not include provisions that we already know are unacceptable. Otherwise, we might as well be saying that we do not want a statute.</p>
<p class="contents">The second requirement, in our view, is that the content of the proposals that we put forward must respect the positions of principle that I mentioned earlier – particularly transparency and the rejection of any notion of privilege.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to insult or offend anyone by saying this, Mr President. It is quite simply to explain why my group is opposed – and has already said so – to Parliament sending the document by the Committee on Legal Affairs to the Council in its current form.</p>
<p class="contents">To give just two examples, Article 9 of the document claims to guarantee future Members virtual impunity. This is inexcusable, and the article regarding remuneration calls for a huge rise in allowances for most Members. At a time when the Union is advocating austerity measures to be imposed for employees and calling for public spending to be rationed, this might sound like a provocation. Obviously we find this unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be honest therefore. Those of you who wish to come to a swift agreement with the Council on a Members’ Statute must not, at tomorrow’s vote, approve the report by the Committee on Legal Affairs in its current form as this report would obviously rule out the prospect of reaching an effective agreement on a statute. On the other hand, by voting in favour of the compromise resolution by Parliament’s three ‘pivotal’ groups, you will leave the way clear to seek an agreement that the broad majority of us, of you, say you want. Tomorrow, each of us will have the opportunity to shoulder our responsibilities.</p>

We want a statute to be achieved and all these matters that annoy our citizens so much to be resolved. We cannot approve of a statute that contains possible elements in the form of concealed pay. We want all the money paid to us in the form of salary and expenses to be as transparent as possible and justifiable in the eyes of the public. Neither can we agree to any privileges for ourselves that we cannot extend to our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As my colleague, Mr Lehne, attacked the Chairmen of the three groups here, I might remark that both the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the Party of European Socialists have themselves provided the reason why the three groups have had to form an alliance. The means the two largest groups have employed to prevent you, Mr President, from holding discussions with the Council have been totally unacceptable. On behalf of my own group, I want to thank you for the efforts you have made, and I believe that you have already achieved more with regard to this statute issue than your predecessor did throughout her entire term. In the letter you sent us you have stated that, given certain preconditions, we really do have the chance now to achieve a solution and we must accept that matters regarding Members’ immunity, for example, will have to be resolved in another context.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow everyone can decide which side they are on. If we want a statute we must continue to explore the various possibilities in the way begun by the President, and in this manner we will at last remove this issue from the agenda.</p>

In our view, the reason why the negotiations are stalling is essentially because, in addition to the technical details, the European Parliament is seeking to obtain a purely European statute for its Members with remuneration paid out of the Community budget, whereas this objective runs counter to the spirit and the letter of the Treaties. Articles 189 and 190 clearly stipulate that the Members of this House are representatives of the people who elected them.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, a long time ago, we put forward a proposal which, we continue to believe, could represent a good compromise. It consists of three parts. First of all, MEPs should continue to receive their main salary, exactly as they do now, from the State that elected them and this will be subject to national tax regimes. It would be excessive – and I stress these words – in our view, for a country’s representative to be paid by anyone other than his own country and for him not to have his main salary taxed in the same way as his fellow citizens. Secondly, relocation and other costs should be fully refunded, but within a reasonable limit obviously. Lastly, if necessary, we could, additionally, identify a set allowance paid by the European Parliament for each day of attendance. This would constitute an income – but this time, it would be a clear and transparent income – which could be subject to Community tax. We have thought for a long time that this proposal offers a good compromise between several objectives. It is rational, comprehensible and transparent and lastly, we believe that it enables us to preserve an essential principle which is to establish a statutory and financial connection between all Members and the people who elected them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During the last three years or so, we have talked a lot but realistically we have achieved much less. The key to achieving a satisfactory outcome to this problem must be the attainment of a political agreement between Parliament and the Council on a package of terms and conditions for Members of the European Parliament which are appropriate to the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">These must then be converted into proper legal form in the manner envisaged by the Treaties. We must not allow ourselves to be side-tracked by debates and possible disagreement over the details of the mechanics of how this process of technical transposition is to be put into effect, because if we do that it gets in the way of achieving the necessary political agreement. Of course, that political agreement is the essential pre-condition of the next stage, the completion of the legal and constitutional formalities, and as said by almost every speaker, and there is agreement about this, that has got to be done by the next European elections.</p>

I wonder what the public would make of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely, the top and bottom of all this is that the majority of this House wants a sensible, standard remuneration package, salary, pension, reimbursement of expenses where practical on the basis of receipts and vouchers – the same sort of system that most of our voters are subject to in their workplaces. Of course, some will say we do not do an ordinary job of work. We are special. Yes, indeed we are special, we are public servants. I have sat in this House now for three years through innumerable discussions on this issue and we seem to move no further forward. What do we have on the table today? We have an exercise in subterfuge bogged down in a quagmire of procedure, I would hasten to suggest.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we are talking about a report – a report that was not a report, merely an advice – voted by one committee. On the other hand, we are talking about some feedback from yourself, Mr President, for which we are very grateful. But some people here do not even want to mention that. Confused? I certainly am.</p>
<p class="contents">Members have nothing of substance or detail before of them, nothing that they have the right to amend or that they all have the possibility to properly vote on. So, what are we discussing here? Some of us had hoped that we were at the very least talking about a process that would finally lead to a proper report setting out the detail of a proposed statute that would be clear, transparent and that every Member would have the right to amend and vote on and stand accountable to his or her voters and finally, once and for all, to draw a line under the criticism that we are so easily subject to.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead, we are bogged down in this interminable roundabout of discussion on procedure. But, help is at hand! Let us be clear, there is a very practical paragraph in the joint motion from three parties that would allow a practical process to take off. The very paragraph, of course, that is opposed by majorities within the big groups in this House. That paragraph is tabled individually as an amendment. So, be on notice: if you block that amendment, you block progress, you block this House from getting an open procedure that will lead to a statute and you stop this Parliament becoming worthy of the name of parliament and you will leave our citizens even more bemused and sceptical.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, Mr President, also to check the procedure under which this question has been brought because I really wonder if it is acceptable procedure within our rules. I would not wish people to become any more confused than we already are.</p>

I once presented a youth petition for a referendum for service and justice and against privilege. I have helped to get rules on incompatibility tightened up, worked on new rules for the separation of politics and business, on measures and decrees for greater objectivity in the filling of public sector posts and the setting up of a group of experts for the shaping of a salary structure covering all public functions in my homeland, from the Federal President to the mayors of larger towns.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of service and justice, mandate, profession and privilege runs through my entire political career and is always a question of the credibility of politics with the citizens. For this very reason I have argued for this question to be put to the Council, because since I have been in this House I have always had the feeling that there is no shortage of rumours, of mutual recriminations in Parliament and Council and between the groups, but no statute. The cause of our problem actually lies in the fact that, although we have all been elected to this House, we are not treated equally.</p>
<p class="contents">Part of our problem is that we have 15 national electoral laws and no European electoral law, that we do not have one incompatibility rule but several different ones. That is one problem. We have already discussed this topic in 1998, 1999 and in April 2001. The President has told us that we have now almost reached our destination and we therefore wanted to know from the Council what matters are still outstanding and how we will reach our destination. Today again we get no answer from the Council – because that was no answer. I therefore ask myself how close we are to the destination if we cannot clearly say what the outstanding points are.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I witnessed a press conference this morning at which accusations were raised against everyone who mentions the Rothley report, which is a report from a committee and contains an opinion for the President. I consider such behaviour intolerable and the claims that were made to be untrue, and I ask myself: who is damaging the dignity of this House and the respect in which it is held? Is it those who make reference to a decision by a parliamentary committee or an opinion addressed to the presidency, or those who ignore that decision and want to start a parallel action?</p>
<p class="contents">No national mandate can be compared with the mandate in the European Parliament. The time involved is greater, the distance is greater and we have less time at home than any of our counterparts. We have a decision from the Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market which forms the basis for the President’s talks. We have a group of experts that has come to a conclusion so that no one can say we are arranging things to our own liking.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the Rothley report and we have the legal situation where we adopt our statute and the Council approves it so it can enter into force. With this question we wanted greater transparency instead of rumours, greater clarity instead of recriminations. We wanted the Council’s answer, which sadly was no answer, to bring us a step closer to the decision we need. Nor do we want to be messed about by political opportunists or the Council’s indecision. I say to you, if we do not take ourselves seriously, no one else will. We must therefore resist opportunism and single-mindedly go the way we in this Parliament have decided on the basis of the law. We are of course always ready to split the report into a constitutional part and the remainder if they give us detailed reasons for doing so, but sadly this question went unanswered today as well.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– <span class="italic">(DA) </span>Mr President, I have to describe Mr Karas's speech as meaningless. The question to the Council went: Is the Council, at the level of Heads of State or Government, prepared to enter into a dialogue with the European Parliament about the circumstances for the adoption of the Statute of Members? The answer is yes. I said that quite clearly. Moreover, I repeated what the Council has said all the time, namely that the ball is now in Parliament’s court. Now Parliament has agreed on something there are prospects of the Council’s adopting and approving, I assume that the ball will be passed on to the Council. I shall not go into details concerning the statement by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market to Parliament’s Conference of Presidents. That statement has not of course been sent to the Council, and it has not been adopted by a majority in Parliament. The Council will not submit a detailed proposal. That is an answer for Mr Lehne. The ball is in Parliament’s court.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you of the events of 1999, when the then German Presidency made a great effort to arrive at a compromise. That is something I believe the present rapporteur can remember, so we do not need to repeat it. I agree with those who have said that it is absolutely crucial for a Statute now to be adopted with clear and transparent rules that can increase the dignity accorded to the individual MEP, together with public respect for Parliament. There must be clarity regarding the reimbursement of expenses; there must be an appropriate salary level; and travel expenses must be calculated on the basis of documentation. That is what the Council has emphasised all the time. We must have this Statute in place in good time for the next elections to the European Parliament. In the light of impending enlargement, there will be a greater focus upon these elections than ever before and, if this problem is not solved, it will give rise to very damaging debates, especially in the new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is bad if the electorate treat this Parliament with indifference. There are unfortunately too many people who do just that. This can be seen from the fact that they do not turn up and vote. It will be even worse if, the first time they go to the polls, voters in the new Member States at the same time read about debates on the Members’ Statute on the front pages of their newspapers. In that way, we are in danger of seeing a great many voters treating Parliament not merely with indifference but also with contempt, and that would be the worst thing of all that could happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would pull no punches in now calling for the President of Parliament to be supported in the initiative he has taken and for a package solution now to be arrived at that has prospects of being approved by the Council. The Council has of course given clear signals. It must be possible for these things to be done, Mr President. It lies in your hands and in those of your MEPs.</p>

They are nothing more than environmental criminals who allow leaking tankers to be towed into the high seas.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is the time to put our money where our mouth is and use the European Solidarity Fund to help the Galicians, and also to help the thousands of volunteers who are facing an impossible task. I would also urge everyone to see this apocalyptic scene for themselves, as the reality is much worse than the television footage. Please let this be Europe's last oil disaster.

It is political because neither the Member States, nor the European Union itself, nor this Parliament were able to take appropriate measures at the time to prevent ships such as the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> – and there are hundreds of them – from moving around Community waters. It is political because this Parliament, despite the fact that there have been seven disasters similar to that of the Prestige over the last twenty years off the Galician coast, did not have the courage to lay down legislation similar to the United States’ Oil Pollution Act, so that we could prevent this type of vessel, which are time bombs operated by criminal capitalist mafias, from moving through these waters.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment therefore, Mr President, since there is no European emergency plan to deal with these problems, hundreds and hundreds of Galician vessels are trying – together with the help of many States, whom we thank – to prevent the fuel oil from entering the Galician Rias. In the Arosa Ria, 500 small vessels are trying to resolve, through small-scale methods, a problem which is the responsibility of the Spanish State and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying the following: I believe that the Presidency of this Parliament should go to Galicia and demonstrate human compassion and a desire to resolve the problem which that country, like many others, is suffering from; but especially Galicia, which is suffering this problem more than anywhere else in the world, should be shown the compassion and assistance it deserves. Thank you very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We, in Scotland, recently in the case the <span class="italic">Braer</span> disaster suffered a similar misfortune. But that is not what I wanted to speak about tonight. I would like to mention the currently hot issue about access to the Court of Justice, especially rights of semi-privileged access in the case of regions with legislative powers. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs discussed that last week and it will come before us in a fortnight's time as a hotly controversial point.</p>
<p class="contents">Tonight's debate on fisheries brings up an interesting example which shows what the reality of the issue is. There are big risks for Scottish fisheries of the kind which Mr Nogueira in a different sense has alluded to. It could be that we want to raise an issue about the legality of current proposals under the primary law relating to the accession of Spain and Portugal. That really ought to be something which can be taken up by the legislature and executive which deal with this problem as a matter of European law, then the Scottish Parliament and Executive. Only if we get appropriate rights of access to the courts will that sort of question be answered in the proper place. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many Portuguese citizens have been cooperating in this humanitarian effort and we are also extremely concerned about the fate of the oil slick from the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>which could also reach the northern coasts of Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an enormous disaster and it is to be welcomed that Europe has, for once, learnt its lesson. It seems that the <span class="italic">Erika</span> was not enough but the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>must be enough for this type of thing never to happen again! I therefore wish to express my agreement with the proposal by Mr Nogueira Román, suggesting that Parliament’s President should visit Galicia and, if the Portuguese coasts are affected, he should visit that area too. Above all, he should express the solidarity of this Parliament and add force, on our behalf, to the requests to strengthen European measures in this field, which will probably be discussed at the Copenhagen Summit next week. It is extremely important that Parliament sends this forceful signal and I therefore fully support the words of Mr Nogueira Román. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
