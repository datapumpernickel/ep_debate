Not only are they part of the genetic code of the European Union, but they are also laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the institutions, surely Parliament is the one that is most committed to defending rights and fundamental freedoms and has a total and permanent commitment to the cause of human rights, which must not just apply to one region, country or continent, but which must be of a global or universal nature. Parliament has therefore given a Vice-President the responsibility for monitoring human rights; it has a body, which is the Subcommittee on Human Rights, as part of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET); it has created a new working group on democracy and electoral observation and there is always a section in its order of business dedicated to resolutions to defend human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, Parliament has distinguished itself by awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, which, as you know, was founded by a person who left a legacy promoting peace, respect, tolerance and peoples living together peacefully.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, in this context, I am delighted to present this report which, in the form of recommendations, discusses the appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights, and I would like to thank members of my political group for the prior work they have done and also thank the other political groups for their work and support.</p>
<p class="contents">An important aspect, Baroness Ashton, is the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The representative must work to strengthen democracy and the rule of law, international justice and humanitarian law; to promote the abolition of the death penalty; and in all areas aimed at defending the causes of human rights’ defenders, fighting torture and impunity, defending women’s rights, child protection and the rights of minors, peace and security and, of course, the rejection of all forms of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Special Representative must work very directly with Parliament and other international bodies, and must work in a context of visibility, flexibility and coherence with the historical aspects that I mentioned at the start of my speech, Madam President. The representative must be a person of broad experience, proven ability, international prestige and, of course, sufficient professional experience in the field of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, Madam President, Baroness Ashton, Parliament does not seek to hijack the decision-making process for appointing this person, as it is up to the High Representative to make the proposal to the Council. However, in this context, I would like to highlight the particular importance of this appointment and the desire that, based on the trust and the mandate represented by the resolution that Parliament is going to adopt, you make the right appointment. This person is going to have a huge profile in defending this cause which, as I said, Parliament sees as a total and permanent commitment to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Catherine Ashton, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. </span>– Madam President, first of all, can I say that I agree with Mr Salafranca that this is in our DNA, and I am really pleased to have the opportunity to speak again in this House on the subject of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members know, this is one of my top priorities, and I really value the opportunities to continue our discussions. May I also formally thank Mr Salafranca for the work he has done on his report.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation that is before this House today is a welcome contribution to the preparations for the appointment of a Special Representative on Human Rights. I give absolute credit to Parliament for championing this idea since its report in 2010. We have now reached the point where it commands a broad consensus across the political spectrum. I congratulate Mr Salafranca for delivering such an overwhelming vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET).</p>
<p class="contents">The broad consensus is the result of broad consultation. Over the past few months, my services have been canvassing opinions from this House, from Member States, Commission services and from NGOs, and that has helped to ensure that the thinking of this House is reflected in the draft mandate which I presented to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, the mandate will be broad and flexible. I want the new Special Representative to work with me to set priorities, to be able to develop the themes that Mr Salafranca has so ably put before us: abolition of the death penalty, combating the use of torture, women’s rights, children’s rights, and to ensure that they are able to do that in the context of working collaboratively with the institutions of the European Union and, of course, to work closely with the European External Action Service.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandate will be longer than usual: two years instead of one. It is the first time ever that the European Union will have appointed a thematic EU Special Representative, so I believe it is important that the mandate should be long enough to start delivering on issues that are inherently long-term issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Special Representative will have significant experience and expertise. I am looking for somebody with an established track record, real experience in human rights and a strong understanding of European Union policy. Member States have put forward some excellent candidates, and I look forward to making a swift appointment.</p>
<p class="contents">I do want to be clear that the Special Representative will be an important interlocutor for this Parliament. You have my full commitment that he or she will be able to brief Parliament regularly, fitting in line with existing arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Special Representative will also add considerable value to our existing work, and that may take the form of leading our human rights dialogues and consultations, where it is obvious that the Special Representative should be a natural interlocutor for our partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Communications and public diplomacy will be key. They need to help us to be more visible and to promote human rights across the whole range of the European Union’s external policies. But just to be absolutely clear, I will remain personally as involved as ever, but with now, in the future, additional, high-level, expert support to work with me and with the team based in Brussels – some of whom are with us today, and to whom I pay tribute for the extraordinary work done over these last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The Special Representative is part of the bigger package because, as you know, the Council is due to adopt a strategic framework and an action plan on human rights and democracy too. Preparation for this has taken account of input from Members of this House in line with my undertaking to engage this House throughout the process.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest of these exchanges took place today, just before this debate began, when my Deputy Secretary-General, Maciej Popowski, met with the contact group in Parliament, under the chairmanship of Ms Lochbihler. I hope that these contacts will continue and become a regular feature of our interinstitutional discussions on a more effective and comprehensive approach to human rights and democracy. I have always intended this process to be inclusive and to give the opportunity for all stakeholders in EU policy to contribute to defining our future priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I end as I began, with a thank you to Mr Salafranca for his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Continuing this point of view, I should actually mention that Lady Ashton started her mandate by stating that human rights would be the ‘silver thread’ running through foreign policy. At the moment, however, the actions being taken by the EU to promote human rights externally are rather disparate, and criticism has been levelled in this Parliament on more than one occasion at the lack of coherence in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of appointing an EU Special Representative for Human Rights is to reinforce the coherence of EU actions in this area, and we obviously must welcome such an innovation. On the other hand, as long as we deal with human rights as a separate area covered by so-called human right dialogues and not at summit meetings between political leaders, I am afraid that our credibility will continue to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">The Arab Spring reminded us that human rights are universal, highlighting that every individual would like their fundamental rights and liberties to be respected. This is why I think that, for the mandate of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to be a success, apart from having the institutional framework, we need the main European and national actors to show political will in guiding their actions according to the solemn declarations made in the Treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why we are delighted that the appointment of such a representative is imminent. We look forward to frequent exchanges with the appointee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our hope that such a position will help to ensure that human rights feature even more prominently in our external action, and will help further consolidate our credibility in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU Special Representative (SR) will have to find his or her place in a complex institutional setting. Moreover, the challenges in the field of human rights are many and varied, so the appointee will have to hit the ground running.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the plethora of competing issues, I hope that the case of Tibet will feature prominently among the priority issues to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in anticipation of this afternoon’s debate, I must emphasise that the human rights situation in Tibet deserves particular attention. Freedom of conscience and belief is very close to my group’s heart. We therefore hope that the EU SR will pay particular attention to the plight and self-immolations of the monks who are subject to the restrictive policies of the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We are worried about the lack of progress and, indeed, worsening repression, and believe that we will perhaps eventually have to consider the appointment of a specific EU SR on Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">From an institutional perspective, the recommendation that there should be an EU Special Representative on Human Rights is obviously only one part of the ongoing review of the EU’s overall human rights strategy, where we are mobilising our potential and political will and increasing interinstitutional preparations to become even more effective on the world stage.</p>
<p class="contents">MEPs from a wide spectrum of political groups desire to work towards some form of joint interinstitutional document, an ambitious and united declaration, much like the European consensus on development, which defines the framework of common principles within which the EU and its Member States implement their development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to strive towards a European consensus on human rights which will set out our common vision on the promotion of human rights in the world, with concrete steps on how to achieve our goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Only as ethical partners in the field of human rights will we ever be truly effective as a Union. I look forward to working with the different institutions on this in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have now reached the home stretch of this marathon and there are just two key things missing in order for us to be sure that everything will go according to plan once we have appointed the Special Representative. We have to appoint a person who will be suitable for the initial period; who will be able to live up to the role of Special Representative in this initial period. Clearly, the person appointed – as our rapporteur, Mr Salafranca, said – will have to work and cooperate with Parliament. We also have to finalise their mandate. It is therefore very important, as we all know and as we all agree, to ensure that this person will not create a human rights ghetto, but rather that they will turn EU policy, trade agreements, the Member States’ bilateral relations and multilateral relations with international authorities into expressions of human rights; we agree on that.</p>
<p class="contents">In the home stretch of this marathon towards the appointment of our Special Representative, I will focus on the areas where I think we still need to reach agreement. I cannot understand why the mandate of the Special Representative, who is the Special Representative of the European Union, still does not include a strict obligation of accountability to Parliament and I would like a clear answer – yes or no – before the mandate is finalised. They cannot be a representative of the European Union without being accountable to the Parliament of that same European Union and that is crucial: they will be accountable to the other institutions but not to Parliament. It is crucial. We want to see the Special Representative here in Strasbourg during human rights emergencies and we want to see them – this is my final question – in the Working Group on Human Rights. The second question is whether it will be possible to formalise this group and get something in writing to that effect. My thanks, Lady Ashton, for expressing your support for the existence of this working group. Now we need something in writing to that effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome, and strongly and warmly support, the moves that the Vice-President/High Representative has made towards appointing an EU Special Representative for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure the High Representative said today, and as she has said on other occasions, this is the first ever thematic Special Representative to be appointed in connection with Europe’s common foreign and security policy. So when we say that we take human rights seriously and regard it as a priority, this is a very concrete instance of doing what we say. It also represents a strengthening of the commitment to human rights compared to the excellent work of Ms Riina Kionka, Mr Solana’s former Personal Representative for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Special Representative will deal on behalf of the High Representative with the Council, the Commission and – I am sure we will make adequate arrangements for this – with Parliament itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I do want to repeat today in the debate, as we said in the resolution and in previous debates, that I would like this post to be a very high-level, visible representation of the High Representative and of the European Union, with a representative who is able to be a big player for Europe with third country governments, in the UN Human Rights Council and in discussions involving the International Criminal Court. I see this as an extremely important means of giving us much greater strength and ‘clout’ in delivering messages on human rights than we have had in the past. I see the Special Representative’s role as something that, for Europe and the European Union, will be akin to the work undertaken by the Under-Secretary for Human Rights in the United States Department of State.</p>
<p class="contents">I see this appointment as a very important opportunity to achieve that aim. If I may repeat today what I have already said in private to the High Representative: I want this to be not just another political appointment, but the appointment of someone who is eminent in their credentials on human rights and human rights law. I do not think we as a Parliament should intervene in the process of selecting candidates; I think that should be left to the High Representative, and the High Representative alone. I would, however, like someone who has a serious and unparalleled record of working in human rights and human rights law, with high-level legal qualifications in human rights, to be appointed to this post. I invite the High Representative to give that the highest priority when she makes the appointment.</p>

In our political cooperation with many countries, we often come up against problems involving breaches of these rights and this appears in various different guises. The situation takes on a special significance in relations with our nearest neighbours, which are frequently countries with European aspirations. Our overriding objective should be to move in the direction of ensuring civil rights in countries that have direct links with the European Union. A leading example of this is Belarus, which, for many years, has been governed by an authoritarian regime that brutally suppresses political opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">We also see treatment of citizens that is contrary to international norms and standards in many other post-Soviet countries. Generally, these are the remains of a bygone era. There are also examples of abuses of power by democratically elected authorities. It is the responsibility of European diplomacy to act efficiently and effectively to improve political standards in countries where there is a common sphere of interest. The appointment of a special representative may simplify this work. However, such a person must work closely with the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and under the control of the European Parliament. This is an important condition in order to ensure a cohesive foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that human rights must be promoted throughout the world in a way that respects the right to live in a traditional family and protects the values in which people believe. It is equally important to combat instances of violence against women and girls and this also applies in situations where such violence is carried out on the basis of mistaken religious beliefs preached by certain faiths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We know that what the EU calls human rights has the consequence that we in the UK cannot protect ourselves from Abu Qatada and his kind. Abu Qatada’s so-called human rights are sacrosanct. In the meantime, you could not care less when it comes to the victims of the European Arrest Warrant. I would cite the case of Andrew Symeou, who, at 18, was held in Greece by means of the European Arrest Warrant for almost three years, 11 months of which were in the notorious Korydallos prison. After the three years, he was let go. It had been a case of mistaken identity all along.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Arrest Warrant has caused the surrender of over 700 UK citizens or residents to harsh and alien legal systems in continental Europe. We are all at risk. I would suggest, calmly and politely – although this is a subject that makes me angry – that on human rights, you get your own house in order before posturing elsewhere.

The most important is his accountability to the European Parliament. A second important point is his freedom of action or, even more, the freedom he will acquire during the performance of his duties. The European Union can, and must, highlight human rights as a question of crucial importance to the future of mankind. However, in order to achieve that, I must emphasise that we need to be firmly convinced that political expediencies will have no voice or place in the representative’s activities in connection with the vital issue of human rights. Other important points are who will undertake this job, how accountable he will be towards those who appoint him, how accountable he will be, as I said earlier, to the European Parliament and the degree to which he understands that human rights must be respected everywhere in the world and in the European Union itself. I should like to close by saying that I wonder if the representative in question will be entitled or obliged to look at the blatant violation of human rights in Member States of the European Union by countries seeking to join the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I used the words ‘does my colleague agree with me’, that usually begins a question. Now for my speech.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1776, Thomas Jefferson institutionalised the concept of human rights in the US Declaration of Independence, and today’s US Ambassadors around the world have the responsibility for projecting that concept wherever they may be. In my country, Great Britain, human rights matters come under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice, but these models are apparently not good enough for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur calls for a Special Representative for this policy area, complete with his or her budget lines and dedicated staff. It is not, of course, within the realm of possibility that the existing EU overseas delegations could shoulder this responsibility. Might that eat into their four-day weeks and prolonged holiday entitlements? There are incidentally 119 such delegations. Surely, at a time of EU-enforced austerity, in situ apparatus should be used, rather than creating new, expensive departments.</p>
<p class="contents">One aspect of the report I do agree with is that if a Special Representative for Human Rights should be appointed, they should have the necessary professional qualifications, extensive experience and a proven track record in the field of human rights, as well as personal and professional integrity and an international reputation.</p>
<p class="contents">The High Representative may feel a little embarrassed at this valid point as these criteria were clearly overlooked in her appointment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this report and this discussion, Parliament has a chance to contribute to shaping the position of the Special Representative for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights issues have been among the key issues in Parliament for a long time. Therefore, in this report, we are addressing several recommendations to the Council. I truly hope that they deserve the support of Baroness Ashton as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Most importantly, the new Special Representative should have an independent and flexible mandate, allowing him or her to act swiftly and effectively. This should contribute to the enhanced visibility and effectiveness of the EU when it comes to the EU’s human rights policy. The EU’s Special Representative will also need to ensure coherence and mainstreaming of human rights issues across various policy areas. The Special Representative for Human Rights should be a high-level interlocutor for his or her counterparts in third countries and at international organisations. He or she should be able to represent the EU in multilateral fora and engage with the UN as well as with relevant regional organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to stress that Parliament will be keen to play its role in the appointment procedure, especially with regard to the hearing of the candidates, as well as overseeing the mandate during its entire term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Howitt report which was recently adopted, we emphasised that the Union’s policy as regards the protection and promotion of human rights must be not just consistent, but exemplary.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of an EU Special Representative for Human Rights will strengthen democracy, the rule of law, freedom and the situation of those who defend human rights. The scope of the representative’s responsibilities should mirror the Union’s human rights policy. Of particular importance are issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, stopping the use of torture, combating violence against women and children as well as all forms of discrimination, including discrimination against disabled or LGBT persons, protection of freedom of speech – which includes the Internet – freedom of religion and beliefs, and conducting a dialogue on human rights with third countries. In connection with the increasing importance of respect for human rights in business, I support the amendment that extends the mandate of the Special Representative to include the provision of support to the High Representative and to EU institutions in disseminating UN guidelines concerning business and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Special Representative should work with the UN, with the Council’s Human Rights Working Group, with non-governmental and regional organisations, with representatives of every level of civil society and with experts. They must have a strong, independent and flexible mandate, and obviously appropriate funding, in order to be able to carry out their duties properly. Much will depend on the person themselves, their qualifications, experience and the trust they have gained in the international arena. The person that takes this position should be a specialist in international humanitarian law and international judicial procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will not be an easy job, either bilaterally or multilaterally, to assume a position here and to rebuff the attempts, for example, to wear down and erode the universality of human rights and produce a strong and proactive human rights policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We have before us an excellent recommendation from the rapporteur, in which the many duties of the special representative are outlined, including that of making better human rights policy within the institutions of the European Union. I can assure you that we in the Subcommittee on Human Rights will assist and support this work to the best of our ability.</p>
<p class="contents">The mandate proposed envisages enabling the Special Representative for Human Rights to brief the European Parliament. I would like to see this more clearly worded, so that the Special Representative would regularly keep Parliament informed and be available for discussion. That is a very important concern for me and my colleagues in the House.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Baroness Ashton, I wish you good luck in selecting the EU Special Representative for Human Rights.

In many countries, this freedom is rapidly disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">In Indonesia, the government is doing little against radical Muslims who are terrorising the Christians and Ahmadis. In Northern Nigeria, the Boko Haram terrorist group throws a bomb into a church almost every week. Unfortunately, we could name countless other examples, which is why we urgently need to pay attention to religious freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The Special Representative has also laid down obligations alongside those opportunities. I am thinking of human rights, of them being taken seriously in Europe’s relationships with other countries. That should be specifically reflected in our trade agreements. In India, 40 million people are trapped in a life of slavery. We cannot therefore have a trade agreement between Europe and India without a strong and effective human rights chapter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also the result of interinstitutional activities such as, for example, the debate of December 2011 on an effective approach by the entire Union to human rights and democracy. This was the outcome of our reflections on what happened following the Arab Spring.</p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights should, above all, increase the effectiveness and consistency of European Union policy in the area of human rights, as we know that such consistency is often lacking, while ensuring an appropriate role for Parliament in the procedure for appointing the representative and in supervising the mandate that the Special Representative will have. The Special Representative should also chair high-level meetings on human rights and be a partner to third countries and international organisations functioning both on a regional and global level. The future European Union representative should be a person who commands a great deal of authority in the area of human rights among organisations and institutions working in this field. It should be a person who is recognised both in Europe and throughout the world, as only a person of this calibre will be able to ensure that human rights are given their due worth in the Union’s relations with our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that this is the first time that the European Union will be appointing a topic-specific representative, it is truly symbolic that it should be for this particular topic. In this area, it is not just about functionality; it is also about the signal sent out to the outside world, and this is sending a positive signal.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to functionality, clearly we do also have to discuss what the Special Representative is able, allowed, supposed or in a position to do. It is important that the mandate should be given the broadest possible form, that it is not constricted, that it is not just about issues that would occur to anyone in respect of human rights matters, but that the Special Representative should have the freedom to really decide what subjects he or she wants to concentrate on. I also approve of the fact that the mandate is relatively long, although I believe that it could be linked to the half-way point of the European election cycle, with two and a half years being a reasonable period, allowing the Special Representative a longer spell in which to dedicate himself/herself to human rights matters. The Special Representative also needs to be adequately equipped and have sufficient staff and I would like to see all that taken care of.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to me that there should be an obligation to report to the European Parliament. The word obligation here is the right word, as we obviously have to monitor what is happening and what is taking place. I also consider it particularly important – and I have now reached the end of my speech – that the Special Representative should also not just be concerned with broad topics, but that also, for example, there could be monitoring of what European companies sometimes do outside of the European Union – for instance, in relation to human and social rights. That is also a subject that would be very interesting.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have something I would like to say to Mr Dartmouth, but he has chosen to leave. I will therefore choose to end my speech now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, I shall vote in favour of this report. There are, of course, certain things in it that I find worrying: the concept of sexual freedom has been confused with freedom from torture, with being free, with freedom of assembly, which is what I understand as human rights. However, despite these doubts and despite certain concerns regarding the funding of this office, I believe that everyone should support this report because the establishment of such a special office for matters relating to human rights is an important issue and worthy of support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Respect for human rights must be reflected in all European Union policy fields. In this very sensitive area, in particular, it is indispensable that both the EU institutions and the Member States should speak with one voice and put forward a responsible and coherent course of action.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, we have, for a long time, advocated an EU Special Representative for Human Rights. The Special Representative should not be bound into tightly defined subject areas but should pursue a comprehensive approach to promoting human rights, democratic efforts and the structures appropriate for states under the rule of law. This comprehensive approach must also be discernible in the way the Special Representative for Human Rights collaborates with other actors. The success of the office will depend, to a critical degree, on cooperation with political leaders, but also, in particular, with the representatives of local, regional and national civil society and with regional and international organisations. Only with the intensive involvement of local and regional actors will it be possible for us, jointly, to durably improve the human rights picture in this world of ours.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must live up to the role envisaged for it in appointing the supervision for the special rapporteur's mandate. I therefore expect the Special Representative for Human Rights to regularly report to us on his/her activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Special Representative should have political experience, credentials in the field of international humanitarian or human rights law or of international justice, and should be capable of acting as an intelligent and strategic advocate of human rights, democracy and the rule of law the world over. He or she should speak on behalf of the European Union and be directly accountable to this Parliament wherever necessary, and should ensure, in coordination with the High Representative and the Member States, that guidelines, toolkits and action plans in this area are actually put into practice. He or she should be someone unafraid of speaking up and of loudly condemning human rights violations in any state, including those with which the European Union has privileged relations, thereby genuinely establishing an honest, transparent and strategic dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot continue concluding agreements and offering financial support, consequence-free and with impunity, to regimes that systematically display contempt for the fundamental rights of their peoples. Our security, trade and development, and energy policies must ensure concrete results and democratic reforms in third countries and, to that end, our external action must prioritise investment in capacity building for civil society. This means that we should work alongside civil society in each country in order to develop the human rights strategy for that country, and the specific priorities and goals of these strategies should be made public.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Council and the Member States will commit to ensuring full cooperation with the Special Representative and will facilitate the task of coordinating the voices confronting him or her. I am sure that you will make the right choice, High Representative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree here in Parliament that the creation of this post in the EU has long been overdue. Parliament has been urging it for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that in the current draft of the Council conclusions, the originally proposed one-year period has been replaced by two years; this was, after all, one of the main points of our European report: the extension of the duration of the mandate. It takes time for the work of a new representative to produce noticeable international effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, when creating this new human rights post, it is essential to define an appropriate, flexible and effective mandate, and to provide all the means necessary to allow for its implementation, as well as to ensure that there is an opportunity for the person holding the post of representative to respond to Parliament’s questions over the course of his or her mandate. The adoption of this human rights package by the Council will represent another step towards the creation of an EU human rights strategy, which I hope will promote effectiveness in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Similarly, it must be possible to extend the Special Representative’s term of office, if he proves to be up to the job.

Right from the start, the European Parliament was in favour of taking advantage of this possibility. We have called, on many occasions, for the appointment of a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights, for example, in Parliament’s 2009 and 2010 resolutions on the annual reports on human rights in the world and the European Union’s policy on the matter. For this reason, we give our unequivocal support today to the recommendation to the Council drafted by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on a European Union Special Representative for Human Rights and we do this wholeheartedly, as this has long been Parliament’s position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Purely as an aside, I would be so bold as to say that it would be good if every individual country had a special minister with the title of Minister for Human Rights and Freedoms. We must nevertheless acknowledge that we have sometimes prioritised stability over human rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to acknowledge that, whenever we have talked about democratisation, we have been eager to talk about multiparty systems instead of bringing up respect for human rights and freedoms in particular. There is no doubt, I am sure, that this representative will have a huge amount of work to do and will really have to tussle with one country or another. However, let us hope that this representative will truly be able to change the lives of some individuals, even if it might be difficult to tackle huge countries like China and India, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, this is ultimately what we mean when we talk about human rights and freedoms: the rights, respect and dignity of each individual. I am convinced that a great deal more can be done, and if there is something that this Chamber ought to be known for, it is precisely the fact that political decisions should be based on human rights and freedoms in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The appointment of a special representative is the logical continuation, on the one hand, of one of the legal pillars of our institutions, notably Articles 21 and 33 of the Treaty, and, on the other hand, of the significant progress represented by the EU’s accession to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">If it adopts this report, the European Parliament will also be taking the opportunity to monitor the activities of the Special Representative and, thus, part of the EU’s new external policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the roles played by the Union and by Parliament will also be strengthened as a result. However, the importance of this position is not so much the creation of the post itself, which must be held by someone honest, qualified, dynamic and determined, but the political message it will send to all third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This message covers several levels. On the one hand, the EU’s international commitment to promoting human rights and democracy will be strengthened and consolidated. The shared responsibility of the EU and the Member States to protect and promote these rights will become stronger because it will be embodied by the Special Representative. The common security policy and the common external policy will become more coherent, effective and visible. Finally, the Union’s role as an advocate of human rights will be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to stress that this post must not be a mere honorary position or the umpteenth empty shell, but a powerful mandate to move towards a freer world in which the dignity of all human beings is respected and in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can be no doubt that choosing a Special Representative for Human Rights is an extremely valuable thing to do. My congratulations of course go to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra on the outstanding work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity, accountability and cooperation: the Member States that put these qualities into practice need to be consistently supported, and we also need to impose conditions favouring those third countries that show particular interest in, and pay attention to, the protection of fundamental rights. That is with regard to trade relations.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of immigration, we still have a number of unresolved issues concerning the protection of fundamental rights for people who flee their native countries because they can see their interests and needs being trampled on there. We need to treat these people with great respect as well. It is a question of natural rights, rights that are inherent to the individual and closely linked to the growth of his or her personality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must therefore ensure that this role is fulfilled as effectively as possible. The person who is chosen must have two qualities: charisma and courage, and must believe wholeheartedly in the job he or she is appointed to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The means at our disposal to date – political dialogue and trade agreements with human rights clauses – have proven to be inadequate. I therefore welcome the initiative to appoint a Special Representative for Human Rights and I support Parliament’s recommendation to the Council. I think that it will give our policy visibility and cohesiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The Special Representative for Human Rights must be able to acquire independence of action and the facility to cooperate smoothly with the competent services, civil society and other international and regional organisations. At the same time, he or she must be able to analyse the situation on the ground in the different countries, as reports of the real circumstances often do not reach us here in Parliament. That is why I believe that the right selection will be made. We understand the importance of protection for human rights in the Arab States to good relations and peace in the world. They are suffering, en route to democracy, from a lack of protection for human rights; the persecution of Christians is a typical example. I therefore believe that the time has come for us to give a cohesive and effective response and the appointment of this new institutional person is a step in that direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is precisely why the future representative for human rights will have to have a robust mandate, be a key spokesperson for NGOs and minorities, cooperate with the United Nations and have consultations with third countries regarding human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, there are too many subject areas here for a single individual to focus on. The Special Representative must concentrate on his/her core responsibilities. Just those in human rights-recalcitrant Turkey could actually merit a special representative of their own: Sharia, the oppression of minorities in the country, the lack of religious freedom, right down to torture. According to Amnesty International, there is also no progress to be detected over the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Baroness Ashton, if you really want to achieve something, it would be a more sensible idea to concentrate on the core areas rather than attempting to be master of all trades and losing yourself in a great many details or trying to score points through pseudo action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few months ago, the Commissioner for Home Affairs was advocating the criminal prosecution of the Dutch Freedom Party because of the content on its party website.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Member States prosecute and imprison people for publishing heretical opinions in speech, written word or in electronic form. The freedom to express oneself is important, but not as important as the freedom to hear or read what has been said or written by others. The British Government is currently proposing a law – the Communications Data Bill – which will provide the security services with access to all of the Internet sites visited by everyone in the United Kingdom. If somebody in a sensitive government job were, just out of curiosity, to log onto a website disapproved of by a party, that person’s job would be at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom of association is mentioned in the report, but there have been bans or attempted bans on parties in Belgium and Germany. In the EU, human rights are for export only.

<p class="contents">May I refer those who have looked into internal issues to Mr Salafranca’s report to the mandate of the Special Representative, and indeed to the mandate that I hold, which is an external mandate. I do try, wherever possible, to answer all the questions that honourable Members put forward and to follow up in writing those that I have not managed to address in the course of what is always a short winding-up speech.</p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely conscious that, in the course of this debate, many attributes have been suggested for this paragon of virtue – the candidate who will become the Special Representative. I agree with a great deal of what has been said. We are indeed looking for someone who is dynamic, bold, courageous, and willing to engage across the world and to fulfil this valuable and important representative role properly on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree, too, that the Special Representative will have to deal with many issues which need to be handled with sensitivity and real understanding. I very much hope that we will be able to find, among the candidates who have been put forward by Member States – none of whom I have yet seen – the best possible fit, in order to really and truly build on what has been said here.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made it clear, too, that the Special Representative will have a relationship with this Parliament. That is set out not only in the Treaty but in the political declaration that has been made, and it will be an important point. As so many honourable Members have said, this is the first thematic Special Representative, and so it will be important to find ways to engage properly. That will, I am sure, be an ongoing debate. It is important that we are able to review developments and respond to Parliament on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just add that the Special Representative will, of course, build on the work that is going on across the world. I want to pay tribute to the many men and women of the European Union in delegations across the world, some of whom work in the most difficult conditions, and to thank them for putting this issue at the heart of the work that they do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Beyond the terms of the mandate, on which we have spoken extensively during this debate, and which, in my opinion, should also be applied to the interpretation of the democratic clause that we have with some third countries, there remains the question of the personal profile of the candidate.</p>
<p class="contents">I was personally very pleased by the speech made by Mr Mitchell regarding the profile that this person should have, which brings to mind the anecdote sometimes told about when, in fourth century Athens, after the age of Pericles, Aristotle was walking with his pupils of the Peripatetic School and one of them made an observation that displeased his teacher. When Aristotle answered, the pupil said to him, ‘that is not my observation, but that of your teacher Plato’. Aristotle’s response has been repeated numerous times on the European stage from the fourth century BC to the present day and our technological and Internet era: ‘Plato is dear to me, but dearer still is the truth’. I believe that the Special Representative must be an integral part of the institutional structure of the European Union, report to the High Representative, have a link to Parliament and the Member States, but that what must be more dear to him or her must be the cause of defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, so that human rights and fundamental freedoms, as Parliament wishes, can take hold in the 21st century across the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Why are differing positions on completely equal circumstances deemed to be normal for the European Parliament? I am more and more surprised and astonished by the cynicism and farce peculiar to the European Parliament. On the one hand, we insist on rules of law, firmness of legislation and European values. But, if the matter concerns, for example, Ukraine, then all principles become only sticks. This gives the impression that nobody needs the truth. An outburst of emotions is needed and beautiful words, so it comes out that in India, everything is all right, in China, everything is all right, in Saudi Arabia all is right as well, but in Ukraine, everything is terrible. But it is just cowardice and humiliation to throw up cards in front of the strong and not be ceremonious towards neighbours if they are different! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
