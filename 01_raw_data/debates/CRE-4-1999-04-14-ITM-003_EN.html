I think that we have had many opportunities in the House to discuss, comment on and vote on texts concerning issues such as the Committee of Independent Experts and the Commission"s resignation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, tabling an amendment at the last minute, whether on the Berlin European Council, agricultural prices or any other subject, discredits our institution; it does not reflect well on us and I feel it is an unjustified attitude that was badly thought out and was not called for. I repeat: I voted against the resolution, and I am proud of it. The Commission has resigned and we have given a political judgement on the issue, at all levels. I think that the approach that I have condemned is damaging to the image that Parliament had projected in the last few months.</p>

<p class="contents">Let us take the case of agricultural policy: Commissioner Fischler described the measures that were adopted as the most radical reform in the entire history of the CAP, one that is so major that it surpasses the in‐depth changes that took place in 1992. This radical reform, that is to say integration into the global market and the reduction of farmer"s incomes, is in reality a collection of specific technical measures, and for someone who is not an expert it is difficult to grasp its general thrust.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that this lack of clarity is all the more serious given the fact that the decisions that were taken are going to be used in order to determine many subsequent policy guidelines. For example, the Council mentions in its conclusions that – and I quote – ’the decisions adopted regarding the reform of the CAP within the framework of Agenda 2000 will constitute essential elements in defining the Commission"s negotiating mandate for the future multilateral trade negotiations at the WTO."</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, without realising it, we seem to have already decided on the European Union"s negotiating position for future international negotiations. This procedure, which is certainly the norm in Brussels, is quite unbelievable compared with the usual methods adopted by democratic countries, to the extent that – and I would like to highlight this point – national parliaments have so far not been invited to ratify these agreements at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The irony of history seems even greater when we know that a short time before the Berlin European Council, a public hearing organised by this House had concluded that there was a lack of debate and democratic control with regard to multilateral trade negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is exactly the situation that the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations has been condemning for a long time, and which led to disastrous results at the Uruguay Round. It is essential that the same method is not used again in the future. This is why we demand that the Berlin conclusions should be rejected on this point, and that the Council"s and the Commission"s mandate for the next WTO negotiations should be the subject of an in‐depth public debate and a formal vote in the national parliaments.</p>

When Mr Martens said yesterday that the resignation of Edith Cresson alone would have solved the crisis, I think he was evidently campaigning.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is making a legal mistake by adopting the amendment on the Berlin European Council resolution. We have accepted something which is absurd. The Commission has resigned, collectively, because it is collectively responsible. Politically, however, this is significant. Mr Martens prefers not to see what is happening or to read the report from the Committee of Independent Experts, according to which there was clearly collective responsibility for the errors that were made.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we ourselves have demonstrated the maturity of this Parliament and helped bring the truth to light, and that we have enabled the Commission to regain its credibility and allowed democracy to progress.

<p class="contents">What a contradiction on the part of Parliament, which, once again, is openly surrendering before even giving battle. I remember those people who asked for the immediate replacement of the Commission that had resigned. These are the same people who are now satisfied with a Commission that would be put in place from January 2000, and on whose appointment the European Parliament may be consulted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same sitting, we voted for Amendment No 2, which is disgraceful and was tabled at the last minute by the PPE Group and the ELDR Group, objecting to Mrs Cresson retaining her post and declaring that we will not cooperate with her as long as she remains in office. Meanwhile, we rejected Amendments Nos 16 and 17, which demanded that the Commission be replaced and asked that the Commissioners should not be candidates at the European elections. Parliament did not take anything that was said in the report from the Committee of Independent Experts to implicate the Commission as a collegiate body.</p>

We therefore voted against paragraph 4 of the resolution. We would rather see deregulation of the labour market and lower taxes on labour; not more of the kind of active labour market policy that has failed to deliver results in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">There is certainly no reason to centralise an expanded Swedish‐style approach at supranational level. Circumstances vary from one Member State to another and, where there is a desire for a labour market policy approach, individual countries should ideally decide for themselves. Another reason for voting against paragraph 4 was that it violates the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be seen to be exercising major restraint on the expenditure front; it is therefore to be welcomed that the agreements reached in the Council of Ministers are based on prudential management of taxpayers" money. Any additional resources that can be then be released should be mobilised to facilitate the EU"s eastward enlargement. New growth markets are developing in the applicant countries; these will create new and worthwhile job opportunities for the Union"s current members. Fostering such markets will contribute much more to the employment situation than could ever be achieved through an active labour market policy.</p>

This initiative has proved to be a useful weapon in tackling urban deprivation. The retention of LEADER for promoting rural development should be counterbalanced by the retention of URBAN.</p>
<p class="contents">The retention of URBAN would be especially important for cities like my own – Dublin – which is likely to see a considerable reduction in the Structural Funds available because of its loss of Objective 1 status.</p>
<p class="contents">I had been campaigning for retention of URBAN as it could provide the basic funding for my proposal that there be a fund specifically ringfenced for the development of deprived urban areas. These areas are both absolutely and relatively disadvantaged as they are side by side with areas of considerable affluence.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that tonight's conciliation results in URBAN being reinstated. I want to ensure that the general Structural Funds are used to a significant extent to address the problem of urban deprivation. I would ask that the rules governing ESF and ERDF be changed in order to direct more of these funds to areas of acute deprivation and I would also ask that the regional aid guidelines be amended to allow for state aids to be paid at a higher rate to those urban areas which are suffering acute disadvantages.</p>

<p class="contents">The result achieved in Berlin with regard to the structural funds has demonstrated the importance that the European Council has attached to both the continuation and reform of economic and social assistance within the Union. Most welcome is the 300 million euros in funding guaranteed for use within the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The Highlands and Islands have made good use of the funds provided under the existing Objective 1 programme but continue to be disadvantaged by peripheral and sparsity of population. The continuation of funding will help the region overcome these disadvantages.</p>

It will not help to improve economic and social cohesion. It is going to result in a particularly damaging breakdown in regional policy, notably to the detriment of several rural areas of France.</p>
<p class="contents">The only cause for satisfaction is fisheries. Thanks to our intervention as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries, we were able to obtain the resources to fund structural measures for fisheries (restructuring the fleets, and so on) in regions located outside the scope of Objective 1, whether or not the beneficiaries belong to regions eligible for Objective 2. In total, 0.39 % of the structural budget, that is ECU 875 million, is reserved for the FIFG. Such a political outcome was not a foregone conclusion, as the Commission was so resolutely hostile to it at the start.</p>
<p class="contents">We are by no means as satisfied with regard to regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sector, the Berlin European Council further increased funding: ECU 195 billion for structural policy, ECU 18 billion for the Cohesion Fund and ECU 49 billion for the pre‐accession instruments. The Objective 1 regions get the lion"s share, with 69.7 % of structural funding, to the detriment of Objective 2 (11.5 %).</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone is competing to be the most eloquent in demanding more funding, but no one is questioning the effectiveness of the money that has been spent.</p>
<p class="contents">What is there to say about a budgetary approach which consists of fixing a spending objective rather than a ceiling for spending, seeking out projects at all costs in order to spend all of the funds that have been approved, rather than allocating funds to existing projects? Spending is becoming an end in itself and the measure of a programme"s success.</p>
<p class="contents">However, statistics published by the European Commission demonstrate, to anyone who will take the time to analyse them, the limits of the policy that has been followed: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ The richest regions of the European Union increased in strength between 1986 and 1996, which bears witness to the concentration of wealth and activity in certain areas: Hamburg, Brussels, Antwerp, Luxembourg, Ile‐de‐France, Darmstadt, Upper Bavaria, Bremen, Vienna... and to a lesser extent, Karlsruhe and Emilia‐Romagna.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ The implementation of economic and monetary union is sure to aggravate the depopulation of the most outlying, most rural and least populated regions, to the benefit of the central area of the Union (Benelux, north‐west Germany, northern Italy, Ile‐de‐France, etc.).</p>
<p class="contents">‐ The poorest regions are gradually making up for their delayed development. The average of the 10 poorest regions was 41 % of Community GNP in 1986. In 1996 it was 50 %. This development is particularly marked in Portugal and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">‐ In actual fact, while the rich are growing ever richer and the very poor are becoming less poor, it seems that the average regions, those which receive funds from Objective 2, are experiencing a sometimes considerable reduction in their GNP and a worsening of the employment situation. This is particularly evident in France: the Pays‐de‐Loire has seen its GNP fall from 95 % to 91 % of the Community average, that of Poitou‐Charentes has dropped from 91 % to 83 %, and that of the Centre, from 103 % to 92 %. This is a general trend which spares neither Rhône‐Alpes nor Alsace. It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland, countries where unemployment has also increased in worrying proportions during recent years, as well as in several regions of the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">It may therefore seem strange that during the negotiations Objective 2, which is dedicated to industrial and rural regions undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed to the benefit of Objectives 1 and 3: its budgetary envelope will be ECU 22.5 billion for the period 1999‐2006, which is more or less the same figure as for the period 1994‐1999. The rural regions eligible for Objective 5b will be among the main victims of this situation: in France, one third of the population eligible under this Objective will no longer receive structural funding after the transition period.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the only anomaly in the reform of the Structural Funds. Many regions are benefiting from special treatment as a result of political bargaining that has enabled them to escape the rigour of joint decisions. Only three countries are excluded from this: Luxembourg, Finland... and France. The case of the Belgian Hainaut region is significant. It is receiving an additional allocation of ECU 15 million in order to compensate for the loss of its eligibility for Objective 1, while the French Hainaut, which borders on it, is receiving nothing. This discrimination is not justified either by GNP or by the level of unemployment in the two regions.</p>
<p class="contents">This example is quite a good illustration of France"s position at the end of the negotiations. Having been weakened by Germany with regard to agricultural issues, France"s position on regional policy has not been respected and it has also been unable to maintain the position that it had within the CAP.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sector, as in many others, the Berlin summit has been a failure: a failure for France and a failure for Europe.</p>

We cannot support price increases at a time when a reform package has only just been adopted which lowers the prices. This simply does not make sense. We should instead be reducing the prices, especially in the sugar and sugar beet sector, where there is no common organisation of the market. The artificially high prices of our agricultural goods must gradually be reduced so that they reach the same level as the world market prices. This is an essential prerequisite for the enlargement process.</p>

These regulations establish strict prices and quotas, which cannot be changed if the regulations themselves are not changed. All the rest is just a veneer of negotiations and debates; what we are actually talking about is simply the timing of a death that has already been prophesied.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposals simply apply the term ‘reduction" across the board for all agricultural products. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development examined these proposals and rejected all the amendments that called for price increases. What we are left with are dangerous proposals, without any balance between the human factor, production and the land, and without any link between prices and products. These proposals aim to further reduce the agricultural population and to bring down prices and production costs in the interests of competition. Not only will they give rise to new imbalances in production; they will also directly threaten the quality of products, the environmental balance, agricultural employment, the social balance and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur himself points out, the 1992 review of the common agricultural policy led to a decline in the markets and to a reduction in farmers" incomes. It even managed to wipe out small and medium‐sized family farms, chiefly in the Mediterranean regions of the Community. This resulted in a drastic reduction in the number of farms and in the level of jobs in agriculture, thereby increasing unemployment in agricultural regions and dangerously accelerating the depopulation of the countryside. The average income resulting from agricultural activity throughout the EU fell by 3.9 % in relation to 1997. Your aim is to reduce it even further, hence the new proposals for agricultural prices, true to the spirit and letter of Agenda 2000. These proposals not only prolong the current situation by means of ‘technical adjustments", and address the problem of farmers" incomes in a technocratic way; they also push ahead with the further decreases in incomes with the avowed ulterior objective of reducing the agricultural workforce and driving farmers out of the farming profession.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures implemented in this sector prove that the declarations of interest in protecting and promoting the countryside are sanctimonious and hypocritical. Prices and subsidies have been frozen or drastically reduced for the eleventh successive year. Institutionalised intervention is being cut back or abolished, leaving the small and medium‐sized farmers at the mercy of commercial middlemen and multinationals. In addition, subsidies are vanishing into thin air to pay crippling co‐responsibility fines. The unconcealed injustice that is being perpetrated against small and medium‐sized family producers is continuing and even increasing. Moreover, large farms, which absorb 80 % of Community support, are still being subsidised in a provocative and even more intensified manner. And finally, the policies being implemented serve the God of large‐scale interests. These declarations of interest in the protecting and promoting the countryside are exactly on a par with those made on humanitarian aid and on the protection of the Kosovar Albanians under the hailstorm of murderous bombs.</p>
<p class="contents">Step by step, a new feudalism is appearing with new tenant farmers. The feudal method is being revived through co‐responsibility fines, so‐called co‐resourcing, and so on. This debate has the wrong title. It is not about establishing prices but about detailing disgraceful acts against small and medium‐sized farmers, against producers in the south, against consumers and against the fabric of society and environmental stability.</p>
<p class="contents">You say you are bombing Yugoslavia for ‘humanitarian reasons". Are you exterminating farmers for ‘environmental reasons"? It appears that their sweat and toil are polluting the ‘healthy environment" of ‘globalisation" and of ‘competition", and that you want to return them to the purgatory of the ‘new order of things".</p>
<p class="contents">But the farmers have demonstrated that they do not intend to accept, much less serve, such designs. They have proved this through their struggles, through their rallies, through the mass pan‐European rally that was recently held in Brussels with the participation of the 15 Member States, and through the rallies in the enlargement countries, such as Poland. You will reap what you sow. You will be forced to defend yourselves at a people"s Nuremberg on account of your anti‐farming and peace‐shattering policy.</p>

Once again, the majority of Parliament has voted against the amendments requesting that depreciation of the currency be taken into account when establishing price levels and compensatory aid. Farmers" income is penalised by this depreciation of the currency. What social group would accept a stabilisation of its income, meaning a decrease in real terms?</p>
<p class="contents">The launch of the euro on 1 January of this year also had negative effects on European farmers" incomes due to the pure and simple abolition of the green ecu. The combined effect of inflation and the abolition of the green ecu is going to give rise to a drop of around 4 % in institutional prices and compensatory aid in the next marketing year.</p>
<p class="contents">When we are discussing agriculture in general we hear a great many calls for rural development, the traceability and health and safety of products, respect for the environment and animal welfare, etcetera. Now, when we are voting on the economic factors that enable us to fix farmers" income, all we do is regularly reduce it. Faced with the problem of the reduction in aid and prices, the only option available to our farmers is to turn to intensification, either by expanding their farms, or by setting up off‐land production. How can we fail to see that it is contradictory to set high environmental, health or animal welfare standards, while at the same time regularly reducing the principle of Community preference? In order to have European production costs and European constraints, we must have European prices. This should be the plan of action for professional and political leaders who want to safeguard European agriculture.</p>

This has always been the policy of the Labour Government. At the recent Berlin EU summit, for example, Labour secured reforms of the common agricultural policy that will eventually save British consumers around 1 billion pounds a year, while protecting farm incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Government also won Britain a fairer share of EU regional aid at the Berlin summit. Labour not only made sure that Merseyside kept its Structural Funds, but secured new Structural Funds for South Yorkshire, West Wales and Cornwall. Furthermore, Labour also successfully negotiated special funds for the Scottish Highlands and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">All this was achieved while at the same time stabilising the EU budget. The Labour Government successfully defended Britain's EU budget rebate. Labour also ensured that the EU budget will remain within its cap of 1.27 % of GNP well into the next century.</p>

The EU must pursue an active export policy that goes beyond the use of export refunds and can have a positive impact on the sales of agricultural products over and above the existing export refunds. Given the importance of this regulation, let me point out that the funding allocated and the financing procedures must be adequate. There should be a special budget to ensure that this export policy instrument has a real impact. Since I consider it important to ensure that the measures can be applied in practice, I have vehemently opposed the introduction of a new management committee.</p>

The Agriculture Council had been asking the Commission since the beginning of 1997 to examine the possibility of setting up a horizontal framework for the assistance of promotion activities for the export of agricultural products.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to highlight the extremely small size of the budget proposed by the Commission, which only amounts to EUR 15 million per year. I would like to make a comparison with the free trade agreement concluded with South Africa. In order to compensate for not using European designation of origin terms (port, sherry, etcetera), the Commission has agreed in its negotiations with the South African authorities to provide funding of EUR 15 million in order to allow South African wine products to enter the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the measures covered by this promotion fund, we did of course support the amendment aimed at abolishing the eligibility of ‘high‐level visits by Community representatives." Why should European funds be used to finance trips taken by Commissioners or directors‐general of the Commission to third countries? Personally, I do not think that the role of a Commissioner is identical to that of a sales representative.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, our group voted against Amendment No 23, which was unfortunately adopted by the majority of the House. This amendment specifies that the Commission shall carry out a study into the possibility of abolishing export refunds and making part of the funds released available for promotion measures. Once again, through a text that could be positive for European agriculture, the defenders of globalisation of the agricultural markets are eroding the principle of Community preference.</p>

Since the start of the discussion on the Commission proposal on serious diseases, that is to say about a year ago, Parliament has stood firm in its position. This led to the meeting of a Conciliation Committee, in which the main amendments proposed by Parliament were eventually approved by the Council. This is why I am very satisfied.</p>
<p class="contents">There has recently been a heightening of awareness about rare diseases, which have long been ignored by doctors, researchers and society, and they are finally becoming a real public health concern. This must become a priority in public health policy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the aim of the programme of action proposed by the Commission, which is based on the view that if impetus is not given at European level, work in this field will never progress. Indeed, as these diseases are rare, the cost of developing and marketing drugs aimed at preventing or treating them would not be covered by sales of the drugs. These drugs, which are therefore called orphan medicinal products, are also the subject of a proposal for a regulation that I would like to see adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With the aim of treating all diseases equally, we therefore need to put in place all the necessary measures to facilitate and encourage the work carried out by researchers and to ensure the appropriate remedies are put on the market. It seems clear that this can be done most effectively at Community level. Only transnational cooperation will enable us to use the appropriate measures and knowledge in a coordinated manner, and to rationalise spending. This is why the European Parliament has demanded and obtained measures concerned with setting up a European information network, establishing cooperation between voluntary organisations from the various Member States, training professionals and promoting networks among experts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it was not possible to alter the Council"s position with regard to the size of the budgetary envelope, which the European Parliament wanted to see doubled.</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously very disappointing. Nevertheless, a joint declaration on the Commission proposal aimed at defining a new framework programme in the field of public health states that it will be necessary to ‘duly take account of the budgetary implications." This is a compromise. The European Parliament will ensure that it is respected.</p>

<p class="contents">What is at the heart of this proposal are workers" legitimate rights to be informed and particularly to be consulted with regard to decisions on the management and organisation of the firm for which they are working. The discrepancy between this right and reality is actually very great, and workers are too often treated as mere pawns who can be used as the economic climate dictates.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in Europe there is a real will among workers to make their voice heard and to have a role to play in the running of their firm. This is a characteristic of our European social model, and we must protect it at all costs. Legislative measures must reflect workers" demands. The Commission proposal aims to do this. Its objective is to ensure minimum standards of consultation and information. Even if it is only the ‘union minimum", as in the French expression, we need to see it as only a first stage in a more long‐term strategy of strengthening the role of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Competitiveness and social dialogue are not in conflict with each other – quite the contrary! I fully subscribe to the opinion that the necessary restructuring will be much better received, even if it involves job losses or retraining, if management have been able to explain their approach and to listen to comments from employees. These measures must be applied in as many firms as possible. The threshold of at least 50 employees is satisfactory. Nevertheless, this should not exempt small businesses from taking into account the opinions of their staff. We will have to work on defining incentive mechanisms in order to promote this type of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">It is obvious that with this aim of extending the scope of these measures, we cannot accept the derogations proposed by the Commission for companies that pursue political, ideological or religious aims. We obviously need to define appropriate penalties so that these measures can be correctly applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Along the same line of thinking, Mrs Ghilardotti rightly reaffirmed that we would no longer tolerate employee representatives being penalised as a result of their duties, and I will not disagree with her.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to prevent Europe from remaining simply an unidentified social object for workers, we must arm ourselves with the means of guaranteeing their basic rights.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. – (EL)</span> Any proposal or measure that strengthens the information, control and role of workers within a company will have our full support, despite the fact that we are aware of the limitations of such legislative interventions in the day‐to‐day reality of the system in which we live.</p>
<p class="contents">From this standpoint, we agree that we need to establish an obligatory and effective legislative instrument that will provide for the swiftest and broadest possible information and consultation of employees on issues relating to the progress and prospects of the company, employment, labour relations and, more generally, all the issues and planned decisions that directly affect the interests of workers and, consequently, their lives and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are categorically opposed to the direction these procedures are taking within the Commission. It regards information and consultation as tools to make it easier to ensure the compliance of workers, or, as mentioned in the explanatory statement of the proposal for a directive, as a prerequisite for the success of procedures to restructure companies and adapt them to the new conditions created by the globalisation of the economy, especially through the development of new ways of organising work.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, the process of informing, consulting and involving workers must be considered as one of the ways in which they can strengthen their role and influence, with a view to effectively promoting and supporting their interests. Naturally, they should not become merely participants in decisions that are taken in their absence. The way in which these mechanisms are developed will clearly depend on the workers themselves and, to a large extent, the orientation and quality of their representatives. Furthermore, employers are strongly opposed to the text proposed by the Commission – which is somewhat unambitious and limited – and also to the many amendments tabled in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and here in the House with a view to rendering it devoid of content. This is proof that, if they function correctly, these mechanisms may contribute effectively to defending workers" interests.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not believe that this directive will be effective if it only covers 3 % of companies, as the Commission itself admits. In our view, the implementation threshold for this directive must be lowered to five employees so that it will cover small SMEs, which form the overwhelming majority of companies. This is something that has already entered into force in some national legislations under pressure from the labour movement.</p>
<p class="contents">The limitations that are being proposed in the name of the confidential character of information and the protection of privacy are unacceptable. If enforced, such limitations will lead to a substantial infringement of the right to be informed and consulted. The provisions for the timing and extent of the information and consultation process must be especially stringent. This process must take place in good time, before a decision is taken, so that there is sufficient time for workers to act, and it must include any changes that may affect their labour and security rights. We are referring, in particular, to plans for reorganisation, amalgamation and cooperation, investments, relocation, closures of all or part of a company or establishment, and changes in labour relations, as well as more general issues, such as the strategy, position and development of the company.</p>
<p class="contents">It is constructive that the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs attempts to make significant improvements to the Commission text. These improvements hope to extend the scope of the directive, the content of information and the degree of consultation. They also hope to prevent Member States from restricting the scope of the directive to large companies, that is, those employing more than 100 workers, and to increase the protection of workers" representatives. However, above and beyond this, it is extremely important to retain the provision in the Commission proposal that relates to the lack of legal consequences of the decisions taken by an employer in violation of the obligation to inform and consult. Therefore, we must not adopt the amendments which seek to do away with this provision. Otherwise, the directive would become devoid of content. Nonetheless, this matter of the lack of legal consequences must relate to the entire decision that is taken where the obligation to inform and consult is not met, and not just to the section involving labour relations and agreements. This would help us to prevent any violations of the directive.</p>

The directive cuts fundamentally into national systems for informing workers; yet we have not had sufficient evidence of the need for a supranational regulatory approach.

That is why I could not endorse the proposal – although it contains many good ideas. I certainly see a need for better provision of information to workers in the public sector.</p>

<p class="contents">This being the case, the proposals presented to us are entirely aimed at considerably improving the situation for those professions that have so far been excluded from the various measures that already exist. From this point of view, I agree with Raphaël Chanterie"s proposal that the period necessary for the Member States to conform to the new provisions of the directive should be limited to four years.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, like Hugh McMahon, I must support the idea of including self‐employed drivers in the directive on working time for road transport. Too many examples demonstrate that excessive periods at the wheel dramatically increase the risk of road accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">I also note with satisfaction that the report takes into account the considerable growth in subcontracting, which allows too much freedom with regard to the legislation in force.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I dare to hope that the demands made concerning the monitoring of working and driving hours will be effectively implemented by the Member States, but I have some concerns in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I have regularly questioned the Commissioners on working time in the road transport sector and on the employment conditions of certain shipping companies. So in future I will see to it that these new directives are effectively applied.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span><span class="italic"> in writing. – (EL) </span>As evidence of support for social protection in the EU, the Commission is putting forward its proposal on extending the working time directive to cover sectors and activities which were excluded and which concern approximately six million workers, chiefly in the transport sectors. Unfortunately, however, we are unable to agree with the Commission: on the one hand, the 1993 directive did not go far enough and fell far short of most national legislations, and on the other, the proposal is part of a more general package, which is characterised by the segregation of workers and by indefensible derogations and exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, we are opposed to any segregation of workers into mobile and non‐mobile workers. It is true that mobile workers have certain special features according to the sector in which they are employed, but this can be resolved by relevant special regulations, which must not, under any circumstances, entail a reduction in the level of protection afforded to them. Evidence of the arbitrary nature of the regulations lies in the fact that the Commission itself is proposing that the directive should cover all non‐mobile workers in the sectors which are currently excluded, as well as mobile workers in the rail sector. It would seem that mobile workers in other sectors who are not subject to the general working time directive will be covered by other special regulations which lay down more oppressive terms and conditions. A typical example is the proposal for a directive relating to the working time of mobile workers in road transport, which permits working times of up to 60 hours per week.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s current position clearly bears the same hallmarks as the approach governing the general working time directive that is already in force and that is characterised by the flexibility of the working week: it allowed the Greek Government to adopt a bill on working time arrangements which allows for a working week of up to 48 hours. In last year"s White Paper on this subject and in its current proposal, the Commission stresses the need for action to allow adequate business flexibility for companies and prevent unjustified burdens on companies, as it so elegantly describes the protective provisions of this labour legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We fear that by extending the scope of the directive, the way is being prepared for the directive to be amended as a whole. This would be unfortunate as it would provide even greater opportunities to manipulate working time. A typical example of the problem is the provision to extend the reference period for the calculation of the average weekly working time from the four months generally in force to twelve months for mobile workers and workers chiefly undertaking work on the open seas. Moreover, it is laid down categorically that mobile workers will be exempt from the provisions of articles relating to the daily rest period – that is, working hours – even though the directive still allows for 13‐hour days. They will also be exempt from articles relating to breaks and weekly rest periods – with the result that seven‐day working works are still permitted – and the article relating to the duration of night work, which firmly states that this must not exceed eight hours. At the same time, there is no specific provision setting out any quantitative limit. Incidentally, the provision establishing Sunday as a day of rest is being abolished. In our opinion, we obviously cannot talk either of extending the level of protection, or of legal protection against the disruption of working relations and working time. This is particularly evident in the transport sector in the context of the completion of procedures to liberalise the markets and greater competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has come up with some constructive amendments that mainly limit permissible derogations. Yet it retains the basic exceptions in relation to mobile workers. It also accepts the view that, by means of collective agreements, we can have derogations to the reference period for the working week, even though it limits the scope of the relevant provisions. However, collective agreements – at whatever level they are concluded – must not be allowed to undermine the position of workers and infringe fundamental provisions of labour legislation, such as those relating to the calculation of working time and those of a necessarily traditional nature. Moreover, one of the basic principles governing the law of collective agreements is that they must either be brought into line with the overlying legislative provision or their content must be more favourable to workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, it is clear that such legislative intervention will not solve most of the problems it is supposed to try to solve. Indeed, under the guise of the specific characteristics of the various sectors, it puts the segregation of workers on an official footing and prepares the ground for a more general amendment of the working time directive that will be to our detriment.</p>
<p class="contents">We have denounced the 1993 directive from the outset and we ask that it be amended to promote the 35‐hour working week without reducing incomes, safeguard the 5‐day working week and the 7‐hour working day, drastically limit overtime, and abolish overwork. We also want it to place stringent limitations on night work and restrict derogations to the permissible minimum subject to stringent conditions, taking account of the special features of the respective sectors. In each case, the central objective of the legislation on working time must be to protect the health and safety of workers and the population as a whole, to reduce unemployment, to promote the aim of full employment, to make use of the opportunities provided by modern technology to the benefit of humankind, and to prevent it being contravened by means of contracts such as those related to tied labour.</p>

The principles behind the 1993 directive and the present proposal are the same. The 1993 directive has caused many problems for the Danish trade union movement. In the first place, the EU directive does not, in general terms, contain any improvement in the legal position of Danish workers compared with the agreements that exist at present. Moreover, the Danish authorities have required that the directive should be implemented by incorporating it into the agreements. In our opinion, this is absurd and this kind of thing – coupled with other (increasing) instances of EU interference in Danish agreements – has the effect of undermining free negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully appreciate that the proposal can, in some respects, be regarded as progress in those EU countries whose trade unions lack the strength to demand improvements through agreements. But based on our experiences in Denmark – and because the EU must respect free negotiations – we cannot vote in favour of this proposal to extend the EU's regulatory power.</p>

<p class="contents">I hope that this directive, which has been overdue since at least 1993, is finally nearing the end of the road and it remains to be hoped that it will survive the deliberations still to come in the Council without changes.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1993 all the transport sectors were excluded from Directive 93/104, which laid down the general working time rules. This directive is designed to make up for what was omitted at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">I wonder how many people today remember the vehemence of the discussions about Directive 3820/85, which the unions believed did not go far enough, while the employers believed it interfered far too much in working life.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we can say that even if Directive 3820/85 did not regulate everything as might have been expected, it was a good thing that it existed at all and tried to bring order into a profession in which labour law conditions had not progressed since the time of Emile Zola"s book ‘<span class="italic">Germinal</span> ".</p>
<p class="contents">However, today we may well ask how the mobile workers, meaning everyone employed in transport, could possibly have remained excluded from the general social rules on working time, periods of rest and driving time.</p>
<p class="contents">After the negotiations with the employers on collectively agreed rules failed again, the Commission now found itself forced to decide on a legal initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">So the weekly working time of all professional drivers has now been fixed at 48 hours. However, this can be extended to 60 hours a week provided the average weekly working time over a period of four months remains 48 hours. There was in fact an amendment calling for the four‐month reference period to be reduced to one month but, although appealing, it was rejected by a majority.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a pity that in fixing night‐work time, the formula of 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. that is usual in all other occupational sectors was not retained. One might indeed ask why night work for transport workers is now to be calculated from midnight to 5 a.m. even though many of them work right through the night. This means that long‐distance drivers and taxi drivers who work at night are deprived of well‐deserved bonuses.</p>
<p class="contents">The greatest improvement introduced by the new directive is in driving and working time. Here the Commission has finally realised that replacing the concept of driving time by that of working time would improve road safety, improve the drivers" working conditions and help harmonise competition between undertakings. In the past driving time was the sole criterion, but now the criterion for professional drivers is the period from the beginning to the end of their work, thus including all the activities involved, such as driving, loading and unloading, technical standby duty, the time spent on customs formalities, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the practical problems relating to controls and to monitoring compliance with social rules on road transport need to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">A first means of ensuring this is the new tachograph that will apply from the year 2000. It not only automatically checks the time worked over a period of four months but also shows the hours worked over a one‐year period. Perhaps it can even be used as evidence that professional drivers work far longer hours than any other workers and therefore also have a right to retirement at age 55 as called for by the unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the entry into force of the new directive, if it is respected, will bring major improvements with it, even though much will still remain to be done.</p>

However, we very much regretted that Parliament did not adopt the Greens" amendment aimed at a zero‐emission limit value for dioxin in water. We know that dioxin is the most dangerous chemical mankind has ever produced. Following new scientific findings, the WHO has also drawn attention to this problem of the maximum permissible level for humans and reduced its limit values.</p>
<p class="contents">So I cannot understand why Parliament has not followed an early Commission proposal. I regard this high level of dioxin pollution as a kind of Waterloo in health terms. I think it is totally irresponsible for Parliament not to accept these proposals, for this in fact means it has bowed to the pressure from industry. In the case of a substance as dangerous as the Seveso poison dioxin, I find that difficult to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">It would have been important for Parliament, which accepted the reduction of dioxin emissions into the air and the reduction of the values, to also agree to the values for water. It is quite incomprehensible why the values accepted for dioxin in water are five times as high as those for the air. After all, water is the most essential means of survival and it is not impossible for drainage water to enter the ground water and for the emissions in the air to precipitate into the water. That is why I very much regret that Parliament did not agree to halve the emissions of hazardous substances into the water or even opt for a zero emission level. We had suggested a late date, namely the year 2020. This would have been feasible in technical terms. Unfortunately we did not manage to give priority to consumer protection.</p>

This plan to integrate the directives is worrying from several points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, Directive 94/67/EC, in accordance with Articles 13 and 18 of this directive, will be applied to existing incineration facilities for hazardous waste from 1 July 2000. This means that those sites have planned investments with the aim of fully complying with the standards set out in the text by that date at the latest. Those standards now have to be considered as obsolete, just when they are about to be applied throughout the Community. Let us be serious: economic operators need a minimum degree of consistency and legal security.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this fusion, on the legitimate pretext of simplifying Community legislation and making it clearer, actually ends up reducing the level of environmental protection by encouraging the mixing of hazardous and non‐hazardous waste in the same facility. This would undoubtedly mean that the incinerators that are currently under‐supplied in some Member States could be used to their full capacity. However, investment errors should not be corrected at the cost of reducing the security standards on hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that we maintain a very clear distinction between these two types of waste, as the fact that they are so different in nature and in their level of toxicity means that we need to define their specific technical characteristics. This should be taken into account at each stage of waste management: when it is being collected, received, handled in the facilities and treated, and when disposing of residues and so on. In fact, if we respect the principle of treating different types of waste separately, the proposed aim of simplifying legislation loses much of its interest.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must support the idea of reducing the economic distortions that result from the differences between the standards for emissions into the atmosphere and discharges into water, but that should not be done to the detriment of the progress that had been made as a result of Directive 94/67/EC on hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament adopted the integration of the directives, and I therefore voted against the modified proposal.</p>

The approach proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection presents several risks.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger that the rules that apply to the incineration of hazardous waste will be relaxed by implicitly allowing it to be incinerated in facilities intended for non‐hazardous waste.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the application of the directive on non‐hazardous waste, merging these two texts runs the risk of causing a delay in the adoption of new emission limit values as defined in Directive 94/67/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to monitoring, there may be a fear that the preliminary monitoring procedures specific to the incineration or co‐incineration of hazardous waste will be removed. Even if fully applied by producers of special waste, these monitoring procedures cannot be incorporated into the procedures that are carried out when receiving non‐hazardous waste at non‐hazardous waste incineration facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the balance of incineration lines, this integration of the two directives threatens to favour certain incineration lines to the detriment of others, through ill‐adapted limit values, whereas we need to pursue all four incineration lines: the specialised incineration of non‐hazardous waste, the specialised incineration of hazardous waste, co‐incineration (incineration in a cement kiln) and incineration by adapted combustion plants. We must take care not to give priority to one incineration line over another, given that the environmental and energy balance responds to recognised needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but by no means least, there is a risk of an excessive rise in treatment costs, bringing no significant environmental benefit, with limit values being fixed for pollutants that are not specific to the waste being incinerated (sulphur dioxide or nitrogen oxide for example), which should be adapted both according to the type of facility and to its capacity.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Theonas </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL), </span> <span class="italic">in writing. – (EL)</span> This proposal substantially supplements the existing Directive 94/67/EC – replacing Article 8 – on a crucial environmental point: determining the specific limits for the concentration of pollutants in treated liquid waste resulting from the cleaning of exhaust gases and determining specific controls and monitoring procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle that is being adopted is a sound one. We cannot allow pollution to be transferred from one environmental medium (air in this case) to another (water and soil in this case). In other words, we cannot on the one hand lay down strict limits on concentrations of pollutants in gas emissions from an incineration plant (and as a result, through the cleaning of the combustion gases, extract large quantities of pollutants) while, on the other hand, allowing a large part of these pollutants (through the defective treatment of the cleaned air) to lead to permissible quantities of (defectively) treated discharges.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worthwhile noting the following: </p>
<p class="contents">1. The philosophy and thinking behind the proposal brings to the forefront, from another viewpoint, the internal contradiction of incineration as a method of treating hazardous – although not only hazardous – waste. In other words, the more we try to reduce atmospheric pollution by retaining greater amounts of toxic substances by cleaning the combustion gases, the greater the problems we are faced with when protecting the other two environmental mediums – water and air – from pollution and, of course, the greater the financial resources needed for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">2. This method of incineration is unreliable in terms of protecting the environment and public health due to the uncertainty that still exists with regard to the danger of pollutants in treated combustion gases resulting from the operation of incineration plants. Characteristic of this uncertainty are the enormous discrepancies in the explanatory statement concerning the upper emission limits that have been established by developed countries. These limits are up to a thousand times higher or lower according to the country or plant involved.</p>
<p class="contents">3. Based on the above, therefore, the opinion of a large section of the scientific community and all NGOs on the limitations and shortcomings of the incineration of hazardous waste is borne out. As a result, the priority of the precautionary principle, that is, the non‐production or the limited production of hazardous waste, is confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">4. All the above applies in full to the incineration of non‐hazardous solid waste. In other words, we are calling for corresponding regulations. And these problems are further exacerbated by the fact that: <br />a) The incineration units have much greater capacity, resulting in a much greater production of combustion gases.<br />b) In this case, we have the production (due to incineration) of toxic substances ‘from scratch", since non‐hazardous waste, including household waste and associated waste, contains zero or negligible amounts of toxic substances, whilst their incineration gives rise to all the problems mentioned above, such as the production of dioxins, furans, heavy metals, slag, bottom ashes, and so on.</p>

<p class="contents">LIFE is the only Community financial instrument aimed entirely at supporting an environmental policy covering the whole of the European Union and including environmental cooperation with neighbouring countries. Due to the type of projects that it funds, LIFE is distinguished from the other instruments for research and development and support of structural investments that also contribute to protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation that we are to vote on today presents the third phase of LIFE, incorporating three thematic components: </p>
<p class="contents">LIFE‐Nature, which is based on the cofinancing of nature protection projects that can contribute to preserving and regenerating natural habitats and species (budget heading B4‐3200).</p>
<p class="contents">LIFE‐Environment, which is based on the cofinancing of new environmental measures, demonstration projects and preparatory projects aimed at integrating an environmental dimension into land‐use development and planning projects and industrial production activities, with a view to improving waste management and reducing the effects that products have on the environment (budget heading B4‐3201).</p>
<p class="contents">LIFE‐Third Countries, which is based on the cofinancing of technical assistance programmes focused on creating capacity for the administrative structures that are required in the environmental sector and that are necessary for developing an environmental policy, and action programmes in neighbouring third countries other than countries that are candidates for accession (budget heading B7‐810).</p>
<p class="contents">The members of the Group of Independents for a Europe of Nations voted for the amendments that favour the setting up and application of the LIFE programme. However, we wish to stress that measures undertaken with the support of LIFE must take account of Community environment policy. We therefore voted against the amendment which made the development of this policy conditional on the results of the LIFE programme. If this was the case, the financial resources that are envisaged in the programme would be entirely insufficient, particularly with regard to the enlargement of the European Union to include the CEECs.</p>
