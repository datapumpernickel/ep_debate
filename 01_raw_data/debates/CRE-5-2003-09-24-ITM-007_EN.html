I am therefore going to deliver a brief statement on some of the considerations relating to this major subject instead.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Council confirms its commitment to the sustainable development strategy established by the 2001 Gothenburg European Council. In this regard, our goal is to ensure the sustainability of transport, deal with growing traffic volumes and levels of congestion, noise and pollution and promote the use of environmentally friendly means of transport. We are also aiming at the full internationalisation of social and environmental costs. As stressed by the European Council, one essential way of achieving this objective is to develop trans-European transport networks, giving priority, where appropriate, to investment in infrastructure for public transport and railways, internal waterways, short sea shipping, intermodal operations and effective interconnection, in other words to encourage the development of means of transport which are less harmful to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing guidelines on the development of trans-European transport networks already identify, as one of the objectives of the network, guaranteeing the sustainable mobility of persons and goods while, at the same time, contributing to the achievement of Community objectives, particularly in the field of the environment and competition. In this regard, the incorporation of environmental concerns at the planning and development stage of projects has been fixed as a priority objective for the development of the network.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, Council Directive 85/337/EEC of 27 June 1985 places the Member States under obligation to give due consideration to environmental protection during the development and implementation of projects, carrying out environmental impact assessments. In addition, an environmental assessment has to be carried out on the plans and programmes drawn up in preparation for these projects, particularly those funded by the Community, under Directive 2001/42/EC of 27 June 2001 on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Genuine free movement of goods and passengers depends on a perfectly integrated transport network, which links the islands and outer or remote regions with central regions. By ensuring a more effective use of transport, a modern, interconnected and interoperable network brings an increase in trade and in the competitiveness of the European economy as a whole. Until the necessary infrastructure has been built and until there is a proper legislative framework for the effective management of the network, the concepts of internal market and territorial cohesion of the Union will be incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of a section dedicated to the trans-European networks policy in the Maastricht Treaty gave the European Community the powers and instruments it needed to develop them. Under Article 154 of the Treaty establishing the European Community, the Community is to contribute to the creation and development of trans-European networks in the field of transport, telecommunications and energy infrastructure. This will contribute to both the creation of an internal market and economic and social cohesion, although, to this end, we need, first and foremost, to develop the interconnection and interoperability of national networks. Over the past decade, we have witnessed not only a disturbing increase in traffic congestion in urban areas but also a new phenomenon of congestion on the major arteries of the trans-European network.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission, the external costs of congestion caused by road traffic account, alone, for 0.5% of the European Union’s GDP. This figure is even more alarming if we consider that the demand for transport is going to continue to increase considerably in the future. If we do not adopt measures between now and 2010 to rationalise the use and maximise the benefits of each means of transport, the volume of heavy road traffic alone in the 15-Member State Union could increase by 50% on the 1998 level. This trend is damaging to both the Member States and the countries applying to join the Community, in that we witnessed both the gradual fall in the market share of the railways and, at the same time, a rise of almost 20% in road transport between 1990 and 1998.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new context of sustainable development, the June 2001 Gothenburg Council called for emphasis, in future, on the development of rail, sea and river transport. In May 2004, 10 countries are to join the European Union, while Romania and Bulgaria are to join in 2007. In the light of this, there is a need for new infrastructure in the corridors serving other countries to link them effectively to the trans-European network of the present 15 Member States. The need also arises to improve links between the countries themselves. A new network of infrastructure therefore needs to be built linking east to west and north to south.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be remembered that the Council conclusions on the second review of the Council strategy on the integration of environmental requirements and sustainable development into transport policy, adopted by the Ministers for Transport in December 2002, stressed the importance of analysing new political proposals from the point of view of their environmental impact and of the Community’s ability to reduce harm to the environment caused by the transport sector. To back this up, I would point out that, during the same meeting of December last year, the Council approved the Marco Polo programme, which is intended to fund improvements to the environmental aspects of the goods transport system. The programme provides for the funding of initiatives to transfer goods transport from road to other means of transport such as rail, internal waterways or short sea shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">The goal of promoting sustainable development through endeavours to restore a balance between means of transport which favours those which respect the environment will, therefore, be an essential point of reference for the Council when, in the coming months, it examines the Commission’s proposal on the revision of the TEN guidelines and the priority projects it contains.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the Council believes that the conclusions of the High-Level Group chaired by former Commissioner, Mr Van Miert, follow the strategic approach of sustainable, well-balanced development with due regard for environmental protection and, at the same time, endeavours to strengthen the unity of Europe through the free movement of persons and goods, and with due regard for the need to reduce natural barriers and to maintain a balance between east-west and north-south routes. It considers that investment in infrastructure together with appropriate public and private partnership initiatives could be a highly effective instrument supporting economic growth. From this point of view, the situation of certain countries which continue to be affected by the problem of passes and whose production systems continue to suffer considerable economic harm as a result, is typical. That is why we must continue to urge the Commission to resolve these issues. The Council therefore calls upon the Commission to present its proposal for revising the TENs without delay, so that a broad political debate can be held and a common position adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all agree that efficient trans-European networks linking eastern and western Europe and northern and southern Europe need to be created, we all agree that the issue of traffic congestion needs to be addressed, we all agree that emphasis needs to be given to the environment and to more friendly means of transport and we all agree that greater emphasis needs to be given to the railways. The problem is when we start to address specific issues. That is where we see that there is a difficulty reaching decisions. For example, Minister, we have been talking about railways for a great many years, but the Council is not distinguished, at least not as a whole I think, by its intention to liberalise rail transport. Because, without liberalisation and without interoperability in the network, it is obvious that the railways, which are the most environmentally-friendly, will never be able to acquire the required momentum.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to priority works. We had the Essen Council. You know that 14 top priority trans-European networks were approved and, a few years later, we see that half of them have not progressed. Consequently, on numerous occasions you see that we make plans on paper. And this becomes even more remarkable if you think that certain of these works concern what we are talking about now, namely respect for the environment and the need to address traffic congestion in certain sensitive areas of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, what is urgently needed is for proclamations and all these plans on paper to find some response in reality. And here we have to look at the question of funding. In a few days' time, no doubt, the European Commission will come along and tell us that it is proposing a new plan reforming the trans-European network guidelines. So we shall jointly adopt a number of priority works. But if we do not fund these works efficiently, it is certain that, as the volume of transport increases, in a short time things will be much worse and the entire European network will be even more overloaded. In this way development too is undermined. Consequently, we need to see how the Member States can assume their responsibilities and how the Union budget will fund the European networks more substantially and what role the European Investment Bank can play in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Italian Presidency, which appears to be particularly sensitive to this specific issue, will manage to take efficient steps in this direction because, believe me Minister, debates such as this have been held on other occasions in this Parliament, but the results were not particularly impressive. I trust that you will take the European Union down a different road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mind you, they have already lost something of their impetus, considering who has been working on them and for how long. From 1996 until today, the TENs have undoubtedly had their ups and downs. At the beginning, or as early as at the Essen Council, they were hailed as the magic remedy for the European Union and its development, until the moment came when we realised that what was expected of them was rather unrealistic. No, I think that the TENs are a very important tool for the European Union, economic cohesion, the internal market and a modern transport policy. The Commission’s White Paper again made that clear not long ago. As Europeans, we need a transport policy that is technically up-to-date – GALILEO was mentioned as a potential model – and one that is sustainable, that is to say with priority given to rail and water. We should now have been a small step further down the road if the Council had also accepted the Commission’s proposals, as Parliament has done. In 2002, Parliament attempted a small revision of the trans-European networks, to which the Council has not so far provided us with a response; instead, the Van Miert Group has gone on to do its work.</p>
<p class="contents">So then, we do not have to re-invent the wheel. The Van Miert Group has done its work, involving high-ranking representatives from every single Member State, and its reports affirm that the Member States agree with what it has, as it were, thought out and presented. It is now, therefore, really up to the Commission to incorporate what the Van Miert Group suggested into a proposal. This would then go before Parliament and the Council and, given good will on the part of the Council, we should then have implemented relatively quickly what the Van Miert Group has thought out in terms of projects and, also, financing instruments. It is not quite clear to me why, in fact, we are now debating the issue once again. The proposals and plans are on the table. It is now just a question of their being implemented and worked on. That is why no further pressure should be placed upon available speaking time. So then, we have a proposal from the Commission, Parliament is doing its work, and then let the Council – instead of dragging its heels, if it please – very rapidly implements the proposal so that the revision of the TENs can be got rapidly under way.</p>

<p class="contents">The work of the Van Miert Group is certainly thorough, but I do not fully endorse its strategic approach, which is biased towards northern Europe to the detriment of the south and the Mediterranean, an area which represents a major opportunity – and also a major European challenge – in terms of the economic, cultural and social cohesion of peoples and countries with which we are called to enter into a new, major dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if Italy is a major bridge in the Mediterranean between north and south and between east and west, I fail to understand why both the Adriatic corridor and the Mediterranean corridor, designed to satisfy the requirements of intermodality and interoperability, have been removed from the list of priorities. Only the bridge over the Straits of Messina, which is a case apart, remains.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore call upon the Commission to ensure that they are reinstated once again among the priority projects for 2020, and for endeavours to improve relations between the public and private sectors and to implement controls. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Presidency’s speech focused more on the functioning of the internal market than on the achievement of sustainability goals, and the same applies to the Members’ speeches: they all talked about transport; no one mentioned sustainability. People say that the review of the TENs will contribute to the development of a network which is efficient in terms of quality and sustainability, but that does not necessarily follow and it requires specific political choices to be made. There is no mention of incorporating environmental concerns into the current debate on the review of the TENs and there is no sign of any intention to carry out a pre-emptive environmental assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">Here is a practical example. Today, we are faced with the danger that the Commission will bring forward to 1 October the approval of what is known as the ‘Van Miert list’, which sets out the TEN priority plan for the next 20 years. As it admitted itself, the Van Miert Group should have carried out an assessment of the projects’ impact on the environment, biodiversity, volumes, transport and climate, but it has not done so. Who should shoulder this responsibility, if not the Commission? If the Commission really is going to take its decisions by 1 October, it will not have time to do so; it will merely have time to ratify the Van Miert list, which boils down to nothing more than the product of bartering between different governments.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that, before the Van Miert list is approved, a proper cost-benefit assessment needs to be carried out on the trans-European networks proposed at Essen; we need to promote a European transport plan which prioritises the restoration of existing lines, reinforcement of regional networks and the fight to achieve decongestion of urban traffic; we need to consult the local bodies and authorities in the spirit of the Aarhus Convention and expose the interests of the economic promoters who are behind major infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot more that needs to be said, but I hope that we will have other opportunities to say it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the few minutes available to me, I would like to say that the experience I have accumulated in the field of TENs has led me to draw two conclusions. Firstly, we could say that we are dealing with a pipe dream, something that was decided many years ago but was not then implemented when it came down to it, perhaps because of a lack of resources but perhaps because of a lack of will too. Secondly, a series of debates has been launched in the individual States on the different resources, on the reference legislation, on the question of whether to focus the TEN project on rail transport or on priority objectives; ultimately, however, of all the original projects – the famous 14 – 11 have yet to be completed. On the other hand, what we are attempting to do – and I would express my appreciation to the Commission here for its endeavours – is, thanks to the work of the Van Miert High Level Group, review the TEN objectives and, in particular, the resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that all the individual States would like this project to be important in terms of the expansion of their economies, of job creation, of attempting to create a genuine network across the 15 nations, soon to be 25. It is therefore important to appropriate more funds. We must therefore endeavour to achieve about 30 or 40% in non-returnable funds; we must aim not just at EUR 600 million per year but at achieving between EUR 6 billion and EUR 8 billion per year for the next ten years. We all hope that this will be possible and I believe that, with the help of the Italian Presidency in these six months, we will be able to succeed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have to say that this debate is not adding anything new to what we already know because, although it is true that there is a general problem where sustainable development is concerned, the fact is that, in this period, we are on the eve of enlargement – partial but major enlargement. There will be 25 countries in the European Union and we must equip ourselves so that we can achieve closer relations between the Member States. Closer relations mean more traffic and more cultural, economic and commercial exchanges, for exchanges involve the transfer of knowledge and wealth, which enables Europe to open its doors to successive enlargements, the ultimate goal being to achieve the full unity of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I have to note that this evening’s debate is based principally on the work of the Van Miert Group and, in particular, on the priorities which have been set according to criteria which, in my opinion, need to be analysed in depth. I cannot list them all, so I will confine myself to mentioning the 10 major trans-European corridors planned and the fact that these infrastructures have essentially been assessed, first and foremost, with reference to the present European Union rather than the future EU, in the sense that a great deal of pressure has been exerted by the countries who are already Members while those who are, in any case, already knocking at the European Union’s doors had no bargaining<span class="bold"> </span>power, with the result that we are now essentially in a position where we do need to consider their needs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would mention, not by chance, by way of example, corridor 8, one of the two corridors which concern Italy. On the list of these priorities, it has been given almost the lowest urgent status, whereas a large bridge is to be opened providing a link with the Balkans, whose peoples, despite the effects of the recent war, are already displaying an accelerated growth rate and are a model example of how<span class="bold"> </span>communities such as those of southern Italy, an area inhabited by 20 million citizens who, precisely through relations with the Balkans and the East, can play a major role within Europe, can become leaders in development.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, pending the arrival of news which we have not received, please would you forward my observations in the form of recommendations, at least, and, perhaps, concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whenever the European economy is faring badly, we are entitled to a debate on TENs. The Commission, however, and the Council even more so, are behaving like an opera chorus. They are singing ‘Let us march, let us march’, while jumping up and down on the spot. One report on TENs follows another, but the projects adopted advance at the speed of a funeral cortege.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that every economy lives by its infrastructures. Trade and the internal market need these cross-border networks. Europe is cruelly lacking investment in the railways, piggyback transport, motorways, waterways, ports and airports. We are lacking interconnected gas and electricity networks. Often, infrastructure decisions collide with ecological considerations. It is no longer politics that decide: it is ultimately the administrative courts. Sustainable development, however, cannot be achieved without economic and social development, full stop. Nor is the lack of transport infrastructures and the permanent traffic jams, the traffic congestion, in the interest of sustainable development. How can we implement the Lisbon strategy without consistent investment in infrastructure? What is more, these investments, as I have just said, are also in the interests of sustainable mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Europe needs to give itself the resources to match its ambitions. It is not enough to make the European Investment Bank contribute; it does not have unlimited resources. Why not take up Jacques Delors' idea of funding TENs with a Community loan? Borrowing to invest, to create the conditions of future sustainable growth, should be an objective common to all true Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is suffocating under its contradictions. We manifest a will to become the most competitive economy in the world, but real policy gets lost in parochial considerations. We need stability, but without growth there will be neither stability nor full employment. The United States is much more pragmatic. The US federal deficit for the current year alone is equal to more than five European Union annual budgets. While the Americans are investing 3% of their GDP in infrastructure, we are hovering around a miserly 1%. The requirements for projects under way or planned are EUR 400 billion. The requirements identified by the Van Miert Group have been estimated at EUR 600 billion. Up to now, Community funding has been in the order of EUR 15 billion. Clearly, therefore, there is a huge gulf between the objectives announced and the actual efforts made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we look carefully at matters, the fact is that, according to the calculations, the European Union is foregoing half a percentage point per year in economic growth because, for example, the infrastructure is insufficiently developed and not functioning efficiently. If, moreover, we were to achieve – as is probable – an improvement of between 25% and 50% in our air quality – at least in quite a few areas – we should be setting our sights more firmly upon combined transport, that is to say on a combination of rail, road and water.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Union has set itself two important objectives – the first in Lisbon, concerning the competitiveness of our continent, and the second, which has since been insufficiently implemented, in Gothenburg, concerning the sustainability of economic development on our continent – it is rather strange that there are already many contradictions in transport policy, in terms of many very different investments and trends, and of the fact that – although we hope this will soon happen – roads are, to some extent, still not paying their way in the light, for example, of the Road Costs Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will soon examine the proposals of the committee chaired by Mr van Miert and will present this Parliament with a practical proposal as to how, in the future, the trans-European networks should be developed. What is first of all necessary is a list of priorities and, secondly of course, the funding. Mr Goebbels and others have already referred to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Credit financing alone will not suffice. Nor is it enough to organise private capital, something that is also incredibly difficult to do. What we see in the case of many projects – and Commissioner Kinnock has already submitted proposals in this respect and set up his own group of experts – is that, in actual practice, a private-public partnership really only works in the case of a few such projects if nothing is also done to increase public investment. In my view, it should really be considered whether, for example, there is the possibility, in the case of carefully targeted cross-border projects that are priorities specifically in terms of European cohesion, of permitting quite specific exemptions from the deficit <span class="italic">calculation à la</span> Maastricht. The Presidency’s proposals on this subject were very problematic because they were couched in too general terms, and I believe we must give them more specific wordings. The Commission and the Council should now be called upon finally to reach decisions and genuinely to propose a realistic funding concept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact remains – and I, too, agree with the Members who have made this point – that it is a pity that this opportunity cannot be fully exploited. There is not much point in holding the debate if the Commission and the Council are not here, but let us, at least, use it to discuss the matter amongst ourselves; in any case, there are very few of us left in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I go any further, I would say to Mrs Frassoni that I, too, am concerned that sustainability should be placed at the heart of the project and that it should, so to speak, be one of the screening criteria for what we want to do. However, I am much more concerned at the unsustainable nature of the present situation.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Socialist Member, Mr Goebbels, said – I do not know if you heard him, Madam President – in actual fact, our citizens are already playing an enormous price in terms of quality of life and quality of the environment now, precisely because of the situation in our continent of malfunctions, traffic jams, traffic overloads and the impossibility of smooth traffic flow.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, however, I, too, believe that, at this juncture, we, too, as Parliament, should launch an ‘Operation truth’ if we do not want the Van Miert report to be just another pipe dream or set of low priorities, for when we start to call priorities 10, 20 or 25 projects involving, as we all know, such huge costs, the likelihood is that none of the projects on our list are actually going to be treated as a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure Parliament is capable of carrying out this ‘Operation truth’, starting by making people shoulder their responsibilities and by asking ourselves, if we want a European transport policy and if we want a large-scale infrastructure policy, what price we are prepared to pay for this policy and, in particular, which choices we are prepared to make. Otherwise, we will continue to hold virtually useless debates like this and, above all, we will continue to raise the expectations of our citizens and of some of our political leaders too, and it would and will be more damaging to fail to meet those expectations than to fail to implement a project.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that, while we are waiting for the Commission and, above all, the Council, to explain to us what the actual possibilities are behind the intentions expressed so clearly by the Italian Presidency at the start of its mandate, we can start to lay down this challenge. If we are to do it, let us get on with it, but we must do it properly and sit down round a table to work out what it is actually possible to achieve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, to adopt the list without any strategic assessment of the environmental impact, profitability or practical safety of any of the 18 projects would be merely to rubber stamp it. The Commission is being called upon to rubber stamp the 18 projects submitted by the governments. I would like the Commission to know that, when Parliament is asked to give its opinion, it will refuse just to give its seal of approval or ratify them, not least because some of the proposals and demands of the Member States are nothing more than whims. One example, in particular, which we have discussed at length with Commissioner Van Miert, is the project to build a bridge over the Straits of Messina. There is clear, solid opposition to this bridge from all the local communities concerned. Its profitability is questionable, there are deep concerns as regards safety and, most importantly, the environmental impact would be terrible if we were to build a pylon taller than the Empire State Building on the outskirts of the city of Messina.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to our objections and to the request for clarification which we put to Mr Van Miert, to find out what the exceptional grounds were for selecting this project, it was explained that the Italian Government had put forward strong arguments for it, to the effect that this bridge would save 5.5 million Sicilians from isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, as a Sicilian, I can tell you that this is not true. The isolation of the Sicilians is caused by the fact that getting from Palermo to Messina involves a five-hour train journey, not the fact that it is 20 minutes by ferry from Messina to Reggio Calabria. We have had to sideline another project – a genuinely key project – corridor 8, which would have made it possible to link southern Europe to the Balkan countries and would, moreover, have helped to confirm our particular consideration for the economic future of the Balkans, in line with the intentions of the Italian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to all these considerations, I hope that Parliament will have the opportunity to return to the subject and to discuss it with representatives of the Commission and the Council here in flesh and blood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
