<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Belder (EDD), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the intent of this proposal for a European Parliament recommendation to the Council on EU-Russia relations is clear – a partnership that is truly worthy of the name. Accordingly, a strengthening of these mutual relations rather than growing mutual separation is what is required. Looked at in a matter-of-fact way, that is also what our many common interests require. In all fairness, however, relations between the EU and the Russian Federation are anything but ideal, and for this both parties are to blame. That is, therefore, the angle of this proposal for a recommendation: European self-criticism and criticism levelled at Moscow. In the autumn of last year, that is the very course on which this House’s Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy embarked. To our satisfaction, we can conclude today that the Commission, according to its communication of 10 February, is more or less on the same wavelength, and so, apparently, is the Council. Incidentally, the Council should, in the view of this House, aspire to achieve more transparency in such an important and comprehensive area of policy as relations with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">This current European consensus with regard to Russia is undisputed, but what matters is its concrete implementation, and that is where Europe's self-criticism comes in. Differing positions have been adopted on Kaliningrad, Chechnya and the Yukos affair. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is why I cannot wait to hear about new agreements for new consistent policy. Yesterday, the press once again confronted me with confusing accounts from a prominent European statesman.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point of important self-criticism is broached in Recital S and paragraph 2 of the proposal for a recommendation. The EU-Russia partnership is based on common values of respect for democratic principles and human rights. Parliament has expressly advised the Council and the Commission to apply this guiding principle consistently to all areas of cooperation with the Kremlin.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the situation in Chechnya is completely at odds with the principle of the EU-Russia partnership. This is a wholly depressing situation of rampant violence and lawlessness at the expense of, in the main, a defenceless civilian population. At the same time, the Chechen tragedy is a problem that is avoided in international politics, as the title of a thorough recent study aptly suggests. In paragraph 13, this House recommends the Council in all seriousness to emphatically refute this shameful analysis. In the final analysis, the internal and external effects of the Chechen impasse affect the European Union's values and interests just as much. To start with, the Council should lodge a vigorous protest with President Putin against the disappearances, tortures or, worse, the killings of Chechen citizens who had the courage to lodge complaints with the European Court for Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of disappearances in the Chechen region, I would refer to the continuing uncertainty surrounding the fate of my compatriot Arjan Erkel. I fully subscribe to the amendment tabled as No 25, which I will quote: ‘reiterates its deep concern once again about the fact that to date, no political solution has been found in the case of Arjan Erkel and regrets the fact that no progress whatsoever has been made in the direction of a solution, insists therefore on a determined political move on the part of the federal and local authorities in Russia, the Commission and the Council to ensure that Mr Erkel is released safe and well’.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more so than Chechnya, there is another obstacle to the EU-Russia partnership that is receiving political and public attention: the extension of the partnership and cooperation agreements to include all new EU Member States from 1 May 2004. Parliament is supporting the Council unconditionally in its position, according to which it will not enter into any negotiations with the Russians in this respect. Could the Council perhaps tell us whether a provisional solution to this difference is in the offing? Good neighbourly relations and, above all, good partnership, should be accompanied by Russian foreign policy that reinforces stability on the continent. If anything, though, the failure to sign or ratify the border agreements between Russia and its Baltic neighbours, Estonia and Latvia, has a destabilising effect, as do, and to an even greater degree, Russia's unfulfilled obligations to withdraw its troops from Transnistria and Georgia at long last. The present proposal for a recommendation urges the Council to stand firm on these sensitive security issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I could mention many other areas of concern with regard to the development of the EU-Russia partnership, as is evident from a careful scrutiny of the proposal for a recommendation, but I would add that it was certainly not our intention to draft a catalogue of complaints. The intention is quite simply to define the mutual frictions, to facilitate and maintain debate on them and join together in seeking a solution. It is logical in this connection that the European Union should set out its priorities unambiguously and repeatedly and should indicate its so-called red lines during negotiations. This practical approach is reflected in the Commission communication. This gives me, as rapporteur, real satisfaction. The relatively considerable attention received to date in the Russian media by the proposal for a recommendation gives ample reason to rejoice. It appears that our message is well received by the Russian Federation, to whom it is also addressed. I am indebted to you, the MEPs concerned, for this response. I found your thoughts and contributions indispensable. I would repeat this praise for the excellent assistance from the secretariat of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy in the person of Mr Dag Sourander. Together with him and my personal assistant, Henk-Jan van Schothorst, we have, over the past few months, poured over these complicated EU-Russia relations with much dedication, because this House sets great store by a partnership that functions right across the board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, those Members of the House who read the <span class="italic">Financial Times,</span> or indeed the <span class="italic">Moscow Times,</span> will recognise that EU-Russia cooperation is not always as straightforward as it could be. I have to say that I regret that deeply. Why? Because a stable and constructive relationship with Russia is essential to the EU, and also because a stable and constructive relationship with the EU is essential to Russia. It is clearly in our interest to try to promote close ties with an open, stable and democratic Russia, acting, we hope, as a reliable partner which can uphold European values, continue reforms, implement commitments and, in cooperation with the EU, play a constructive role in the newly independent states.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication which the Commission adopted on 9 February, a communication which heavily influenced the report discussed by foreign ministers on Monday of this week, took as its starting point the interdependence of the EU and Russia and our wish to build a genuine strategic partnership, based on shared values and driven by our evident common interests. There are positive elements to the relationship, but, overall, we have to accept that the results of five years of increasingly intensive cooperation are not as positive as we expected. We have to do something about that.</p>
<p class="contents">There were three important outcomes from the review of EU-Russia relations discussed on Monday. First, a strong, clear and public message was passed to Russia that we expect the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to be extended to the ten acceding Member States without pre-condition or distinction by 1 May. The Commission has held intensive discussions with Russia. We hope that we have been able to convince our interlocutors that the question of extending the PCA must be rapidly settled. The EU, for its part, is ready, in parallel to the extension of the PCA, to discuss any of Russia's legitimate concerns over the impact of enlargement. I hope that our attempt to resolve this issue as rapidly as possible will not be affected by the formation of the new government of the Russian Federation, with which we will look forward to working in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the Ministers confirmed the importance of the EU's relations with Russia. It was agreed that the EU should engage with Russia, that we should be ready to discuss all complex issues of mutual interest, and that as part of this approach, the EU should stress that its partnership with Russia is not only driven by common interests but also founded on shared values. This implies discussing frankly Russian practices that run counter to European values, such as human rights in Chechnya, media freedom and cooperation on the environment. It also involves not hesitating to defend EU interests vigorously.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, the ministers recognised the need for the EU to change the way in which it does business with Russia – to become more 'joined up', to use the bureaucratic terminology. It was agreed that the EU should establish clear, agreed objectives and positions ahead of every meeting with Russia. If we wish to build what can honestly be described as a strategic partnership, EU messages must be balanced and coherent, and our ambitious political declarations must be matched by progress on substance. This requires better coordination between policies defined at EU level, and the approach of individual Member States to relations with Russia. Why, for example, is it that the EU subscribes to joint statements with Russia, in which we agree to step up cooperation on crisis management, yet the EU is unable to convince Russia to work with it to resolve the very real problems in Moldova and the southern Caucasus? Why, in addition, do we see individual Member States agree to facilitate visas for Russia, at the same time as Russia is blocking conclusion of a readmission agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these views are shared by the report which the honourable Member has presented so eloquently this morning; the report is a welcome contribution, in my judgement, to the debate on our relations with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Our task now is to translate words into action and to establish a more coherent, strategic approach to Russia, reflecting the views of the enlarged Union. It is important that the EU can make real progress in its work with Russia. This matters to business people wishing to gain access to the promising Russian market – we should remember, after all, that after enlargement, more than 50% of Russia's trade will be with the EU. It also matters to importers of energy, given Russia's position as a major supplier of oil and gas. And not least, it matters because, if we are to tackle cross-border problems such as environmental pollution, illegal migration and organised crime, Russia will have to shoulder more of the burden than it has previously.</p>
<p class="contents">Discussions at the General Affairs and External Relations Council reaffirmed the interest of the EU in promoting integration in the long term, through the creation of a series of common spaces within the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. The Commission has advocated strongly that, once agreement is reached on PCA extension, the EU should be ready to present a draft joint action plan to Russia covering all these four spaces, consistent with our neighbourhood policy and incorporating relevant elements that are of common interest to both the EU and Russia. This would help to establish an issues-based agenda, focused on substance, and be a further step towards the strategic partnership that we genuinely want with the Russian Federation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the honourable Member once again for presenting such a thoughtful report and I am sure it will contribute to the outcome that we both wish to see.</p>

The Second Chechen War is now into its fifth year. It will soon have been going on for as long as the Second World War did. Every day that the war continues, the leaders of the Russian State demonstrate their inability and unwillingness to bring the civil war to a peaceful end. The war has become self-perpetuating. European leaders and the EU must be more active in pursuing peace in Chechnya, and we must demand that the Russian army comply with the rules of war in their dealings with the civilian population. There must be an end to so-called mopping-up operations, which amount to nothing other than robbery and kidnappings, and Russian soldiers who do violence to the civilian population must be brought before the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">With the collapse of totalitarian Soviet Communism, there were high hopes and expectations of the way in which Russia would develop and draw closer to the rest of Europe. Now that we see how developments have taken another direction in certain parts of the country, we must make demands and not just express expectations. State-controlled media and a so-called controlled democracy have no place in a modern, democratic constitutional state. President Putin announced the departure of the Russian Government a few days ago. He quoted as a reason for forming a new government the fact that it would work more intensively on developing democracy in the country. That sounds all well and good. We must hope that it will also become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable to the EU that, prior to enlargement, Russia has not approved agreements drawn up with Estonia and Latvia on the delineation of borders. It is also unacceptable for Russia to oppose an extension to the partnership agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has huge environmental problems. This is in large part a legacy of the Communist era when the environment had very low priority. The greatest risk of an environmental disaster that might also hit the EU area is presented by the outmoded and oldest nuclear power stations of what is termed the Chernobyl type. They exist in Sosnovy Bor, not far from Estonia’s border with Russia, and in Kursk, near Moscow. We must clearly emphasise to the Russians that the continued operation of these first-generation RBMK reactors is unacceptable. They should be phased out as quickly as possible, and other nuclear power stations in Russia must be upgraded from a safety point of view in accordance with the International Atomic Energy Agency’s (IAEA’s) safety standards. EU cooperation with Russia on upgrading the safety of nuclear power must become more effective.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is no doubt of its time and has come in for a lot of attention. I wish, in conclusion, to thank Mr Belder for his constructive cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission has decided to threaten Russia with a trade boycott if it does not agree to extending this agreement to the future Member States. There will not be much cooperation left if we end up squabbling over the partnership in this manner!</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy on Russia has failed badly. Nothing concrete has been achieved for several years, apart from the Kaliningrad question. The eastward expansion of the EU and NATO will reduce Russia’s sphere of influence and its trade by hundreds of millions of dollars. Given this situation, Moscow has mentioned 14 areas of concern, such as transition periods for customs tariffs. We, the old Member States, are now imposing transition periods with regard to the workforce in the new Member States. The Union has not agreed to one of these. To reciprocate, Russia will not sanction the Kyoto Agreement and is putting pressure on relations with the minority in the Baltic region.</p>
<p class="contents">A trade boycott would cause great harm to certain Member States as a result of an increase in the costs of raw materials. Other countries would suffer less, some not at all, but my country, for example, would, as the share of trade with Russia is enormous there and we also have some experience in a history of dealing with difficult relations.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Russia is actually up against the wall as a result of this trade policy threat, while at the same time there are two kinds of expansion taking place. We are pushing our way into Russia’s trading zones.</p>
<p class="contents">The country has just voted in a more nationalistic parliament than ever and the current presidential election campaign smacks of the same. The EU ministerial troika now has to take the initiative and make a suitable proposal to resolve this issue prior to the summit, because this is an area of cooperation where we have to find new approaches. We cannot force democracy on Russia: it will come about through wider channels of cooperation. The best and most effective approach of all is to try to have an influence directly on President Putin, who has a key role in everything that happens, as was said just now. This again will require cooperation, not boycotts. I understand the criticism regarding Chechnya and Sasnovibor, for example, but they are part of the very cooperation that we must now build and eventually obtain results from, so that the benefits are discernible on both sides and in order to end all these peculiar threats, which are inappropriate with regard to the sort of cooperation we need in this day and age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are nevertheless prepared to accept some amendments. On the other hand, we hope there is support by the other groups for our own amendment, which concerns the position of national minorities in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently we in the European Union have been pondering our relations with Russia. The conclusion we have jointly come to is that the formally adopted strategy has not worked satisfactorily. The main reason for this is that the Union has been incapable of showing any united front in its dealings with Russia, but instead some Member States, the bigger ones in particular, have been inclined to go their own way. This situation has to be rectified.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another key reason for our failings, something that has been given too little attention in our deliberations. In the Union there is insufficient knowledge or understanding of the political situation in Russia. Russia, at least up till now, has not complied with the diplomatic and political principles that we and other Western countries take for granted. This has been evident, for example, in the fact that Russia has been adamant about not agreeing to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement to the new Member States of the EU. Perhaps the threat of sanctions would not have the desired effect either, but might instead lead to a trade war in which the Member States of the EU might come off worse than Russia. I have not noticed any such threat being made as yet, however, although it has perhaps been discussed at times.</p>
<p class="contents">Calm and patience are needed in relations with Russia. To be able to realise our own objectives effectively and keep a watch over our own interests, we always have to consider the special political circumstances that obtain in Russia, hard and wearisome though that sometimes is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is an unacceptable situation in Chechnya, where the Russian army is engaged in gross violations of human rights. There are disturbing internal political changes within Russia, with what is termed ‘managed democracy’ increasingly taking on authoritarian characteristics, and we also take a highly critical line on Russia’s dealings with the new Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union formerly adopted a two-track strategy in its dealings with Russia; underlying it was the fact that Russia is – and must be – one of our most important strategic partners. A two-track strategy does not of course mean that we refrain from criticism – on the contrary; it is when strategic relationships are being developed that there has to be a central role for engagement with our canon of values, for the upholding of democracy, of the standards associated with the rule of law, and of human rights. At the same time, though, it was also our concern to achieve the sustainable mutual interconnection of Russia and the European Union, and not only by means of the partnership and cooperation agreement. I think this would not be the moment to put question marks against this strategy; in so doing, we would be letting go of the opportunities we have for really getting to grips with internal political developments or with the situation in Chechnya. Moreover, I believe, we ought to be far more serious about concerning ourselves with social conditions in Russia. The life expectancy of men in Russia has decreased by ten years over the past twelve years – a tragic development, and one that characterises the situation in many parts of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I endorse Mr Belder’s criticisms of Russian policy, I would have liked the report to have made more explicit what he said in his speech just now, with his trenchant criticism of the Council’s actions and of the European governments whose dealings with Russia are based on economic rather than strategic considerations. Ever since 11 September, many governments – and not only Mr Berlusconi’s, but also the German Federal Government – have been allowing the war in Chechnya to be trivialised as part of the war on terrorism, and so we keep quiet about it.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it is enough to think of Russia as a strategic partner only in the economic sense or in terms of securing our borders and preventing trafficking in human beings. Our relations with Russia have to be characterised by mutuality and interpenetration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that relations between the EU and Russia are now more unpredictable than for a time is the fault of both sides. It would be worrying if Russia were to become our own Middle East, and, because of European dependence on energy, we were prepared to allow human rights violations such as those played out in the tragedy that is Chechnya to continue from one year to the next, and accept the increased risks attached to the transportation of oil, the collapse of nuclear safety, and the alarming restrictions on civil liberties. The crucial issue here is freedom of speech, and one only has to go by Russia’s track record on other political rights to reach a reliable conclusion on that. An independent media and judiciary are vital to allow a robust civil society to develop in Russia, which has never yet been a true nation-state.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU does not seem to have any coherent or consistent policy with regard to Russia; neither are issues given any sort of priority. That is also shown by the way the Union’s Northern Dimension has been neglected, although it embraces regional cooperation, especially in Baltic and Arctic areas, which is vitally important for the stability of the EU’s neighbouring regions and the common stability that results from that, and although its importance will only increase as the Union is now expanding to include the Baltic countries. The Northern Dimension is certainly different from Kaliningrad, which is symbolised, for example, by the Sami people who live in the Arctic region that stretches from Norway to Russia and who at the same time are the EU’s only indigenous people.</p>
<p class="contents">Ending on a positive note, let it be said that our land border with Russia has been remarkably peaceful and free of problems, and the EU does not really deserve the credit for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing a recommendation to the Council in the Council’s absence, which is itself not a good sign of the Council’s potential interest in such an important question. However, I think we are having a rich debate, certainly richer than what the press is reporting today, noting the remarks made by Mr Chirac, who seems to think Europe lacks respect for Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">But which Russia? The Russia of the new parliamentary elections? Elections where, as some of our fellow Members have pointed out, we have seen a virtual monopoly – even more so than in Serbia – of ‘nationalist parties’, as we say when we want to be tactful, although we know that, generally speaking, they are literally fascist parties. But we cannot say that because we are talking about Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with what a number of other Members have said: Mr Arvidsson, Mr Brie, Mr Wuori and others, who listed a number of small things that are not going right, I do not think there is much that is going right. The elections to the Russian Duma have shown that. So far as the presidential elections are concerned, we cannot speak of an election campaign because no such campaign has taken place. We all witnessed the scandal of the Rybkin affair, a candidate who was kidnapped, abducted to a foreign country, drugged and sent back. There was the scandal surrounding the candidature of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who is undeniably one of Russia’s greatest entrepreneurs. We would not have tolerated one tenth of one quarter of what was done to him. I think the Strasbourg Court will be bound to agree, but sadly it will be three years before then, by which time the fate of Mr Khodorkovsky’s business and of Mr Khodorkovsky himself will have been sealed.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a question for Mr Patten. Mr Patten, at what point must we speak of a human rights violation? When 20% of a population of a million people have been wiped out, is that a human rights violation, genocide or a disaster of biblical proportions? I think we speak of human rights violations when we find a number of serious breaches of laws that are known and generally respected. But when, as we have seen in Chechnya, we find that 200 000 people have been killed in nine years, with tens of thousands of cases of torture and rape, that is no longer a human rights violation, it is genocide. I think a lot of honourable Members, myself included, are somewhat reluctant to use the word genocide. We all know why. What happened in Europe 60 years was genocide. What happened in Rwanda was genocide. And what is happening today in Chechnya is genocide, and, Commissioner Patten, has nothing to do with human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Belder, and many other fellow Members who, I think, in the end were forced to admit that what is happening in Chechnya and in Russia is no longer about human rights violations and a lack of democracy. It is something far worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the values, today finds us criticising the way in which democracy and the rule of law are developing, as well as the situation in Chechnya, but, in so doing, we must not lose sight of our many shared interests. Now that the European Union is enlarging, it is vital that the borders between the European Union and Russia should not become new barricades; instead, we should also use them as bridges and as a means whereby the partnership and cooperation agreement may be extended. Our provision of aid is important, for it also helps to promote liberalisation within Russia. It is important that Russia should be able to join the WTO – in the same way as everyone else rather than subject to special conditions – and, if the normal conditions apply, then we should also support it in doing so. We have shared interests in energy, security and the combating of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">This, I think, is something we should make clear, and we should not allow the situation in Belarus to result in energy not being supplied to the European Union as contractually agreed. In many areas, the enlargement of the EU does not create a new situation, and we should not confuse the issues. The continuation of the partnership and cooperation agreement after the European Union is enlarged must not mean that we accept claims for compensation arising out of trade issues, for then the whole world could do likewise, and I do not believe that a precedent of this kind would be acceptable; the question also arises of whether the figures Russia has produced are correct.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to make it clear, though, that the Baltic States’ negotiation of accession to the European Union has helped to put minorities there in a position not shared by minorities in many other parts of the world and perhaps not in certain parts of Russia. The issue of the minorities cannot be an excuse for delaying the signature of the border treaties or, in any case, for delaying their ratification. This has to be done now, and for that clarity is needed. Both by means of technology and through cooperation, we should help Russia to establish exemption from visa requirements, but this must be done in such a way that the Schengen standards for the acceding countries can be maintained, in order to maintain internal security.</p>
<p class="contents">In doing this, we should work for good relations with Russia, and recognise that it can be a factor for stability only if we accept that it, too, possesses territorial stability. This is something else we have to take on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I will not reiterate here all of the many points raised in the text. Mr Belder’s work was extremely thorough, in line with the Commission communications and Parliament’s previous resolutions on Russia. I will therefore limit myself to addressing two aspects contained in the report. The first is the lack of consistency between the governments of the Member States on this matter – a lack of consistency and a lack of coordination. When dealing with such a large and difficult partner as the Russian Federation, it is intolerable to hear EU ministers, even prime ministers or Council presidents, expressing differing opinions, for example on the painful war in Chechnya or on President Putin himself or on the elections. Such differing opinions, sometimes expressed only a few hours apart, weaken the Union and damage the credibility of its efforts to have a common foreign and security policy worthy of the name.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect I wanted to mention is also a lack of consistency, but this time between the Union’s different actions with regard to Russia. Our partnership and our strategy have many facets, which are reviewed in the report, but it all needs to be put in perspective with priorities and much more consistency. It is true that the EU and Russia have set themselves the long-term aim of creating a common economic space, a common space of freedom, security and justice, a common space of cooperation in the field of external security and a space of research and education, including cultural aspects. That is all very well, but once again it needs to be done consistently, which will require a great deal of determination, organisation and know-how: in other words, we still have a long way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As several people have said, there are good reasons for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Monday, we were able to ‘commemorate’ the 60th anniversary of Stalin’s deportation of the Chechens and, thus, also the 60th anniversary of a genocide that has never been properly acknowledged. We have also, in the last few days, been able to see how journalists of a critical disposition have been denied visas for Russia. These are journalists who wish to cover the election and who are not therefore being given an opportunity to offer a critical analysis of what is happening. We see other things. Mrs Malmström mentioned how, with a snap of his fingers, Putin dissolved the Russian Government. All these things mean that the situation is extremely worrying. There are good reasons for being very critical of what is happening in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">I sincerely support Mr Belder’s report but, conversely, I have, in recent days, been astonished that we can talk so clearly about Russia but so unclearly about China. I do not understand how, on the one hand, we can pursue a critical line – which I think is correct – on Russia and, on the other hand, consider lifting the arms embargo against China which, in my view, is more or less as difficult, troublesome and unreasonable as Russia in its behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that genocide has taken place, and is continuing to take place, in Tibet. I believe that the oppression of the Chinese people is without parallel. I believe that we are here seeing problems similar to, and in reality still greater than, those in Russia. Nonetheless, we are considering lifting the arms embargo.</p>
<p class="contents">In one way or another, the EU must ensure that its foreign policy is adjusted in such a way that the policy lines adopted are commensurate with the behaviour of the countries with which we work. I do not, moreover, think that this is the situation at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is entirely reasonable, but it seems that we have now forgotten another fundamental right, and that is every people’s right to self-determination.

It remains a major military power and deserves recognition on the global centre stage. Although economically it has shrunk, it is a vital source of gas and oil to the EU and has a common enemy in international Islamist terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Mr Putin will win the presidential election, and that we must recognise his democratic mandate to rebuild a strong Russian state. I do not accept calls to expel Russia from G8 because of its handling of the Yukos affair. Only two weeks ago the Russian courts handed down a lenient sentence to one of its executives convicted of tax evasion: hardly the signs of judicial bias.</p>
<p class="contents">I sympathise at the loss Russia faces with the ending of the bilateral free trade agreements with the acceding EU states, but overall, the tariffs drop from 9% to 4% and Russia cannot fail to extend the Partnership and Cooperation Agreements to the Baltic Republics because of disputes over ethnic Russian minority rights there. The Kaliningrad question is settled now and work on visa-free or flexible travel to the EU should commence once a readmission agreement is struck.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia sees the EU as muscling in on its sphere of influence from Georgia to Ukraine, hence its attempts to reconstitute some of the binding elements of the former Soviet Union in the Yalta agreement with Ukraine, Belarus – a country where Russia could use its special influence to do more to encourage democracy – and Kazakhstan. I also urge Russia to withdraw its troops from Transnistria, allow a peaceful reunification of Moldova and consign the Tiraspol gangster regime to the dustbins of history.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I am concerned that there has been mass migration west of ethnic Russians away from the far eastern territories, where Russia is attempting now to forge close links with Japan and Korea on resource exploitation. These ethnic Russians are being replaced by illegal Chinese migrants, a situation which may cause tensions in the future in that vast, under-populated but resource-rich territory. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no reason to have separate negotiations on that. If there are problems in economic and trade relations between the enlarged Union and Russia they can then be discussed separately between the Union and Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia is the EU’s most important neighbour. It is in the interests of both the Union and Russia that relations between them develop favourably in all areas of life. Furthermore, we must be able to discuss sensitive issues such as human rights. We must ensure that the Union is consistent in its policy on Russia and that in Russia they understand that the EU cannot be split politically. From the beginning of May, the Baltic countries that join the EU will form just as solid a part of the Union as the old Member States. Their condition for membership was fulfilment of the Copenhagen criteria regarding such matters as human rights and the rights of minorities. These conditions have been met. Moreover, Russia is committed to compliance with human rights as a member of the Organisation for Cooperation and Security in Europe and the Council of Europe. It is very important that there are assurances that the work of the OCSE in Chechnya can proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">Strategic cooperation based on common values has been spoken of with regard to relations between the EU and Russia. Perhaps such grand-sounding aims should move a step closer to something a bit more concrete. There are good grounds for that, too, as the EU will account for 55% of Russia’s foreign trade. The EU needs oil and natural gas so there is a need for cooperation on energy to be developed. The environment must play a part in that, whether it is a matter of energy production or its transportation.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the areas of cooperation mentioned at the St Petersburg Summit was research, education and culture. I am a firm supporter of more exchange programmes for researchers, teachers and students and cooperation between educational institutions. If we are to build sustainable cooperation our citizens will need to network with one another. Here too we will have to provide young people with the right facilities and opportunities. They cannot bear the burden of a divided world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the subject of freedom of the press, and I am pleased that Commissioner Patten mentioned this. </p>
<p class="contents">We know that, according to Russian law, there is freedom of the press in Russia, but there is a big gap between the law and everyday practice. The organisation Journalists Without Frontiers has published a list in connection with press freedom on which, out of 158 countries, Russia is in 148th place. Moreover, the situation is getting worse. Journalists are being murdered in Russia. According to the International Federation of Journalists, four journalists were killed in Russia last year alone and, since 1 January 2002, thirteen have been killed. </p>
<p class="contents">Obstacles are placed in the way of journalists’ work. I saw this for myself in St Petersburg in the run-up to the election for Governor when, for example, it was forbidden to show pictures, or quote the names of, candidates in the election. Recently, a Danish journalist was denied entry to Russia. Her crime was to have written critically of Russian conduct in Chechnya. </p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission and the Council to take press freedom seriously when the negotiations with Russia are begun. The attacks on freedom of expression that take place in Russia are unacceptable!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for that reason that I find this picture of the European Union’s relations with Russia all the more regrettable.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s relations with Russia are not a one-way street. They need to be optimised if the interests of the enlarged EU are to be given the same weight as Russia’s. It is also an indispensable requirement – let me repeat, an indispensable requirement – that the partnership and cooperation agreement, which has been in force since 1998, should now be extended to cover the European Union’s ten new Member States. What formerly stood in the way of this was the objection that the enlargement of the EU would put Russia at a disadvantage on the market, so that it demanded that compensation be paid. This line of argument really is questionable, as the enlargement of the European Union will automatically create, for Russia too, a market with a great deal of purchasing power, and that cannot fail to be good for its economy. Cooperation in decommissioning nuclear power stations that are ready for scrapping, or in the disposal of nuclear waste off the Kola peninsula and in the North Sea leaves something to be desired, to say the least, and it is far from clear why Russia has so far turned a deaf ear to the demands for safe tankers in the Baltic. What makes it astonishing that the alleged difficulties of the Russian minority in the Baltic states keep being brought up is the fact that both the OSCE and the Council of Europe believe that the problem is no longer there. By way of contrast, the OSCE was barred from entering Chechnya. The fact that most of the asylum seekers and refugees in Austria are Chechens can only be taken as an indication of how appalling the situation there is, although I do not want in any way to downplay the crimes committed by terrorists against the public in Russia. And, even though the EU has been very accommodating with regard to Kaliningrad, there has not to date been any agreement to take back refugees or illegal migrants.</p>
<p class="contents">With presidential elections now in the offing, I deliberately do not now want to discuss Russia’s internal politics – reference has already been made to ‘managed democracy’ – even though they must inevitably have an effect on relations between Russia and the EU. Even so, it does not make sense to keep quiet about problems when dealing with them cannot fail to help promote good relations between Russia and the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The controlled democracy that characterises Russia is a source of great concern. We are all aware that democracy has not secured a foothold in Russia and that a climate of fear has been created in which people who express independent political views in relation to President Putin are exposed to threats. People with considerable financial power have, in particular, ended up in difficulties with the judicial system.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise that the administrative resources and control of the media were such that the parliamentary elections for the Duma on 17 December 2003 can scarcely be said to have complied with international standards. An independent judiciary is required if it is to be possible to refer to Russia as a fully-fledged democracy. At present, the prosecuting authorities have no independence from the executive.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia must act internationally to close down its current military bases in Georgia and Moldova without delay. Russia must act constructively in the conflict in the South Caucasus, and I wish to issue a special appeal to the Russian Government to solve the protracted conflict between Turkey and Armenia and to promote reconciliation between the peoples of these countries. Turkey should also recognise the genocide to which the Armenian people was exposed between 1915 and 1918.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia has a special responsibility for developments in Belarus, a new neighbour of the enlarged EU, which can scarcely be described as a democracy but, rather, as a country under the authoritarian control of President Alexander Lukashenko.</p>

Dialogue and cooperation have been enshrined in a plethora of treaties and agreements in many international institutions, and partnership and cooperation agreements make meetings between the EU and Russia at the highest level a regular, and indeed fixed, occurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">I increasingly get the impression, though, that this comprehensive dialogue is becoming a fossilised and predictable ritual. I think it was Commissioner Patten who, a few months ago, told the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy that he had the impression that the speaking notes prepared for him on Russia had not substantially changed for some considerable time. Politics is, of course, always the art of the possible, and that means that one will always have to take an approach to a large country like Russia that differs from the approach one would take if a small country were misbehaving itself. In terms of proportion, one can certainly compare atrocities against civilians in Kosovo and in Chechnya, but it is obvious that our response to Russia will be different – as it indeed is. I would, however, ask the Council, as a matter of urgency, to address the issues that have not been satisfactorily resolved and are still on the agenda rather than dodging them – which is what it is doing, in a sense, by the mere fact of being absent from this debate. There can be no compromise where partnership and cooperation agreements are concerned, nor in relation to their adoption by, and extension to, all the new accession countries; Russia can, for example, take a good look at how customs tariffs change from what they were before, at a time when we had bilateral agreements with some of the candidate countries. Once they are in the EU, customs tariffs will fall. It follows that these countries’ accession to the European Union does not have only detrimental effects.</p>
<p class="contents">Many references have been made to Chechnya. There too, I believe, we should not merely allow ourselves the luxury of making appeals or of ignoring it outright. I have always taken the view that we have to find different ways of targeting the funds that we appropriate for cooperation with Russia. We must try to prop up the weak structures of civil society in Russia, in order that this society may undergo democratic change from the bottom up and not in the lamentable way we have seen in recent months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the two main lines pursued in the report. First, the reaffirmation of the desire to develop the vital partnership between the European Union and Russia. Russia is a big country and it is essential to develop economic relations with her in the areas of industry, research, health and energy. Common ambitions and objectives must be set, as the rapporteur proposes. They are of strategic and political importance. We must set priority objectives, such as cross-border cooperation in the fight against crime, defence of human rights, democracy, independence of news media and the rule of law, cooperation to resolve conflicts in the region and disarmament; we must also promote improvements to public health and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line pursued in the report seeks to be more critical, especially concerning basic freedoms and democratic rights in Russia. I agree with the rapporteur when he deplores the weakness of the Union’s role in the Chechen conflict, which has caused more than 200 000 deaths in ten years and is really genocide. The report calls on the Russian authorities to investigate the disappearances, torture and all violations of human rights. In November 2003, several of us intervened following President Berlusconi’s statements justifying the Russian military’s intervention policy. Europe must indeed play a much greater role in strongly and clearly condemning Russia in its handling of the war in Chechnya. There will not and cannot be a military solution in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">The desire for a partnership between the European Union and Russia must follow a plan that includes peace and security for all peoples. Europe can no longer be content with mere rhetoric. It must act and, from that point of view, the report is a step in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
