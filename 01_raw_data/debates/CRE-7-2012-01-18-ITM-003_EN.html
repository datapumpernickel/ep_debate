One of the greatest Europeans of our age, the late Czech President Václav Havel, said: ‘For twenty years now, Europe has no longer been severed in half. I firmly believe that it will never again allow itself to be divided but, on the contrary, will provide scope and initiative for ever-deeper solidarity and cooperation’.</p>
<p class="contents">Havel was Europe at its best: a champion of liberty and creativity; a guardian of rule of law and democracy; a driver of progress and integration; a helping hand to support the weak and vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">At this critical time in our history, it is our shared responsibility to fulfil Havel’s belief in Europe. We must do our part to fulfil, and to keep on advancing, Europe’s potential for peace, opportunity, freedom and prosperity. That is the challenge facing Europe as Denmark takes over the Presidency of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been looking forward to speaking to you today as Prime Minister of Denmark but also as a former member of this great, unique Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Every day, in the political engine room of this House, decisions are taken that form the building blocks of tomorrow’s Europe. As in any parliament, there are lines of division and heated debates – as there should be. But what makes this assembly special is the commitment to Europe and its citizens that runs through the veins of the majority of its members. You are a parliament of Europe and for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been truly fulfilling for me to be part of the crucial work that you do here. I was honoured to serve in improving Europeans’ right of movement, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in furthering European integration as part of the European Convention that led to the Lisbon Treaty. And it was a particular pleasure in that context – and a privilege – to be active in achieving the changes which have significantly and rightly enhanced the legislative powers of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the coming six months, I ask for your support, your cooperation and your partnership. This will be crucial if we are to achieve real progress on the heavy agenda in front of us all.</p>
<p class="contents">I belong to a generation that was young in the Eighties. For many it was a time of hardship, with high unemployment and limited job opportunities, especially for the young, who were also disadvantaged by cut-backs in our education systems. We were sometimes described as ‘the no-future generation’. But in Europe, we saw a path to a more prosperous and promising future. We saw leaders of vision and vigour, like Havel. And, as the years passed, Europe delivered the conditions which brought the single market, which helped to breach the Berlin Wall and promote the reunification of Germany, which produced the Maastricht Treaty and secured European enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of the gloom and pessimism came an era of growth, progress and optimism. Europe inspired the world with a truly unique model of cooperation. This is an achievement which we must be proud of when we recall that, just a few decades ago, Europe moved from being a continent of repeated conflict and division to a Union of 27 nations based on openness, rule of law and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We, in our Union, have created an unparalleled framework for decision-making at the European level – the Community method – that enables us to raise standards of freedom, fairness in economies and societies without diminishing the diversity of cultures and communities. And the common values of solidarity, participation and inclusion form the keystone of that construction.</p>
<p class="contents">For us they are not only noble ideals – they are practical working realities. That is why we have built a Europe with a strong social dimension. We aim at both prosperity and solidarity because we know that, in the modern world, they are not merely desirable: they are interdependent. In this century, even more than in the past, justice, care and opportunity are components of efficiency, while efficiency is the vital source of investment in justice, care and opportunity. That mixture is at the core of the European success.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I draw very particular attention to it today not only to honour our past but – more importantly – to give confidence and guidance to our future.</p>
<p class="contents">No one here needs to be told that Europe is in a profound economic crisis that has rocked the very foundation of our cooperation. Growth is low. Debt is high. Businesses are struggling. Jobs are being lost. Insecurity has become part of everyday life for millions of European families. And, because of the nature of the current afflictions, citizens throughout Europe are experiencing, and will experience, cutbacks and reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must confront the economic challenge with decisive action to restore confidence in Europe; to create a new foundation for growth and progress; to ensure the long-term viability of the European model. We owe it to all generations throughout Europe but in particular we owe it to our youth.</p>
<p class="contents">What our youth demand of us is only fair: access to the same education and job opportunities that previous generations have enjoyed. A chance to contribute to their societies and to build a secure future. They will work for that – but they can only be sure of achieving it if we encourage and enable them to do so. If we want them to be providers for us in the future, we must be providers for them in the present. That is the contract between generations. We must honour it with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">And we have to show the same steady resolve in ensuring robust public finances, because robust public finances are the true bulwark against short-sighted speculation. The only sustainable future for our social market economies is to embrace change and increase competitiveness. The essential basis for that is stability that fosters growth, and opportunity that maximises innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Restraint in spending is not a departure from solidarity – in present conditions, it is a precondition for dependable solidarity. I am certain that a great majority of people understand that, and are prepared to be part of it, if it is fairly applied. People are ready to make sacrifices, but they will not be sacrificed. People will accept austerity with justice, but they will resist austerity that is manifestly unequal and unfair. As leaders of Europe, we must work in that knowledge and respond to that reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s destiny is Denmark’s destiny. This has been the leitmotif for Denmark’s European engagement for decades. Forty years ago, Denmark was part of the first enlargement of the Community and our new partners trusted us with the Presidency the very same year that we became a member. Thirty years ago, Denmark held the Presidency in a period of Cold War and economic uncertainty, but also in the first period with an elected European Parliament. Twenty years ago, we held the Presidency at a time when the single market was launched. And 10 years ago, Denmark held the Presidency when the EU fulfilled its historic obligation and united Europe. Like now, these were crucial periods in the history of the European Union. In the coming six months, we will again work hard to move Europe forward.</p>
<p class="contents">European citizens expect their political leaders to act, and rightly so. We must keep one thing in mind: democratic politics are judged by results, not by intentions. The Danish Presidency will work tirelessly during the next six months to ensure that the EU continues to produce tangible, useful results: results that benefit all Europeans, young and old, students and workers, in the North and in the South.</p>
<p class="contents">To illustrate that, I want to highlight our key priorities. Firstly, the Danish Presidency will aim at ensuring a responsible European economy. That is the only path out of the crisis. We need to put Europe back on track so that we can ensure the prosperity and security of our citizens. This requires discipline and political will from all of us to implement and comply with the new rules of economic governance. We need a modern and responsible budget, and we must bring public deficits under control.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we will work for a more dynamic Europe. Growth in Europe must be restored and sustained. We need to stimulate long-term growth and job creation, not least for our younger generation. Modernising and developing the single market will be a key part of this effort. Looking outward, we must do more to help our companies exploit trade opportunities with the emerging economies outside Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we will work for a greener Europe. The EU has developed an ambitious policy on energy and climate issues. We are a leader on the global stage in this field but, to maintain our position and to encourage others, we need new initiatives in areas such as energy efficiency and renewable energy. Think about it: more than 20 million jobs are linked to the environment in one way or another. There is a huge potential here, but we face a real risk that high-tech research and knowledge-intensive jobs will move out of Europe to more attractive regions. The Danish Presidency will work hard to ensure that the centre of green research and green jobs stays in Europe in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we will work for a safe Europe. In a globalised world, only a joint European effort will be truly effective. To ensure the safety and freedoms of our citizens we need to work in that area: to combat terrorism and cross-border crime; to manage our borders; to establish a well-functioning European Asylum System.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond our own region, the EU’s voice must be heard – and heard even more clearly – as we promote our common values and protect our interests. The Presidency will support and assist the High Representative and the European External Action Service. Budget discipline, growth and jobs, green policies, and ensuring the safety of our citizens and the voice of Europe in the world: these are our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be bold and ambitious. In the middle of an economic crisis I do not expect the Danish Presidency to be easy. But I can assure you that the Presidency will not be daunted either. We are not built like that.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, a Presidency cannot fulfil its ambition on its own. We need active cooperation from all stakeholders – the Member States, the European institutions and civil society. We need a European Union that is united in meeting and overcoming the challenges facing us today. Your input and your support in this Parliament will be critical in this effort.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stand here today, as Prime Minister of Denmark, I can assure you of my personal commitment to Europe. I am a European at heart and, most of all, I am a European for my children. I know that ultimately their security, opportunity and liberty will depend upon the safety, the life chances and the freedom of their generation everywhere. The Union is the best implement for helping to spread and strengthen those conditions in our own continent and throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate measure of our Union and our solidarity is not where we stand in moments of comfort. It is where we stand in moments of challenge. This is such a time. As I have stressed today, the challenge facing the EU today is basically threefold.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we need to rely on the strong rules and institutions for decision-making that are already firmly established in our Union. We are a Union based on cooperation, rule of law and democracy. During times of crisis, when tough decisions and compromises need to made, these fundamentals – our Community method – are more important than ever. Relying on our fundamental rules and procedures is not only in the interest of small Member States like Denmark. It is what sets our Union apart. It is what makes our cooperation so strong and so durable. That is in the interest of all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must maintain that Europe is part of the solution to the current crisis, not the problem. The path out of this crisis goes through more Europe, not less Europe. In current conditions, to be inward-looking is to be blind to reality. It is up to the leaders of Europe to show this to our citizens and to the outside world. It is the practicality of Europe that will restore faith in our European project.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must bring Europe through to the other side of the crisis with our values intact. Fiscal restraint is crucial to stabilise our economies and restore confidence. But when the social market economic model has proven so successful for us over the decades, it must continue to be our guiding principle through and beyond the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the current crisis has put the European Union to the test. The countries of the eurozone have taken on a huge responsibility in securing economic stability in our region. The Fiscal Compact will play a key role in stabilising the euro. This is also in the clear interest of the European Union. However, the crisis should not lead us astray. On the contrary, it is more evident than ever that we share a common destiny. It is of paramount importance that we work together and stand together. If we are to realise Václav Havel’s vision of cooperation and solidarity, we need to secure a Europe at work again. Together, we will do that.</p>
