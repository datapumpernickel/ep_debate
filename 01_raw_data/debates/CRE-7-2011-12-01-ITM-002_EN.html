<p class="contents">The Commission fully shares your concern and your commitment to improving the lives of people living with HIV/AIDS in Europe and beyond. The resolution is a strong and timely political signal underlining that, 30 years into the epidemic, HIV/AIDS still needs urgent attention. Last year alone, 25 000 people got infected in the EU and more than 100 000 new cases were reported in the Eastern Neighbourhood.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is committed to working towards universal access to prevention, treatment and care to support achieving the Millennium Development Goals targets by 2015. Let me reassure you that fighting HIV/AIDS remains high on the Commission’s agenda, following the adoption two years ago of our strategy and action plan on combating HIV/AIDS in the EU and neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Since then, the Commission has supported a number of initiatives in this field to help Member States and stakeholders across Europe through the Health Programme, the development programmes and bilateral agreements with third countries. Indeed, evidence-based prevention, access to testing, treatment and care, and fighting discrimination are the core elements of our response to HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also fostered mechanisms to coordinate HIV/AIDS policies and actions, such as the HIV/AIDS Think-Tank and the Civil Society Forum. Two years on, the overall Strategy and Action Plan to combat HIV/AIDS remains valid, and the Commission will report on its implementation early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Especially in times of economic difficulties, we must not lose sight of HIV/AIDS. The Commission will continue to play its full and active role now and in the future. I take this opportunity to stress that HIV features prominently in the Commission proposal for a new Health Programme which Parliament will be debating soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our Parliament felt that it was very important that we adopt this resolution in order to send a strong message.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the AIDS epidemic is on the decline worldwide and is probably far less visible, we must not let our guard down: it remains a blight today. It affects over 12 million young people aged 15 to 25, including 500 000 in Europe, and so we need to rally all our political forces.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Dalli has just said, the European Commission adopted an action plan to combat HIV/AIDS for the period 2009-2013. A mid-term review is important because it will allow us to take stock and identify exactly what progress has been made. The reality is that over 50 000 new cases of HIV are diagnosed every year in the European Union and neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the Union, almost 30% of those who are HIV-positive do not know that they are infected – the figure is as high as 70% in several neighbouring countries. Consequently, this is a serious problem for political decision makers, which means us. Half of HIV-positive patients are still treated late, reaching advanced stages of infection before being diagnosed and starting treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, recent findings show that the risk of transmitting the virus to uninfected partners can be reduced by 96% if patients take retroviral drugs from the moment when HIV is diagnosed, rather than when their health begins to decline.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, it is imperative that the European Union maintain its commitment so as to avoid negating the progress and investments made thus far. We need to beef up prevention and training. We need to improve surveillance. We need to work tirelessly to create networks linking all the stakeholders working to combat this curse. We must also promote the dissemination of good practices and, among other things, make sure that simple yet effective tests are available for our citizens. If these tests become widely available, I think that it will be much easier for everyone to find out whether they are carrying the virus.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the challenge facing us. I feel that it is imperative that we remain vigilant and continue our efforts to combat HIV/AIDS. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an opportunity for us to unite in the fight against HIV, to show our support for people living with HIV, and to commemorate those who have died. HIV/AIDS remains of major public health importance in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I am calling for the EU to implement the strategy on combating HIV/AIDS in the European Union and neighbouring countries. We need stronger action to reduce new infections, over 25 000 of which were recorded in 2009. An estimated 30% of people with HIV/AIDS are unaware they carry the virus. Therefore, we need to increase HIV testing amongst most-at-risk populations, such as young people, homosexual men, injecting drug users, sex workers and prisoners.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 2007 and 2010, a new HIV testing programme in the US was carried out aimed at hard-to-reach groups and high-risk populations. Testing took place in a range of settings: emergency departments, STI clinics, substance abuse clinics and community-based organisations. Whilst most testing was carried out in clinical settings, conducted by community-based organisations as part of the programme, it yielded a disproportionate number of new diagnoses, indicating the importance of supporting community-based organisations to improve rates of HIV diagnosis. We must guarantee access to HIV prevention, counselling, testing and early care, and, most of all, support a community-based approach.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also calling for more action to tackle stigma and discrimination. People living with HIV/AIDS should be included in all equality and anti-discriminatory legislation. A 2010 UNAIDS survey reported that those living with HIV experienced high levels of negative attitudes and behaviours, as well as employment discrimination, including loss of work. Exclusion from family activities was reported by more than 40% of respondents. We must remember that the enemy is HIV, not HIV carriers.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should also provide a policy framework to encourage national governments to address the issue of HIV/AIDS in the context of sexual health strategies. We need adequate information and sex education, access to protection means, such as male and female condoms, and strengthening the rights of women in sexual relationships. In an Irish context, I regret we still have not developed a national sexual health strategy. Of course, the active participation and involvement of people living with HIV at all levels of the national and international response is crucial to the success of all our efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to thank my fellow co-sponsors on this question, and especially my colleague, Michael Cashman, who has worked so hard on this issue for so long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Progress still needs to be made, whether in prevention, early diagnosis or timely access to treatment. The situation within our Union is even more worrying in certain regions, notably Eastern Europe, while at the same time, the disease tends to be forgotten in the minds of people and policy makers. Thirty years after the first detection of AIDS, it is still crucial to underline the importance of greater awareness-raising and information, the need for strengthened and targeted prevention policies and the need for governments in the EU to remain committed.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, we welcome the Commission’s commitment and continuous effort in implementing its strategy to combat HIV/AIDS, but we hope that you will make clear to Member States that having a strategy just on paper is not enough. Even during a time of crisis, national AIDS programmes need to be effectively financed and implemented. Let us also look at the reality and focus on the right priorities. There is no room for taboo or forbidden topics. It is crucial that Member States ensure that all national AIDS programmes and strategies develop strong linkages between sexual and reproductive health and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me say a word about the resolution that we will be voting on today and which has been broadly supported by all groups within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Yes, there are vulnerable groups that are more at risk, notably young people, men who have sex with men, and injecting drug users, which deserve all our attention and for which targeted strategies should be developed and reinforced. These groups become more vulnerable when subjected to social exclusion, stigmatisation and discrimination, from which people living with HIV are too often suffering. It is certainly not by denying the existence of these groups or by refusing to speak about anti-discrimination campaigns that we will succeed in our continuous fight against HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that all Members of this House will abstain from ideological consideration and will support the resolution as a whole. Today is World AIDS Day, an occasion to recall and maintain our consistent and unambiguous commitment in combating HIV/AIDS in Europe and beyond.</p>

Our common objective is to reduce the number of HIV infections, for statistics do not support the notion that this is what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">In the EU countries, tens of thousands of new cases are confirmed every year, and if we include our neighbouring countries, the number of new cases a year is in excess of 100 000. However, this is a disease that is completely preventable, and we know how to do this. The main reason why everything that can be done to prevent new HIV infections is not being done is hypocrisy.</p>
<p class="contents">A few years ago, I was in South Africa and I happened to see a television advertisement in which Nelson Mandela said that we speak to our children about sex because we love them. Mandela was obviously referring to the fact that young people and people in general could protect themselves from HIV. They need to know about sex and they need to know, for example, that a condom will protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">The experience of my own country, Finland, is that sex education in schools and the open debate generally on sex, together with comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services, are an effective way to reduce the number of problems relating to sexual behaviour, from abortions to sexually transmitted infections, including HIV. That is why sexual and reproductive health services are so vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members have already referred to the position of women. Statistics show that 45% of those newly infected are young women under the age of 25. This clearly shows that the issue also concerns gender roles and whether women have the knowledge and courage to insist on the use of a condom in their sexual relations. Testing obviously plays a crucial part in the prevention of new infections, because people who are not aware that they are infected are three times more likely to spread the disease. Similarly, treatment is crucially important, for example, in preventing the infection from being passed on from breastfeeding or expectant mothers to their children, and the prevention of discrimination is important from the perspective of treatment, as some Members have already mentioned. I hope that we can add to our general objectives and set concrete goals, as the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) has done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking about World AIDS/HIV Day, and this evaluation of the resolution and communication of 2009 is crucial. It is crucial precisely because of things that have already been mentioned. We are repeating ourselves because, unfortunately, there is still room for repetition, which means a lot remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many new cases diagnosed every year in Europe and in the European Economic Area: the 2010 report talks about more than 25 000 new cases. If we take into account neighbouring countries, we are talking about over 100 000 new cases. Moreover, if we think that some things are as bad as they can be, they can always get worse.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that I would like to make very clear here has to do with the divestment that has been taking place in the health care sector because of the economic and financial crisis that we are currently experiencing. This divestment has been having a very serious effect on areas crucial to combating HIV/AIDS. Therefore, Commissioner, I think that the Commission has a key role here in calling on the Member States to meet their obligations in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">A second issue has to do with the increased discrimination that the economic and social crisis has also brought to light; discrimination against workers who have lost their jobs because they are carriers of this virus. That is why prevention, treatment and care should be the same for everyone, regardless of sex or age, and regardless of the region in which they live. I hope we will be able to implement these measures with your support, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While that number remains relatively low, figures released this week show a rise of 20%, with the majority of new cases being diagnosed among men.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of these figures and the World Health Organisation’s confirmation that 33.4 million people worldwide live with HIV, including 2.1 million children, it is my belief that education throughout Member States is vital for prevention, which, alongside early diagnosis and access to treatment, can play an essential part in limiting the spread of HIV. It is time to eradicate people’s fear of being tested for the HIV virus. Due to the stigma and fear attached to an HIV-positive diagnosis, people are coming forward for testing after the point at which treatment for their infection should have begun, which greatly worsens their prognosis.</p>
<p class="contents">The advances in HIV treatment in the last 30 years since the virus emerged have been massive, but too many people still test late and fail to benefit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, on World AIDS Day 2011, when we are marking the fight against AIDS, the European Union and the Member States are joining people around the world in commemorating relatives, friends and loved ones lost to AIDS, and reiterating their commitment to supporting all people living with HIV and those affected by the AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, we are celebrating a special anniversary: it was exactly 30 years ago that the world learned about HIV and AIDS. In December 1981, the first cases of AIDS were discovered. During these 30 years of struggle and sacrifice for millions of people, over 30 million people have lost their lives and 16 million children have been orphaned due to AIDS. HIV and AIDS have affected every country and many communities and families. It is estimated that there are currently 33.3 million people living with HIV worldwide, and that each day, 7 000 people are infected with AIDS, mainly in low and medium-income countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The last 30 years have also been a time of engagement and partnership to a hitherto unseen extent. The fight against HIV has taught us the significance of partnership and dialogue, and we have learned that human rights and human dignity should always be in the spotlight. Impressive progress has led to a decrease of nearly 20% in the number of new HIV infections worldwide in the last decade, and to a decrease of almost 19% in the number of AIDS-related deaths in the years 2004-2009. The greatest progress has been made in the area most affected, that is, in the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, home to two thirds of all people infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is proud of the fact that the efforts it has undertaken, together with key partners such as UNAIDS, the WHO, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, UNITAID, people living with HIV and civil society, have helped to achieve remarkable advances in the global fight against HIV and AIDS. In 2010, the European Union’s contribution to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria amounted to nearly USD 1.5 billion, which represents 53% of total contributions to this fund (taking into account total contributions from the European Commission and the Member States).</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, more than 8 million people living in low and medium-income countries still need access to effective treatment, and the number of new infections still exceeds the number of people entering therapy. This means that HIV and AIDS are still one of the biggest barriers these countries face on their road towards development. In seven countries, including five countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, the number of HIV infections increased by more than 25% between 2001 and 2009. Through partnerships with these countries, the European Union will intensify its efforts to change this intolerable situation, calling for the urgent stepping up of prevention programmes and services at regional and national level, which may help to eradicate HIV and AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will play a decisive role in the fight against HIV and AIDS by strengthening its leading position, and by better adapting the activities of the institutions of the European Union to the changing context as regards HIV at global and European level. The challenge for us now is to retain AIDS as a priority and to accelerate actions taken at global, regional, national and local level in order to end this epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union welcomes the comprehensive review of progress made in terms of meeting the obligations arising from all the Millennium Development Goals of the year 2000, and the ambitious targets for 2015 as set out in the political declaration on HIV/AIDS entitled ‘Intensifying Our Efforts to Eliminate HIV/AIDS’, adopted at the high-level meeting of the United Nations General Assembly on AIDS in June 2011. Achieving these objectives will bring us closer to a world with no new HIV infections, no AIDS-related deaths and no discrimination. The European Union joins the community of people taking action against the AIDS epidemic by supporting the UNAIDS strategy: zero new infections, zero discrimination and zero HIV/AIDS-related deaths – ‘Getting to zero’ – and, on the occasion of World AIDS Day, it confirms its willingness to participate in achieving the joint task of defeating the HIV epidemic. We reaffirm the commitment of the European Union to working towards the 2015 targets, which include the initiation of antiretroviral therapy in 15 million people infected with HIV, a halving of the number of sexually transmitted infections, a halving of the number of HIV infections among intravenous drug users, the elimination of mother-to-child HIV transmission and a significant reduction in the number of AIDS-related maternal deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union stresses that prevention is the most effective way to halt the HIV epidemic. We need to ensure that preventive strategies are comprehensive, and are developed on the basis of available knowledge with full respect for human rights and understanding of the local context, making the fullest possible use of existing methods of prevention and, at the same time, promoting new methods and technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union notes with concern the fact that women and girls are particularly vulnerable to HIV infection due to physiological, economic and social factors, inequalities and gender-related violence. Women and girls constitute more than 50% of all people living with HIV, and HIV and AIDS remain the most important cause of morbidity and mortality for women of child-bearing age. The European Union will therefore step up its activities to promote an approach which takes into account issues relating to gender, gender equality and the empowerment of women, as well as actions to promote women’s rights, in particular, the right to protect themselves against hazardous sexual behaviour, especially in the context of combating human trafficking and all forms of sexual exploitation. At the same time, attention should be paid to promoting responsible behaviour, especially among men.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union draws particular attention to populations most at risk of infection, including men who have sexual relations with men, intravenous drug users, migrants, prisoners, ethnic minorities, persons providing paid sexual services and their clients. These populations are often marginalised and it can be difficult to reach out to them, which increases their vulnerability to HIV infection.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we note with concern that most young people still have only limited access to programmes on sexual and reproductive health, providing information, skills, services and social support. It is vital to ensure wide access to specially designed prevention programmes and services, including confidential HIV testing and counselling, high-quality male and female condoms at affordable prices, comprehensive sex education, harm reduction programmes and other available prevention measures. While planning effective HIV prevention and care, one should not forget about the prevention and treatment of other sexually transmitted infections, including hepatitis B and C and tuberculosis.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for closer cooperation in this area, and the inclusion of HIV and AIDS programmes in basic health care, including programmes on sexual and reproductive health, and a strengthening of programmes and services related to the prevention and treatment of all these diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union recognises the need for greater involvement of people living with HIV or AIDS in all aspects of the planning, implementation and monitoring of prevention and support policies, strategies and programmes. We are aware of the crucial role played by non-governmental organisations, including organisations which bring together people and groups affected by HIV to support national and local actions in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union welcomes the substantial increase in the availability of antiretroviral treatment. However, it notes with concern the differences in availability from region to region. Currently, more than 6.5 million people in low and medium-income countries are receiving antiretroviral treatment. However, there are still 8 million people who are eligible for medical treatment but who are deprived of the opportunity to receive such treatment. The results of recent research on the effectiveness of antiretroviral drugs have opened up more opportunities for HIV prevention and make it possible to fight the epidemic more effectively. We wish to emphasise our commitment to universal access to antiretroviral treatment, care and support for people living with HIV or AIDS, and the importance of involvement and investment at national level, taking into account respect for the dignity, rights and freedoms of HIV-infected persons.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union welcomes the significant decrease in the number of new mother-to-child transmitted HIV infections. We reaffirm our commitment to actions aimed at universal access to the prevention of vertical infections in order to eliminate HIV infections among children and to save the lives of their mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union reaffirms that all persons living with HIV or AIDS, in particular, children and young people, should be able to benefit from the best available methods of care, treatment and support. Once again, we emphasise the need to integrate issues relating to HIV/AIDS and reproductive and sexual health rights into strategies and programmes at local, national, regional and international level. The Member States should protect persons living with HIV or AIDS against discrimination, stigmatisation and deprivation of their rights and freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU also confirms its commitment to, and support for, the abolition of restrictions on the right of entry and short- and long-term residence for people living with HIV, and the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the elimination of laws punishing it, since such legislation neither provides appropriate tools to fight the epidemic nor supports populations particularly vulnerable to infection.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union acknowledges that in times of economic crisis, the appropriate allocation of available resources, including health promotion and preventive actions, is a key issue. We therefore reiterate our firm commitment to increasing the effectiveness and efficiency of programmes and services that have already been implemented, and to strengthening national health care systems and the human resources necessary to provide health care, education and social services, which are critical for the prevention and treatment of HIV infections and care and support for people living with HIV/AIDS and their support. Only by continuing our work and stepping up high-quality and effective measures, and by remedying existing shortcomings in all regards, will the European Union as a whole, and each of its Member States individually, be able to contribute significantly to reducing the number of new infections, instances of stigmatisation and discrimination and AIDS-related deaths. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This strong message has become increasingly important nowadays, due to the austerity measures that Europe is undergoing, which call for a reduction of many of the resources that were being allocated to the health sector. Our message today needs to focus on budget cuts in our countries that tackle the squandering of money and not the reduction of funds for programmes such as HIV/AIDS, especially in light of the considerable investment required for its prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">These last few years have witnessed substantial progress in the battle against this illness. However, we are still nowhere near to fulfilling our main objective of a zero figure in terms of new infections, zero deaths due to AIDS, and zero discrimination. Nonetheless, I can guarantee full commitment on the part of the Commission in its determination to go on working relentlessly in order to achieve these goals. We must keep up our fight against discrimination, which is a great scourge among many European countries, and ensure access to care for all those who are infected or in danger of becoming infected by this illness, both within Europe and outside it. However, as some of you have also said, a more vigorous effort is required in educating our people, our citizens, on everything that has to do with HIV/AIDS infection.</p>
<p class="contents">I augur a steady continuation of all our efforts in this regard. On the part of the Commission, we are conducting a platform, a so called think-tank against AIDS/HIV which is made up of Member State, where we try to promote best practices amongst each Member State to the best of our ability, in order to ensure better coordinated action and, in turn, to yield better results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statistics currently available indicate that this rise in the number of patients results from two different trends: the continuing increase in the number of people infected with HIV and the rise in the life expectancy of people with this disease, as a result of the discovery of new treatments and drugs. In these circumstances, the European executive must look at the directions of the strategic action for preventing the spread of the HIV infection, with the aim of making social and health policies applied at this level more effective, as well as at the policies for investment in research, prevention, treatment and support for patients, with the aim of spreading good practices and European models. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is even worse is that we are talking about a fully preventable disease, but with a growing number of infections! The targets are ambitious; the spread of HIV/AIDS should be reversed by 2015. But how do we get there? I would like to emphasise three points. First, prevention. Equitable, universal access to prevention is necessary, together with adequate information, sex education and access to means of protection. Of course, when it comes to prevention, we shall mention vaccination as well which has already helped to lower and then freeze the number of new HIV infections to 2.7 million per year. Second, anti-discrimination. We should make sure that people suffering from HIV/AIDS are not discriminated and not stigmatised. Third, the gender aspect. We should bear in mind that women are more vulnerable than men in getting affected. This again shows the importance of, and the need for, ensuring women’s rights and autonomy.

This report accurately points out that disease knows no borders. In the same way, we as members of the EU need to look past our national differences in order to make a positive impact on Europe as a whole. The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in EU Member States as well as surrounding nations is a serious matter, with over 2.2 million people in the European region suffering from the disease. Together, we can fight this life-threatening disease and help alleviate the harm it causes to those who suffer from it. I propose that in order to truly fight the ongoing epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Europe, we focus on not only treatment but also disease prevention. It is important for the EU to work together, pool research and resources, and then to branch out in order to meet specific needs of various nations and regions. Only through these united efforts can we seriously combat the danger that HIV/AIDS presents to our society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In May 2011, a new antiviral drug was registered. It is essential to revise the objectives of further research, as well as the arrangements for funding and the level of such funding.</p>
<p class="contents">As in any field, the most effective approach is prevention. Since HIV does not produce any symptoms for a long period (about 10 years on average), systematic prophylactic tests are necessary. We also need effective information and educational campaigns. Their targets should primarily be the high-risk groups. In Poland, for example, about 50% of HIV infections are in people between 20 and 29 years of age.</p>
<p class="contents">HIV-infected patients and those suffering from AIDS face not only the disease itself, but also discrimination and stigmatisation, and often also a lack of financial resources for treatment. Intolerance makes it more difficult to find work, the result of which is poverty, and which, in turn, increases the risk of the disease spreading, thus closing the vicious circle. As Nelson Mandela once said, ‘The killer is not AIDS. Stigma, discrimination and ostracism are the real killers’. On the occasion of World AIDS Day, held on 1 December, I hereby appeal for understanding and institutional support for all those suffering from the disease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite efforts having been made to reduce the number of new infections within the EU and neighbouring countries, progress on the 2009 Commission strategy, which aimed at doing this, has been unsatisfactory. I am quite alarmed that an estimate for the European Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has revealed that around 30% of HIV-positive people are still not diagnosed. Furthermore, these undiagnosed patients have three and a half times higher risk of transmitting HIV than those who have been diagnosed. What’s more, those that have been diagnosed with HIV are still presenting themselves late for care and, consequently, progress to late stages of infection before they are diagnosed and can start treatment. It is therefore imperative that there are better resources allocated to ensure fair access to HIV prevention, testing, treatment support and medical research, along with continuing implementing measures to address the continued discrimination and stigma attached to those infected with HIV. It is therefore only right that I voted in favour of this motion for resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
