<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nicolai Wammen, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council. </span>– Madam President, just like racism and sexism, homophobia is a blemish on European values, threatens the principle of equality, undermines the spirit of tolerance and diversity and blights the lives of victims. Therefore, the Council stands alongside Parliament today in the fight against it.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be constantly vigilant in combating discrimination. This is about defending and putting into practice the values we have enshrined in the UN Charter and human rights instruments such as the Convention on Civil and Political Rights, in Treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and in EU legislation. This is not only about sexual orientation and identity. It is about freedom, including the right to speak freely, to march, to demonstrate and to express oneself in public.</p>
<p class="contents">As a legislator, the Council has already taken steps to protect European citizens against discrimination. The Council directive on establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation is an important one. It prohibits discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age or sexual orientation, as regards employment and occupation. Thus, it is already illegal for employers to discriminate against someone just because they happen to be gay – or indeed heterosexual – but, of course, discrimination does not take place only at work. European citizens also expect to receive equal treatment at school, when seeing a doctor, when renting a house and so on. No one should suffer discrimination because of their sexual orientation. No one should face harassment and bullying.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is currently examining a Commission proposal for a new directive that would extend protection against discrimination to areas outside employment – areas such as social protection, health care, education and access to goods and services, including houses. As you know only too well, the negotiations on this proposal have not been easy. The Council has been examining the text since 2008. We need all Member States to agree before we can adopt this act. However, the work continues and the Danish Presidency will be presenting a progress report to the Employment, Social Policy, Health and Consumer Affairs Council in June.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation is, of course, the bedrock of human rights and equal treatment, but it can never be enough in itself. Another tool at our disposal is awareness raising. Changing attitudes is a long-term process, and I recall with satisfaction that five years ago, the values shared by the Council and the Parliament were given embodiment in the 2007 Year of Equal Opportunities for All, which was set up to remind our citizens that all people are entitled to equal treatment irrespective of their racial or ethnic origin, age, sexual orientation and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to continue this work. The Fundamental Rights Agency is deepening our understanding of discrimination based on sexual orientation, and the EU also seeks to project its values in the wider world through its external actions. The European Parliament keeps a vigilant eye on this process.</p>
<p class="contents">A glance at the newspapers is enough to confirm that homophobic incidents are still all too common in Europe and beyond. The European Parliament plays a crucially important role in defending sexual minorities who are not adequately protected by politicians and the law. The EU has led the world in affirming lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people’s rights and we must continue this process together. This is a shared responsibility of this House, the Commission and the Member States, and it is a shared responsibility for all our citizens in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Madam President, last week, on 17 May 2012, we celebrated the International Day against Homophobia and Transphobia. On that occasion, I made a statement on behalf of the Commission, and I would like to reiterate here, in front of the elected representatives of the European citizens, that homophobia and transphobia are an unacceptable violation of human dignity and that they are completely incompatible with the founding values of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Commission is fully committed to combating this phenomenon with all the powers at our disposal. As Vice-President in charge of fundamental rights and non-discrimination, I have the task of ensuring that the principle of equal treatment remains valid everywhere and for all. Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people across the EU are still victims – victims of exclusion, hate speech, hate crime, discrimination and intolerance. We all know that, and we also know that our basic texts, such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights, prohibit any discrimination based on sexual orientation. As explained in the recently adopted annual report on the application of the Charter, the Commission ensures that this principle is respected in every EU action and by Member States when they implement EU law.</p>
<p class="contents">Discrimination based on sexual orientation is also prohibited in our directives, for instance, in the directive on employment. The Commission has made a legislative proposal to extend this prohibition to cover access to goods and services, social protection and education. I agree with the Presidency that it is unfortunate that this text is in an impasse in the Council, and I look forward to the report the Presidency is to prepare on its efforts to move forward on it. Unfortunately, this text needs unanimity in Council and that is the reason why it is blocked, but it is clear also that there is a vast majority of Member States who would back it.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only do we have laws in place but the Court of Justice has also confirmed several times in its rulings that the directives on gender equality in employment and access to goods and services also prohibit discrimination based on gender reassignment. So, with regard to the legal basis, we are very clear: there is no doubt what the legal foundations are.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of that, of course, you have to stay vigilant, and the Commission remains vigilant, following up closely every petition and parliamentary question that alerts us to discriminatory practices on grounds of sexual orientation, whenever they concern matters falling within EU competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Hate crime against LGBTI persons remains a source of concern, as shown by the recent homophobic murder of the young Belgian, Ihsane Jarfi. That is also why the Commission has asked the Agency for Fundamental Rights to conduct a specific survey on hate crimes and discrimination against LGBTI persons in all Member States and in Croatia, because we need to have evidence – not only the evidence once a crime has happened, but also a mapping of where crimes happen in order to understand more about the trends in this domain.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the Commission is continuing its awareness-raising actions across Europe in order to fight discrimination and to promote equality and diversity. In particular, as you know, we support civil society organisations and national authorities in combating discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do in Europe, we also do outside Europe. The External Action Service is very much aware of the difficulties faced by the LGBTI community in third countries like Russia, Ukraine and Moldova, to mention only those in which we find not only discrimination and violence but also criminalisation. The EU has repeatedly condemned such measures and repeatedly called on the authorities of those countries to respect their international legal obligations on human rights, including the principles of equality and dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that Cathy Ashton, the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, condemned homophobia in her statement on 17 May 2012 and called on governments to apply human rights equally, irrespective of sexual orientation or gender identity. And every time she visits a country outside the EU, she recalls these principles in very strong language.</p>
<p class="contents">As EU Commissioner for Justice, I will continue here in Europe to do my utmost to uphold the fundamental rights upon which the European Union is founded, not only on the International Day against Homophobia, but on every day of the year, because homophobia has no place in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Europe, there is no room for discrimination of any kind, and that includes homophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">There are no two ways about this. Earlier today, all the political groups of this Chamber sat down together around one table to draw up a common resolution, in order to be able to speak against homophobia with one voice. Since this issue stirs up a great deal of emotion and controversy, the EPP wants to keep the debate focused on the real issue: that is, homophobia. Otherwise, it will be impossible to find common ground.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the EPP would like to raise two points. Firstly, we must clearly keep in mind the limits of our competence: that is, what we can do and what we cannot do. We must respect the principle of subsidiarity, which is a basic principle of the European Union. This means that matters that are within the competence of national governments should be left to be handled at national level. Secondly, we must avoid condemning individual countries, especially in cases where it is not the government of a particular Member State that is responsible for a given initiative or incident.</p>
<p class="contents">Homophobia is unacceptable and we have to make sure that it is eradicated in Europe and beyond, but to do this in an effective manner, we must be credible, we must make sober, rather than emotional, assessments, and we must respect the limits of our mandate. Most of all, we must speak with one voice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that we can all, as one house, vote in favour of denouncing homophobia. Homophobia blights and destroys lives; it destroys the lives of those who actually practice it, as well as those who experience it. Hate crimes, homophobic crimes and transphobic crimes scar our continent. As Madam Reding said, that young man in Brussels died for the simple reason that he was a homosexual.</p>
<p class="contents">The laws being enacted in Moldova, in Ukraine and in Russia are a step backwards. They are not a step forward towards understanding and celebrating diversity or people, but rather a step towards saying that, in order to have the protection and the respect of States and institutions, you must conform to a very narrow stereotype.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, it makes absolutely no sense. Two twins born to proud parents grow up looking the same, behaving the same, but one wishes to declare that she or he is homosexual and the other heterosexual. For that simple reason, the child that was loved and protected by that state and by its institutions is immediately denied the equal protection and support of the state. They are even denied education that tells them that it is indeed okay to be who they truly are and that others in history have been exactly the same. There are people in the European Parliament and other parliaments, and Presidents and Prime Ministers. But no, we suffocate people with oppression and take away information and education that can help them become the unique individual that they were born to be and the unique individual that deserves to love and to be loved.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr Busuttil, I absolutely agree with you that we must respect the limits of our competence. I do not want us to start amending what we have agreed, but we must not limit our aspirations for other Member States. That is extremely important. I do think that if we do not name these countries, we cover them in a cloak of anonymity and we encourage others to join them by bringing in laws which are homophobic and which seek to treat people unequally.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Commissioner, let me finish on this. I can see at least one person sat in this House who has experienced homophobia. I too, as an openly gay man, have experienced homophobia, but very, very rarely. Why? Because I was given the benefit of a family and a society and education that supported me so that I could become who I am and to be proud of who I am. That aspiration and that opportunity must be given to every individual of the European Union and beyond. Thank you for your indulgence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have a rescue fund, and I was just wondering: should we not perhaps give a tax discount to LGBT people? They represent 5 to 10% of the European population, they contribute to our economy, to the rescue fund and to bailing out countries in the eurozone, and yet they do not get the same rights as other EU citizens. They do not get the same protection and services from their governments, so perhaps we should not ask them to pay the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I am being a bit ironic as that, of course, is not the solution. The solution is that we start, at both EU and Member State level, to give the same protection and the same rights to all EU citizens. It is time for the European Union to deliver. I am actually very glad and proud to be a member of this House, which has really become a champion of LGBT rights, and I very much welcome the first ever resolution dedicated to homophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Busuttil, I very much welcome the support and the cooperation of the EPP Group, because I think that the cross-party support for this resolution sends a very strong signal to our own countries’ governments as well as to the governments of the countries mentioned: Russia, Moldova and the many other countries which treat LGBT people very badly. My final point is about the hate speech of opinion leaders, political leaders and religious leaders. That is not innocent and not innocuous. It contributes to a climate of hatred, intolerance and violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say – also to Mr Busuttil – that discrimination is not necessarily less bad than homophobia. If we tolerate discrimination and unequal treatment, we send a signal that some people are less equal than we are, and that justifies homophobia. So, colleagues, I ask everybody to wholeheartedly endorse the resolution tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As a lesbian woman myself, and one who has lived through times when things were not, at least in some parts of this continent, as easy as they are now, I know how it is to live a life of fear, of being afraid of walking hand in hand with your loved person in the streets, or of kissing her or him goodbye at the train station.</p>
<p class="contents">Homophobia is about fear, as it states in our text. It is an irrational fear of, and an aversion to, lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, based on prejudice and similar to racism, xenophobia and anti-semitism and sexism. It is something that we should all condemn, and we should make sure that people do not have to be afraid of living their lives to the full, which includes a happy love life. Much as things have improved in many parts of this continent, there is reason for serious concern.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned, in some countries outside the EU – Ukraine, Russia and Moldova, for example – there are people, sometimes in government and sometimes outside it, who try to put laws into practice that prohibit any kind of public discussion of homosexuality. Visibility and public speeches are so important, especially for young people who are coming out and want to be open and out and proud of what they are.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us here, at all levels of the European Union, to speak out against homophobia, to condemn it clearly, to make strategies – to make a road map, Ms Reding – to fight homophobia and to pursue equal rights for lesbians and gays, in order to make sure that, as you advocated, homophobia is condemned on this continent, and is not something that any one of us supports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Our progress towards building a more tolerant society should not be allowed to go into reverse gear. Of course, we all have different views as to what role the EU can play.

And let us not forget that many started their journey a long time after others.</p>

One of the areas of concern related to the law restricting the definition of a family to a heterosexual family. That law instantly gives off a signal on the part of the Hungarian Government that it stands on the side of the homophobes.</p>
<p class="contents">In more and more Eastern European countries, laws are making it impossible merely to talk positively about lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender (LGBT) issues in public or even to hold gay pride festivals. The very governments that are now promoting homophobia really should be providing a positive lead. LGBT people need good role models, such as politicians who dare to publicly stand up for their sexual orientation.</p>
<p class="contents">During the International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHO) last week, we all believed that things were getting better. The reality is that, in many European countries, things have, in fact, only got worse, and it is therefore incumbent upon all of us to ensure that things really do improve. By supporting people who dare to stick their necks out in a chamber less safe than this European Parliament, and by saying the truth to those governments that support homophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Vice-President Reding, we can only tackle governments of this kind if we also have our own house in order in the European Union. I am therefore disappointed by your answer to my written questions, in which you said that you do not plan to bring forward measures to recognise full equal rights for same-sex couples if they take advantage of their freedom of movement.

<p class="contents">Homophobia continues to manifest itself in Member States and third countries, taking different forms, such as violent public speeches and even murder. Laws have recently been brought in or passed against ‘homosexual propaganda’.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot turn a blind eye to these situations. We should call on the relevant authorities in these countries – Russia, Ukraine, Moldavia, Lithuania, Latvia and Hungary – to ensure that the principle of non-discrimination is respected and to reconsider these laws, bearing in mind international human rights legislation and their own commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, the Council and the European External Action Service (EEAS) should take note of these bans and take appropriate action in the context of home affairs, bilateral dialogue and the European Neighbourhood Policy. It is regrettable that, even within the European Union, the basic rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are not always fully respected. We can only strongly condemn any discrimination or incitement to hatred or violence on the basis of sexual orientation. Moreover, homosexual children should have access to positive and reassuring information about their sexuality. These laws make it difficult and illegal to access such information, which is disastrous for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if we can congratulate ourselves on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, news stories tell us that we still need to stand firm in our fight against the violence and discrimination that lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people face in their everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">In far too many countries around the world, national and regional governments enact laws that criminalise what is termed by them as propaganda promoting homosexuality. In far too many countries around the world, living as a homosexual or expressing oneself in a gender that differs from the one recognised at birth can be life-threatening. This, in itself, fully justifies the need for those affected by such situations to be granted access to international protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, the path to equality, in our countries, is still a long one, but we should stay on the right path as LGBT people are all too often the target of unacceptable stigmatisation and sometimes violence. Cases of suicide among LGBT teenagers are also signs warning us of the urgent need for action.</p>

They could be divided along three lines: firstly, and this forms the foundations, by educating children from a very early age to respect others through school curricula that aim to confront prejudice, representations and sexist and homophobic stereotypes, next by offering gay couples equal rights to marriage and adoption, and I am pleased to see that the new government in France has pledged to carry out this reform, and lastly by legally sanctioning homophobic and transphobic insults in the same way as racist insults. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot claim that all of the credit for this belongs to the coalition government of the last two years, as we are of course building on previous work, Mr Cashman.</p>
<p class="contents">However, one clear new development which we are taking forward is equal marriage. I agree, of course, with Mr Busuttil that family marriage laws are a national responsibility, but there is an EU dimension when a gay married couple moves to another country where they lose their civil status and legal rights, including parental rights. But for all too many LGBT people in Europe, and even in the EU, the discrimination and prejudice they face is crudely homophobic, nasty and brutish, to the point not only of hate speech, but violence and murder.</p>
<p class="contents">I, like others, strongly welcome the support of the EPP under the leadership of Simon Busuttil for this resolution. The progress we have made in Britain is based on cross-party agreement. It is not so long ago that we had a law against the so-called promotion of homosexuality, known colloquially as ‘Section 28’, and now we are on the verge of equal marriage. Stuff happens, progress is possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I listen to today’s debate, I am starting to think that we will not be supporting it for the following reason. I am a strong opponent of homophobia and a strong supporter of human rights. However, there are no LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) rights. I think this is nonsense. It is just ideology. There are human rights and, of course, we must fight for human rights, including those of homosexuals, and we must ensure that they are not discriminated against. This is why we have an anti-discrimination paragraph in our Treaty, anti-discrimination legislation and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In cases where this legislation is not complied with, and I do not know of any such cases in the EU, then of course it is necessary to take legal proceedings. This can and should be done. However, that is not what we are talking about. We have been speaking here the whole time about so-called gay marriage. You may be in favour of it or you may be opposed to it, but that has nothing to do with human rights and nothing at all to do with the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The charter explicitly states that every Member State is free to decide how it defines marriage and the family. This was specifically included in the charter to enable states such as Germany and many others, including Hungary, to say that marriage is a contract between a man and a woman. That is a right which is specifically guaranteed in our Charter of Fundamental Rights. You cannot lump that together with homophobia. You can criticise it in political terms, but you cannot link it with dreadful events like those instigated in Russia by Mr Putin, which I also condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last part-session in Strasbourg, I warned this House about the ideological misuse of human rights. Human rights are too precious to be lumped together with socio-political propaganda. For this reason, I am horrified at the tone of many speakers in today’s debate. I am opposed to breaches of human rights, I am opposed to homophobia, but I am also opposed to ideological propaganda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Same-sex couples are not guaranteed the freedom of movement within the EU, as the mutual recognition of their civil status is not a given. European-level action against hate speech and hate crimes is also absent, even though this is also considered an important aspect by the relevant recommendation of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in addition to an appropriate legislative environment, it is crucial that we ensure actual non-discrimination, and to this end we must create a social environment that is characterised by tolerance and respect for diversity. There is a lot of work to be done in this field throughout Europe, and the role of politicians, the media and education is exceedingly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Many here have mentioned Hungary. On the one hand, Hungary can be proud to have the eighth most favourable legislative environment for anti-discrimination in the EU. On the other hand we can see that for the second time, the police attempted to outlaw the Hungarian day of Gay Pride, Budapest Pride, and that Budapest Pride participants needed police protection against radical counter-demonstrators, while the city’s leadership is attempting by all means to prevent the Euro Gays event from taking place. Thus, we are seeing an ambiguous picture, and political rhetoric often reinforces precisely those attitudes that we would like to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">There are many tasks ahead of us: the Commission should monitor the implementation and transposition of directives on discrimination, and we would like to ask it to investigate the implementation of European Union legislation against hate crimes. The Council should adopt the horizontal anti-discrimination directive, while Member States should make extensive efforts to create an inclusive environment through education, raising awareness, and closer dialogue with civil organisations.</p>

Mr Busuttil, we definitely must be emotional! People in the European Union are being abused and unfairly treated every day, simply because of who they love or who they are. They are being oppressed, discriminated against, mistreated and even killed. It is tragic that in 2012, we have not made more progress on this issue in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">An important discrimination directive is cluttering up the drawers in the Council’s desk because there is opposition to the issue of LGBT people’s rights within the Council.

In Lithuania and Latvia, there is a proposal for legislation banning information on homosexuality.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the simplest words to understand and one of the best words in the language is the word ‘family’. In the EU, we have the free movement of citizens, including families, but not for everyone. The EU’s definition of a family is not in line with reality. That is highly deplorable, because one of the fundamental pillars of EU cooperation is human rights and this includes the rights of LGBT people.

My concern, however, is that we have heard all these grand words condemning homophobia here, but what about practising what you preach? I have been the victim of two homophobic incidents since I have been a member of this Chamber, and Parliament simply has not bothered to act.</p>
<p class="contents">If you are going to tell other countries, especially third countries, what to do, at least first practise what you preach. Fortunately, as Baroness Ludford has said, I live in a country that has been reported to be one of the best places – or the best place – in the world to be gay. I count myself quite fortunate.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there are many other people in the world who cannot say the same thing. Yet there is a football tournament on our doorstep in Ukraine – which will be held jointly with Poland – and many Members of this House will be travelling to Ukraine as representatives of some organisation or other, or representatives of the European Union, while today, the UK Foreign Office has put a warning out to gay people to be careful travelling to Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Why should a single member of this House or the European Union go to Ukraine? Should the European Union as a whole not be boycotting the tournament if that country cannot protect citizens? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are some ring-fenced issues that we cannot forget. Firstly, the family must be understood as the union of a man and a woman, completed and given full expression by the birth of children, which cannot happen between two people of the same sex.</p>
<p class="contents">Two homosexual people can live together freely, perhaps even enjoying forms of legal recognition on a voluntary basis. That said, there can be no talk, for example, of marriage or adoption of children. I do not think we can go against nature, which requires a man and a woman in order to procreate. Everything else is just senseless arrogance, which comes close to the absurd in some extreme cases, such as male mothers.</p>

If you do not mind, I do not intend to talk about countries outside of the European Union, because we also have a problem with homophobia in the Member States of the European Union. Not so long ago, maybe a couple of days – last week, a member of parliament in my country spoke before the Chamber and said that homosexuals are sick people who should be locked up somewhere and should receive treatment. So we should not pretend that it exists outside of the European Union, it exists here as well – within the Member States of the European Union. I am always surprised by such statements because when I meet someone, I do not ask them about their sexual orientation. When I choose my friends, both male and female, I do not ask them what they get up to within their sexual orientation. I always try to ensure that my friends and the people I talk to are decent people – people who may have the same perspective on life as I do. I am therefore very sorry that even today, members of the LGBT community are exposed to such attacks, not only from extremists, but also by policy makers in the Member States of the European Union. In my opinion, as each Member State is unable to regulate same-sex cohabitation, it would be appropriate for us to regulate such cohabitation at a European Union level. It is high time for us to do so, as it is quite evident that the Member States of the European Union have been unable to tackle this agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Homophobia has no place in Europe, either in an open form or in a hidden form, in any Member State, and that includes those Member States which are newcomers to the European family. It has no place against any citizen, wherever he or she may be, in the EU or in those countries outside the EU which want to have relations with us. I made that clear in my speech and I quoted Baroness Ashton, who regularly intervenes on specific issues in such countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Because I agree with it, I will not repeat everything that has been said. There was, however, one question which I have already answered several times in written form but which I think it is important to answer in this Chamber in order to make things clear. It concerns the link between the Free Movement Directive and the mutual recognition of same-sex couples. You know that the Free Movement Directive provides for the right of entry and residence for Union citizens and their family members, regardless of the recognition of same-sex marriages or partnerships. Such recognition is immaterial for the purposes of the application of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 24 of the directive ensures that same-sex couples who exercise their right to free movement have the same rights within the scope of the Treaty as same-sex couples in the host Member State. The mere fact of having exercised the right to free movement does not imply that same-sex couples would acquire more rights in the host Member State than those guaranteed to their own nationals in that Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of recognition of marriages does not fall within the scope of the Free Movement Directive. In order to apply it correctly, Member States do not need to address the recognition of same-sex unions. They need simply to grant entry and residence to the couples in question and to their family members, including spouses and partners, irrespective of their sexual orientation. This means that all Member States are obliged to grant the right of residence to a Union citizen’s spouse regardless of sexual orientation, but the host Member State is under no obligation to recognise the marriage under its national law.</p>
<p class="contents">So much for the legal question, but when this legal question is not handled properly, what do we do? I shall give you a very concrete example. A Polish authority refused to issue certificates on civil status to citizens wishing to marry, or conclude a registered partnership with, a person of the same sex in a Member State where this is possible. The Commission intervened on the basis that such a stance was incompatible with respect for private and family life, and the Polish authorities informed us that steps would be taken to abolish the practice of asking the sex of the future spouse or partner. I give you this example in order to explain what the law says and to explain how, without making a big fuss, we can intervene in the application of the law in a Member State in order to have that Member State change a practice which is not in accordance with our European rules. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As I have made very clear during today’s debate, the Council is absolutely with the European Parliament on this, and naturally the Council upholds the principle that no citizen may be subject to discrimination on account of his or her sexual orientation, for example. That is a fundamental principle. In this connection it is, of course, also key that all Member States take the necessary measures to ensure that the fundamental rights of all EU citizens are respected and enforced, not only according to the letter of the law, but also in practice in real life. The Danish Presidency of the EU will therefore continue to work on the anti-discrimination directive, which could come to make a very important contribution to implementing the ban on discrimination outside the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">I have noted the strong and correct views expressed here today, and I am happy to assure you that I will pass them on to the Council. At the same time, I would like to give you my assurance that the Danish Presidency will maintain its focus on safeguarding citizens’ fundamental rights right up to the last minute that we have responsibility for the Presidency, and also, of course, thereafter, as one of the 27 Member States. All of us here in this Chamber – whether we are members of Parliament, of the Commission or of the Council, wherever we come from, whatever we believe in, whatever our sexuality – we all share the common task of ensuring that homophobia, which was an abhorrent part of our history, is never again allowed to become a part of Europe’s future.

At the same time, as someone who is fighting against such discrimination, I find it sad and thought-provoking that the same Parliament that adopts a resolution against homophobia almost every six months has failed to adopt in the past five years a resolution against the very serious infringements and humiliating discrimination that hundreds of thousands of citizens belonging to linguistic and national minorities have been facing in several EU Member States. This form of discrimination affects 10% of all EU citizens every day.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the motions for resolutions submitted by the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament, the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in the context of the fight against homophobia are based on the same misrepresentation: Hungary is being stigmatised for proposals for amendment submitted to the General Assembly of Budapest that actually failed and were rejected by the same General Assembly. We here in Parliament are well aware of the fate of motions for amendment that are voted down and how much weight they carry: none whatsoever. To stigmatise Hungary for such reasons implies political ill will. It is resolutions such as this that make the work of the European Parliament seem frivolous. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Education, combined with legislative change at EU and national level, is what will make a difference; it will be what improves the track record in every Member State, it will be what will transform the way this vulnerable section of society is viewed and treated by its peers and ultimately by the State. As Members of the European Parliament, it is our duty to see to it that this happens in our respective countries. The Commission must ensure that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender expression in all sectors is eliminated by swiftly completing the anti-discrimination package based on Article 19 TFEU. The Commission has held that ‘homophobia has no place in Europe’. Now it must do its utmost to translate this statement into legal safeguards and guarantees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, in many of the Member States, and also in Poland, the level of tolerance shown to sexual minorities is still too low. Last Sunday, I took part in the Kraków March for Equality, which was held under the slogan ‘Diversity, Solidarity, Equality’. Our diversity was cheerful, colourful and friendly, but the counter-demonstration held by the bovver boys from the National Rebirth of Poland movement exuded a pathological hatred.</p>
<p class="contents">Homophobia, like every phobia, is an illness and needs to be treated. However, what we are seeing in Poland is not homophobia but a form of chauvinism favouring one sexual orientation over another, and it needs to be fought by adopting appropriate legislation. Apart from good law, active promotion of equal opportunities is needed and a strengthening of society’s awareness of equality issues, for example, by addressing the issue of non-discrimination, beginning at nursery school and in all areas of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">An end to discrimination against homosexuals in the European Union can be achieved only by a directive establishing a uniform, minimum level of protection for people who suffer discrimination because of their age, sexual orientation, disability, religion or world view. A key factor is for there to be complete separation of Church and State, because homophobia and its expression in laws which discriminate against homosexuals find particularly good conditions for development precisely in situations in which too large a role is played by religion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
