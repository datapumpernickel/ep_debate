<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lynne (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I should like to say thank you to the sign language interpreters. I wish we could have sign language interpretation every plenary session, for every report. I should also like to thank everyone who has helped me to write this report: all the MEPs that have worked very hard with me to come up with compromise amendments; the Commission; and especially disabled people's organisations. I have taken a lot of advice on this report. That is why it is a good one. It is not my report. It is a report that has been brought together with the help of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the UN ad hoc Committee, between 16 and 27 June 2003, decided on a specific convention on disabled people's rights. I believe only a specific, legally-binding convention will do, rather than any other instrument. But there must be a monitoring mechanism to see how disabled people are treated in practice across the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I put in my report a list of rights that should be included in any UN convention. It is a non-exhaustive list because of space. However, I called for a mainly rights-based approach to get away, once and for all, from the medical model of disability and to cover all forms of disability, whether it is a person using a wheelchair, or somebody with another mobility problem, a hearing impairment, a visual impairment, a learning disability, a mental health problem or any other hidden disability. We must be inclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 37 million disabled people in the European Union. There are 600 million disabled people world-wide. There has already been some progress in the United Nations: the 1981 World Programme of Action and the 1993 Standard Rules on Equalisation of Opportunities for People with Disabilities, to name but two. At EU level there has also been progress: in 1997, for instance, Article 13 of the Treaty of Amsterdam brought forward the employment directive and the Action Programme. But as I said in my report, we now need a specific disability directive at EU level. We need all Member States to implement the current employment directive that is due to be implemented this year. There are many Member States that have not even started to look at implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if we did get it right at European level, 80% of disabled people come from developing countries. That is why we need a legally-binding convention covering a whole raft of different rights, including the right to quality of life. That also means protection from degrading and inhumane treatment. That includes institutionalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to see access to employment because a vast majority of disabled people do not have employment. We need access to vocational training, education and the right to inclusion, which is so important. That means access to buildings, access to live as independent a life as possible, and access to public transport. If people do not have access to public transport they cannot get to their place of work.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we look at civil and political rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe very strongly in equal citizenship, as do most of us here. That means no more 'rights for disabled people', but 'equal rights for disabled people'. Those equal rights mean access to financial support as well; access to health care, access to culture and leisure – including sporting activities, equality before the law and the right to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that a split vote has been asked for so that only organisations of disabled people, rather than organisations representing disabled people, will be consulted over this. Let us remember that we deal with developing countries here! Many do not have organisations of disabled people. They only have organisations representing disabled people. Are we going to exclude them? We are not just dealing with the European Union. This is a world-wide convention. Even within the EU there are many organisations that would be left out, including the Royal National Institute for the Deaf in the UK, and, more importantly, people with profound learning disabilities and severe mental problems, who quite often need an advocate to speak on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge you to vote for this report in its entirety and not be tempted to vote in the split vote.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, I should like in particular to thank Mrs Lynne and the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for drafting this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This report confirms that the issue of disability is an issue with political, social and economic aspects. It is an issue which horizontally touches all European Union policies. In particular within the framework of the European Year of Disability, this report sends a clear message to the European Union and to the Member States, making Parliament’s commitment known in the clearest of terms.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point which I should like to raise is the future UN Convention, which is expected to be a very important document of historic significance. Your report will be useful and will play an important role for the Commission services during the discussions being held with the Member States, on the one hand, and the UN, on the other hand, on this future Convention. It is well in keeping with the Commission proposals and communication. We share the same principles and the same objectives. In particular, I should like to comment on the core political aspect on which we agree, namely an approach based on human, social and political rights. It is worth noting that the UN Convention is further recognition of the fact that it is not the individual’s disability that needs to be corrected, it is the restraining environment that must adapt so as to safeguard full participation and equal opportunities for the individual. The emphasis has shifted from the medical model to the so-called social standard, to building a policy based on fundamental human rights, on the one hand, and on social rights and guaranteed equal opportunities on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">In issuing this communication, the Commission has made clear its intention to promote this rights-based approach at European level and to rely on the European experience obtained to date from combating discrimination. In addition, the Commission is insisting on an approach based on the social integration of the disabled and has tabled the issue of disability as one of the basic elements in the national action plans drawn up for social integration and combating poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has requested negotiating instructions due to the fact that part of the Convention concerns the issue of ‘non discrimination’, which now comes under the jurisdiction of the European Union following the Treaty of Amsterdam. Discussions with the Council have continued up to today, while at the same time the Commission is working closely with the Presidency on the pre-preparatory work for the Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lynne referred to the specific issue of developing countries and to the policy for development cooperation, which so far has been limited to drafting an explanatory memorandum on disability and development. This memorandum, which is addressed to the representations and services of the European Union, was drafted in close cooperation with non-governmental organisations representing the disabled. This document, which has been distributed to the representations of the European Union in developing countries, has had positive reactions at both government level and at the level of civil society organisations and it is important that, for the first time, we have an approach to the issue of disability in relation to development policy and development aid. Although it is difficult in the initial stage to call for disability to be incorporated into the central body of development aid policies, this is a clear declaration that disability must be included and dealt with in the policies of every state in all sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">My final comment concerns the possible disability directive. As Mrs Lynne has already said, the European Union has had a general directive on non-discrimination in the field of employment which also relates to the disabled since 2000. This directive, which really was a big step for Europe and was accepted by all the Member States, has not progressed as we would have expected. Most countries have not yet presented even a preliminary bill for transposing this directive, even though the final deadline is December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite repeated efforts during discussions in the Employment Councils, my letter to all the ministers and the mobilisation of European and national organisations, it would appear that the Member States have serious difficulties of a political and economic nature. I call here on Parliament to also play an important role in exerting pressure on the Member States to get them to adopt this directive in principle. However, I believe that it is clear from the situation today that it is premature to promote a new directive which would extend the scope of policies beyond the field of employment to all policy sectors overall. I think that this would create a difficult situation in the Council and it would perhaps make it even more difficult to adopt the first directive, which has come up against the difficulties I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the Commission has proposed that the Member States examine and decide themselves if Community legislation should be used to combat discrimination on the grounds of disability in sectors other than employment in a report on the application of the directive on equal opportunities. This will give us a first official reaction on the part of the Member States to this second, important step which, politically, is clearly a step which the European Union needs to take, but which it needs to take at the right time, with important preconditions to success, both at the decision-making level and at the level of practical implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Commission has undertaken to participate actively with the Member States in the negotiations on the United Nations Convention. Participation in these negotiations will also continue after the European Year of Disability within the framework of continuing action here, because our objective is to present an action plan at European level at the end of 2003, at the end of the Year of Disability, which will be the result of all the work carried out in all the Member States during this year, so that we have commitments on the part of the Member States at legislative, budgetary, policy and programme level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">All the Member States agree that it is necessary to integrate disability into the procedures used by the organs monitoring the Treaties, either in the form of a protocol attached to one of the existing Treaties on human rights or as an instrument containing general principles, leaving open the possibility of subsequently adding implementing protocols.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, that we will only be able to achieve the desired objectives by means of a legally binding convention which includes civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights suited to the circumstances of disabled people. An agreement of a binding nature will demonstrate that disabled people face in their daily lives – as we all know – serious generalised problems which relate both to access difficulties and to bureaucracy and the attitudes of their co-citizens. Its objective is not to create new laws but to clarify and adapt the existing ones. The creation of a specific convention will be the only way to provide an effective monitoring mechanism for analysing the treatment received by disabled people throughout the world. The convention will prioritise the rights of disabled people within the agendas of governments. Its approval must mark the beginning of an effective and specific process aimed at guaranteeing the full and equitable integration of disabled people throughout the world. This means that the problems of these people will be taken into account in the political decision-making processes at regional, national and international levels. The European Union should also guarantee that organisations of disabled people are represented and act as advisers throughout the process and not just at the final moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to insist on certain points which are important, although other Members have mentioned them, and which we in Parliament and in the Group of the Party of European Socialists have been advocating: the existence, in many cases, of multiple discrimination – as a disabled woman or a disabled immigrant – eliminating legal barriers in order to eliminate physical barriers, education – which is very important – in values, which includes non-discrimination against disability in schools. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The unanimous vote in committee also serves to prove that disability is not a left- or right-wing issue, but an issue promoted by those who care about respect for the rights, equal opportunities and dignity of all citizens. Moreover, the figures are no joking matter: there are 600 million people with disabilities in the world, 38 million of which live in Europe, and there will be 45 million in the enlarged Europe next year. It should be pointed out that anyone can become disabled at any point in life. It happens, in particular, as a result of the ageing of society, but that is not the only cause: consider – and I am quoting a figure relating to Italy – the 24 000 young people who become disabled each year as a result of accidents caused by the frenetic approach to life and social activity today.</p>
<p class="contents">These are figures which give cause for thought. Hence the importance of establishing binding international standards seeking to protect the rights of people with disabilities with an appropriate built-in monitoring mechanism. The binding UN Convention adopted last June, which has just such a monitoring mechanism, like the six human rights conventions, will have to bring to light the considerable, widespread problems encountered by people with disabilities in their everyday lives, whether in terms of access or bureaucracy or social attitudes. It will therefore form the basis for the rights of all people with disabilities throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore trust that the European Presidency too, the Council in its role of negotiator, will make every endeavour to achieve a better-defined, more specific text in early 2004 than that presented in Mexico, in order to define practical standards to guide the approach of governments. However, I regret the position adopted thus far by the European Commission, which has not yet provided a timetable for a future horizontal directive on the rights of people with disabilities in Europe and has not given specific or genuine undertakings to incorporate the rights of people with disabilities into its policies. The directive on employment and occupation is important, as is the directive on access to transport, but we need to go further, Commissioner. In particular, we cannot let the different countries get away with inertia as regards their legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also ten years since the UN Year of Disabled People and tonight it is quite right that this Parliament focuses not only on the rights of disabled people within the European Union, but on the disabled victims of human rights abuse world-wide.</p>
<p class="contents">On the global stage disabled people are the least recognised and most disempowered of all people. This UN convention should act to mobilise change across all levels of government: local, national and international, forcing decision-makers to recognise disability rights in a human rights context in a way that has not happened before.</p>
<p class="contents">For too long international human rights instruments have failed to recognise disabled people explicitly and UN agencies working in the field of human rights and development cooperation have not recognised the specific factors which exclude and isolate disabled people. I would like to think that a UN convention would also bring important resources to assist disabled people in their own empowerment and development in decision-making in order that their voice can be heard.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased tonight that Members on all sides of the House have supported the principle of a legally-binding convention. Whilst existing human rights treaties apply to persons with disabilities, they do not specifically state that they protect the rights of persons with disabilities, nor is there an international treaty which specifically addresses those rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The human rights of disabled people deserve the same level of protection as those of other disadvantaged or vulnerable people such as women, children and ethnic minorities. People with disabilities are a marginalised group for whom existing, generalised human rights standards have not worked and who therefore require explicit standards to adjust the discrimination they face in society and the range of violations to which they are subjected.</p>
<p class="contents">That is true for us in the European Union also, and it must be true further afield – particularly as regards our development cooperation policies – as the ACP-EU parliamentary assembly passed a groundbreaking resolution last year. However, we still have to ensure the full participation of, and full rights for, disabled people such as the victims of landmines, people who have deliberately had disability inflicted upon them as part of war, or who have developed disability because of chronic diseases unknown to us nowadays within the European Union. This is a truly worldwide issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate the Commissioner on what she said tonight. She says that she supports bringing forward in the future a comprehensive disability non-discrimination directive. She will not be surprised if I say to her again that in November she will have the opportunity to announce her intention to do so, in the communication winding up the European Year of Disabled People.</p>
<p class="contents">While she has the requisite power and influence, she should make that commitment. We need her to do so; indeed, in the vote that will take place tomorrow we call on her to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has made clear that there is a difference between her view and that of the Socialists on the issue of organisations for and of disabled people. Organisations of disabled people are controlled by disabled people and by the parents of disabled people who are able to speak for themselves. It is right that they are given priority, as they have been within the European Union since the 1996 Commission communication. The Commissioner mentioned blind people: the European Blind Union – part of the European Disability Forum, the representative body of disabled people – wants us to give priority to organisations of disabled people. Mrs Lynne says that people with severe learning difficulties cannot represent themselves. But what about People First and other self-advocacy organisations? These prove her wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">We stand by the split vote. But that does not detract from our enormous support for this and for a United Nations convention for disabled people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Legislation is necessary which not only protects the rights of people with disabilities but also ensures that people with disabilities are provided with support and structures that will allow them to participate on an equal footing in all aspects of life.</p>
<p class="contents">The best-placed people to do this and present what is needed are people with disabilities themselves. We have to be very careful about telling people with disabilities what they need and what we can do for them. Unless you are a person with a disability, you do not know what is necessary to allow you to participate in society on an equal footing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very good to see people here tonight providing sign language. This should not only be for tonight: it should be looked at on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to look at how people are educated. We need to ensure that education is fully integrated and allows people with disabilities not to be segregated, but to be educated along with everyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a tendency when we speak about disability to provide certain services for people with disabilities, but to segregate them. We should look at sign language, at Braille, at all these things that are necessary and allow them to be part of the educational curriculum in all the Member States. People should not have to go to special places to be educated or to participate. This is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Howitt mentioned the Commission and its commitment to bringing forward a directive by the end of the year. In the year of disabilities, it is not enough to say we are going to do a lot and then at the end of this year forget all about it and go along as normal. We need to have something at the end that we can be proud of, to allow people to participate in society. We need a broad perspective, not one which focuses only on accessibility in education. This needs to be done in relation to disabled people themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">On that final point, I would like to say that the Centre for Independent Living, which is based in Ireland, is bringing a delegation from all over Europe for the second part-session here in September. There is going to be a special intergroup which will be meeting with people with disabilities. They will be telling us exactly what they want and what they would like to see brought forward. This will be a great opportunity. Everybody interested in the issue should come along and listen to people outlining what they want. They are the people who are best-placed to do so. We have to listen and allow them to make the decisions, we should not make decisions for them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Politics certainly cannot give back sight to the blind or speech to the dumb or mobility to the sick, but it can and, at all events, must enable people with disabilities to bear the difficulties of everyday life with less physical and mental effort and thus to give them the chance to lead an even more dignified life.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes – as we know from personal experience – it does not take much to give them this chance: removing structural barriers, building according to certain criteria which take into account the needs of a section of our people who have difficulties. Thus, politics has the task of giving the issue due consideration: this is not charity or a work of mercy but recognition of the right to the best life possible. Where, then, a physical disability goes hand in hand with a state of financial need or even extreme poverty – and that is the most common thing in the world – the situation becomes even more tragic. The figures recorded in the report are alarming: there are 600 million people with disabilities, many of which come from the developing world. We can therefore imagine their quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for Europe of the Nations Group, on behalf of which I am speaking, is aware that there is still much which can and must be done to address a major issue which affects millions of families in the world, who are waiting for politics and politicians to respond with practical measures to a topical problem which continues to be urgent. However, the group acknowledges the Commission’s sound proposals and endorses the conclusions drawn by the rapporteur, Mrs Lynn, in her report. We will therefore vote for the resolution, which has the merit of giving many unfortunate people to whom fate has dealt a bitter blow the right to hope once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a slap in the face of people with a congenital disability to know that we make such a fuss about their rights, while their disability in the unborn child would be a reason for termination.

<p class="contents">There are some loopholes which must be closed. Firstly, the international treaties currently in force in the field of human rights do apply to persons with disabilities but none of them contains specific and binding provisions in this area. Then we have the European Union, which has been relatively active in protecting persons with disabilities, but which adopts measures that are intended only to establish a general framework for equal treatment in employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, who calls for the adoption of a United Nations convention. This convention will be able to highlight the serious problems facing disabled persons in their daily lives. I wish to take this opportunity to recall that the organisations representing disabled persons must participate fully in the drafting of this convention, and in defining and assessing all the measures intended for them. Despite the Commissioner’s understandable caution about the commitment of the Member States, I would ask the Commission not to delay presenting a wide-ranging Community directive on the rights of the disabled and incorporating these rights into our cooperation and development policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You have said so yourself, Commissioner. The European Union must, therefore, encourage the adoption of these instruments and play a full part in them.</p>
<p class="contents">Disabled people wish to have a free choice when it comes to their lifestyle. They wish to be as independent as possible. Like all other citizens, they wish to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process, not only insofar as they themselves are directly affected, but also through the recognition of all their fundamental rights. I think that a Community policy worthy of that name must be based on the existing measures, as is already the case. Moreover, it must promote legal measures at all levels, as underlined in the Lynne report.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, we are aware that although legal measures are necessary, they are not sufficient in themselves. We must therefore work hard to raise the awareness of all sections of society, unions, management and teachers included. Everyone must be encouraged to take account of the specific situations related to disabilities. This heightened awareness is also needed if the directive is to be transposed. Transposition is currently incomplete.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point to note is that our political ambitions need to be brought into line, and financial programmes should be meaningful and appropriate to current needs. I could mention the great needs in the fields of education and schooling for example. I refer both to special and mainstream education. The two are not contradictory.</p>
<p class="contents">We know some disabled people are excluded, dependent and live in poverty. We must respond with action to develop independence, solidarity and integration. On this subject, the report before us today explores a whole series of approaches to be followed through all aspects of daily life. These areas are detailed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union and its Member States must truly stand by people with disabilities. It is not a question of charity. It is a question of rights. It is a question of the effective exercise of citizenship. This is the simple demand of disabled people.</p>
<p class="contents">In this European Year of People with Disabilities, I think the recommendations of our rapporteur will contribute to the current action being taken to ensure all concerned are truly citizens, just as we in this House are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Usually we all offer to say nice things about the disabled. What is not mentioned, however, is that the problem of disability does not concern a separate group of unlucky people; it concerns all of us, because we are all potentially disabled. We just have to remember the thousands of people made disabled every year by accidents at work or on the roads. This fact alone can incite us to the required degree and reduce our negligence to date.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that the major revolution in the approach to disability over recent years is that the disabled are not treated simply as people with problems but as subjects of human rights. However, what has not yet been fully realised is that this is not just a question of additional recognition of certain extra rights of a group of people. The recognition of the disabled as people with rights is part of the realisation of the idea of the functioning of democracy. It is therefore a question of the effective exercise of all existing fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Τhe right of free expression of opinion presupposes the right to information. Neither of these two rights can be exercised by the disabled unless they are given the right language. Universal access to public services is a dead letter if the obstacles to access to services for the disabled are not removed. The fundamental rights of the elector and the elected remain inactive for certain groups of disabled as long as no care is taken to ensure there are specialised arrangements which make it possible for them to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">This being so, it is not a question of wishing for more advanced safeguarding of rights which are already generally safeguarded for the disabled or even the principle of the recognition of specialised rights; it is a question of how such a fundamental issue to the functioning of democracy has remained unresolved for so many years. Allow me at this point to ask a simple question: 2003 has been proclaimed the Year of Disability. This sort of celebratory proclamation has a practical impact not only when it is confined to raising people’s awareness or collating material, but also when provision is made for specific timetables. I know that Commissioner Diamantopoulou has an increased interest in and is particularly sensitive to an advanced policy for the disabled. However, the Commission and the Member States do not appear to be on the same wavelength. This explains the fact that the Commission, as the rapporteur has pointed out, is avoiding making any such commitment. I should like, therefore, to ask the Commissioner to convey to the Commission our position that it is not possible for the European Union to reliably exert pressure on the members of the UN to vote for a special convention which will also be binding on developing and poorer countries when the more developed world refuses to set an example in this endeavour.</p>
<p class="contents">In all events, the basic line which needs to be adopted is not the recognition of new rights, but the effective application of rights already safeguarded in the international conventions recognised by the UN. In this way, safeguarding the rights of the disabled will move away from the idea that it is a question of granting rights and will be established on the perception that it is an obligation based on commitments undertaken internationally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am convinced that it is we legislators and politicians who are responsible for discrimination against people with disabilities, because of everything we have failed to do thus far. Mr Mantovani, in 2004, there needs to be a legally binding UN decision to protect people with disabilities – it is necessary because, otherwise, they will not have their rights – and there is also a need for a European directive on disability. I regret this too. I know that if Commissioner Diamantopoulou had the powers of a European minister – the powers of a minister of one of the national states – she would have already resolved the issue of people with disabilities, for we have all seen the importance she has attached to this matter over the past four years.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one more suggestion – to myself, more than anything – with a view to resolving the issue of disability: given that politicians are deaf, it may be better for us to channel our energies into educating young people – the few who are not – to respect disability.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, I will end, if I may, by mentioning a subject which is very dear to the shadow rapporteur, Mr Mantovani, who has been striving on behalf of the non-self-sufficient for a lifetime, and saying that, in too many parts of the world, the non-self-sufficient, in addition to being disabled, are also elderly and do not receive the financial assistance which would allow them to live dignified lives as elderly, disabled people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Every year, throughout the world and here in Europe, the fundamental rights of disabled people continue to be infringed in many ways. Even in Europe, the ill-treatment of disabled people is often a taboo subject, as is the very subject of disability itself. These problems affect real men and women but most importantly victims. Disabled people are vulnerable both physically and intellectually. This indicates the desirability of a legally-binding instrument and specific legal protection for disabled people the world over. I am, of course, very happy that this question is on the agenda of the United Nations. As was the case in respect of women and children, it is certainly now time for all the nations of the world to consider the protection of the fundamental rights of disabled people and the respect of these rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Drawing up a convention would establish global reference points for drafting national policies and legislation. It would enable appropriate monitoring and control mechanisms to be put in place to ensure that the fundamental rights and dignity of disabled people are respected. We are aware that the Charter of Fundamental Rights outlaws discrimination on the grounds of disability and states that the integration of disabled people must be assured. Above all, however, the first article of the Charter affirms the right to human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is founded on the rejection of the differentiation, segregation and negation of people on any basis whatsoever. It is therefore essential that, in addition to the categories of rights we have established in this report, we establish the right to protection against any form of violence and the right to protection against cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. In this regard, I hope the European Commission will be in a position to put to Parliament a proposal for a comprehensive European Union directive on disabled people at some time in the future. The action we take in relation to disabled people must seek to combat not only violence and ill-treatment, but also the negation and infringement of disabled people’s most fundamental rights in their daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I believe we must adopt pro-active policies to integrate disabled people into the whole of society on the same terms as any other citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important issue, and one that we are highlighting here in the European Parliament through campaigning for the Convention to become legally binding and to be accompanied by an efficient supervisory system, in common with the other six UN conventions on human rights. It is important for this Convention to be seen as a way of strengthening the UN’s general work for democracy and human rights around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to emphasise that, if disabled people are given opportunities to live outside institutions, they must be offered sufficient support for doing so successfully. In Sweden, people who would once have resided in institutions for mentally handicapped and/or mentally disabled people now, in large measure, live instead in their own homes, with the result that many of these people are no longer part of a social community and have instead been isolated in their flats or become homeless and out on the streets. That is a tragic lesson for other European countries to take into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important for there to be a sensible definition of ‘disabled’ as a concept so that it does not lose its real meaning. As a Swedish Christian Democrat, I should like to have seen us in the European Parliament state that the future Convention should include wording concerning the right to life, implying that disabilities should not form a basis for diagnosing foetuses as unviable, for it is absolutely basic to our view of human beings that people with disabilities should not be looked down upon and their human dignity violated. Foetal diagnosis must not be used for screening out people with disabilities.</p>

Tonight he has made his best speech ever in the House. It would appear that we have had some influence on him.</p>
<p class="contents">We all recognise that there are millions upon millions of people in the European Union and around the world who suffer indignities every day of their lives because we have failed, not only to pass legislation, but to change society's attitude to them. We constantly obstruct their path towards enjoying a full human existence. There are six hundred million disabled people across the world, 80% of whom are in the developing world. It is clear, as the Commissioner said, that we need to address this in our development and aid policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that a voluntary approach to guarantee rights for people with disabilities is not working. We need legally-based rights, as this report points out, at an international level. We need a convention to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">We are here as representatives of states, all of which have failed to implement a directive that they freely entered into not more than two years ago. They have all failed to implement the framework directive. Therefore we have to accept our own responsibility for that. It is a matter of regret for me that in my own country we have a proposed disability bill, intended to implement the framework directive, which refuses to accept a rights-based approach for people with disabilities. I simply cannot understand how, after all the years of experience, this continues to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with care to the Commissioner when she gave her reasons as to why she has not brought forward a draft directive under Article 13 of the EC Treaty. I have no doubts at all that she is committed to providing legally-based rights for people with disabilities, but her argument on not bringing forward a new draft directive is wrong. By bringing forward a new draft directive greater pressure would be brought to bear on Member States and people in this House to ensure that what is there already will be implemented. If we sit back and allow Member States to stall on the current directive, by not putting pressure on them through a new directive, we would be making a grave mistake.</p>

<p class="contents">As has already been emphasised in this debate, it is estimated that around 600 million people in the world are affected by one form of disability or another. This equates to 10% of the world’s population, and there is a direct link between disability on the one hand and poverty and social exclusion on the other. The problem faced by disabled citizens is the way in which principles of equality and non-discrimination are applied, in other words, the problems in accessing the rights of full citizenship also faced by people who are discriminated against on any other grounds. The most important aspect of overcoming this discrimination, furthermore, is the attitude that we all take in the various decisions we face in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Parliament’s intergroup for disabled persons – and I wish at this juncture to make a special reference to the group’s chairman, Mr Richard Howitt, who has been tireless in chairing this intergroup - in close collaboration with the European Disability Forum, we have, despite everything that has been achieved, noted some points on both minor and major issues that concern everyone: with regard to disabled access to city buses, to banning obstacles in the built environment and with regard to telecommunications. Much, however, remains to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">As our rapporteur said, it is curious that the Commission should consider a new United Nations convention to be needed to promote and protect the rights and dignity of disabled persons alongside other conventions devoted to specific areas of human rights and yet is not of the view that this principle should also apply to European legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Commission will pay sufficient attention to the Disabled People's Parliament that will be meeting in our own Parliament buildings in Brussels in November. We also hope that it will then think not only about the legislative initiatives that must be taken at international and Member-State level, but also about those that the Commission itself will be taking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
