I hope that such unanimity leads them to reconsider their position on these two amendments that you said you would not adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, regarding the report we are currently debating, I should like to point out that the specific aim of these technical measures is to protect juveniles of marine organisms in order to reduce the threat to future yields. As a result, alongside the Commission, we are aiming and endeavouring to protect fishery resources. As you know, such measures include rules on the size of fishing gear, – and of meshes in particular – minimum allowable landing sizes, specific closed areas, protection of endangered species and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The governing Regulation No 850/98 entered into force on 1 January of this year, but it must obviously continue to be periodically adapted to incorporate any new data and scientific innovations which may emerge. In the case we are currently dealing with, we are discussing the fifth amendment which will enable the Commission to include various new measures that, in our opinion, are fully justified. We are talking about nets for shrimp fishing, closed areas for fishing for sand eels and a review of the minimum size for certain bivalve molluscs and crustacea. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposed revisions and additions to Annex XII appear to be reasonable. However, in the newly added case of deepwater rose shrimp, the carapace length of 24 millimetres seems excessive and could cause problems for fishermen. As a result, your rapporteur has introduced an amendment, which has already been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, suggesting a compromise of setting this restriction at 22 millimetres. This compromise, of course, has already been agreed with the Member States as being more appropriate. We also feel that reducing the size of carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres, which has been widely called for by the sector, is a very positive step.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is now a question of adapting certain measures that will have a positive impact on economic and social spheres whilst strictly respecting scientific reports.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, it is essential that this regulation is kept up to date and that it is based on the best available scientific recommendations. This will not be the last amendment made given that there will be a continuing need to adapt to specific conditions and to scientific reports that emerge in the future. For this reason, with this amendment – which I think should be taken into consideration – we accept the overall proposal from the Commission and I hope that the Commission will in turn accept our amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A short while ago, we were still dealing with measures within the sphere of NAFO. We will now depart from the subject of offshore fishing in the ocean and go into detail on fishing in EU waters. It is not always just whales and seals which the public wants protected, and which attract, without doubt, greater attention from them. No, we must also direct our attention now and then to less popular species which do not look as cute. Who as a child has ever taken a carpetshell (<span class="italic">venerupis polastra</span>) in his arms as he would a soft toy? We certainly have a heart for children, but nothing concerns us quite so much as whether the juvenile fish are thriving. We are therefore always prepared to take the necessary measures to protect them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must protect the periphyton of marine organisms now in order to preserve all species. The regulation which we are dealing with is not a new one. In fact, it is being amended again today for the fifth time. In view of the developing populations, however, it must be amended time and time again in accordance with the requirements at a particular moment in time. The mechanisms are improved, and new minimum sizes and fishing methods to protect species are established, as is deemed necessary by the fisherman on the spot. In the end it is the theoretical expert who must give way to practice.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have any objections to the amendments which the Commission is proposing, right down to the last detail. They represent the latest technical and scientific developments. I think the Commission likes to hear this, and it is also therefore appropriate to emphasise the work done by the experts dealing with this in the Commission. Ultimately, Parliament has no interest in branding the Commission as its general scapegoat. On the contrary, I would like to use this report to show that things can also be done differently. The Committee on Fisheries is particularly benefiting from positive cooperation with the Commission and its services. This cooperation is imperative for the preservation of sea populations. Who, apart from the Commission, should monitor them and protect this natural resource? It is not always possible to fall back on artificially bred substitutes, which furthermore have been genetically manipulated wherever possible. Does it sound healthy to you, for instance, when I say that it is possible to breed super salmon which grow eight times faster than before? Quantity instead of quality? The awareness that we need to do something to preserve a healthy variety of food and the willingness to take appropriate action are the needs of the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go onto a fishing ground like the Huns, destroy it, and then simply move with the caravan onto the next one without taking responsibility for what is left behind. If the matter is worth something to us, economically as well as ecologically, we must also take appropriate action on our own doorstep and not just in the North-West Atlantic. These measures are a step in the right direction. I do not think that tourists, on boat trips in the future, will be able to watch sand eels as well as seals being reared, but maybe, in a few years’ time, we will once again be able to say, with a clear conscience, that we can fish for this species because its preservation is guaranteed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, we are now discussing the fifth amendment in two years to the regulation on technical measures for the conservation of juveniles of marine organisms. This is a report of a technical nature which is of no interest whatsoever to the majority of MEPs. However, perhaps their attitude would change a little if we were to explain exactly what it is about and how a report of this type can impact on the lives of the peoples of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, Commissioner, I shall refer specifically to the carpetshell, which is mentioned in paragraph 4. I shall refer to carpetshells as I am delighted that the Commission has reduced the minimum size for selling carpetshells from 40 to 38 millimetres. Ladies and gentleman, this is a matter of 2 millimetres of carpetshell. These millimetres are important because when the landing size was increased to the current 40 millimetres, this caused serious problems for women who harvest shellfish in my region, Galicia, as it did for the whole marketing sector and for consumers themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">In Galicia, shellfish gathering on foot – and this is how carpetshells are collected – is only done by women. It would take a long and complicated explanation to say why. The fact is that men gather shellfish at sea and using technology, albeit basic, and women gather shellfish on foot using a hoe. Approximately 10 000 women in Galicia extract carpetshells, as shellfish are not fished but rather extracted. These women work in a self-sacrificing way, working long days digging up hectares and hectares of beach in very difficult conditions for very low incomes. These women then see their income dwindle away as more than half their annual income is consumed by social security contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidence seems to contradict any research the Commission used to increase the minimum landing size of these molluscs as, from 30-32 millimetres upwards, the carpetshell is mature and can reproduce. Environmental conditions in densely populated areas where the carpetshell breeds and reproduces, such as in the estuaries of Galicia, do not allow them to reach the 40 millimetres required by the regulation which we are going to change today. The truth is that 80% of naturally produced carpetshells fall short of the current size requirement. If shellfish gatherers were to wait for carpetshells to reach this size, mortality would be considerable and such loss would be due to environmental conditions and not to the women’s actions. In places where molluscs are most abundant – and I am thinking of the Ferrol and Arosa estuaries – the size of carpetshells does not exceed 36 or 38 millimetres. Carpetshells measuring 40 millimetres are neither produced, sold nor consumed, simply because there are none.</p>
<p class="contents">If we wish to avoid encouraging non-compliance, one of the tasks of this or any other Parliament is to ensure that the rules reflect real conditions. In the case of harvesting shellfish on foot, such non-compliance leads to illegal fishing and to a black market subject to no health checks.</p>
<p class="contents">This House must realise that, by drawing up these technical measures, we are trying to protect juveniles, by allowing them to reach a certain size and breeding age, whilst at the same time trying to reduce unnecessary yields. But for a regulation to fulfil its purpose, it must be adapted to real conditions. As a result, not only will we benefit hard-working Galician shellfish gatherers but we will also benefit consumers as they will have access to a product that has passed all health checks. We will also encourage traders who will cease to feel persecuted by legislation that, if it were fully complied with, would lead to a shortage on the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the Group of the Party of European Socialists – which I represent – supports the proposed amendment to this regulation, in the same way as it supports the amendment from the Committee on Fisheries on the size of deepwater rose shrimp. The only thing we hope, Commissioner, is that we do not have to review the regulation again within a year, because this would mean that both we and the European Commission had once again made a mistake in our calculations. But, if need be, we will be here to amend it once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Technical measures in order, especially, to protect juvenile fish– and thus secure the quantities which can be fished in the future – may be necessary. Up until now, measures have consisted of reductions in quotas, minimum mesh sizes for nets and fishing bans in certain periods. It stands to reason that such measures and arrangements should be modified in the light of new needs and knowledge. What is new is that the fisheries in which sand eel are caught off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland are to become protected areas. The reason for this is the low breeding rate of the kittiwake in recent years. Denmark is the Member State which will be most affected by this limitation, which will reduce many fishermen’s potential catches and, in that way, affect their livelihood. As a matter of form, I would point out that Denmark has agreed to this technical measure for a limited period. I should like to ask the Commission if the fishermen have been compensated for their losses or been directed to other likely fishing grounds. Because bird colonies are affected by many factors in addition to fishing, I wish to propose that the Committee on Fisheries be included in future discussions about closures or limitations on quotas against the background of what is happening on land. What I want is for us to have the opportunity to look in depth at the different factors of relevance to bird colonies and, in that connection, to discuss the bird colonies’ influence on catch sizes in relation to the principle set out under the common fisheries policy whereby the fishing industry is to be safeguarded through the optimum exploitation of marine resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on today's fisheries reports, both of which I am sure will receive the overwhelming acceptance of this House and both of which are extremely important in terms of protection and conservation of fishery resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the Commission's updating of the regulation on the protection of juveniles. We all know that sustainable development is a learning process and we must be able to update and adapt existing legislation to protect our fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have paid particular attention to scientific advice which indicates the requirement for the closure of fisheries for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland. This does not just concern the maintenance of sand eel stocks themselves, but the preservation of the entire ecosystem in these localities. The low breeding rate of the kittiwake that Mr Busk referred to is of particular concern. I am also happy to note, as Mr Busk confirmed, that Denmark as a Member State principally concerned with sand eel fishery has accepted these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while these measures will hopefully contribute to improving the state of fishery resources, I am concerned that the Commission has not got it right in certain other areas: for example, in the recent report on the implementation of MAGPs and the drastic cuts that it calls for in some fleets which is of grave concern to Scots and other fishermen. I would like to ask the Commission if they have really looked at whether cutting fleet sizes actually improves the conservation of fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">I quote from the Commission's own document which says: "The Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries found no evidence that stocks had, in general, deteriorated or improved since the adoption of MAGP4." Surely we must question the effectiveness of MAGPs as a conservation measure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also failed to take into account how fleet sizes are reduced. I call for a more thorough investigation by the Commission into this. In those states which have, on paper at least, been complying with MAGPs such as Spain and Portugal, what has happened to the vessels which are removed from the register? How many would be decommissioned? How many were scrapped? How many were sunk and so on? How many were simply transferred to another flag? How many vessels continue to fish either here in the Community or elsewhere under what is, in many cases, a flag of convenience?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must get conservation measures right, but I am not convinced that MAGPs are the way to do that. They can be circumvented easily and they do not fully take into account national measures such as days at sea. How can the Commission reconcile this with the fact that its own report says, and I quote again: "It could be argued that a reduction in activity would have a more direct impact on the exploitation rates than a reduction in capacity."</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the Commission will review its position and not impose swingeing cuts on our fleets. In Scotland, the proposed cuts would cost hundreds of jobs in particularly fragile rural areas. The new proposals to cut fleets will, ironically, fall mainly on the Scottish pelagic fleet where MAGP targets have actually been met through control measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome today's reports on this agenda, but I hope the Commission will think again when it comes to the interrelation between fleet sizes and other conservation measures. We have got to get this right so that in the long run fish stocks in Europe are conserved, thereby ensuring the continuing viability of our fisheries communities.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although I think that the Commission’s proposal is not unreasonable, we have to bear in mind that the size limit is being set for the first time and that this species is an important part of the catches of certain fleets in southern Spain and Portugal where, until now, they have been fishing for shrimps without any size restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">In a species that does not grow very large, 2 millimetres is a great deal when trying to determine whether the profitability of some very small-scale fisheries will be increased or decreased. As I said, such fisheries are not used to fishing with minimum size restrictions. </p>
<p class="contents">What is more, Portugal, the other Member State involved, wanted this minimum size to be even smaller. As a result, I feel that the compromise reached is acceptable and to be commended.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the Commission for being so prepared to listen and to accept both suggestions from this House as well as from the Council, which were along the same lines. </p>
<p class="contents">I am also especially interested in the Commission’s proposal on the temporary halt on sand eel fishing in Scottish and English waters. I must also welcome the fact that Denmark, the country most dependent on fisheries, has not raised any major objections to this measure. Their attitude should enable us to progress towards a more realistic management system of fishery resources used for industrial purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I have often expressed my doubts about the idea that we should maintain large fleets in depleted ecosystems, such as those of the Community, which means that fish stocks are being destroyed in order to produce fish meal or oil.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Parliament Resolution of June 1998 on this type of fishing, which was based on a report drawn up by Mr Kindermann, it was highlighted that 60% of Community yields in the North Sea, Skagerrat and Kattegat are intended for this type of industrial use. Reports from the FAO and environmental organisations estimate that 70% of fisheries production is used to this end and say this is contributing to the destruction of stocks on a worldwide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Evidently, these figures also highlight the high socio-economic dependency of some Community regions on such activity. For this reason, while I have no desire whatsoever to eliminate this activity completely, it may be an opportune moment to debate the possibility of achieving a greater balance, taking account of the various fleets’ objectives in the use of resources. Eventually, this new balance should be borne in mind when distributing Community funds for structural measures as well as administrative and market policy measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report, whose name probably causes more confusion than clarity amongst those people who have not been following, the subject is in fact a number of separate amendments updating the original regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to separator trawls or nets with sorting grids used in shrimp fisheries; secondly, the revision of minimum sizes for a number of bivalve molluscs and crustaceans; and thirdly, with respect to the establishment of a closed area for fishing for sand eels off the north-east coast of England and the east coast of Scotland. It is on the last proposal that I primarily wish to speak.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very good example of the eco-system approach to fisheries: taking action for environmental reasons beyond those applying strictly for fish stock levels. In 1998, a report by the Working Group on Eco-System Effects of Fishing Activities of the International Council for Exploration of the Seas identified for the first time that sea birds, specifically the kittiwake, which has been experiencing low breeding success over recent years, were in fact in competition with the industrial fleet, primarily Danish operators fishing for sand eels off the East coast of Scotland and England.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom requested the Commission to submit an appropriate proposal in the light of that report and the United Kingdom made initial approaches to the Danish government to encourage their support for the initiative. It was suggested that a closed season for sand eel fishing should be introduced between April and August when the breeding birds were most dependent on sand eels for food.</p>
<p class="contents">The ICES subsequently looked at the science again and suggested a closed area stretching from mid-Northumberland northwards to include the Grampian coast. This closed area is the one proposed by the Commission in December as part of the annual TAC Regulation and adopted by the Council. These measures have, I understand, already been accepted in principle by the key parties involved. I therefore hope the Council will be able, after this debate, to reach a speedy agreement. It is important for the conservation of sea birds. It is important for us to demonstrate our concern in this area.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A gradual improvement in the regulations will contribute in the long term to the future health of the marine environment for the generations that will come after us. We can improve our resources. We are not self-sufficient in fish in the Union, only 50% self-sufficient. With good conservation and better practices, we could give a better living to more people involved in fishing. We could increase by something like EUR 4 000 million the value of the fish landed in the European Union if we could apply a little bit more care over a period of time to our fishing activities.</p>
<p class="contents">This is highly technical. It is important that we do the research, keep up the revision and gradually convince people that the European Commission is not a hostile organisation sent from afar to persecute fishermen and prevent them from making a living.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not use occasions like this to make inflammatory statements about the necessity of reducing the size of fleets that are involved, because of the reduction in stocks, because of the high price of fish arising out of its scarcity in the European Union and the attraction of this type of food for health reasons. There is a great urge to go out and catch more and more of it.</p>
<p class="contents">People complain about the Multi-Annual Guidance Programme and say it is not working. Surely, a transport manager will not want to keep ten buses on the road if one bus will transport the passengers available. The same applies to trains or trucks. So why do we get this pressure from the fishing communities to maintain large expensive fleets if, in fact, the fish are not there and we are bound by quotas? If the quotas are being observed, surely it is in the interest of the fishing communities of the regions and the individuals involved to go out and catch these fish with the smallest possible number of fishing vessels. Surely it contributes more to regional and national economic planning to do that. Do not swallow this foolish talk that we want to keep boats and that somehow or other this will keep people in jobs if the fish are not there.</p>
<p class="contents">There were banner headlines just because the Commission published, a few days ago, a report which indicated that some fleets would have to be reduced. Those reports spread over from Scotland to Ireland and the papers were full of massive reductions in the number of people employed. There is no need for it. Let us sit down, come to the Fisheries Committee, listen to the officials, listen to the researchers and work out a sensible solution to the problems instead of trying to create an atmosphere of hostility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have one programme broadcast in Ireland that deals with the sea. It is called "Seascapes". The night before we had the Maastricht Referendum, they upped their tone and the temperature of their anti-European broadcasting, which goes on continuously, in an effort to ingratiate themselves with fishing communities who have the impression that somehow or another the European Commission is there to damage their interests. Let us, as responsible public representatives, try to present the truth to our people instead of trying to mislead them and excite them and frighten them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
