Debates on globalisation and its impact are high on the agenda, both in the European Union and on a global scale. The report contains a great many proposals, which the Commission intends to examine in detail. I should, however, like to make a few preliminary remarks on a number of the report’s demands and proposals. I am delighted that Parliament has lent its support to the initiatives the Commission has proposed and developed with a view to strengthening the social dimension of globalisation. The Commission has adopted a proactive approach in order to help ensure that the benefits of globalisation are shared more widely, and to reverse its negative effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission backed the talks held by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation, which was established by the International Labour Organisation. The communication of 18 May 2004 contains the European Commission’s original proposals, and expresses clear support for the implementation of the World Commission’s final report. Since that time, these proposals have gained wide support, especially among the members of the European Council, the Council of Ministers, the European Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Your report and motion for a resolution contain a great deal of information that is of crucial importance for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">If the social dimension of globalisation is to be promoted in the European Union and elsewhere, joined-up measures that will command widespread support are needed. The Commission welcomes the outcome of the UN summit held in September. I would remind the House that the Commission played a part in the preparations for this summit, in particular by acting as a coordinator at EU level, and by making use of its contacts within the UN and the UN’s specialised agencies, such as the International Labour Organisation. The UN summit’s final declaration makes express reference to fair globalisation and decent work on the basis of fundamental social rights. As well as laying down principles, the declaration also stresses that the promotion of decent work and fair globalisation should be incorporated into development strategies at global and national levels. This UN backing is of crucial importance for the European Union’s external actions in all areas, whether in terms of enhancing our cooperation with the International Labour Organisation and other international organisations, or in terms of bilateral cooperation with other regions and countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to begin by saying that I much appreciated Commissioner Špidla’s speech in this Chamber today. The greatest challenge we face in our common future is that of how we in Europe can help make globalisation a real opportunity for social progress in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have just returned home from China, and let me tell you all that the Chinese are very concerned about the future of Europe. I told those to whom I was talking in China that I too was very concerned. I am concerned if we cannot stand united and work with the aim of making a contribution to the world that can maintain a balance. I am concerned if we cannot stand united in the world in order to fight for social justice and social progress in the developing countries. I am, moreover, concerned on behalf of India, Africa and China and on behalf of all the developing countries if we cannot stand together in order to keep to this objective, for if we cannot maintain the objective of greater social progress and justice, the whole world, including Europe, will lose out. It is therefore crucial to strengthen basic workers’ rights, as agreed by the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation. As draftsman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I entirely support this conclusion, and I know that my colleague Mr Christensen, who acted as PSE shadow rapporteur in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, also supports this conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I have focused on three main issues in my speech. Firstly, we cannot promote greater flexibility without providing our workers and children and women with greater social protection in exchange. Secondly, Europe must not compete in terms of social dumping. Europe must compete in terms of the best and not the worst. Nor should Europe export social dumping. Thirdly, Europe must have a role as the world’s social conscience in relation to development, the environment and employees’ rights. That is something I also know we agree with Mr Christensen about. Tomorrow, I shall report on the views taken of the social growth programme of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should, however, like the European institutions and the national authorities also to give some thought of their own to the matter, using the actual conditions in the Member States as a starting point. The social dimension of globalisation requires us to adapt the structures of society to the commitments made, but without for all that sacrificing what underpins society.</p>
<p class="contents">To begin with, I should like to address the social dimension of globalisation from the perspective of citizenship. Nothing cripples citizenship more than the feeling of inferiority generated by the daily onslaughts of poverty, subordination and dependency. Consequently, all our efforts should be aimed at ensuring that all those men and women who are today excluded from progress because of unfettered globalisation can hold on to, or regain, their dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark relates to one of the greatest challenges of globalisation: poverty. Last month, on 17 October, we commemorated the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. We said that, in order to combat poverty, we needed to enter into a close partnership with the poorest people. Unfortunately, the European Commission has not yet heard these calls. That is why I pray that the European and national institutions might take the contributions of the poorest families and citizens seriously. These people are the real experts when it comes to understanding the social dimension of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point relates to the contribution of women to this debate. The Lisbon Strategy anticipates that at least 60% of women will participate in the labour market in 2010. I am convinced that this objective has already been achieved. All that is required is for recognition to be given to all of the work done by women that is not officially recognised at present by the national and European authorities. What do we really know about the commitment made by women in leading intergenerational support networks and in being the driving force behind other forms of informal work? Society as a whole benefits from this.</p>
<p class="contents">I encourage the services of the European Commission together with the Member States to recognise the work done by women that is not yet officially recognised, and to do so irrespective of the social status of these women. This also forms part of the responses to the social challenge of globalisation.</p>

I should like to begin by saying thank you to the rapporteur, Mr Brejc, for his work on the report on the social dimension of globalisation and for cooperating with us so constructively in this connection. Globalisation has given many people in the world considerable advantages. It is just that the advantages are not distributed equally across all countries and all groups in society. This is something about which the EU clearly has a duty to do something. I am therefore pleased that the report focuses on, and gives rise to a debate about, the social aspect of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We all have a responsibility for finding new answers to the challenges. We must ensure that the people of Europe do not associate globalisation only with companies transferring their operations abroad, dreadful conditions of work and mass redundancies. Globalisation must, on the contrary, be associated with more and better jobs, more opportunities and increased prosperity for all. We must do away with the harmful consequences of globalisation and ensure that the positive aspects of globalisation are more evenly distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely in this area that the EU can play an important role. It must ensure that it creates good conditions for people in the EU so that they can cope successfully with international competition. It must not only focus on the market economy and the free play of market forces. It must also invest in people. If everyone is to be in a position to cope successfully with global competition, the fact is that more and better education is needed, together with an active labour market policy. Lifelong learning and the development of people’s skills are necessary if everyone is to be able to give a good account of themselves in the face of global competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second answer to the challenges of globalisation is that the EU must increase and promote the use of the social dialogue in both the EU and the rest of the world. Close cooperation between the two sides of industry can facilitate restructuring, just as increased information can reduce the fear of globalisation. In the rest of the world, the social dialogue will mean that labour market conditions are improved, for the EU also has an obligation to bring about social progress throughout the world. It is not only in the EU that globalisation must benefit people. In this connection, I should also like to thank my colleague, Mr Rasmussen, who has done some constructive work in drafting the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs so that the report also focuses on the EU’s external policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted that the Commissioner, on behalf of the European Commission, has expressed a similar view, and I hope that this view is also shared by the Council of Ministers, even though the seats reserved for the Council are empty, as I see they are. In our opinion, it is crucial for the European Parliament to pursue this matter, and thanks are due to the rapporteur for the motion for a resolution he has tabled. Although there are many different aspects to this issue, I should like to highlight two that I believe are particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the significance attached to the social dimension of globalisation depends to a large, if not decisive, extent on the emergence and consolidation of a civil society in every country. This is especially true in the case of those countries that are making insufficient progress in democratic and economic terms. The European Union should support civil society building in all the countries with which it cooperates, and particularly in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I should like to highlight is the role the European Union must play in monitoring globalisation and promoting its social dimension. Globalisation is inevitable, and it is a necessary, not to say indispensable, process. At the same time, however, we are all aware of the significant social risks it poses. Globalisation therefore needs to be controlled in such a way as to ensure that any negative effects are kept to a minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">This may well be the very foundation upon which the social dimension of globalisation is based, and I believe that the European Union can and should play a key role in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it does not, the mocking proverb according to which ‘the road to hell is paved with good intentions’ would no doubt have to be recast in a version for the EU, which would read: ‘the road to neo-capitalist globalisation is paved with the EU’s fine words on social policy’. The report is still far too vague about the correlation between poverty, business and the destruction of the environment; to take an example, the International Energy Agency’s ‘World Energy Outlook 2005’ paints a frightening picture of worldwide CO2 emissions increasing by 52% between now and 2030.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a clear trade-off between the destruction of the environment and the reduction of poverty, and it is above all the poorest who suffer from it. One of the functions of policy is to set clear boundaries for business; multinational conglomerates must accept much more responsibility for society and the environment, and the Triple Bottom Line approach is one example of how they can do so. The public can be guided towards more responsible ways of being consumers, and eco-label is one way in which this can be done. Consumers have the right to be told whether a product was manufactured fairly and in line with ILO standards or if exploitation was involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say something else about the WTO. I am perturbed by the excessive respect in which that organisation is held. Many politicians’ attitudes towards it suggest that they see it as some sort of force of nature. The WTO must become more democratic. Elected institutions must redefine its objectives and monitor its activities. This is another area in which the EU must bring much more influence to bear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also exacerbating environmental imbalances, both between different countries and within individual countries, as demonstrated by the UN’s figures and reports.</p>
<p class="contents">High levels of unemployment, inequalities in the distribution of wealth, poverty and social exclusion are also causing rising social tension, something to which we in the EU are not immune. It is therefore not enough simply to observe the current situation; what is needed is a clean break from the political, economic, monetary and international trade policies that have led to this situation, both at world level and at EU level, in order that the strategic objectives for sustainable development can be met and living standards throughout the world can be raised.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for amendments that we have tabled are aimed at stressing the importance of changing some of these policies, as a matter of urgency, in such a way that the social dimension is given due prominence. Practical measures must urgently be taken to combat financial speculation in the world’s capital markets, for example, by taxing the movement of capital and stock market capital gains. This will serve to reduce the volatility of the capital markets and the risk of financial crisis, to boost investment and wealth creation in the real economy, and, in so doing, to promote social inclusion and ensure respect for human rights. It is moreover vitally important that the Lisbon Strategy and the Stability and Growth Pact be replaced with a European strategy of real solidarity and sustainable development, aimed at promoting equal rights and social protection for all, eradicating poverty and social exclusion, solving problems of precarious work, and strengthening the social rights of workers, the unemployed, the elderly and children. Universal access to high quality public services, in areas such as water supply, health, education and housing, is of fundamental importance. Accordingly, the EU, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation and GATT, must not give precedence to liberalising services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It started from Rome as ecumenism, last century the communists tried to impose it as internationalisation and, today, globalisation is the answer of capitalism.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask anyone in Europe – the tradesman in Cologne, the artisan in Marseille, the farmer in Greece: are they happy with the results of globalisation?</p>
<p class="contents">The only people who are happy are the Chinese with 12% growth. What do we get out of it? What is going well in Europe? Countries with a strong economy, such as Germany, are now in deficit. What do we get out of it? Unemployment is increasing and we cannot get it under control. What do we get out of it? Everything comes from China. Is it not true that everything comes from China? Is it not true that we are trying, now that the horse has bolted, to find a way to stop the whole of China coming here? This is the reality. The third countries took our factories and we get their inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have these incidents in France, with those whom Mr Sarkozi called 'scum'; and of course I disagree with the term used by the French Minister for Home Affairs. However, these people do not have work, because the factory where they worked left for North Africa or the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">So globalisation does not benefit us Europeans, but we are so clever. We took our currency and revalued it against the dollar by 50%. How can we do anything with the euro so high? How will we be able to address globalisation? How can we safeguard viable pensions? Do you know what the average pension is in Greece? It is equal to an MEP's per diem. The EUR 270 which we get here today is more than a Greek farmer gets in a month. Can we safeguard a viable European pension? Can we safeguard work for all Europeans? Can we safeguard cotton, which is in warehouses in Greece, which Europe does not take so that it can take cotton from third countries? Can we safeguard Spanish oil, which Europe does not take so that it can take oil from Tunisia?</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reality. What globalisation are we talking about? What are the results? I repeat, what does Europe get out of it? What are we safeguarding for European citizens? We have played the game of the United States of America so that big business can reap the benefits.</p>
<p class="contents">The only ones who are happy are Carrefour and Lidl, and how so? By exploiting people. I went to Lidl here in Strasbourg and bought a few things. I bought the same things in my own country three times more expensive. The same product, the same name, the same quantity. How can small retailers survive? How can artisans survive? That is why we are moving towards a shrinking economy, towards a problem which we will have to face. Beware; I do not know if this heedless enlargement of Europe will be its downfall, but its biggest problem will be the economy. Globalisation will seriously damage the future of Europe.</p>

All too often, when we talk about globalisation, our comments and concerns centre solely on trade, rather than on the social aspects of globalisation. In fact, the European Union can play a very significant role in disseminating best practices through what we have achieved in the Union itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the faults that exist within the European system, there are also many good and positive things. I wish to give just one example of this. Two weeks ago I was in Nairobi. In one of the slums there I visited a school which has 1 690 students and 22 teachers. The principal of that school was earning the equivalent of EUR 150 per month. The only reason there were so many children going to the school was because they were given food donated by the European Union and the World Food Programme. They were being encouraged to learn but were also being fed. I am reminded of the saying ‘give a man a fish and you feed him for a day, but teach a man to fish and you feed him for life’.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most important aspects of the social aspect of globalisation is education, because no matter how many trade issues you deal with or how many preferential trade deals you give to developing countries, the people in those countries will never be able to climb out of the pit of poverty to which so many of them are consigned unless they are given proper access to education and healthcare and an understanding of how systems operate. Our role, our duty and our responsibility, be it in world trade or in the United Nations, or even within our own development aid actions, should be to ensure, first and foremost, that when we speak about globalisation we place people at the centre of the debate. It is not just about trading blocs. It is not just about economic returns. It is about ensuring that the world itself is a better place for future generations. That can only be achieved if we invest in the people themselves.</p>

Yet, with 20 million unemployed people in Europe, what social model are you talking about? The Lisbon process, which is a failure? The debt of those Member States that are on the verge of bankruptcy? Social precarity, crushing taxation and the new type of poverty of Europe’s Fourth World? Do you believe that all of this might constitute a social model that we can export?</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to have an accurate view of the social dimension of globalisation, I invite you to go and be a tourist in the 300 French towns that, for the last 18 days, have been the scenes of social uprisings, ethnic riots and anti-French hatred, with burning cars and destroyed schools, creches, gymnasiums and hospitals, and all this without mentioning the systematic and widespread attacks on fire fighters and law enforcement officers. You will thus assess the tangible and visible consequences of the extreme ultraliberal, ultra-internationalist and ultra-immigrationist economic policy carried out for the past 25 years by the European institutions and the Member States, with France at the helm.</p>
<p class="contents">Your social model of integration is, in fact, an out-and-out model of disintegration: economic and industrial disintegration, social disintegration, cultural disintegration and institutional disintegration. In addition to businesses relocating to countries with low social costs linked to production, the populations of poor countries are relocating to countries with high levels of social protection. Widespread social dumping brought about by globalisation is just what is needed economically to bring about social decline. Your economic globalisation is, in fact, globalisation of social dumping and of migration. Foreign populations are entering Europe en masse, while businesses are leaving Europe en masse. Today we have to tolerate not only the rioters in our suburbs, but also the economic looters plundering our industries, combined with the political and institutional bandits pillaging our national identities, our national units, our sovereignties and our values of civilisation. Enforced economic and migratory globalisation will end up imposing on the people of Europe a multi-community and multi-ethnic society, positive discrimination, obligatory racial mixing and a level of social protection equal to that of Communist China. That model is clearly not ours, and it is crucial today to defuse that ticking timebomb.</p>

<p class="contents">The report being discussed today includes an account of measures relating to the social dimension of globalisation. The report also constitutes a first response of the Commission and of the European Parliament to the dimensions of globalisation and, of course, to the report of the World Commission on the Social Dimension of Globalisation, set up by the International Labour Organisation (ILO).</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of definitions of globalisation. The basic idea behind globalisation is the progressive integration of economies and societies. It is driven by new technologies, new economic relations and national foreign policies of various entities, ranging from governments to civil societies. Globalisation is a process which does not carry an ideological content, neither that of the Left or of the Right, neither that of the Liberals or the Greens. It is a process which entails positive and negative consequences. For that reason we may consider it from various viewpoints, the economic, financial, technological, environmental and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The social dimensions of globalisation constitute the subject matter of this report. The Commission communication emphasises the social dimension of bilateral and regional relations within Europe which encompass bilateral and regional agreements, political dialogue at the regional level, the European Union neighbourhood policy, respect for human rights and democratisation in the third countries, migration development and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which, amongst other things, place emphasis on the cooperation policy, on ensuring that the trade policy fully underpins social progress giving developing countries access to the markets of developed countries, and on the support for a specific initiative for social progress and the transposition of good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">In my report, I have tried to place particular stress on the following: we have to strengthen the factors of globalisation which act in a positive manner and we have to create conditions for a reduction in the negative impact of globalisation. The Member States of the EU can set the good practices they have developed as an example for other parts of the world to follow and should endeavour to make the revised Lisbon Strategy a success.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to promote a climate which supports enterprise, investment and social progress. We need, however, a more flexible labour market, less bureaucracy and greater personal responsibility. To maintain the competitiveness of the European economy and social progress, we need large investments in human resources and for this reason I welcome the efforts of the Commission in that direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has to support the so-called Core Labour Standards and the ILO’s Decent Work Agenda. We have to seek to attain observer status for the ILO at the World Trade Organisation with a view to improving the quality of interinstitutional dialogue. We should stress the significance of a united front within international institutions, develop Corporate Social Responsibility and urge enterprises to use appropriate measures and good practices. In this context, I would like to mention the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises. We should also highlight the important role of educational institutions and the media in the process of keeping the public well informed about the impact of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I note with interest the idea for a Parliamentary Group to be set up to oversee the coherence and consistency between global economic, social and environmental policies and to provide a holistic overview of the most important international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultation on the Commission communication and my report has provided a fruitful ground for a number of amendments, none of which concern the social dimension of globalisation. While I would like to urge you to restrict this consultation to the social dimensions of globalisation only, I do understand my colleagues who would like to highlight other aspects in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, we have received amendments concerning the common agricultural policy, environmental aspects, oil and gas trading and so on. Some of the amendments are far–removed from reality and would be better placed in the dustbin of the history of socialism than in the context of the modern welfare state and I cannot, therefore, lend them my support.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this opportunity to thank the Commission for drafting an excellent communication and extend my gratitude to all my colleagues who have made an important contribution in shaping the report of the European Parliament on the social dimensions of globalisation.</p>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that globalisation results in increased economic output, as well as reducing costs and the differences between corporate cultures. That is the good thing about it. It does, though, also lead to far keener competition, which can entail serious job losses and be a source of serious anxiety for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Christensen is quite right to say that the benefits of globalisation are not equally distributed, but it does bring progress, and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is in favour of using that progress and getting to grips with solving structural problems. If we want to look forwards and compete – as we must – then there must be reforms, but we must, at the same time, find innovative ways of responding to social challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, my colleague Mr Brejc put together an excellent report, which was even-handed enough, concentrated on the essentials and came up with crystal-clear solutions, but its 17 compact paragraphs were suddenly inflated into 39 by the desire of certain Members on the Left of this House to introduce a whole new dimension into it, which they believed to be necessary. I have to say that I do not agree with them! In the twinkling of an eye, they make effective institutions into instruments of regulation; one can almost feel the bureaucrats breathing down one’s neck. They urge the Commission to monitor the compatibility of fisheries partnership agreements with the Millennium Development Goals, and stress the importance of such issues as the threat of eco-destruction and the loss of biodiversity.</p>
<p class="contents">If the subject were ‘the ecological dimension of globalisation’, then that would be all well and good and we could talk about it, but the report is about ‘the social dimension of globalisation’. There are times when one has to concentrate on the matter in hand if one is not to end up in considerable difficulties. It is grotesque that demands should be made for such things as measures to deter businesses from relocating in order to obtain EU subsidies. Where a business is to be based is not decided at short notice and with payments from Brussels in mind; it is a long-term process involving major financial transactions and long-term decision-making by management.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us cut through the tangled growth of repetitious verbiage, irrelevant matter and high-flown ideological posturing; what the own-initiative report called for was in fact perfectly clear, namely extensive investment in human capital, improvements in countries’ educational systems, the promotion of professional expertise – which is more urgently needed than ever – and the creation of high-quality jobs in line with the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, of the ILO? I agree with the rapporteur, and with some of those who have already spoken, that the ILO must concentrate more on humane working conditions. We must carry on struggling to prevent social exclusion, to do away with child labour and to win the war on poverty. What the ILO needs is observer status within the WTO, and we would welcome an institutional multi-stakeholder forum on corporate social responsibility. Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be better inter-connected if they are to be enabled to actively participate in a globalised economy and if new jobs are to be created, and the social partners need to be involved in all decision-making processes if the social dimension is to be strengthened. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The WTO’s sixth Ministerial Conference is due to be held in Hong Kong this December, and it will be yet another of the kind at which there will be no discussion of a ban on child labour, or of the abolition of forced labour, not to mention freedom of association or the right to set up trade unions.</p>
<p class="contents">The examples I have just given are core labour standards, and there can be no fair trade without them. The Commission communication that we are discussing today sets out the things that the Community can do to make the globalisation process fairer for everyone, and, with that in mind, I would like to draw the House’s attention to a negotiating mandate for the 1999 WTO Ministerial Conference in Seattle, which expressed the EU’s desire for a conference at ministerial level on the subjects of trade, employment and core labour standards.</p>
<p class="contents">At that time, the Commission – and it is the Members of the Commission that I would like to remind of this – undertook to hold such a conference in 2001. If you, Members of the Commission, want to take action, then I suggest that you make a start by doing what you undertook to do years ago. I expect of you no other than this, that you hold this conference at long last, for fair trade is more live an issue than ever, if – as you now should – you take the social dimension of globalisation seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a matter of great topical interest and was also the subject of a lively debate during the recent informal meeting of Heads of State or Government held on 28 October at Hampton Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation is a complex process, a source of both opportunities and challenges, and therefore needs to be managed in such a way as to deliver all its benefits while simultaneously minimising its concomitant social and economic imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">Here, the Union has a positive contribution to make by promoting its development model at international level. I therefore agree with the rapporteur’s proposal to relaunch and reinforce the Lisbon Strategy, which stresses the interdependence of the economic, social and environmental dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with him on the vital importance of investing in human resources, professional training and research and innovation, which are all vectors for development focused on social justice.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that is not enough by itself. As recent events in the French suburbs have shown, even the Union’s most industrialised countries have serious social imbalances, which leave whole swathes of the population feeling marginalised.</p>
<p class="contents">Good global governance is not enough to solve these problems; the demands of the country also need to be better understood. To survive and prosper, a globalised economy needs a more solid foundation; it must promote more extensive and more inclusive social action and must be compatible with local requirements. This is why we need to think globally and act locally. In my view, the keyword is ‘<span class="italic">Glocal</span>’.</p>
<p class="contents">The European model, therefore, needs an overhaul which, without compromising the important social progress achieved in the 20th century, will help it to get closer to the people and thereby respond more effectively to the demands of a constantly-changing society and of an economy now operating on a global scale. Europe must look to the future with courage and cannot afford to fail the test of globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Globalisation is the central ideology of the urban and <span class="italic">petit bourgeois</span> opportunistic ideological movements of various hues, but with a common ambition to try and camouflage capitalism and its class structure.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication by the European Commission on the social dimension of globalisation analyses the phenomena from the point of view of the interests of big business and tries to obscure the real reasons for modern problems. At the same time, for the new economic and social reality which is being shaped, it proposes as a strategy at regional and international level the alleged need to accept and reform the imperialist unions.</p>
<p class="contents">Capitalist restructurings are the answer of the European Union, with the promotion of competitiveness as their main feature. The Lisbon Strategy and the success of its updated expression are the basic parameter of the Commission's choices and proposals in the contribution of the European Union to the process of globalisation. An evaluation of all the data shows that the term 'globalisation' is a misnomer. It covers the nature of and the crisis in the system. The era we live in is not an era of globalisation; it is an era of imperialism. The working classes and the workers in general reject the reactionary process and the course of so-called globalisation and are fighting for radical changes and grass-roots prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that the challenges relating to European Union development are often perceived by the public as a globalisation process is very worrying and is yet another key argument that calls for us to formulate appropriate policies in order to endow the processes of globalisation with a social dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of globalisation, as is rightly emphasised in the report, also brings with it significant positive benefits, but equally the positive results of globalisation, which, objectively, is essential throughout the world, may not be achieved if attention is not paid in good time to social aspects. The outcome of the globalisation process will depend on the capacity of its participants to adapt in rapidly changing circumstances, and for this reason support should be given to the importance of implementing the Lisbon Strategy, as the report stresses on several occasions, so that the European Union may be able to derive maximum benefit from the globalisation process and to win public acceptance of that process in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, however, the report has here departed from the current reality in the European Union. The endless debates about the reform of the common agricultural policy demonstrate that at the moment the European Union can only agree on a budget structure that meets 19th century needs. We are witnesses to the struggles here in the European Parliament on the Services Directive. We know the importance that this directive has for the European Union’s Lisbon Strategy: it is one of the strategy’s cornerstones. Therefore, in my view, it is actually here, in the extent of our willingness, that the greatest threats of globalisation lie hidden, since public opinion in an increasing number of European Union Member States is not ready for the challenges of competition even within the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, however, it also represents a great opportunity for people from all continents, countries and regions. One need only look at the booming Chinese economy to see proof of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same way that socialism was needed to take the edge off 19th century capitalism, however, the globalisation of today needs a social dimension, without which it will be nothing but a wasted opportunity for humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the EU must speak out with one voice in favour of globalisation with a human face, it is painfully obvious that the EU itself lacks integration, a common foreign policy, a strong budget and a services directive capable of boosting the economies of the new Member States. Workers have no freedom of movement within the EU, unlike capital, and the common agricultural policy is unjust.</p>
<p class="contents">All the more praise and recognition is therefore due to the rapporteur, who has temporarily overlooked the unjust division into old Member States and new Member States, instead advocating a fair division of goods on a global scale. The European social model, as set out in the Lisbon Strategy, should become our calling card and our leading export.</p>
<p class="contents">The accumulation of goods has now reached such levels that the most important task facing the world is the decision to divide these goods up fairly, while ensuring that everyone can live and work in dignity. The outsourcing of human rights and workers’ rights must follow on the heels of the outsourcing of capital. We should set up institutions that support the work of the WTO and that endeavour to bring a social dimension to globalisation, such as the Council for Human Development mentioned in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must say, however, that, if there are no changes to it, it will be difficult to support the report in the form it has been drawn up following the committee’s reading of it. In its present form, the report states that globalisation leads to gulfs and imbalances between countries and within societies. That is emphatically not the case. If there is anything at all that globalisation has provided, it is well-being and prosperity for the poor parts of the world. We see today how poverty has been combated in large parts of Asia. We see how people in Taiwan, China, India and ever more other countries are slowly obtaining progressively more dignity and increased prosperity. Globalisation has helped do away with poverty of a kind that, for centuries, characterised large parts of the world in which we now see wealth and well-being increasing, as well as respect for the individual. It is important to state that, directly contrary to what is stated in the report, it is, in actual fact, precisely in those parts of the world not reached by globalisation that we have stagnation and poverty, for example in those parts of Africa and Asia in which free and open trade are not practised and in which people are excluded from globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the lack of globalisation and participation in the global economy that produces indigent people, poor living conditions and undignified working environments. It is also easy to see that this is the case, for where do we find the worst working environments and the worst social conditions? It is not in developing countries, but in those countries that belong to the lost world and that are excluded from the global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It may also be worth asking whether we should be better off if the poor parts of the world were not being developed. Would we be better off if the Chinese or Indian economy had not been developed? For a number of different reasons, the answer to that question is of course ‘no’, partly because it is good that life is progressively improving in these countries and partly because these same countries constitute our growing markets. Europe is a continent that, to the very highest degree, thrives on globalisation. Our well-being, prosperity and high wages depend on our having companies that can operate and develop throughout the world by offering high-quality products and services.</p>
<p class="contents">If we try to put a stop to globalisation, we ourselves are affected. If we try to impose our rules on other countries, they, for their part, are then hit. It is free trade that, both historically and in the present time, creates increasing well-being and respect for people. That is the basis on which we must proceed when making policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is timely, with only a few weeks to go until the opening of the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Hong Kong.</p>
<p class="contents">The form of globalisation that we know today has always been presented to us as a positive phenomenon that creates wealth. It certainly has its winners but - to plagiarise the former Prime Minister of France - globalisation is a new aristocracy of money and power, which today accumulates profits and relegates a majority of losers to the sidelines. We are not only noticing an increase in the inequalities in North-South relations, but we are also discovering that these inequalities are reflected today in South-South relations and within the very heart of a Western society in which the gap between the richest and the poorest has become dramatically more pronounced over the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The pursuit of social globalisation has the effect of endangering social rights and creating disgraceful working practices and dangerous imbalances. This new situation forces us no longer to view the world with the same detachment. We have to take note of the fact that this process of liberal, non-transparent and unfettered globalisation is of concern to our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet, who can hold it against them if they are afraid for their jobs, their future, their democracy and the environment of the planet on which they live? No one. For what have we done to respond to these legitimate anxieties? If I were to take the most recent example, that of the last UN Summit in New York, the results were disappointing. They were disappointing in terms both of the concrete commitments made towards the poorest countries and of the reform of the international institutions. Europe has to act in a coherent and credible fashion. Doing so at multilateral level is exemplary behaviour. That is why incorporating strict social and environmental standards into the rules of trade and checking that these standards are upheld in the bilateral agreements we sign, are priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe also has to act as an example internally. To do that, it has to improve its model, put in place a system of upwards social harmonisation, put a stop to the dismantling of public services and reject a market Europe. Europe provides an opportunity and a hope. It has to be the main actor in a different form of globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You say that the Lisbon agenda will, in bringing together the social components, enable us to meet the challenges of globalisation. It will do no such thing! The year is 2005; the period is halfway through. We have conducted a mid-term review, and expressed the criticism that these methods will not work on their own. To a large degree, globalisation has helped to create wealth, but – and this I say to Mr Hökmark – it has, equally, contributed to greater poverty, more exclusion, and to more social division, which does not, indeed, add up to equality and justice for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should have more to say about the Gothenbourg Summit, for that is where the economic, social and ecological triad – to which I would like to see the protection of consumers added – was set in stone, for that, in fact, is our fundamental concern. Trade must, by definition, be free, but liberalisation alone will not move us forward, for we need environmental, labour and social standards, and it is only if we include these and take them on board that we really do have a chance of making trade fair across the globe. That is a world away from your approach, and it is for that reason that Hong Kong will, unfortunately, be a repeat of what we have seen before. If we get fixated on trade and take no account of the other social components, we will get nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we would stand a chance if we were to enforce the global standards that already exist and limit imports into the European Union to those goods manufactured in accordance with them. To do so would help us and reverse the trend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is clearly, therefore, the structure we should use in addressing global problems such as poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome – as most people do – the recent initiative by the G8 to implement further the process of debt relief for the Third World. This is only right and proper, as debt relief is presently crippling many countries in the Third World. The Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative achieved moderate success in tackling debt relief for the 42 poorest countries in the world, but this was only an initial effort by the developed world to tackle the problem of debt relief itself. The European Union is the largest contributor of development aid in the world and therefore must continue to show real leadership when it comes to addressing humanitarian and development aid problems in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the WTO is the best structure to open up competition in the industrial services and trading sectors. It is in all our interests that a multilateral framework be put in place to govern the trading relations of the 150 different members of the WTO at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore evident that tough decisions will have to be taken if a deal is to be reached in time for the Hong Kong ministerial round next month. I do not want to see a repeat of the Cancun round of WTO talks, which was a lost opportunity and, indeed, set progress back in this regard by at least two years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, Mr Brejc, deserves our praise because, in commenting on this communication, he has produced a basic report which has turned into an extended list of wishes and admonitions in order to highlight the basic objective of the two previous texts. The objective, of course, is the fairer distribution of the benefits of globalisation between the peoples of this planet and better forecasts of the costs which are often connected with sudden global changes. This broad wish list, both in the communication and in the Commission's report, must be incorporated by the Member States on a daily basis, both in their legislative and in their executive work.</p>
<p class="contents">It rightly emphasises that the entire spectrum of education in developing countries is the basic means for creating quality jobs which will safeguard a better life for people in their country of birth, because another issue, apart from poverty, child labour and overworking by women, is the concern being expressed about the brain drain from developing countries, especially in the health professions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us, as European institutions, help to create the means of overseeing the multilateral system of the global economy and addressing cohesion and consistency between global economic, social and environmental policies. We here also take a positive view of the global action of social organisations in order to promote honest social governance and, more importantly, in connection with the guidelines of the OECD for multinational companies, which the Commission supports.</p>
<p class="contents">The global area has a familiar name in Greek; it is called 'ecumene', a word from which the term ecology, care of the environment, is derived in numerous languages. However, its main, original meaning is the concept of the space populated by man and it reminds us of our obligation to link globalisation with compliance with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the need for the basic labour rules of the International Labour Organisation to be mandatory. We have five years in the European Union to achieve the Lisbon Strategy, to make Europe the first power in the knowledge economy, with respect for the environment and promoting a new social model which we can propose globally. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For millions of people in Europe and throughout the world, though, globalisation is not one. Some benefit, while others suffer its adverse effects – a win-lose situation, in other words. Although critics may question this, I think that we must try to turn globalisation into a win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Brejc’s report contains a number of interesting proposals in order to achieve this. I endorse his appeal to use EU funds to alleviate the adverse effects of globalisation. It should be clear what is meant by this. We must not pump funds around needlessly and must not keep alive at all costs those industries that are doomed to fail anyway. Instead, we should free up funds to ensure that people who lose their jobs through globalisation are given the opportunity to find a job in another sector.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that the funds should be used to create new opportunities, rather than to needlessly prolong the suffering of insolvent sectors. In so far as that is what it is intended to do, I am pleased with the Commission’s proposal to set up a globalisation fund. This need not necessarily involve new funds. We could examine how existing funds could be redirected in order to get this globalisation fund off the ground. Clearly, something must be done. If we do nothing for the people who lose their jobs through globalisation, they will end up in a lose-lose situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am indebted to Mr Brejc for this report, which I think will galvanise us into action. We should put our money where our mouth is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the role of legislators not to resist globalisation but to make sure its benefits reach as widely and deeply as possible. In this respect we should acknowledge and welcome the proactive role of the Commission in supporting the UN conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">I share with Mr Kułakowski the regret that the Presidency of the Council does not, apparently, regard this debate today as important enough to command the presence of a minister. The social dimension of globalisation is highly important, because globalisation brings with it change and all change is a challenge. Our role is surely to help our society equip itself and adapt to meet that challenge much more strongly. As Mr Crowley said so eloquently this evening, this is all about people.</p>
<p class="contents">The original Brejc report addressed the subject sensitively and sensibly. Sadly, as so often in the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, it now embodies amendments that are less sensitive and certainly less sensible. That is why we have to trouble the House to vote tomorrow to get closer to the original report and delete most of those amendments, except of course my own!</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot support the sudden suggestion to make CSR – corporate social responsibility – compulsory. We cannot support calls for exporting the EU social model as a condition of opening up world trade. We cannot support calls for increasing the EU budget. The PPE-DE Group has therefore put forward a number of amendments to remove these and other muddled messages.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the House will support those revisions. If it does not, the UK Conservative delegation would agree with Mr Hökmark, as well as many other colleagues, and reluctantly vote to reject this report as it stands. We want to get back to a report about the social dimension, not just the Socialist dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Malta, my fellow workers are going through disastrous changes. Everyday they face a lack of work, and now, all of a sudden, we had the news that a factory employing eight hundred and fifty people to produce jeans is going to leave to start manufacturing outside the European Union. This means that in a small country like ours, with the thrust of a knife, suddenly we have 0.5% of our workforce losing their jobs in one single day. About two years ago these people had read in brochures that, if we entered the European Union, God willing, we would solve all the problems related to the challenge of globalisation, they promised them what they used to call a 'new spring'. Maybe we were not so popular because we used to tell them the truth, that we had to work everyday in order to be competitive. Now that we are members of the EU, though, we have to see that we put people before profits, that persons come before directives. Some would say that this cannot be done because of our rules; in that case, Commissioner, we have to change the rules.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the debate has also provided clear confirmation of something that we had in fact all suspected, namely that globalisation has been underway for a relatively long time, or in other words at least 300-400 years. It is also apparent that this process will continue apace, and that an interconnected world whose inhabitants are in close contact with each other has become a part of our lives. There is therefore an urgent need to give globalisation a human face and a social dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also no getting away from the fact that it is impossible to find a straightforward solution or a single initiative that could solve the entire problem. Nevertheless, I believe that it is crucially important that the European Union has decided to turn its attention to the social dimension of globalisation, and to promote it in close cooperation with the United Nations and, in particular, the International Labour Organisation. This approach is capable of delivering results, and I believe that it is very much the right one to take, even though the results may only be incomplete in certain cases. It was with great interest that I listened to this debate, and I will also be very interested to follow developments regarding the report that has been drafted and the structure of the amendments that will be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People say that the world is getting smaller, and that it will soon become one village, although others believe it would be truer to say that a very narrow section of the social elite of the world are growing closer to each other, while the majority are increasingly excluded from opportunities. It is debatable whether what we are seeing is globalisation or an increasing divide between richer and poorer sections of society on a global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation can be turned to both good use and bad.</p>
<p class="contents">However, a detailed analysis of economic processes reveals that the poorest peoples of the world are those who are excluded from the process of globalisation, while countries that claim their share in the international division of labour have seen an increase in their national income. Given that two of the most populous countries of the world, China and India, are among the latter, globalisation has in fact helped the majority of the world’s poor to achieve a higher standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">All indications suggest that isolation from globalisation brings greater risks in terms of poverty effects than if a country participates in globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation must benefit everyone. For this to happen, strong international institutions are needed to ensure sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed in Europe and throughout the world is to establish clear roles linked to clear deadlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The external and internal policies of the EU, its social model and its development at international level could also serve to other regions of the world as a model of ethical globalisation with a positive impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
