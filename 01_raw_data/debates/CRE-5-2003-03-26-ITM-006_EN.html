What we are dealing with here is the fact that the wording of Article 32 and the declaration of Annex XV to be primary law mean that the Council is in breach of its Agreement with Parliament. This has to do with Parliament and the candidates for accession not being dealt with in the same way as the other Member States. This is quite clearly a legal problem, and it is also a problem in terms of a fundamental issue. Those of us who sit on the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy take an interest in the equal treatment of the candidate countries, but – as Parliament's fundamental rights are involved – we especially support the position of the Committee on Budgets as well, for budgetary law is the prerogative of any Parliament, and must not be set aside even in a situation such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not understand the Council. Although our dialogues made reference to many options and possibilities, which are also contained in the draft resolution on which we will be voting tomorrow, the Council has adopted none of them, even though that would have made it possible for us to come to an understanding by now. Responsibility for this lies with the Council. I am perfectly aware that the Greek Presidency of the Council is making every effort to resolve this, so I am not attacking the Presidency; this is more about the conduct of a number of the Member States' governments. I get the feeling that the government of my own country also has a part in this, and not one about which we can be entirely happy.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard it as an unworthy trick to confront ten countries that have made the journey, by way of a great process of transformation, from dictatorship to being invited to join the European Union, with a situation that makes them insecure, and, at the same time, to go about curtailing Parliament's rights, even though it was the advent of democracy that was crucial in overcoming dictatorship. That the Council should behave in this way leaves me baffled.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me ask the Presidency's representatives to inform their colleagues that we will not allow the process of European unification to be wrecked by tax inspectors scrutinising certain aspects of the administration of power. We know perfectly well that, financially speaking, we cannot push this too far; it would be disproportionate to take excessive advantage of a Budget, for that is not what we are aiming for. What we are working towards here is a right and a matter of principle. I think the Council must be able to summon up sufficient creative thought to enable us to resolve this matter, so that the requirements of the law are satisfied and, on 9 April, we in the European Parliament can give the green light to the accession treaties being signed in Athens on 16 April. Whatever happens, we want that date to be kept to; it is a duty laid upon us by history. How will it look if, because of disputes about the Budget, we vote on 9 April for a deferment and the Hungarians hold their referendum on 12 April? Are we to sacrifice the stuff of history for the sake of a financial issue like this one? So I urge you to get into gear and get a move on once and for all, so that we can come to a speedy decision on this matter and do justice to our historic mission!</p>

The first one, in the first paragraph, is our commitment to making sure that enlargement takes place on 1 May 2004. Let us be clear: that it is an objective which we all want to reach. But in achieving that objective, I for one will not see the rights of Parliament sacrificed. We have a battle going on at present between two institutions as to what Parliament's rights are and what they are not. Whether the Council respects our rights and our prerogatives remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 3 and 4 spell out some pretty clear pictures. Paragraph 3 warns the Member States that if Article 32 and Annex XV are maintained in the Accession Treaty in their current form, Parliament will regard this as an infringement of its prerogatives in budgetary matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 4 goes on to say that the Parliament ‘considers the Member States' approach to be a breach of the principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions’ and that it ‘interprets this approach as a signal that the Council intends to abandon the Interinstitutional Agreement and the Financial Perspective included therein’. Those are not threats, but statements. I guarantee you now there will be no IAA if Annex XV goes into the treaties unamended or without any guarantees that Parliament's rights can be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to Paragraphs 6 and 7 in the current text of the report. There will be an amendment from the PPE-DE and PSE Groups to Paragraphs 6 and 7, to remove the figures, to delete Paragraph 7, and to put in a statement which will mention our rights again, because this is what this debate is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow we will have a trialogue and, hopefully, we will try to get an agreement on a draft declaration. If we get that agreement, it would certainly be the minimum that I could accept because what we will be doing is agreeing a declaration on how to violate the Treaty. That is what we are doing. We are going to agree on how we can violate the Treaty because of Annex XV.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years this Parliament and the Committee on Budgets have fought for the rights and the prerogatives of this institution. We are not here to sell those rights for 30 pieces of silver. Even if we can agree figures for category 3 in this declaration, do not take that as a sign of Parliament selling itself just for a small amount of money.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to be known as the Chairman of the Budgets Committee who sold out those rights for such a small amount of money. My job as Chairman is to make sure that the rights and privileges that we fought for over so many years are maintained, and I intend to do that. I make it clear now, and I said it in the Budgets Committee, that if Annex XV is maintained in its current form and if we have no guarantees about our rights I will vote against the Accession Treaty documents. I may be the only person in this room to do so but I will certainly vote against because I feel that strongly about it.</p>
<p class="contents">If we get an agreement in the trialogue tomorrow, we can all celebrate. There will be something to be cheerful about. If we do not get an agreement, I should like to point out to the Greek Presidency that if there is another trialogue next week, it can certainly be held in Athens because two of us from that body will be there next week. We can have the trialogue in Athens and try again.</p>
<p class="contents">If, at the end of the day, we cannot get an agreement – and this is the important point – I have no doubt that this House will not delay the vote on 9 April. The loyalty of this House, as Elmar Brok has said, is to get enlargement in place. But I will tell you one thing, colleagues: you will not have an interinstitutional agreement and war will have been declared as far as the budget goes for 2004.</p>

<p class="contents">On the question of the adjustment of the financial perspectives in order to take account of enlargement, I can assure you that the Greek Presidency, and I am delighted that the speakers acknowledged this, demonstrated that it had the political will to resolve the problem which arose with Parliament right from the start. And, as President-in-Office, I can assure you once again that the adjustment of the financial perspectives will be exercised in full application of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement. I should also like to make clear that no one in the Council disputes Parliament's prerogatives in budgetary matters laid down in the Treaty or the perspectives in the Interinstitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform the House, with regard to the question of the adjustment of the financial perspectives, that Mrs Schreyer gave an initial presentation of the Commission proposal on budgetary matters in Athens on 20 February. The Presidency asked for this item to be retabled at the tripartite dialogue scheduled to be held in Brussels on 27 March, tomorrow in fact, with a view to settling the matter. We know, and I personally know, that this is an important and complicated problem. We understand the sensitivities of the European Parliament and, in accordance with our programme, when this tripartite dialogue is held tomorrow, I should like to be optimistic that an agreement will be found and that the good cooperation between the budgetary authorities achieved over a number of years under the budgetary procedure will continue. As, therefore, there will be negotiations on the matter tomorrow, I would rather say no more today. However, I do want to assure you once again that the Presidency and the Council have the political will to settle the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, therefore, may I say that I trust that the obstacles to a positive vote by the European Parliament on 9 April will be removed and that we shall have the pleasure of witnessing the signing, on 16 April, in the presence of the President of the European Parliament in Athens, at this historic moment for the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The most ambitious enlargement in its history is within our grasp. This brings to its conclusion a work process lasting many years, and, in Copenhagen, the candidate countries and the Member States were able to come to a good result even on financial issues, which are always tricky.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial perspective now has to be adapted to enlargement, and the procedure for this was decided on, as long ago as 1999, in the Interinstitutional Agreement, which states in very clear terms that this decision is to be taken jointly by the Council and Parliament on a proposal from the Commission. For Parliament now to say that a deal is a deal is of course to the point. The Commission very much regrets the present conflict between the institutions, and I do not want to conceal the fact that the Commission advised the Council to take a different course. The Commission had advised the Council to make explicit reference to the Interinstitutional Agreement, and particularly to Article 25.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present situation, the time for finding negotiated solutions is running out. The last few days have seen all the parties engaging in dialogue in great depth in order to resolve the issues. It has to be borne in mind that the draft Treaties have now been finalised by the Member States, and also by the candidate countries. The search for a solution to the present difficulty has led the Commission to concentrate on the second way referred to in Mr Wynn's and Mr Brok's joint resolution. That Parliament should highlight two alternatives is seen by the Commission as a clear expression of Parliament's constructive attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal for adapting the financial perspective to enlargement was submitted as long ago as the beginning of this year. It is made on the basis of Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement. Should both parts of the budgetary authority so desire it, the Commission is now prepared to submit forthwith a proposal for the revision of the financial perspective. This would be done on the basis of Part C of the Interinstitutional Agreement, and the proposal could contain an increase in the upper limit for Heading 3, that is, of the budget for internal policies. This would indeed be in the spirit of enlargement, as it would create additional financial facilities for helping the enlarged Union to grow closer together.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst I believe that we are on the right track, I have to tell you, honourable Members, that tomorrow's Budget trialogue – which we should take seriously – is doomed to be a success. The procedures and deadlines leave us, in practical terms, no other choice. We should make every effort to resolve this issue before the treaties are signed and before Parliament's resolution, so that, in time for 9 April, the financial perspective can be adapted to enlargement. I am convinced that all the parties are aware of their great responsibility and will make it possible for us to do what history requires of us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Being conscious of the political responsibility involved in ensuring that the timetable for enlargement is kept to, we have also indicated our willingness to adapt the financial perspective, and to do so if possible before the enlargement agreements are put to the vote. It is quite clear, though, that you can take it as read, in view of the manifest legal problems that we have to work through at present, and of the opinions and interpretations with which experts have provided us, that we will do everything possible to save and defend Parliament's rights within the institutional structure. No decision will be taken here on the basis of an exchange of rights for money.</p>
<p class="contents">In tomorrow's trialogue, the Council has the choice of doing a deal with us or accepting responsibility for the legal, institutional and budgetary problems that the coming months and years will bring. It is obvious that, despite all their efforts, the Commission and the Council have underestimated the institutional dead-end into which their stubborn refusal to let go of Annex XV and its integration into primary law have led us all. This is not just about Article 25 of the Interinstitutional Agreement, but about the many statements that were constantly being made on the basis of last November's agreement, and about common statements arising from many codecision procedures on the multiannual programmes, which repeatedly declared that adjustment of the financial perspective would, at this point in time, be carried out on a joint basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, please permit me another reference to Heading VII. It is important to me that we hold fast to the <span class="italic">de facto </span>impossibility of carrying out a revision by transferring the aid programme for Turkey from Heading IV to Heading VII and then leaving everything in Heading VII just as it is. We therefore still regard adaptation of Heading VII as a precondition. This is about pre-accession aid, but also about special and privileged partnerships with the European Union's neighbours. It is with this in mind that we will, tomorrow, try to negotiate constructively and find a way on which we can agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past few weeks our group has actively supported all the preparatory work to enable the European Parliament to give its assent to the accession treaties with all of the ten future Member States. We sincerely want the official signature of the Accession Treaty to take place on 16 April in Athens.</p>
<p class="contents">On every occasion I have emphasised the importance of this enlargement process for the further development of the EU and its contribution to the strengthening of democratic structures. It may, therefore, come as something of a surprise to people that today I have to declare that a delay in the final stages of the enlargement process cannot be completely excluded. This is not because we do not want these countries to enter, it is not because we are dissatisfied with the negotiations, and it is most certainly not because we have found some bureaucratic institutional or technical arguments to reconsider our previous commitments to the enlargement process.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's rights of decision on the budget, including the long-term financial perspectives, are among its most fundamental rights. A limitation of those rights by a sole decision of the European Council must be regarded as a serious attempt to limit the democratic foundations and the democratic functioning of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's decision to include, as part of the treaties – for the first time ever – the negotiation results in the final aspects of accession must be considered as a serious limitation of Parliament's budget rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Our colleagues in the future Member States must be aware that this attempt to limit one of Parliament's most fundamental rights is unacceptable, particularly at the moment when the European Convention is considering a further democratisation of European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider it as a joint objective. For those who are already Members, as well as for those who soon will become Members, Parliament's rights will be strengthened as a result of the enlargement process and not weakened. Not only do we care about Parliament having those rights, but we believe Parliament should be able to use those rights. That is why we believe that the financial framework resulting from the negotiations must be considered as a minimum amount, not a maximum amount.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group does not want to block enlargement. We do not want to delay enlargement. We have a joint objective to make a success of this process. Strengthening, not weakening the European Parliament's rights must be part of that success. We are convinced that the future MEPs from the new Member States will support our demands.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that the Council will find a solution to this unnecessary conflict, but it must fully respect Parliament's budget rights so that we can ensure that the final stage in the enlargement process will proceed without any delays. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group, however, is very sceptical as to whether the good levels of cooperation that have existed up till now between the Council and Parliament in budgetary policy can continue.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Copenhagen Summit approved the Accession Treaties for the new Member States it also endorsed the necessary financial framework. There were no discussions at all with the European Parliament with regard to this financial framework, so it cannot be binding on Parliament. Parliament’s budgetary authority is defined in Article 272 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Council is to include the financial framework in the Accession Treaties, it is to become EU primary law. That would be a restriction of Parliament’s budgetary authority beyond that contained in the EC Treaty. This is a clear infringement of the EC Treaty and Parliament’s competence. In future Parliament’s competence would be determined under the EC Treaty, which would apply to the old Member States, and by the Accession Treaties, which would apply to the new Member States. The situation must be considered a mess on the part of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We doubt in particular whether we can even discuss the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary policy and its review. Parliament obviously just has to exercise the competence bestowed on it by the EC Treaty fully, as the Council does not respect interinstitutional cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have already expressed my agreement with this line of action in the exchange of opinions held on the matter in the Conference of Committee Presidents. I now express this agreement once again – with the particular gratitude and commitment of myself and my group – with the clear and rigorous way in which the motion tabled has addressed this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we cannot easily accept the way in which the Council position clearly relegates the powers of the European Parliament to second place and clearly limits these powers, in patent breach of the Treaties and of the Interinstitutional Agreement on budgetary matters. Nor can we remain indifferent to the fact that the principle of the equality of Member States and the rule of budgetary unity are being trampled on. Even less can we accept that sums that should not even be considered as the minimum necessary for implementing enlargement should be set as maximum allocations.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not dwell on this issue of the sums earmarked for enlargement, since our position on the matter is already common knowledge, but it is nevertheless worth underlining that, if anything can be emphasised with regard to the position adopted in the motion for a resolution on increasing appropriations for category III of the financial perspective, it is the terms laid down and the obvious clear-headedness of the approach to the matter. I do not think that the European Parliament can go further than it does in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This is obviously not the time to call enlargement and the timetables planned for its implementation into question. It is crucial, however, at least at this final stage of the process, to ensure a minimum of objectivity, transparency, and respect for the candidate countries and that an end is put to the tight-fisted policy of providing limited means, which has dogged the enlargement process from the very beginning. It is also crucial, in our opinion, and for this very reason, that a rigorous and firm position of the European Parliament does not collapse at the first sign of rejection or of limited agreement by the Council, which, incidentally, must fully assume its responsibilities for the potential consequences of its unacceptable attitude, which is in clear breach of norms and practices that have been agreed and signed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Either way, neither of the two options is particularly attractive; let us suppose that the Council just stupidly forgot that the Interinstitutional Agreement in Article 25 specifies that the Council and Parliament must take decisions on changes to the financial perspectives on account of enlargement together. Let us suppose that it simply did not know that ignoring this article violates the agreement on loyal cooperation between the Council and Parliament and therefore blows it out of the water. The problem we are then faced with is that the understanding of Parliament’s role and its budget rights has apparently not filtered through into all layers and the fabric of the Council. It is a blessing in disguise, however, that this problem is easy to solve, because once it realises that, the Council can simply obtain the amounts from the Treaties. It is, however, more likely that the Council was perfectly well aware of this all along but was gambling on the fact that Parliament would not demand its rights, since delaying the ratification of the enlargement is a nuclear option for which very few Members of Parliament would be keen to take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is not, however, prepared to proceed to the agenda without further ado, and so the Council is now willing to negotiate on texts; however, these texts will not make the problem go away because the Council wants to keep the amounts in the Treaties unchanged, which in fact violates Parliament’s rights. Yet it is prepared to state that this resolution leaves Parliament’s rights intact. What nonsense is this? I agree with Mr Wynn; I can only conclude from this that the Council is offering to ignore the Treaties in future, a kind of Dutch toleration policy. Drugs are banned under criminal law, but the government and parliament have agreed to tolerate their use. And that is how it will be in the Treaties. The amounts will be prescribed but in practice things will turn out differently if the Council and Parliament agree to that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, now like to ask my fellow Members how likely it is that the Council will comply with such a statement loyally and in good faith by 2006. I do not have much faith in that. Anyway, my group regards this action as an infringement of the Interinstitutional Agreement, and we will therefore not hesitate, if necessary, to make full use of our rights under Article 272 in the next Budget procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Dutch policy of tolerance is at least pragmatic, this proposal by the Council is also completely absurd in practice, since it is impossible to govern with amounts written in stone. Supposing there were to be an accident at a nuclear power station, such as that at Temelin in the Czech Republic? Would we first have to have a Treaty Amendment with ratification before we could earmark additional funds? I think that even the Council would have to admit that it would not like to suffer a self-inflicted injury. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A balance of powers between the institutions is essential for the stability of cooperation within the EU. What the Copenhagen Summit laid down in Annex 15 concerning the financial perspectives for accession countries affects the budgetary right of this Parliament as established in Article 272 of the Treaty. The Council and Parliament are the two arms of the budget authority and must respect each other in that. That is why we also have the Interinstitutional Agreement of 1999. Unilateral establishment of financial perspectives is incompatible with this, even if it were understandable in the light of the situation on conclusion of the accession negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not have a hidden agenda in this matter. We do not want to jeopardise the Interinstitutional Agreement; still less do we want to jeopardise the signing of the accession treaties. Nevertheless it seems as if the Council is in fact doing this by undermining the budget right, which is one of Parliament’s essential prerogatives. The Presidency has informed us that it has not managed to remove Annex 15 as it is about impending primary legislation. So Article 272 of the Treaty, the budget right, is valid primary legislation. As both arms of the budget authority have to agree every year, it is now important that they reach out to each other, preferably tomorrow, but in any event within the next two weeks. If we do not succeed with an EU of Fifteen, we are putting the EU of Twenty-five at risk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the Council, which is well represented by the Greek Presidency, is measuring the amount of unanimity which is emerging from the speeches of representatives of political groups within Parliament, so as to be able to say where it is absolutely necessary to adjust its aim.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must defend its prerogatives, and it is right to do so. The Commission, for its part, must defend the spirit and the letter of the Treaties. All this is part of our agreements and of straightforward cooperation between institutions. One can understand the political reasons which led the Council, in Copenhagen, to adopt a certain number of measures. However, that must not be done at the expense of the integrity of the prerogatives of the institutions, starting with Parliament. I therefore appeal sincerely to the Greek Presidency, and I am sure that it will listen to me when I ask it to do everything in its power to ensure that we find our way out of this impasse, so that the Athens ceremony does indeed take place and so that it is not, as it were, obscured by a conflict which would otherwise run the risk of calling into question either the enlargement – and no one here wants that – or the spirit of the inter-institutional agreements that exist between us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unfortunate in a legal sense because it calls into question specific rights of the European Parliament. It is unfortunate in a political sense because it poses a serious threat to the reputation of this House, of the Council itself and of the Commission as guardian of the Treaties. Indeed, it puts the whole enlargement process at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">This unfortunate situation impacts us all. I should point out that it is particularly painful to those of us who have long argued in favour of the usefulness and validity of an interinstitutional agreement providing credibility and stability for the Union’s financial framework. In our innocence we believed the interinstitutional agreement was binding on all parties. Much to our dismay, however, we now find it only seems to be binding on certain Council officials when it suits them.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is of the opinion that such delicate implementation calls for a stable and permanent financial framework, recognised by all. It was not necessary to include the Annex in the Treaty. Confidence in the interinstitutional agreement would have sufficed, but you lacked that confidence, gentlemen of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">A fresh negotiating proposal is on the table. This proposal finally provides for Annex XV to be included in the Treaty of Accession, albeit only because you are unable to turn the clock back and retrieve this unfortunate situation, gentlemen. You are nevertheless in a position to prevent further damage and accept the proposal our representatives will take to the tripartite dialogue tomorrow. If you fail to do so and bring rigidity and intransigence to bear on what is currently only an unfortunate situation, the scene will be set for something worse. Then the interinstitutional agreement some of us believe in almost blindly could become the collateral victim and suffer the most damage. I could give a louder warning but it would be hard to give a clearer one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You and I are but two of the many who suffered long years of dictatorship. We all wholeheartedly supported the idea of the reunification of Europe and the creation of a democratic Europe once the countries in the other half of the continent achieved democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, we were well pleased with the outcome of the Brussels and Copenhagen Summits. The results might not have been remarkable, but the conclusions were acceptable and took account of the balance between the institutions. Then the text of this draft Treaty suddenly appeared. I should emphasise that the Treaty has not yet been signed and therefore everything is still open to amendment. This includes the deletion of Annex XV we have heard so much about. The reason is that it contains fixed budget items, together with guidelines on agricultural spending. In other words, it amounts to suspending the European Parliament’s rights up to 2007 in some cases and up to 2013 in others. This is inconceivable. We seem to have fallen down a black hole and be back in 1970. I find it quite intolerable.</p>

The result was to damage the enlargement process and introduce unexpected hurdles when we all believed a solution was within our grasp. An unprecedented dispute then arose because precedents were ignored. There is no Annex XV in the Treaty for the previous enlargement involving Sweden, Finland and Austria. It is a new invention and that is really why the difficulty emerged.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as other honourable Members have made clear, Parliament is committed to enlargement on 1 May 2004. We are not in any way committed to a celebration on 16 April in the shadow of the Acropolis, however, though we would like to be part of it. We hope to be there, but we cannot accept the creation of different classes of Member States. We cannot accept restrictions on the competence of the European Parliament either. We would therefore like to make it quite clear that we are concerned about competence, not about money. Ladies and gentlemen, we will not sell Parliament’s birthright for a mess of pottage.</p>

It is hard to understand why the Council should disregard Parliament’s powers and not implement the revision of the multiannual budgetary agreements, or financial perspectives, as might otherwise have been anticipated and as was done in the case of previous enlargements.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has certainly shown great understanding for the fact that the difficult negotiations concerning the new Member States’ portion of the budget for agriculture and for the Structural Funds are not to be reopened, but we have indicated that what is required must be examined under the heading of internal policy, or expenditure category 3, for there are a number of problems and, if we do not adjust the budget in the next few years, high-priority areas such as the social dialogue, internal security, training, police cooperation and the creation of a secure working environment could suffer as a result, and we should be unable to fulfil our political priorities. Allow me to give an example. Many ordinary people fear that enlargement will mean competition from the new Member States in the shape of businesses that do not care two hoots about the working environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States must of course implement EU legislation on the working environment, but what really counts is what is happening out there among businesses. There is a need to change the culture and to bring about greater awareness, both among businesses and employees, of the need for a secure working environment, and that is something we can do through our agency in Bilbao and by way of the social dialogue. What it requires, however, is an adjustment of the budget, partly because the pre-accession aid in the shape of the Phare programme will dry up as from the end of this year, so the work will in actual fact come to nothing if we do not take action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must respect Parliament’s powers, Article 272 of the Treaty and the Interinstitutional Agreement. Anything else would be unacceptable and a declaration of war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Admittedly the normal budgetary procedure for the Europe of fifteen, in which Parliament has the right of codecision, was not followed. However, was it actually relevant, since we are now talking about a future Europe consisting of twenty-five members? Finally, will the decision not be taken in a much more solemn and legitimate manner by the Treaty itself? If Parliament’s powers had been cut in favour of a ministerial committee, an obscure committee, I could understand its protests. In this case, however, it is the people who will take the decision. How can the European Parliament protest when it is the people who are deciding on a question for themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Once again we see the effects of Parliament’s navel-gazing and of its perpetual struggle to increase its privileges, which make it lose sight of both the undeniably greater legitimacy of the people and the fact that it is in everyone’s interests that the process of enlargement should advance smoothly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The states that want to join us have undertaken a great endeavour, but the resolutions passed by the European Heads of State and of Government in Copenhagen have needlessly created a grave and extremely difficult situation. Their decision puts them in breach of all the Treaties currently in force and of budgetary law, Parliament's most important prerogative.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's actions could be read as a denunciation of the Interinstitutional Agreement in accordance with Article 26. With the serious issues within the European Union relating to enlargement having to be resolved and resolution of those relating to the Treaty of Nice still a long way off, that this should happen is the Council's crowning failure! It baffles me that such a thing is possible when the Council and the Commission have so much expertise at their disposal, unless the intention is to openly provoke Parliament. As we all want enlargement, we are faced with the problem of retrospective damage limitation. When I see, though, how the Council treats treaties and the European Parliament, I have the gravest concerns about what is coming next. Transparency, democratisation, integration and cooperation are empty words if you do the very opposite. At the moment, I do not trust them.</p>
<p class="contents">As the resolution of this difficult problem will be the subject of ongoing negotiations between Parliament, the Council of Ministers and the Commission even after this decision is adopted, Parliament would be well advised to keep an open mind on all the options for dealing with the accession treaties in April. As I know from personal conversations with them, many Members of this House very much doubt – just as I do – whether, under such conditions, they should give them their approval. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
