<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission would like to thank Parliament for the opportunity to clarify once more the actions that it has taken after being informed in May 2003 about the serious events at Eurostat and at some of its contractors, most of which had occurred – as investigations have shown – in the period up to 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the Commission had evidence of the problems in Eurostat, it took action. The Director-General and all the directors were moved to advisory posts while the Commission conducted a thorough investigation into who was directly involved. The Commission launched an Internal Audit Service examination of Eurostat contracts and grants. Following the reports by the IAS and the special task force, contractual relations between Eurostat and other Commission departments and certain organisations were brought to an end. OLAF (European Anti-fraud Office) was encouraged to conclude, as soon as possible, outstanding enquiries there.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was determined to rectify and strengthen its relevant rules and practices, and to fully implement the staff and financial reform begun in 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, on 25 September 2003 Commission President Prodi presented his action plan to a meeting of the Conference of Presidents, enlarged to include members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. This action plan had three basic components: first, thorough restructuring of the Eurostat Directorate-General; second, consolidation of the reform regarding relations between Commissioners, their private offices and services, and centre-periphery relations in the area of control and audits; third, revision of OLAF's legal framework, with the presentation of new legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Prodi provided further clarification of his undertakings when, in November 2003, he presented the Commission's legislative and work programme for 2004 to the European Parliament. In the meantime, the Commission has further discussed matters concerning this case with Parliament and its bodies and has expanded on its plans.</p>
<p class="contents">One main forum for these discussions involved the Committee on Budgetary Control when the follow-up to the 2001 discharge was dealt with and when information was provided on the Commission reforms. However, the continuing concern of the Committee on Budgets as to the progress of the reform has been of considerable help, most recently at its meeting in early April this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomed the efforts made by the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Theato, to help ensure better understanding of the causes for concern. The work undertaken by Mrs Avilés Perea, Mr Casaca, Mr Bösch and other members of the committee helped the Commission to implement suggestions that have improved our action.</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 October 2003, with these proposals in mind, the Commission adopted the new Eurostat establishment plan. That plan was put into operation, as planned, on 1 November. On 21 January 2004, the Commission was informed of the action plan for Eurostat's activities in 2004, put in place at Mr Solbes' initiative. On 9 February 2004, the Commission adopted the communication providing a progress report on its financial and administrative reform, which includes a specific section on the measures that the President had presented on 18 November 2003, as well as proposals for two regulations amending the legal framework of OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission acknowledges the careful and thorough monitoring work undertaken by Parliament and its bodies in the discharge process, and in its other monitoring activities, with regard to the Eurostat case. It is grateful for the concern and commitment that the Committee on Budgetary Control continues to demonstrate in relation to the implementation of the Commission reform. Both are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">With comprehensive modernisation of structures, systems, internal controls and management and personnel policy now in place, the Commission will continue to review actions taken and improvements made, so as to maximise the safeguards against any repetition of the practices detected in Eurostat or any similar conduct. We are being aided by the sustained and shared commitment of Parliament to that end and we are grateful for that support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to point out that at the moment the jobs of thousands of officials in the Commission and other institutions are at stake, but this is also an opportunity to highlight the most significant events which have taken place in the field of financial management.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that the issue before us is financial management and not each of the specific issues arising from that management and, furthermore, any potential irregularities are dealt with by the various courts or judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">For all of these reasons, the report for which I have the honour of being rapporteur consists, as usual, of three important documents. On the one hand, the discharge of the accounts is submitted to this plenum and, secondly, what is proposed is that the management should be discharged, rather than postponed, accompanied by recommendations which make up a resolution covering very diverse aspects, some of which I will comment on very briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we have the problem of shared management. In accordance with the Treaties, the Commission has exclusive responsibility for financial management, but it is also the case that eighty per cent of that financial management is in the hands of, or carried out with the crucially important cooperation of, the Member States or third States. It is therefore proposed that the Treaties be interpreted as granting and recognising the Commission’s primacy and pre-eminence in this area, in order to provide it with instruments which may require particular action on the part of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the report deals with the issues of Commission reform. This concerns substantial reform in the field of financial management which involves its decentralisation and the allocation of responsibility to the Directors-General which is reviewed every year in the annual statement of activities. This mechanism has been updated over the years and this report suggests further improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the reform of the Commission, the issue of Eurostat is raised. We have just heard a statement from the Commission and unfortunately this issue is not closed. Instead, it is in the hands of the judicial authorities, which could raise issues of political responsibility in the future, and we must therefore remain vigilant. It is also the case, however, that Eurostat has also served as an incentive for certain important reforms undertaken by the Commission, including detecting some of the defects which existed, such as the relationship between the Directors-General and the Commissioners, which has been considerably enhanced in the Commission’s third progress report and in relation to which we must expect further substantial improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of this general reform of the Commission, we are also seeing a reform of accounting procedures, an important reform which must reconcile a dual system of budgetary management based on both cash-based and accrual-based accounting. We believe that the general approach which is being applied and proposed to be satisfactory. We must wait until 2005. Improvements have been made, such as the invoice register or the contractors’ database.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also addresses problems of coordination between the various control structures and, fundamentally, the establishment, within the Directorates-General, of the relationship between the internal audit service and the Commissioners. The internal audit service is the responsibility of the Presidency and it is proposed that it remain with the Presidency. It is also proposed to link, to some extent, the Internal Audit Capabilities with the Internal Audit Service. Furthermore, it suggests a separation of the functions of the budget and those of budgetary control.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the various policies that are analysed, in the field of own resources a more direct connection is proposed which reduces the tension that exists between net contributors and the other countries. The existence of a tax, the existence of a direct link between the European citizens and the Commission and the European institutions would promote awareness of the European Union and would reduce that tension between what some people give and what others receive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of agriculture, a critical view is taken of the prefinancing of exports, which represents free financing, and, with regard to the Structural Funds, underutilisation, which is the result of the Member States’ overestimations in their calculations is criticised.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external measures, it is requested that external audits are undertaken on the basis of objective criteria and that food safety and aid not be subsumed into the framework of a general development programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to administrative expenditure, the report addresses the problems of invalidity pensions and sick leave.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to thank Bent Adamsen and Marianella Martínez, who have helped me, and the Executive Commission and the Court of Auditors for their cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I drafted the report on the discharge for the European Development Fund. In our discussions on this in the committee, we had a broad consensus on our analysis of the development of the European Development Fund, and also on our decisions regarding the report. I have also enjoyed very constructive cooperation with the Commission and the Court of Auditors, and I should like to thank the institutions for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the Court of Auditors’ Statement of Assurance on the European Development Fund, we can say that the expenditure has been approved, but only with reservations, as the Court of Auditors is not prepared to give the green light with regard to direct budgetary support, which in 2002 constituted approximately a quarter of aid. This is important because, according to all plans, more and more aid will in future be given in the form of direct budgetary support. If these funds are used correctly and if we are to be given the opportunity of examining whether or not they are being used correctly, there must be a sea change in the quality of budgetary control and monitoring in the beneficiary ACP States. A great deal of work remains to be done in this regard by the Commission before we can be given proper accounts for this. This is a key factor in the future auditing of the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors is also very critical regarding the annual declaration of the Director-General of the competent Directorate-General. The Court of Auditors does not believe that he was in a position to make this declaration on the basis of the information at his disposal. The Commission should take this criticism on board, and my judgment is that it is very serious. It indicates that the control system is still not working properly.</p>
<p class="contents">When we asked the Commission for actual reports evaluating various projects in various ACP States, it took a very long time to procure these reports. This confirms much of what we feared during this work, namely that Headquarters in Brussels has an inadequate overview of the work in the Delegations. If it does not have the reports and cannot give them to us, even though they are on the lists, it is hard to imagine that there is proper monitoring in place. We are of the opinion that this is something that the Committee on Budgetary Control must continue to examine and look at next year. As a whole, then, we recommend granting discharge in respect of the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to say a few words about the other reports, which have also largely caused more controversy than mine in this debate, chiefly the reports by Mr van Hulten and Mrs Stauner. The Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left and I shall not be voting in favour of granting discharge to the Council or the Committee of the Regions and, in our opinion, the votes on discharge for these two institutions should have been postponed. The main issue with the Council is its attitude and unwillingness to cooperate with Parliament. The Council was sent a schedule, a questionnaire, which it is in effect refusing to answer. Such requests for answers to questions are in fact fully in line with the Financial Regulation in force. In reply, the Council refers to a kind of gentlemen’s agreement from the 1970s, which is completely obsolete. In reply, the Council of Ministers deigned to give answers to certain selected questions to certain selected Members; this is in no way binding and is secretive. I think that this runs counter to the spirit of this discharge process as a whole, which should be open and transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we vote in favour of discharge in respect of the Committee of the Regions. As much as a year ago, the whistle was blown on very serious cases of maladministration in the Committee of the Regions, especially regarding travel expenses and a great many other points. It is quite evident that the Committee of the Regions still has not taken this in hand in earnest: quite the reverse. The committee still rejects several of the main conclusions from OLAF’s investigation. As OLAF had expected, it has failed to put into operation the disciplinary procedures that it should have instituted. It is quite clear that the Financial Controller who blew the whistle on the maladministration has been badly treated and has not received the apology he was due, as his actions were fully in line with his duties.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the report by Mr van Hulten, we are of the opinion that this is a very good piece of work. It is of high quality, thorough and very specific. On the subject of Parliament itself, it is time to push for the abolition of the Strasbourg sittings. There is no excuse from the point of view of budgetary control for spending nearly EUR 200 million extra per year commuting between Brussels and Strasbourg. Now is the time, before the end of the Intergovernmental Conference, to put forward this point of view, and we have the opportunity to do so tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of reimbursement to MEPs will be an issue in these elections whether we like it or not, but Parliament only has itself to blame. There is no way of justifying to the man in the street the various systems of reimbursement we have and the fact that it is we who have granted ourselves them. Instead, we must bring in a new system of reimbursement and salaries that is justifiable and transparent. For this reason, together with Mr Blak of the GUE/NGL Group, I have tabled a number of amendments intended to clean up the system of privileges. This relates in particular to our belief that travel expenses should be reimbursed on the basis of the actual costs incurred rather than the distance travelled.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also of the opinion that the existing system for taxi fares should be revised. Parliament has free cars at its disposal, and thus there is no reason to also have a system for reimbursing taxi fares; we can pay these ourselves out of our subsistence allowance. We have also put forward a number of proposals intended to tighten up the system for obtaining the daily subsistence allowance so that it is more closely linked to the meetings we actually attend.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to comment on the Eurostat affair, and also on the Commission statement, even if the Commission seems to be leaving. I think that the proof is overwhelming, as the whistle was blown on the maladministration within Eurostat long before the Commission chose to act. The whistle was blown by Parliament and the internal audit service, but the Commission was too slow to act. This is a matter of political responsibility. At the start of the Commission’s term of office, its President emphasised that the Commission should require individual Commissioners to accept political responsibility, and now, when it finds itself in a situation where it should have done so, it is saying it is not necessary. This is a great disappointment given the aspirations the Commission had when it took office. In our opinion, this is not good enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission's statement on Croatia is due to start at 6 p.m. I propose that I call the two speakers at the top of the list as well – which means that we will overrun slightly – in the hope, and with the request, that these Members will be brief so that we can then proceed according to the agenda and deal with Croatia. The timetabling has been extremely tight recently and we are having to improvise a great deal. I would ask for the indulgence of the three Commissioners who are now present so that we can overrun slightly and take the two speakers on the list.

As Mr Sjöstedt has already pointed out, the Council has indeed largely withdrawn from control and cooperation with Parliament, in contrast to the other institutions. We cannot accept this situation. It also cannot be justified on historical grounds or in terms of a 'gentlemen's agreement’. That is why we have called, in my report, for a response no later than 1 July 2004 to the outstanding questions contained in our questionnaire.</p>
<p class="contents">The increases in remuneration resulting from the system of 'weightings' which the Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors are granting to themselves must be condemned. Whereas the Commission was sensible enough, in this case at least, to vote in favour of suspending this illegal practice for its Members from 1 January 2003, the Court of Justice has reintroduced these increases in remuneration retrospectively on the basis of an internal administrative ruling. This cannot be regarded as a ruling in its judicial capacity, which means that these payments are still illegal. This gross violation of basic rule-of-law principles is especially regrettable when it is committed by the supreme guardian of European law, namely the European Court of Justice. The Court of Justice should set an example and be particularly scrupulous in the conduct of its internal affairs. The same applies to the provision whereby Members of the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors can use official cars for their private purposes to a quite excessive degree. However, as the Court of Justice and – in its wake – the Court of Auditors, unfortunately, have failed to come into line, we are calling for any transfer of funds to the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors to be suspended until these practices have ceased. Only under these circumstances can I genuinely uphold my recommendation that discharge be granted to these two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor will I conceal the fact that once again, as has already been mentioned, problems have arisen with financial management and staffing at the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. However, I believe that both institutions have demonstrated to the committee that they are on the right track, and that to some extent, they are still trying to cope with longstanding problems. I believe, however, that discharge can be granted in these cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a positive comment about Mr Mulder's report concerning the agencies. We now have twelve agencies. That is a great many and as we all know, the number is likely to increase further in line with political objectives. However, I believe that as long as we are successful in avoiding duplication of work and setting appropriate priorities, the efficiency of these agencies will be guaranteed to a greater extent than is the case with the Commission, which is a mammoth bureaucracy. The heads of the eleven agencies are highly qualified and have demonstrated their responsibility for their particular agency. I would like to pay tribute to that. I really cannot say the same of the Members of the Commission, and the agencies make a refreshing change in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">After the Eurostat scandal, the dismissal of the Chief Accountant and the discovery of a completely inadequate accounting system deployed by this Commission to manage – or should I say mismanage – a budget of some EUR 100 billion, I will not be voting in favour of discharge for the Commission. Commissioner Fischler's comments a few moments ago about Eurostat also did not tell us anything we did not already know. I would like to find out from the Commissioner responsible why this Commission statement has just been delivered by the Agriculture Commissioner – have you concluded that Eurostat is an agricultural problem as well, or was there some other reason for this? I am sure you will be able to enlighten us.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating fraud must of course continue to be a priority. Mr Bayona's report contains a number of points on this issue. In my view, the Commission should proceed very cautiously when amending the OLAF Regulation. In paragraph 90 of our esteemed colleague Mr Bayona's report, we have therefore clarified a number of points to ensure that OLAF can operate independently in future too, that it can focus on internal investigations, and that the rights of persons affected are protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the Secretary-General on the result that we are hopefully going to deliver tomorrow, which would be a positive discharge for the European Parliament. The cooperation has been excellent and the Secretary-General, together with all his staff, has done a very good job of running the Parliament over the last five years in the face of mounting challenges, not least of which is enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism contained in my report is not aimed at Parliament's staff or the Secretary-General. My criticism is aimed at us, the politicians, who give political direction to Parliament. In 1999, I was elected in the Netherlands with a very low turnout of just 29%. The main reason why people did not go and vote in the European elections was that they did not have faith in the EU institutions. This is bad in itself, but it is also a great danger to European integration because if people do not have faith in the institutions it is very unlikely that they will support further steps in European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">My mission for the last five years has been to try to reform the institutions to make them more legitimate and credible in the eyes of our citizens. We have come a long way, in particular with regard to the European Commission. Here I would like to pay tribute to Commissioner Schreyer and her colleagues who have done a great job over the last five years, again in the face of very difficult challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has made progress. People who say that this institution is just a 'gravy train' are wrong. We have made excellent progress in modernising the institution, in modernising the administration and even the rules governing Members. But two big eyesores remain. One is our system of expenses, which is still not based on the actual costs incurred. This system is indefensible to the outside world. No matter how big the differences in salary between MEPs from different countries, and no matter how unfair that is – especially when the new Member States come in – we cannot continue to justify this system. The vote tomorrow will be an opportunity for this House to show that we are in touch with the real world, that we are prepared to put our own House in order and to clean up our act.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns Strasbourg. This is a beautiful Assembly and an even more beautiful city, but we should not meet here for only four days per week. The Commission and the Council are based in Brussels. If we are to be a credible democratic assembly, defending the interests of the citizens of Europe, then we should be where the other powerful institutions are – with the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It was natural to come to Strasbourg when this Parliament was still a part-time Parliament, when the memories of the Second World War were still fresh and we needed a symbol of reconciliation. But today Europe's citizens are not looking for signs of reconciliation between France and Germany. I do not believe that anyone doubts those two countries get on together – perhaps a little too well at times! The citizens are looking for efficient, modern institutions that are capable of managing European integration and the policies we have agreed together.</p>
<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the time is right for a move to Brussels. Clearly we must find a purpose for Strasbourg. It has been built on European institutions and we must give them something in return. We have suggested the idea of the first European university. The buildings would be perfect for that. Another suggestion is to let the European Council meet here rather than in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the key issues that we need to address. I hope that tomorrow we will also give President Cox a mandate to go to the Intergovernmental Conference and say that we need to change the Treaty in this respect. We need to give Parliament the right to decide its own seat.</p>
<p class="contents">Today a number of MEPs held a press conference organised by the Campaign for Parliamentary Reform. We signed a reform pledge which commits the signatories to the reform of our expenses system and to work for a single seat for Parliament in Brussels. I hope that when we vote tomorrow we will all sign this pledge by voting for the amendments that have been tabled by a number of Groups. I am grateful to them for having done so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
