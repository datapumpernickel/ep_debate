I do not wish to do so however without first thanking my fellow Members. The shadow rapporteurs have been especially helpful. At this point I would also like to direct a word of thanks to the industry. We had the opportunity of holding intensive discussions, not only with the packaging industry, but also with the packers and the environmental groups. This gave rise to heated discussions and it increased my understanding of actual practice.</p>
<p class="contents">These discussions have convinced me that we must start looking at packaging differently. For a long time it has been self-evident to see packaging as an environmental problem, a small and necessary problem certainly, but a problem nonetheless. We can also see packaging in a positive light by looking at it in conjunction with the product. Packaging then becomes the protector of the product and prevents waste. Packaging is also the vehicle of globalisation, of world trade and of socio-economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">Seen in this light sustainable development is no longer possible without packaging. A positive way of thinking about packaging however is only credible if we go all out to prevent environmental pollution. Which is why recycling and prevention are necessary. I shall turn to them briefly now.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all recycling. This is an important part of the directive. Some even maintain that really the packaging directive is first and foremost a recycling directive. In the debates during the first reading I pointed out that recycling is not a goal in itself and that there are also limits to the environmental benefit of recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">During the second reading we were mainly concerned with the costs of recycling. The British Government in particular is concerned about the extra costs of more recycling and published figures on this. What remains unclear however is the way in which the costs have been calculated. Recycling costs money, but it does produce something as well. The greater the scale, the more cost-effective, but there are limits of course. If you want to collect the last tin in the north of Finland, that does of course cost a disproportionate amount of money.</p>
<p class="contents">Our discussion about the environmental benefit in the first reading and the economic costs in the second almost inevitably lead to the conclusion that the optimum percentage could vary substantially from one country to another. The discussion was indeed more of a discussion between countries than between political groups. Ultimately we are going to have to work towards each country finding and fulfilling its own optimum. But that is only possible if sufficient recycling capacity has already been created in each country. That is why we need clear objectives now.</p>
<p class="contents">We must certainly not set the bar too low, nor too high, nor too close, nor too far away. We need a good middle position. I therefore call on you to support the compromise that the groups have reached. This compromise is 55% in 2007. In passing I note that we are therefore later than the original Commission proposal, because that was 55% in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important to set ambitious but achievable targets for the new Member States as well. They must themselves be involved with this.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste and recycling have become global markets. There is no objection to the export of sorted waste, but we must be sure that it has indeed been sorted and that it is indeed being properly processed in developing world countries. The exporter must prove this.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention.<span class="bold"> </span>Prevention still receives too little attention<span class="bold"> i</span>n the packaging directive. We have to do something about producer responsibility. We have done so previously in the electronic waste directive and the end-of-life vehicles directive. The responsibility of producers here is not just financial. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy demands better implementation of the essential requirements and asks producers to choose the most environmentally friendly alternative. It is a good idea to set up an indicator for this. Different materials such as paper, metal, glass and plastic must compete on an environmental quality basis. This will provide an incentive for constant innovation in the environmental field. And there is an incentive to invest in recycling capacity. It will lead to every country having optimum recycling capacity because every material producer will have an interest in recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of an indicator is also a way of giving consumers greater involvement with packaging and of giving supermarkets or businesses the opportunity only to choose five-star packaging for example. In this way sustainable development is something that concerns all of us. This approach fits in perfectly with the sixth environmental action programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to two further points. Firstly, re-use. Discussion of this topic has gained fresh momentum since Germany made deposit systems compulsory on 1 January. Complaints are pouring in about this because of the distortion of the internal market. Deposit systems can indeed conflict with the internal market. It is a pity that the Commission has not seized upon the revision as an opportunity to do something about the long list of complaints. It is also a pity that no majority was to be found in the first reading for the amendment to create clarity. We must prevent improper utilisation of re-use and therefore we must put the environmental result first here too.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to make concerns ceramics. I have a question for the Commission about this. The ceramics industry is concerned about the effects of the packaging directive and is seeking total exemption. There are two points on which I would like a clear statement from the Commission. Firstly, in my view it is not advantageous for the ceramics industry to fall completely outside the packaging directive – this directive does after all provide the basis for trade in the internal market. Commissioner, what is your opinion on this? Secondly, I would like clarity as to whether the ceramics industry will have a recycling obligation by 2007. In my view it will not, but on this too I would like confirmation from the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know she has done a very serious job and looked at this in depth.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999 a total amount of 63.5 million tonnes of packaging waste was generated in the European Union. This corresponds to around 17% of municipal solid waste and 3% of the total waste generation by weight.</p>
<p class="contents">The packaging and packaging waste directive has made the collection and recycling of packaging waste a normal activity in all EU Member States, increasingly so also in the accession countries. In this way the directive has helped to reduce environmental impacts and to strengthen the internal market for packaging and packaging waste.</p>
<p class="contents">This revision builds on this success. I am very pleased that the European Parliament has, since the first reading, given clear support for our proposal to more than double the minimum recycling targets and to further increase the recovery target. It seems that there is now widespread agreement on the levels of the targets. The key remaining question is whether the implementation deadline will be 2008, as in the common position, or whether an earlier date should be set. In my view deadlines should be both realistic and ambitious. It will also be important to give Greece, Ireland and Portugal – Member States already granted later target dates under current legislation – a reasonable time to adapt to the new targets. This also applies to the accession states. I intend to propose deadlines for these countries before the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that Parliament largely agrees that other aspects – in particular, prevention and re-use – should be further studied before new decisions are taken. However, the need for further analysis also applies to the new obligation referred to in the first part of Amendment No 7. This new obligation to minimise the environmental impact of packaging risks duplicating the existing essential requirements and facing the same problems in regard to enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully understand the concerns of Parliament regarding exports for recycling. I agree that we should make sure that recycling in non-EU countries should only count for our targets if it is done properly. However, controls and paperwork should be focused on where they are really needed. I do not see any reason why this should apply to materials such as metals, paper and glass. These materials are part of a functioning, internal, international market. I doubt that we need written proof of the recycling of each exported batch.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also seem strange to me to apply stricter controls on exports of packaging waste than the provisions on waste electrical and electronic equipment, which we decided just a few months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be a great deal of concern in Parliament – as we just heard from the rapporteur – about the effect of the packaging directive on ceramics packaging. Let me be clear that nothing in the directive obliges Member States to set up recycling systems for this type of packaging. Excluding ceramics from the scope of the packaging directive raises the question of why we should exclude ceramics and not other, similar packaging types. It also gives Member States the freedom to take any measure on ceramics packaging, as long as it is within the framework of the Treaty. Therefore I believe it is better to ask the Technical Committee to solve any possible implementation problems, rather than excluding ceramics from the scope of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that flower pots, self-adhesive labels and related issues are important for the industries concerned. Therefore they merit a proper discussion. Conciliation is, in my view, not the right framework for such a discussion. This is a job for detailed work by the experts in the Technical Committee.</p>

<p class="contents">It is clear that we must set quantitative objectives and that these must be ambitious but, at the same time, they must be achievable. We must not forget the fact that in certain Member States the objectives will be more difficult to achieve for historical reasons relating to lack of infrastructure, low population density or consumer habits.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret not having been able to reach a full agreement with the rapporteur, but I believe that her work has not been at all easy. In the report which she presented in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy there were many points on which we were in agreement, but Mrs Corbey wanted to go further and, after having reached a compromise, at the last minute she has introduced modifications in Amendments Nos 26 and 27 which have obliged me not to sign them and to vote against them tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that in countries such as Germany, Belgium or the Netherlands the collection of waste is cheap and efficient. In these countries there is a uniform distribution of population and no geographical barriers. But it is not logical to impose the same objectives on other Member States which do not have a similar distribution of population. And I am not just talking about my country, Spain, but also Finland, Sweden, France, the United Kingdom and other Member States which are going to have great difficulties fulfilling the objectives agreed in the common position. And this is not a problem of a lack of investment on the part of public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 41 million of us living in Spain, half the population of Germany, in an area of 504 000 km2. The population is distributed around the most mountainous rural environment in the whole of the European Community. Can anyone believe that the collection of waste can be carried out on equal terms? We need a realistic, flexible and, above all, applicable directive. It appears that some people want to gear this directive towards their own laws and impose it on the other Member States. This is neither fair, logical nor equitable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Council’s common position is pretty balanced. I fully support the dates and the quantitative objectives set in it. My only regret is that there are not equal objectives for all materials and that, as a result of economic interests, we have forgotten that there are problems with the functioning of the internal market, which is the real reason for this Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is very important that we support the various different options for dealing with waste: re-use, recycling and energy recovery. These three options are better than merely depositing waste in dumps.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must bear in mind that packaging waste represents a relatively small proportion of all waste generated in the Member States, 3% according to you, Commissioner. So let us be flexible. Industry is making great efforts as are the agents involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The targets for recycling and re-use for the next five years in the form now proposed are fairly high but are by no means unreasonable. Many Member States have already achieved considerably higher levels than those now being proposed. These suggested targets are easily achievable, and if we had less ambitious targets, then any branch of industry, for example, which would exploit the use of recycled material, could not develop.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to reach the targets, however, we should bear in mind the excellent measures that have already been implemented in different Member States to achieve the greatest possible targets for recycling and re-use. For example, countries that have good experience of re-use projects should also be encouraged even further in this area. Just as the rapporteur stated, economic and ecological factors must be taken into consideration in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to draw attention to the fact that, as recycling targets are being proposed for wood, it is these very ecological and economic factors that have not necessarily been taken into consideration. The 15% target for wood is a low one, but in a country like Finland, for example, the ecological disadvantages of transportation greatly outweigh the benefits gained from recycling wood in this way. It is a lot wiser ecologically if this wood is burnt as an energy source in people’s houses. I therefore hope that common sense will prevail and that Amendment No 26, which is a proposal put forward by the rapporteur and others, will be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a waste directive that is not really concerned at all with packaging but with packaging waste. To discuss this is, in actual fact, to begin at the completely wrong end of the production chain. If we wanted to achieve a reduced quantity of waste and reduced mileage, especially for lorries transporting waste on motorways, we should begin by discussing packaging, the role of packaging, logistics and how we could gain a huge amount, both environmentally and in terms of road use, from having fully adapted packaging. Nor does it make any sense at all for us to occupy ourselves with recycling – irrespective of whether it be recycling proper, including energy recycling, or re-utilisation – and for us to spend the whole time debating the packaging that goes out to households. Clearly, we should have a much more rational system whereby the greater part of packaging material goes to shops, institutional households, wholesalers etc and whereby the packaging we carry home is as simple, slim and small as possible, almost to the point of being non-existent. As matters stand, it is a question not of strength but of design.</p>

<p class="contents">I would also like to point out that this proposal represents the fulfilment of one of the objectives of the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and say, like the rapporteur, that the objectives of the proposal are ambitious but achievable, as certain Member States are demonstrating by already complying with certain aspects of this Directive on packaging and packaging waste.</p>
<p class="contents">We must place particular emphasis on compliance with the Directive (one of the most serious problems we are facing is very frequent non-compliance with Community environmental legislation). We must stress the need to ensure that exporters carry out the process of recovery or recycling under conditions which are not merely similar to those laid down in Community legislation, but exactly equivalent to them.

This must have been very difficult for the rapporteur in face of Members of this Parliament who want to drag their heels for the benefit of the packaging industry.</p>
<p class="contents">However, looking at the current packaging directive and at compliance with it, and just looking at my own country Ireland and a number of others, for example Portugal and Greece – they are all now looking for derogations for extra time. In my opinion, they are being rewarded for being tardy and environmentally irresponsible. This is sending out a very dangerous message to the applicant countries.</p>
<p class="contents">If the existing Member States cannot comply with the existing legislation and cannot meet their targets then it is going to be very difficult to argue and to push for the new countries coming in to do the same, since they come from an economically less well-off background.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the proposals that have been put forward in the legislation were alarming. The idea of a maximum target for recycling is crazy. If Member States can recycle 100% then surely they should be allowed to do so and to set a ceiling here is irresponsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of recovery is a major problem. Recovery is stretching definitions to the extreme. Recovery is basically a nice term for incineration; it is burning and then producing heat.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of a minimum target for recovery will to a certain extent force Member States who do not have incineration to bring it in or to use that as an excuse. Perhaps the wording is not as bad as it was originally. This is a major problem for countries like Ireland that have not done anything about their waste problem. They will say, we are going to recover, and that sounds very nice.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage we have to do what has been proposed by some other speakers. We have to eliminate, reduce and recycle, and then finally disposal should be the last option. Burning waste and calling it recovery is stretching the imagination to the extreme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The principle underlying this legislation is limitation of the harmful environmental consequences of packaging. The way in which the targets formulated are achieved may differ from one Member State to another. Unfortunately, we have to say that the European Commission thinks differently about this, witness the fact that on 17 December last year it decided to summon the Netherlands to appear before the Court. And this while the targets are being amply achieved in the Netherlands through the operation of a voluntary agreement between the Ministry for Housing, Spatial Planning and the Environment and industry.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach will also have to be recognised in this directive. In compromise Amendment No 31 this has been done, although I still find the requirements very tight. I recognise that the targets of this directive may be ambitious, but nonetheless this matter must not end in conciliation, certainly not if there is agreement with the Council on the other points. I can for example give my unqualified support to the idea that the export of packaging waste may only count towards the achievement of the targets if the exporter can supply the proof that the recovery and/or the recycling has taken place in circumstances that are equivalent to the community regulation. I am less happy with the fact that the discussion of mechanical recycling is again being deferred, so that we continue to be faced with a lack of clarity.</p>

That is confirmed by the Commission's recently published Thematic Strategy on Recycling. This now says: 'Current directives foresee that all Member States should achieve the same recycling targets as this one does. However, the question is legitimate whether this uniformity in targets is most effective, both from an environmental and economic point of view. It might be better to have an overall EU recycling target at EU level and let market forces determine which recycling facilities can achieve the objective in the most cost-effective manner.' How right that is! We know that there are some Member States that want to go beyond the proposed targets. Others will find them impossible to meet. So why are we ploughing on with a strategy that is already being undermined by the practicalities?</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom has a problem with this. For many years we have relied on landfill. Our geology favoured that. We consequently had no particular incentive to press ahead with recycling, as some countries did.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now moving as fast as we can, but there is no way that we can move as fast as the rapporteur's amendments prescribe. To do that would mean spending EUR 1.8 billion on recycling packaging waste alone, and packaging waste is only 6% of the waste going to landfill in Britain. This would mean that we would have to tell British local councils to initiate policies to remove packaging from the household waste stream. That takes time and money, Mrs Corbey.</p>
<p class="contents">Maybe such policies are not the most pressing priorities of my country's local authorities. Maybe their priority is financing home helps, Meals on Wheels for the elderly or services of another kind. If subsidiarity is to mean anything at all, such priorities should be for local decision. How can I defend a situation where a combination of continental MEPs press for changes that will supply an imperative to British local authorities that a majority of British MEPs have not voted for? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have just heard how the way we deal with packaging has a decisive part to play in shaping the future of our environment, and how there is – of course – a market in this field, one in which the big packaging groups are competing with one another, so that we have to give some thought as to how we achieve an optimum level of effectiveness. Within this market there are specialities, which represent the opportunities offered by diversity in Europe. Where these are concerned we have stressed the need for this great pot to safeguard the interests, futures and chances of survival of the small firms, scattered throughout Europe, working in the ceramics sector and producing highly-prized packaging such as that for Meaux mustard and similar goods. To describe them as an industry would be an exaggeration, in that they have between 30 and 50 workers each. It is for this reason that the keynote of our amendments is that the directive should not cover packaging materials which cannot be utilised for energy recovery owing to their material quality, which are inert, and the quantities of which do not exceed 0.1% of the proven quantity of packaging in the Community, and for which material or raw material recycling is ruled out for ecological and cost-benefit reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard from the Commissioner – and for this we are grateful – that the packaging directive’s recycling order will not apply to ceramics. There must, of course, be a place for ceramics in the packaging directive, but recycling it would mean that it would have to be transported back across Europe, in minimal quantities, in order for this to be done. Systems for its return, collection and recovery would have to be introduced. That would kill off small businesses. We cannot believe that Europe is about enacting directives that cut away the economic basis from under small firms that offer speciality goods that are highly prized in Europe. I thank you for your unambiguous statement, which is something we can build on, and which will also give the firms a certain amount of breathing space and a reliable prospect of future development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have just heard impressive speeches to the effect that equal quotas in Europe are unfair. At that, I cannot but laugh; why, then do we have them? In Europe, we have to have comparable rules, and the ground rules have to be interpreted in such a way that the Member States can make a start. I was here in 1994 – as was Mrs Jackson – when we adopted the directive. If my schoolboy maths serves me well, that was twelve years ago. There are Member States that, since that day, have simply sat with their arms folded and done nothing whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, I was at a big event in Frankfurt, along with several hundred others. They gave me a good telling-off and said to me, ‘Florenz, why are we, in Germany, in the Netherlands, in Belgium, in a number of Nordic countries, keeping in step and implementing these rules, while, elsewhere, they are doing nothing at all? You are a poor representative of your country if you allow this sort of thing to go on’. I have to tell you, Commissioner, you are the guardian of the laws, and you have to intervene at a much earlier stage.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Corbey, I see it as almost shameful that we should be starting a dispute in this House as to whether the starting date should be 2008 or 2007. That is not what all this is about! What matters is that we should heighten awareness among the public and in the Member States of the fact that a recycling strategy means that resources are conserved, and that when we talk about the conservation of resources, we are talking about our children’s capital. In Europe, that has to be organised on a Community basis. I very much sympathise with those who say ‘yes’ to this, but are worried about the export issue. With my liberal approach, I do not go as far as that, but when it comes to exports, we cannot have the situation in which enterprises here develop recycling strategies, and then export the materials. Such a thing would surely be false. While I, of course, have sympathy with Member States that sort out care for the elderly before dealing with the packaging directive, I do accept that this is the rule. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Landfills are reaching capacity, incinerators are overflowing and the wads of excessive packaging we use should go.</p>

I would ask you to support that. Culture change takes time. The UK is meeting its existing recycling targets, but it is simply not possible to meet and implement this legislation by 2007 without an expensive, crash-spending programme. The figures do not look very significant, but they represent millions of tonnes of material which must be collected, recycled and new markets found. A realistic timetable for implementation is five years. Any attempt to compress this time will result in spiralling costs – if not quite as much as Mrs Jackson says.

I can understand the compromises that have been made. Not everyone can be equally tough. We must however in any event leave those who can be tougher, but who perhaps go about things differently, as in the Netherlands for example, with its voluntary agreement, in peace because they are achieving more than the others.

Commissioner, I have a question for you about this. It has become apparent to us – and they are finding this very difficult in the area that I come from – that because of the way in which deposit money is levied on single-use packaging in Germany – and shortly in Belgium too – it has actually become impossible at the moment to continue importing single-use packaging from other European countries into Germany. What we have therefore is a trade embargo. Do you not think, Commissioner, that this way of achieving the target, namely the reduction of waste, which I am otherwise in favour of, is distorting the market through the imposition of an ecotax or deposit money? And should that not be reason for you, perhaps in consultation with your colleague Mr Bolkestein, to take this up and in any event to give me an answer now? What is your opinion on this and what steps must be taken to bring an end to this trade distortion, which has for that matter already led to job losses? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support the objective of this directive to minimise the impact of packaging and packaging waste, as long as the costs are proportionate to the environmental benefits. It is often forgotten that packaging waste is only a small proportion of total landfill.</p>
<p class="contents">The key concern in relation to the amendments to this directive is the deadline for achieving compliance with the proposed higher recovery and recycling targets. The deadline, or 'time-line', should be realistic, proportionate and achievable in line with best practice. This will allow infrastructure and recycling capacity to be built up at a pace that ensures progress with the objectives of the directive whilst not imposing excessive or disproportionate costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to draw attention to the derogation that sets the same recovery and recycling targets as for the other twelve Member States, but allows Ireland, Greece and Portugal longer to achieve them. I urge support for the common position, which sets an accepted deadline of 2012. There is an assumption that all Member States should ultimately reach the same recovery and recycling rates, irrespective of size, geography or infrastructure. It is not a question of having done nothing alone. Yes, far more could be done, but in Ireland's case we have a population of less than four million and too small a market to sustain a packaging manufacturing infrastructure. We import 75% of our packaged goods.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one paper recycler, little plastics recycling, no metal recyclers and the only glass recycler in the country has recently closed down. Therefore we are at a permanent geographical and structural disadvantage. To comply with this directive we must ship packaging waste overseas or build more reprocessing facilities and export the empty packaging, which is uneconomic. The cost will not be proportional to the environmental benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">I underline what Ms Jackson said to us, on the Commission's recent communication on the Thematic Strategy on the prevention and recycling of waste, published in May 2003. From an environmental point of view it is more important to optimise collection and recycling in the Community as a whole, rather than to consider whether this takes place in a particular Member State. This should be reflected in the overall recycling target at Community level. In the Commissioner's own words, could she please explain how this squares with what we have here today? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There will be another time for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like here to mention some of my own amendments, which were approved by the committee in the recommendation and also in the proposed inter-party compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">If the targets are to be implemented we should avoid discrimination between materials on the basis of weight. That will not happen, however, if, for example, charges are based solely on weight and do not take account of each material’s environmental impact. Clarification is needed to give proper shape to the whole programme. The very fact that there is an aim to recycle 55% by weight of packaging waste and an obligation that goes with it to take the environmental costs and benefits of the recovery and recycling of packaging materials into account means that there should be no one-sided increase in material-specific commitments, even if that would mean the 55% target would be achieved more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has promised to present a report in 2005, one section of which is to be on the subject of re-use. My amendment proposes that that report should examine re-use and, in particular, a comparison of the ecological benefits of re-use and those of recycling. The report should focus precisely on real environmental impact and assessing market viability.</p>
<p class="contents">Important details include examples in the Annex of products which constitute packaging that is not subject to the scope of this directive. These include tubes and cylinders around which flexible material is wound, release paper of self-adhesive labels, and wrapping and gift wrapping paper sold as a separate product.</p>

We need the best possible systems to deal with what amounts to some 58 million tonnes of packaging material produced every year in the European Union, an amount that is increasing from year to year. In so doing, we would be ensuring that the environment is better cared for and giving important sectors of industry the security to plan ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Among those we will be voting on tomorrow, there is one amendment that I regard as particularly important. Amendment No 4 has to do with packaging materials in small quantities, which are therefore subject to a very low market penetration in the Member States. One material that occurs in small quantities of this sort is ceramic packaging; for example, ceramic bottles, pots, and bowls made in the Netherlands, in France and in Spain, are mainly used for the packaging of brandies, chocolates, and patés. Ceramic packaging accounts for only 0.1% of the packaging waste produced in the EU – in other words, just 58 000 tonnes out of 58 million tonnes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ceramics consist of baked clay, and their artistic and creative appearance means that, in many households, they are kept or re-used, so that they do not end up in the household rubbish. Ceramics can be neither re-used in the production of energy nor recycled. They pose no problems for the environment. To treat ceramics separately, collecting them and transporting them thousands of kilometres across the Member States, would make no sense either in environmental or in economic terms. I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 4.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste management, which was already introduced on the basis of this directive, or which has yet to be introduced in certain Member States, should deal with those materials that are suited to recovery; it must concentrate on materials the collection and recycling of which is profitable in economic and environmental terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to repeat that we have no intention to introduce a recycling obligation for ceramics packaging. Secondly, in reply to Mrs Oomen-Ruijten, we think that deposits on one-way packaging are in principle acceptable. I know from the country I know best that they have worked for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bolkestein and myself have made clear that we are not satisfied with the current situation in Germany, and we have urged the German Government to set up a return system in conformity with Community legislation, which can also be a nation-wide, one-way deposit. We are taking action and we will continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I have visited Ireland so I know the challenge the handling of waste creates in Ireland. At the same time, we are open about the cost-effectiveness studies, the cost-benefit studies, that we have made on this particular issue. We have done a very thorough job in comparing these targets and looking at the situation in different countries. We have judged that it is not impossible to reach the targets. However, it is reasonable to accept different target dates for different countries because the pre-conditions are so different.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a comment to Mrs Jackson. Unfortunately she has left now, but she asked 'is this out of date?' Are we discussing a proposal that is completely out of date or is the timing wrong? There is, of course, a balance in trying to do what we can now and dealing with the acute problems of handling waste, while at the same time preparing for a modern, long-term strategy, which will probably not be following waste stream per waste stream. However, we will try to establish a different type of approach, including what Mrs Paulsen proposed. Hopefully, we will be able to look at the source of the problems, including transport of packaging and packaging waste.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that this is the right approach, but the question is extremely complicated, because the whole issue has to be looked at in different ways. We have already released a number of documents where we introduced this long-term thinking. The IPP strategy has to do with this, our resource-use strategy as well as a new waste-recycling strategy. We will therefore have to come back to this. This is a revision of an existing directive but, be assured, we will have to look at the overall approach and discuss this again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
