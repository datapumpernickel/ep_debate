<p class="contents">The Commission"s response on imports of garlic is quite a surprise, ladies and gentlemen. The problem does not lie in differences of analysis. For once, everyone seems to be in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is one of pace. The problem itself was identified as far back as 1993, but the solution was inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, when the safeguard clause was applied to garlic from China, it was already possible to predict that a number of traders would set up triangular arrangements, nationalising the Chinese garlic in Thailand, Taiwan, Vietnam, Iran, Malaysia, Jordan, India, or any other country.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a system is easy to conceive and is also viable, given how slack certain Member States usually are when it comes to carrying out customs checks.</p>
<p class="contents">Triangular trade has therefore continued to expand, and garlic production in the Community is moving ever closer to extinction. In Spain alone, 15 000 farms and more than three and a half million direct jobs are at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, production is highly concentrated in certain geographical areas. The social and economic consequences of the present situation will therefore be very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Can this state of affairs really be due to administrative slowness? Can rural development measures really compensate for such shortcomings? It is therefore surprising that the Commission has stated that there is no time to implement an effective system this season because the procedure to establish a global quota and change tariffs in the World Trade Organisation has not been initiated.</p>
<p class="contents">There has, in fact, been ample time to initiate it and if it has not yet been set up then emergency action must be taken until it is. Such action must involve applying retaliatory measures to countries taking part in the triangular trade and compensating Community producers for loss of income.</p>

The promotion fund for agricultural products is seen by many as a substitute for export refunds. Now these refunds have been cut, we have to look to promotional activities, so the reasoning goes. This reasoning conceals a major risk, because it seems the Union is going to conduct its export policy along the same lines.</p>
<p class="contents">This was an export policy which was certainly advantageous to Europe"s farmers, but which had numerous disadvantages as well. It was a policy whereby the European Union dumped its internal market surpluses on the world market at the expense of the developing countries. We must abandon this export policy driven by quantity. There must be information campaigns to promote a clear emphasis on quality. Only products which pay proper attention to food safety, animal welfare and the environment should be considered for subsidy. Developing countries must be given the chance to develop their own agricultural potential. Subsidising the export of European products to these countries would seriously hamper that process, and I am against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we equate promotional activities with export subsidies in terms of financing. The aim of export subsidies is to keep agricultural prices high throughout the Union. That works to the advantage of all Europe"s farmers. So it is obvious that Europe should finance that. The same logic does not apply to sales promotion. Advertising is only effective if it goes together with a speciality or trademark. If the products concerned are made principally responsible for financing, that creates a new link between costs and benefits. European subsidies should at most play a supplementary role.</p>

The policy on prices has become well established over recent years. Let us hope that future crises and our commitments to the CEECs will not oblige us to downsize even further, and that other events do not compound two negative trends which have been noticeable in the past few years: not only the falling incomes of European farmers, but above all the drop in their numbers. Thirty years ago, farmers represented some 25 % of the workforce in Europe; now they have shrunk to around 5 %. What particularly concerns us, moreover, is that full‐time farmers are steadily being replaced by part‐timers, who cannot guarantee proper levels of professionalism. I am referring here to Mr Fantuzzi's report on quality: clearly, non‐professional farmers cannot guarantee top quality, and this will have an effect on product promotion strategies both within the Union and in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the offensive strategy proposed by the rapporteur. We should not wait for a disaster like BSE before promoting the consumption of European beef – safe beef, naturally – just as we should not have waited for globalisation, and hence the influx onto the EU market of wines from around the world, before deciding to promote European wine and explain to everyone that it is not harmful, especially as long as one does not over‐indulge. What is more, as with all of life's pleasures – 'wine, tobacco and women are a man's downfall', as the Italian proverb goes – everything should be done in moderation. And so it is a matter of educating consumers: moderation, quality and teaching people how to drink – and, above all, how much to drink.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree that the funding is excessively limited, ludicrously so, for a promotion campaign such as this, given the present cost of advertising.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sturdy </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I certainly hope that it will not be the last time that I am speaking here on agriculture to Mr Fischler as a member of the Commission, because over the years he has done an extremely good job.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much agree with the price package that has come out of the Commission – it is very similar to a lot of the proposals I put forward two years ago when I was the rapporteur on that particular price package.</p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned that we are making a singular mistake today if we think that the price package and the Berlin Summit are not intertwined. Agriculture is not about a short‐term gain and short‐term positions: it means planning for five or ten years. I work on a ten‐year rotation; plans have to be made far further ahead than for any short‐term positions. I totally disagree with Mr Rehder when he said that the Berlin Summit had been a great success. It has been a total disaster for agriculture! It was a total misconception, it was done in a hurry, without thinking about the future of agriculture. That is why it is very important that we keep the discussions flowing and work for the benefit of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to come back to a point the Commissioner made in his speech. He said very poignantly that we were not going to allow the Americans to dominate European agriculture. I was delighted to hear it. However, we are signatories to the WTO. Are we going to accept WTO regulations, even though it may mean somewhat expensive payments or having to take imports which we do not want? Perhaps the Commissioner could clarify that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Funk mentioned co‐financing. I hope that co‐financing is forgotten about forever.</p>

Amending and correcting the regulation on the common organisation of the market in fruit and vegetables is extremely important. In my view, serious questions need to be asked about the waiver from the obligation to supply producer organisations for products which are marketed directly by the producer. This method of selling by means of direct marketing has traditionally had a very special status in Germany, which I myself have strongly supported for many years.</p>
<p class="contents">You said this morning, Commissioner, that this is the second marketing year that the new regime for fruit and vegetables has been in force. Unfortunately, however, I have discovered that the Commission only takes the waiver in the market organisation to mean sales on the producer"s holding. What is the position for sales in the field, at the roadside or at the weekly market? This extremely restrictive interpretation is the result of a letter from Mr Legrand of the Commission. You are nodding; it seems then that there have been more recent developments. That would certainly be welcome. The proportion of goods permitted to be marketed directly is supposed to remain unchanged at 20 % of the produce of each Member State. In this context, one of the issues we discussed in the Agriculture Committee was how it is proposed to check up on this. Is it not the case that implementing this system in agricultural holdings will actually be extremely difficult? If you consider agricultural practice, for example at asparagus or strawberry time, you might be forgiven for thinking that a certain amount of idealism is at work here. I do not believe that the rule of the game should be direct sales when demand is high and the producer organisation when demand is slack. But the monitoring of the whole scheme seems to me to have been too theoretically conceived.</p>

We should not forget that it was under the Luxembourg Presidency in December 1997 that the Council acknowledged the need to continue developing the current model of European agriculture while strengthening its competitiveness, particularly on the markets of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now before us is a result of that desire and also of the wishes of the Agriculture Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is laudable and should therefore be approved. However, it is unfortunately too timid and too paltry, if I may say so, in terms of the financial resources of EUR 15 million. Moreover, the promotional instrument proposed should be simplified and rationalised. This instrument really must take advantage of the experience and know‐how of the existing professional structures in order to encourage and implement promotional and publicity measures on agricultural products and processed products which can be exported or sold through new outlets in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the financing, I agree with our rapporteur who has rightly pointed out that the United States annually devotes nearly ten times more than the modest appropriations indicated by the Commission for promotion on the markets of third countries. The Community should also be able to fully finance measures such as participation at events, fairs, exhibitions and so on. The financial participation of the Commission should also be rather more substantial, as we have proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the problems which may arise when, on the basis of an open or restricted invitation to tender, the Commission chooses the body responsible for implementing the promotional measures, it would be safer and more transparent for the organisation proposing the programmes and measures to be responsible for implementing these and for choosing the necessary service providers. I proposed amendments to this end which were approved by the Agriculture Committee and which I hope the Commission will accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must insist on the strengthening of the consultation procedures of the Management Committees and the Standing Group on the Promotion of Agricultural Products.</p>

It involves more than 15 000 farms and some three and a half million direct jobs. Garlic is being imported on a massive scale from Asian and Middle Eastern countries, some of which do not even produce it. The amounts involved exceed the maximum overall quota of 33 600 tonnes. Moreover, imported garlic appears in European Union markets after crossing borders at which officials are not always conscientious as regards properly enforcing the correct procedures relating to quotas and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">This amounts to a clear departure from the arrangements for commercial traffic envisaged in Article 115 of the Treaty. We therefore call on the Member States to provide the customs entry points with the human and material resources needed to undertake correct tariff classification, carry out phytosanitary inspections and check the origin of products. Further, we urge the Commission to demand that Member States be conscientious over border formalities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the European Commission to broaden the scope of Regulation No 544/97 introducing certificates of origin for garlic imported from certain third countries, and to apply retaliatory trade measures to those countries involved in fraudulent deals. According to Article 115 of the Treaty, such measures aim to prevent distortion in the movement of goods under the framework of the common commercial policy. In addition, a dissuasive customs tariff for imports over and above the set limit should be put in place. Measures to compensate garlic producers for loss of income should also be considered in order to tide them over until the other measures previously requested come into effect.</p>

There is therefore no need for me to repeat myself now. I should simply like to thank very much all those who spoke in the debate for their constructive contributions and to respond briefly to three specific questions which have been asked in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, as far as garlic is concerned, I said that we want to work on two fronts here. We want to make use of the existing safeguard clause again, and to activate this for a further period. In this respect, I was asked how this will be monitored. It is quite clear that the task of monitoring falls on the Member States. We have already alerted the Member States several times to the fact that their customs authorities, in particular, must make it known that there is a risk of garlic being imported illegally from certain countries. The countries are also sufficiently well known. In addition, we have introduced our own certificates to make monitoring easier. We are aware, however, that these measures – at least in the way they have been implemented so far – are not sufficient to achieve satisfactory results. That is precisely why we are also prepared to go a step further. We will be tabling a proposal for a negotiating mandate so that we can negotiate a suitable mechanism for fixing quotas in the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">On the second question – raised by Mr Sturdy – about the WTO, Europe"s position and how it proposes to act, all I can say to you today is the following: although this Commission is only an acting Commission at the present time, I believe that it is necessary and important – and I have therefore issued instructions to this effect to the services responsible – for us to develop a negotiating strategy based on the agreements reached as part of Agenda 2000 as soon as possible, so that we will then be in a position in the second half of the year to liaise with other countries about this forthcoming WTO round. You can safely assume that part of our strategy will be to take measures to strengthen Europe"s position.</p>
<p class="contents">I can reassure Mrs Keppelhoff‐Wiechert: the object of our proposal for an amendment is precisely no longer to include only sales on the producer"s holding – when they take place on the holding – but to treat sales at weekly markets and all the other direct sales measures you mentioned in just the same way as direct sales on the producer"s holding, that is to say as an exception and thus as part of the 25 % rule.</p>
