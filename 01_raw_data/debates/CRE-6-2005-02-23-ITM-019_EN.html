Thanks to them, and to the Dutch and Luxembourg Presidencies, we today have a package of amendments to the common position which is acceptable to both colegislators and to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that this House will support the proposals contained in Mrs Bresso's recommendation, which were supported unanimously in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">All the proposed amendments to the committee recommendation are acceptable. The amendments are in keeping with the objectives of the directive to safeguard constant consumer protection throughout the European Union, something which, on the one hand, will increase consumer confidence and, on the other hand, will simplify things for legal undertakings. Similarly, their application in practice is feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive provides consumer protection and, at the same time, it is good both for the internal market and for our competitiveness in general. It will replace the current compilation of national regulations with a cohesive Community framework. For traders, this means a cohesive set of regulations wherever they trade in the European Union. For consumers, it means new means of protection in certain sectors, such as aggressive practices, and the certainty that cohesive rules apply throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We trust that you will support this package, so that we have the possibility of putting this new law into application. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bresso (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the proposal for a directive on unfair commercial practices was approved by Parliament at first reading on 20 April 2004. The directive provides for a general ban on unfair commercial practices and an indicative, non-exhaustive list of general and specific examples of unfair commercial practices. The key aim of this directive is to achieve a high degree of consumer protection, as the Commissioner pointed out, coupled with the smooth functioning of the internal market, in such a way as to favour commercial transactions and, therefore, economic growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The original text of the directive was based on harmonisation of consumer protection at a sufficiently high level on the one hand and application of the country-of-origin principle and mutual recognition on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, Parliament introduced amendments aimed at improving the balance of the proposal, by adding further consumer protection elements. In this connection, Parliament proposed extending the legal basis, partly by inserting Article 153 of the Treaty, whereby Member States had the option to retain more stringent national provisions for five years after the directive’s entry into force. Parliament also added an obligation for the Commission to report to Parliament on the application of the directive every five years and to propose any necessary updating of the annex.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important amendments adopted by Parliament at first reading covered a wide range of issues, particularly the insertion of a definition of vulnerable consumers and codes of conduct, consumer participation in the drawing-up of the codes of conduct, as well as other amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position which the Council sent to us was, of course, examined by the committee, and we decided in the first place to base ourselves solely on Parliament's amendments at first reading, above all so as to avoid reopening the debate on points already settled in the earlier discussions, which would have prolonged the time required.</p>
<p class="contents">On the country-of-origin principle in particular, which was omitted from the proposal, we believe it is no longer necessary to call for it to be included, in view of the level of harmonisation of consumer protection now achieved. It is important to note that the common position has incorporated many of Parliament's amendments, notably the definition of vulnerable consumers, the participation of consumers' associations in drawing up codes of conduct, and the inclusion of a definition of undue influence among aggressive practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also accepted Parliament's proposal for a derogation, extended from five to six years, for the application of legislation. We believe that the common position represents a satisfactory compromise, while also being aware that certain of the amendments from first reading aimed at significantly boosting consumer protection need to be reintroduced. Our intention was particularly to re-propose consumer protection provisions in the following areas: restricted after-sales guarantees; the right to exchange; products similar to those of another manufacturer designed to mislead the consumer; plus advertising directed at children. As regards the last point, the aim is not to outlaw advertising but to tighten the ban on commercial practices which could put children under undue pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">After a considerable number of amendments to the draft report had been tabled, we arrived at a compromise document which incorporated the most significant of them, upholding Parliament’s rights but also taking the Council’s common position into account. In particular, the Committee on Internal Market and Consumer Protection unanimously accepted amendments on the following points: taking social, cultural and linguistic factors into account in defining the average consumer for legal purposes; a ban on a trader claiming that a product has been approved by a public or private body when it has not; a ban on promoting sales by pretending to be just a consumer or a private vendor; and, lastly, it is considered unfair practice to create the false impression that the consumer has won something when the prize does not exist or is subject to the consumer paying money.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I consider that, subject to the slight changes proposed, this directive is worth adopting, since it will mark a step forward for both consumers and traders in the EU, in terms of a secure legal framework and the protection of the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to give a final warning on a technical point, for which I apologise: since a number of issues have arisen during revision of the translation, the text to be considered authentic is the one approved by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO). I should also like to thank the first rapporteur, Mrs Ghilardotti, the Commission, the Council and my colleagues on the IMCO Committee for their fruitful collaboration, which, as has been mentioned already, led to the text being adopted unanimously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you, Mrs Bresso, that we will once again be giving the package of amendments, all nineteen of them, our full backing. We have all been working on unfair commercial practices for a while and as progress was made, starting with the Green Paper up to second reading now, we have become increasingly aware of the need to allow the internal market to be not only an area in which the free movement of goods and services simply occurs, but also to turn it into an area in which this free movement occurs in the knowledge that all is done in accordance with fair practices.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, not the case that so far, or as long as this directive is not in force, everything would have been done unfairly. The Member States assumed their responsibilities at a time that was appropriate to them in the past, but we have noticed that, for as long as those Member States organise that protection differently in each country, we will have a problem within the internal market, namely that this market lacks the confidence of the unassured consumers who dare not look across the border, or the confidence of the enterprises, mainly the smallest enterprises, that hardly dare take a step across the border because they too are unfamiliar with the rules on the other side of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the work we have done collectively is sound. It is a very balanced document because it offers a high level of consumer protection, as the treaty expects from us, but it also provides maximum legal certainty for the trader, which means that we can strike a perfect balance. We are also for the first time taking a careful step towards full harmonisation. I think we can do this because the level of consumer protection is so high. This is all thanks to perfect cooperation with Members from other groups, the Council and Commission. I should like to thank all those involved, because it is thanks to this openness, transparency, constructive attitude that we have achieved so much and that we are able to complete the dossier at second reading. Mrs Bresso, I would, of course, like to thank you, in particular, for your commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this proposal only deals with ‘B to C’, that is, ‘business to consumer’ relations, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is nevertheless pleased with the fact that this legislative document explicitly mentions that when an entrepreneur establishes that a competitor contravenes this directive, that that can be used by that entrepreneur to turn it into a case of unfair commercial practices, a case of distortion of competition, albeit in accordance with the national law of the country in question. We are also satisfied that we have, at long last, managed to establish among ourselves who the reference consumer is, that we take the average consumer as a point of reference but that we do this without losing sight of the weak consumer. I think that in that area too, we have struck a particularly good balance.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains for us to do is to hope that the Council will set to work promptly to give the initiative its official stamp of approval and that the Member States will not hesitate to ensure that everything is transposed into national legislation within the prescribed timeframe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that she, along with everyone else concerned, has helped to make it possible for us, today – or, rather, at tomorrow’s vote – to draw a line under the legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that these 19 amendments, all of which my group will be voting to support, have enabled us to achieve a good compromise, one to which we can consent with a clear conscience and with confidence. This is, I have to say, a compromise, and we Social Democrats would have been quite happy to go further in some respects, although we did of course have to make sacrifices to the majorities in this House, and that is what we did, particularly where more vulnerable consumers – by which we meant children in particular – were concerned; had things gone our way, we would have afforded them even more protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have preferred it if there had been no possibility whatever of direct marketing to or for children being permitted, thus outlawing unfair business practices in this area from the word go. Unfortunately, though, that has not been possible; that is something we have to live with. Perhaps we will be able to achieve this through further amending legislation at a later date.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats can, however, be very satisfied with the way in which we – with evidently large majorities in both the Council and this House – have managed to dispatch the planned provisions relating to the country of origin principle. This is an area in which real harmonisation is happening – rightly, I think, for we have to ensure that the legislation rests on firm foundations. That we have done in this area, and the decision we will take tomorrow will surely be the right one, pointing the way into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, then, many thanks to Mrs Bresso for a job well done; I think we have now done something very fine for the protection of consumers and the public, something that enables us to face the world out there with our heads held high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must thank the rapporteur for her hard work in bringing this consensus together, especially taking over the report as she did. It has been a wonderful example of all the institutions working together at the second reading to get a good result.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that this is an important and innovative proposal, giving us a very high level of consumer protection, and harmonisation of that protection, across the EU, in a comprehensible and coherent way. That is to be welcomed. It is also innovative in that, as a framework directive, it is combined with the use of codes of conduct. That is a good step forward. I hope, and it seems from what has been said here already tonight, that we will all be able to give this proposal a fair wind.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of our Group, I want to make two further, more specific, points. As others have said, there are still concerns about the definition of vulnerable consumers. I know, for instance, that in some of the Nordic Member States and, indeed, in the EEA states for whom this legislation will have relevance, there are higher levels of protection already in existence. There are worries about how this will be affected in the future. I believe that the Commission, during the transition period, should give some consideration to these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to turn to one of the particular unfair commercial practices that is dealt with in the Annex and is the subject of an amendment that we will vote on tomorrow. It is a particular practice in my own country that has reached epidemic proportions. I refer to the telephone scams, where people are phoned – again and again, evening after evening – told that they have won a prize and invited to phone another number, which, if they do, they will run up an horrendous and huge telephone bill. We will, at last, have the ammunition to deal with that when this legislation comes into force across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe there are many other good things in this proposal that commends itself to us all in the House, and I hope it and our rapporteur get the support they deserve tomorrow.</p>

I also want to thank Mrs Bresso for leading that negotiating process, together with all the shadow rapporteurs, in particular my colleague, Mrs Thyssen, who led for our side on this.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, as many Members have already said, will be very good for consumers. It will also be very good for thousands of businesses that want to trade fairly and provide high standards, because those companies are in many cases outraged when they see fraudsters perpetrating scams on unsuspecting consumers. They want them dealt with as much as anybody else. Unfortunately, ingenious tricksters keep finding ways to take money off unsuspecting consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is interesting that since we started work on this we have already added a number of new provisions to this annex. One of the things we must have – and this is addressed to the Commission – is a mechanism to keep absolutely on top of this. We must also ensure that we keep adding to the blacklist when we find that people are finding ways around the rules. We want consumers to have confidence that they can exercise their rights in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">That leads me to the second point: as we are clearly going to approve this overwhelmingly tomorrow, it is now important to tell the Commissioner that we want to see this transposed as quickly and effectively as possible. Under its 'better regulation' proposals, the Commission has new mechanisms to coordinate and push through transposition as quickly as possible. We expect the Commission to do that and also to put pressure on those Member States that, perhaps, are not quite as vigilant as they should be or are not supporting the consumer protection bodies with the resources required. A part of our overall work in this committee is to support consumers. It is an important flanking measure to other things we are working on.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say, in conclusion, that it is an essential foundation for what I know will be a very successful directive on the internal market for services, which I am confident this House will adopt very soon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tone was set from the outset by the rapporteur, and her energies and skills as a new Member of this Parliament were quite exceptional, particularly since in the last few weeks she has been crossing the Alps more often than Hannibal, with other activities in her own country also.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay tribute to all those who brought this about under the Treaty provisions for consumer protection, which had not been used very frequently up to now. Everyone has to agree to a conclusion like this and any one person can wreck it. All of those who have spoken in the debate today have been contributors, both by withholding the negative power to destroy and joining the other institutions; the Luxembourg presidency and the Commission, and indeed the staff of our own committee, the Internal Market Committee, a new committee, to whom I would pay particular tribute, so that we brought about the right result here.</p>
<p class="contents">It extends the internal market; we should not forget that, because it produces more assured consumers. And it produces them because they are protected; because the special character of vulnerable consumers is acknowledged in this legislation; because there is a clear guarantee that high existing standards of consumer protection will not be imperilled and that over the next five years we move to higher standards for those that do not yet have them, and not lower standards for those who do; because the blacklist in the annexes here is clear, comprehensive and unambiguous. The consumer knows where she or he stands. So does the honest and legitimate businessman; and so does the cold-caller with the lottery scam; the rip-off timeshare artist; the peddler of mock sales.</p>
<p class="contents">If you sail under false colours this directive will sink you. I can think of nothing better guaranteed to enhance the image of this institution as a people's parliament for the public good than legislation like this. It opens the way for further developments, including, in time, more sophisticated use of self-regulation by a stable industry, and for the position of children, the one social category who are, by definition, vulnerable. To those of our colleagues who felt that, in these fields, we did not go far enough, I would say that we have a foundation of security which harmonisation at the highest level can now proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">We have helped our citizens, Mr President. We have provided an object lesson for our colleagues. It is not a bad start for this new committee and for this new Parliament and Commission. I thank you all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not always easy to be a consumer in present-day society. The volume of advertising has increased enormously and it has become very diverse. In the course of their daily lives, consumers constantly have to make decisions on the basis of the very conflicting information they receive.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes advertising can be misleading for the consumer, and marketing can be aggressive and unfair. Legislation to regulate this varies from one country to another. For that reason, we need common legal instruments that will guarantee high levels of consumer protection everywhere in the countries of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is wrong to suppose that consumers have the opportunity or time to examine advertising material very carefully. The average consumer will only skim through it. We ought to pay special attention to advertising which is aimed particularly at children, who are more vulnerable to the effects of marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation must not lower standards of consumer protection, which in some EU countries are very high. Consumer policy should be based on guaranteeing high levels of consumer protection. For that reason, I hope that we will get <span class="bold">–</span> and apparently we will <span class="bold">–</span> the transition period that has been proposed for this directive. This is a good thing. The Member States need to be given time to reform their national laws in order to maintain high standards of consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the country-of-origin principle is not being applied, and should not be applied, in this directive. If the authorities in the country of origin were deprived of the opportunity to take issue, if necessary, with unfair advertising, the most crucial objectives contained in this proposal for a directive could not be achieved.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To be sure, it is no easy matter to take over such a brief in mid-stream, and, while carrying on with what Mrs Ghilardotti had begun, you have added your own emphases, and I have to say I admire the way you have been able to hold your own in the trialogue, a place where predatory beasts dwell.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not always agree about everything, but I would like to stress at the very outset that I am very glad that you have succeeded in keeping this directive flexible in its application. The eastward enlargement has of course given us a much more heterogeneous range of consumers, as well as far more diverse ways of doing business, and I am glad that that has been taken into account by allowance being made for local circumstances in the interpretation of the directive in individual cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This, though, also means that it is important that Article 4 should provide that the Member States may not restrict the free movement of services and goods on the grounds of unfair trade practices. As I understand it, this also means that a decision taken in one Member State on the legitimacy of a business practice cannot be questioned in another. I think this comment is an important point of reference for the courts who will have to interpret this in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see, Commissioner Kyprianou, that you have given pride of place in your work programme to the transposition of European rules and regulations. This directive is one where putting good thinking and ideas into practice will be difficult.</p>

The creation of a European legislative framework, based on an adequate level of harmonisation, to give consumers legal protection against unfair business practices will increase their confidence, whether they do their shopping locally or on a website hosted in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keenly aware of the need to take account of vulnerable consumers, who, by reason of various factors such as age, physical or mental incapacity, limited literacy or disability, require extra protection. I regret, however, that we have been unable to reach agreement on better protection of minors. I am particularly pleased that the country-of-origin principle has not been reintroduced in the compromise, and for this I must congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, who has done an excellent job. The Socialist Group has always vigorously contested this principle and will continue to do so in the context of the Services Directive, because the application of this principle only generates social insecurity and legal uncertainty for the public.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this directive and Mrs Bresso’s report tomorrow is therefore of the utmost importance in the effort to protect consumers.

It is their work that has enabled Parliament to put forward its positions on this subject, which is so important to consumers, and at the same time has saved us the delays and uncertainties of a conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This represents an important moment in the internal market and the first landmark in this area during this parliamentary term. Parliament has here a very important contribution in terms of key points, and all those who often underestimate our legislative work will be proved wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">During the previous term, it was because of Parliament that the common position after first reading included the following points: the notions of vulnerable consumer and binding commitment; greater procedural rigour in drawing up codes of conduct, including the participation of consumer associations; a more precise and comprehensive listing of aggressive and, as such, banned practices; the derogation clause, now extended to six years, to permit the interim application of more stringent national legislation; and the obligation on the Commission to report regularly to Parliament on the implementation of the directive and to propose updates when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the astuteness of the rapporteur and those who conducted and closely followed the interinstitutional proceedings, the second reading will also enable us to go a little further with consumer guarantees and protection, particularly in the area of child protection, outlawing the unfair exploitation of children through a number of duly considered and polished amendments, for which the final agreement of the Council is already assured. Good news, then, and complete success. I also made a modest contribution to some of these amendments, especially Amendment 17, and I should like to thank my fellow Members for all their understanding in accepting it and following it through, because I am aware that I tabled it only just within the time limit allowed by the Rules of Procedure for second reading. However, it is one more consumer guarantee that has been put in writing – in this particular case, in the area of insurance – and that is clearly a positive outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a final point, Mr President, to say that I share the rapporteur’s view that it is unnecessary and might even be inappropriate to insist here on the so-called country-of-origin principle or, in this case, the internal market clause. I am also one of those who believe that we should be moving towards the harmonisation of legislation in these areas, and that is what has been achieved here, which is a good sign for the future. We have chosen the right path. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My Swedish colleagues and I have a number of misgivings, however. At first reading of the proposal, Denmark and Sweden registered their reservations, as we are concerned about the directive adversely affecting the level of consumer protection where Member States have stricter national legislation, as does Sweden in this case. The Swedish members of the Socialist Group in the European Parliament still hold this view. We also find the scope of the proposal too narrow, as it is strictly limited to the economic interests of consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main objection to the proposal, however, is that it threatens to overturn the Swedish ban on TV advertising aimed at children. This is currently governed by the Television without Frontiers Directive which, in turn, is in danger of being fully harmonised as a result of this proposal for a directive. Unfortunately, the proposal does not afford children sufficient protection against advertising, as we discussed in this House earlier this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The Swedish proposal to ban TV advertising aimed at children under the age of twelve is based on the same developmental theories that form the basis for our requirement that minors be protected against violence and pornography. Children cannot be expected to view advertising critically or resist bait advertising directed at them. That is why we ought to have had a stricter proposal with regard to advertising aimed at children. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This second reading of the common position on unfair commercial practices has demonstrated that, given the necessary political will, it is possible to formulate a European law which harmonises the wide diversity of national legal positions instead of pitting them against each other. We must indeed remember that the European Commission, in its initial draft, proposed the application of the country-of-origin principle, and it was the Council that opted for a strategy of closer harmonisation, which our Parliament firmly supported at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, I can only urge the Commission to learn the lessons from this directive and encourage the House to keep pursuing the path of harmonisation in respect of the draft instruments currently under discussion, and particularly the proposal for a directive on services as well as the proposal on measures to promote sales, on which a stalemate has been reached in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a realistic compromise; like all compromises, I am sure that many of us would like to certain aspects go further. However, it is a realistic and workable compromise. I agree with Mrs Wallis that this is a good example of how cooperation between the three institutions can produce positive results for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the concerns expressed today are met by the legislation. I remind you that, in respect to children and other vulnerable consumers, there is still the possibility of stricter measures by the Member States based on health, safety, taste and decency. This gives Member States room for manoeuvre. The derogation period of six years for higher protection and standards will be very useful. In the meantime, the Commission will come back with a report on the application and transposition of the directive, and we will also review every aspect and see how we can take it even further. In this respect, we will see how we can proceed with updating and increasing, if necessary, the list of practices contained in Annex I. I must remind you that the list may be modified only by revision of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour was right: my commitment to Parliament is to give priority to enforcement and implementation. Otherwise, we can adopt the best laws but, unless they are transposed and implemented by the Member States, they will be of no value to European citizens. This will be the Commission's first priority and will be reflected in the report, where we will present to you any problems in implementation. I look forward to working together with you to get the Member States to implement and enforce this legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish once again to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Bresso, for her excellent work. I also wish to thank the Groups, the shadow rapporteurs and the chairman of the committee, who helped a lot in this respect. I am very proud that this important piece of legislation comes under my competence. I am proud and very happy and take it as my duty to ensure that it will be transposed properly by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
