<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> I shall start with the declaration. It is the last International Women's Day of this century. A declaration on the situation of women, and especially on violence against women, is thus appropriate. The Member States of the European Union are democratic societies where women and men have equal rights. Women form slightly more than half of the population in every country. However, this is not reflected either in decision‐making bodies or in administration or business life.</p>
<p class="contents">All of our countries have subscribed to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We all know that the human rights of women and of the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible part of universal human rights. What then is the situation in our countries? Women have the right to live in safety, but a great number are not even safe in their own homes. Women have the right to be treated with dignity, but thousands and thousands of women are sold like cattle and regarded as only having the value their pimps and traffickers can get from exploiting them. Women have full human rights but oppression and violence keep them in subordinate positions in all our countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the issue of violence against women is internationally recognised as a substantial problem. With the 1993 Vienna World Conference on Human Rights, women's rights were finally accepted as human rights. Gender‐based violence and all forms of sexual harassment and exploitation are incompatible with the dignity and worth of the human person. Such behaviour has to be eliminated. The issue of violence against women was on the agenda of the United Nations Women's Conference in Beijing in 1995. The Platform underlined that violence against women is an obstacle to the achievement of the objectives of equality, development and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">For years it was often said that women had themselves to blame if they were beaten and raped. It was said that they should not wear short skirts. This argument is sometimes still used but in slightly different forms. I personally would not, by the way, use the argument that the wearing of jeans is a guarantee against rape. Today, the common view is that the woman and her testimony should be relied upon in court. Most Member States have changed their laws so as to make violence against women a criminal act. Also, rape within marriage is now a crime. Women often have the right to a special counsellor during court proceedings. Women's organisations play an essential role in the fight against violence. They reach out to those at risk and are active in raising awareness among the public. This is the very basis of the Daphne initiative. Since 1996 we have supported nongovernmental and voluntary organisations in their fight against violence towards women and children. The demand for support is far greater than the resources available. The new Daphne programme will also be open for NGOs from countries from Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the presidencies have also launched a campaign against violence towards women, in response to the demand by the European Parliament to make 1999 a year against violence against women. During this campaign a number of European actions are being organised. The next big European event will be the ministerial conference on violence against women, to be held in Cologne at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">The campaign against violence is not just a series of official European conferences: the Member States themselves are of course invited to initiate events involving both the public and NGOs. For many years the issue of violence against women was discussed as a women's problem. But it is not women who are the problem, it is the violent behaviour of men. Therefore we should not only focus on women. Women and children are the victims of this violence. The problem is men who argue using physical force and violence instead of words. This campaign should therefore also focus on men and what can be done to change the present situation. Projects by, for and about men will be supported in the Member States. Let me quote a Swedish doctor who wrote before the United Nations Women's Conference in Beijing: ‘Sufficient numbers of men must discover and take an active stand against the violence which occurs around them. A greater number of men must make themselves heard at workplaces in the public debate and refuse to go along with this violence. Violence of this kind is despicable and inhuman and therefore also unmanly. Real men do not behave like that.". Fathers must pass this message on to their sons, teachers to their pupils, military commanders to their men, and friends to one another.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of our European campaign I invite all men today to support the campaign by wearing a white ribbon. This ribbon is a sign that you are real men, who say ‘no" to violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause ) </span></p>
<p class="contents">The achievements under the Daphne programme have been impressive. Violence against women, adolescents and children has been placed high on the political agenda. A total of 95 projects have been supported since 1997. These projects have led to the establishment of useful networks and cross‐border cooperation between non‐governmental organisations. An observatory on violence against women has been established and research projects are under way.</p>
<p class="contents">An important part of the Daphne programme is the campaign against violence against women. This campaign is based on an initiative from the European Parliament. A preparatory meeting was held in June last year under the British presidency. In December the Austrian presidency hosted a conference in Vienna. It focused on the role of the police in combating violence against women and violence against migrant women. At the end of March the German presidency will host a ministerial conference in Cologne. There are also plans for a concluding conference towards the end of the Finnish presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Between these conferences several actions are being organised on both a European and a national level. Examples are the production of television spots, information packages and a website on the Internet. We are also conducting a statistical report on violence as well as Eurobarometer. Projects will also be supported in the Member States. One of the main targets will be projects focusing on men and how to prevent violent behaviour from men towards women.</p>
<p class="contents">On 20 May 1998 the Commission presented a proposal for the new Daphne programme. This programme will run from 2002 to 2004 with a total budget of ECU 25m. Since then I have been anxious to have the proposal adopted as soon as possible. We need to have the programme in place at the latest by 1 January 2000. During the Austrian presidency progress was meagre. By the end of 1998 the discussion focused on the legal base of the proposal. A number of Member States made it clear that they were opposed to Article 235 as the legal base for the programme. On the other hand, many Member States saw Article 129 as an appropriate alternative to the legal base. The discussions in the Council in January and February showed clearly that there was a considerable risk of blockage if Article 235 was maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was therefore forced to accept the proposed new legal base. Nobody should be in any doubt that we would have preferred to keep Article 235 but we had to face the fact that there is no value in an unadopted Daphne programme. I assume that Article 129 will not limit the scope of the programme. The context in which we work to combat violence and in which women and children suffer is, indeed, the context of human rights. However, the impact of violence on women, young persons and children amounts to injury or the risk of injury to their physical, mental and psychological health. It should be noted that according to the World Health Organisation's definition, health is ‘a state of complete physical, mental and social well‐being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity".</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Daphne programme is victim‐based. Its aim is to prevent all forms of violence and to protect all victims and potential victims of violence, irrespective of whether the violence takes the form of trafficking, sexual abuse, the abandonment of children or any other form. I regret the inconvenience that this amendment has caused the European Parliament. However, in our view it was necessary to act swiftly in order for Parliament to take account of the amended proposal at its committee meeting on 16 and 17 February this year.</p>
<p class="contents">When the new Daphne programme is adopted it will provide a new impetus in the fight against violence. Under the programme we will continue to provide support for NGO cooperation within the European Union but we will also be able to include cooperation with NGOs in the candidate countries. I recently participated in a conference in Budapest with NGOs active in the fight against sexual exploitation of children. The extent of the problem is immense. The need for support and cooperation with the NGO community in these countries is evident.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to succeed in the fight against violence we need concrete action involving all parts of our society. To fight against violence towards women is the responsibility of us all. We welcome the fact that the European Parliament will consider the amended proposal in its appropriate committee in March with a view to submitting it to the April plenary session for first reading.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hautala </span> <span class="bold">(V). </span>‐ <span class="italic">(FI)</span> Mr President, I am speaking here on behalf of the Committee on Women"s Rights. Hardly anyone can be left in any doubt that the Committee on Women"s Rights and the European Parliament have been responsible for the European Union"s decision to tackle the problem of violence against women, children and young people. We want these campaigns to be carried out as this is a very serious social problem. In previous years the European Parliament adopted specific budgetary policies to counter the problem of violence against women, children and young persons, and there has been overwhelming interest in setting up projects of this kind, so that in 1997, for example, funding could be provided for only just over 10 % of all the projects proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has also approved two very important reports dealing with violence against women. A report compiled under the leadership of Marianne Eriksson raises the issue of so‐called zero tolerance in matters of violence. An important report was also put together under the leadership of Susan Waddington extending the debate to cover the issue of the trade in women. It is an astonishing fact that there are two million women and young girls in the world being sold every year to be sexually exploited, which means that the issue is not actually merely an EU problem, but a global one, and one in which we must be able to intervene.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee is very worried that if the Commission now gives in to those Member States which do not agree that the Daphne programme should be made law under Article 235, the scope of the programme will not be adequate to the scale of the problem. We would like it to deal with all the possible legal aspects connected with violence against women, including the trade in women. If the legal basis is the promotion of public health, we want guarantees that the Commission will actually be able to create a programme, in conjunction with the Member States, in which violence against women is not merely reduced to a health problem.</p>
<p class="contents">All credit goes to Mrs Gradin for her attempts to meet our demands that the notion of public health must be understood in as broad a context as possible here. But we actually want guarantees that legal instruments might also be on the agenda. Let me tell you about the situation in Finland. A law came into force at the beginning of this year in Finland under which the police or a court can impose a restraining order on a person who has behaved violently. In other words, a person may be prevented from coming near their victim when there is reason to fear that violent acts will be carried out again. In the Member States there are certainly other excellent examples of how this matter can be approached using legal means.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the global nature of this problem, I have received, in my capacity as chairman of the committee, a letter from an Iranian organisation pointing out that women in Iran are still being stoned. We should also remember that we are sure to become involved in these global aspects of the issue with this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I was not altogether convinced, having heard your reply, that this change to the legal basis will now guarantee us a good programme within the Daphne context. Perhaps we can try together to convince those reluctant Member States I mentioned that they should agree to consider Article 235 as a legal basis. I understand that in fact you were of the same opinion as us originally, but that now you base your opinion on the overall importance, in general terms, of accomplishing this programme.</p>
<p class="contents" align="center"><span class="bold">IN THE CHAIR: MR IMBENI<br /></span><span class="italic">Vice‐President</span></p>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gröner </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I warmly welcome you all to International Women"s Day. I have just come from a worldwide video conference, organised by Unifem, the UN women"s organisation, which calls for a worldwide campaign for a world free of violence against women. We in the European Parliament are preparing to make an important contribution to this campaign. We are taking part in worldwide actions and I think it is most important for the women in our Member States to realise that they are not alone, that we are fighting alongside them.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union have been fighting for a long time for a European year against violence against women. A year ago 350 Members supported the written declaration calling for this and for a campaign to that end. Now we have reached the point where we can start the campaign and have a draft programme on the table. But legal problems are arising now: reasons – which in my view are pretexts – are being put forward by the most varied groups of people, which will prevent the Daphne programme from being adopted at an early date.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats want rapid action. We want the programme to be adopted quickly, obviously with the participation of the European Parliament, which also has a greater say thanks mainly to the use of Article 129 as the legal basis. But I can see that it will be very difficult to get the programme ready on time so that it really can enter into force by 1 January 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">What we definitely want to ensure – and we will fight for this – is that large sections of the previous draft programme are not cut, such as those on trafficking in women and domestic violence – I find it difficult to call it <span class="italic">häusliche Gewalt</span> , violence in the home, as it is called in German, for no home is violent as such, it is always the people, and usually the men who are violent in the home – and that we get the programme wrapped up in good time. You all know we will be having new elections, Parliament has to be formed first, and the Council presidencies have to take that into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The German President‐in‐Office of the Council, Christine Bergmann, said in the Committee on Women"s Rights that she wants to see the Daphne programme signed and sealed as soon as possible. The Justice Ministers want the programme too, but nevertheless formal difficulties have cropped up again. This is probably largely because we do not have a formal Council of Ministers for women"s affairs that could adopt the programme, and this is another very crucial demand made by my group.</p>
<p class="contents">If we discuss the matter at all, we would say that Article 129 must definitely lead to a multidisciplinary approach. We also want to take account even at this stage of the provisions that will come with the Amsterdam Treaty, which will presumably enter into force by the year 2000, and we want a comprehensive definition of what the concept of health actually covers. This means that we must also look at the social background to violence and in particular we must adhere to the approach that non‐governmental organisations, Member State authorities and the judiciary and police can all work together here. That is vital if we are to pass on the message to our citizens that Europe and the European Parliament are fighting to prevent all forms of violence against women.</p>

<p class="contents">I would have liked to have been here presenting the report by the Committee on Women"s Rights on the Daphne Programme, for which I am the rapporteur. However, as you all know, this was not possible as the legal basis was changed at the last minute, when a great deal of work had already been done on the report. It is not bad news although certain aspects do concern us. Our main priority is to ensure that the Daphne Programme moves forward. As you will remember, it was this House"s initiative to create a special budget line to fund measures for combating violence against women and children, and in the three years since its creation, it has seen magnificent results. There is a high degree of collaboration between NGOs, civil society and public bodies which has led to many new ideas and projects. Together they are searching for better solutions, and it is our responsibility – and that of all the Community institutions – to implement this programme before the end of the year. For the first time, the European Union is facing the challenge of a five‐year programme to combat violence. Five years is a long time for those who are suffering. It is therefore also our duty to prepare a good text setting out an appropriate strategy for the medium term that effectively helps to prevent and mitigate the effects of violence on women, children and young people. As a result, Commissioner, we are extremely concerned about the definition of the concept of public health. This must be interpreted more widely to mean a state of physical, mental and social well‐being and we hope that this will be the case. Trafficking in women, sexual abuse and the disappearance of children are all forms of violence. The European Union can provide an important added value in combating such violence. It would be unfortunate if these issues were left aside just because a legal concept was poorly interpreted.</p>
<p class="contents">Today is the last 8 March of this millennium. On the first 8 March, women were almost invisible. Over the last 20 years many inequalities have been corrected but discrimination still exists. I do not want to end without highlighting the major challenge facing us if we are to make the principle of equality a reality. The ratification of the Treaty of Amsterdam will certainly help us to do that as we will have firm legal bases that establish mainstreaming as a fundamental and horizontal objective. There is still too much direct and indirect discrimination that prevents women from playing a full role as citizens, that hinders their access to employment and that prevents them from being independent and having high self‐esteem. The fourth action programme serves as a guideline in all the Member States but its aims must not end with the programme. Rather, we should pursue them and improve them in a fifth action programme. We must promote the reconciliation of professional and family lives and encourage women to get involved in politics. These are key elements for the participation of women in society and, of course, their integration into the labour market. The European Union has many resources it can draw on to provide assistance. I hope that Agenda 2000 and the new Fund regulations – which are vital documents – establish clear measures in favour of working women.</p>

She rightly points to the fact that women are still under‐represented in decision‐making forums, government and the world of business and industry. This is despite the fact that there are more women than men in the European Union. Parliament"s President himself has just said that more work is needed here. She rightly observes that women"s rights are human rights. Women are entitled to be safe and to be treated with human dignity. To a lot of men, including men in this Chamber, violence against women is a marginal and rare phenomenon, at least in the European Union. But the figures tell us that one woman in five has at some point been the victim of violence. Violence against women and children too occurs in all societies and at all levels of society, irrespective of culture or religion.</p>
<p class="contents">She is also right to say that the battle against violence against women must not be waged solely by women and by non‐governmental organisations seeking to help stop violence against women. First and foremost we have to tackle its root causes, and those are not short skirts or too little assertiveness on the part of women, but the millions of European men who use violence in some form or other every day.</p>
<p class="contents">We must use 1999, the year of campaigning against violence towards women, to make men aware of their obligations. For all these reasons and given your most excellent statement, I find it a pity that the new legal base for the Daphne programme is so restrictive, even though you are asking for it to be interpreted broadly.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Daphne programme also covers violence against children and young people. I have tabled a number of amendments on behalf of my group to ensure that this is made clear in the resolution, in the title and in a number of paragraphs as well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I am delighted to be the first man to speak in this debate on International Women's Day. I want in particular to assure my colleagues here that the vast majority of men would support them fully in ensuring that they have full equality of rights, parity of esteem and protection against any violence whatsoever. I am proud to wear the white ribbon to show that I make that stand myself personally. I know I speak for the majority of my colleagues here as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that the statements made in this House are not just made in a vacuum and that we send a message out to the wider world that we in the European Parliament are willing to be visionary and to bring the world into the 21st century by guaranteeing equality of rights for all; and, in particular, by putting in place special protection programmes for those who suffer violence. That is why the Daphne programme is so important to us, not only because – if I could use the phrase – it was our own child, but also because we see the importance of its effect on a global scale.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already experienced some of the benefits from the Daphne programme. It is unfortunate that legal difficulties – which this Parliament has encountered many times through the use of Article 235 – have delayed the implementation of the new programme. However, I am confident that, utilising the new legal base, we can begin once again to put this issue on the map.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that when we decide to bring in new programmes, we ensure that the voluntary sector and the non‐governmental organisations who are working at the coalface, who are there with women's and children's refuges to help them, are brought in at the very earliest stage to advise us of what is the most effective way of utilising funding. But it is equally important to bring the governments of the Member States along with us, because, as has been seen from the use of Article 235, certain governments felt this was an imposition on them, and that it interfered with their democratic rights under the rules of subsidiarity within the Treaties. Therefore, we must ensure that governments are seen to be playing an active role in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The new equal opportunities created for us in the Treaty of Amsterdam must be grasped fully. But henceforth let the message from here be: men and women oppose violence against women, against children, against all.</p>

If the Commissioner does not have a problem with the legal base, then as regards the Daphne programme, nor do I. It is just that my own personal dream of including preventive medicine and the trade in women has still not been fulfilled. I hope that in spite of everything, we may yet be able to reach agreement on all areas. However, I can see that it is going to be an uphill struggle, although perhaps we should not paint too gloomy a picture.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that I have the floor, I should in any case like to thank the voluntary organisations for their work, not just within the European Union, but all over the world. Even though we politicians may be amazingly competent, we cannot deny that there is a need for teamwork between us who are elected by the people and those who toil at grass‐roots level. It is that teamwork which will enable us to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to mention that I am wearing jeans in honour of the day. I must say that I was extremely surprised by the Italian court ruling. It made me think that if only it were a simple matter for myself and our children to wear jeans, we would have an infinitely better working arrangement with the jeans manufacturers who are currently having such problems. Unfortunately, however, wearing jeans is not a simple matter. I have been wearing jeans now for several days in celebration of International Women's Day, which was first proclaimed by women Socialists at the beginning of the century, and by the United Nations in 1975, since we are hardly ever able to celebrate it on 8 March. I hope that some time in the next century it may be possible to designate 8 March a holiday in honour of us women, so that we can celebrate that one day in a fitting manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted about the ‘White Ribbon" campaign, organised by ‘real" men in Canada to demonstrate, by wearing this token, that they actively oppose violence by other men against women. I think it is a very commendable campaign, and I sincerely hope that all those men who are wearing a ribbon today in the House continue to sport it for the rest of their lives, instead of discarding it once this day comes to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence by men against women is, as was mentioned earlier, a worldwide problem of enormous proportions and with devastating implications for those concerned. It is not good enough for one man to say ‘but I for one am not usually violent". Obviously, there are other men who are. This is something we are frighteningly aware of today.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Swedish Government, which last year brought in legislation to protect women that viewed their problems from a different perspective. For example, the customers of prostitutes are to be criminalised, an approach which this House found highly amusing some 18 months ago, but which is now the subject of legislation in one Member State at least.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to extend my thanks to Leyla Zana, one of several women who are still the victims of political violence.</p>

We hope the Commissioner is right, or wins through, and that even with an inadequate legal base she will manage to implement a programme which is effective in combating crimes such as trafficking in human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Measures to combat violence against women and children are a priority worldwide. They really mean the start of peace – the start of moves towards a peaceful society and a humane society from which many women and children are still excluded. Many men suffer violence too, but as we take up and intensify the campaign against violence against women and children today, I think we can be pleased with what Commissioner Gradin has said, although of course the Chamber does not altogether reflect that. The men have drifted away in droves, despite being sympathetic on this issue. Happily we have already heard one male speaker, and undoubtedly there are many others who will feel sympathetic. But it took some time before women too realised that we must not simply act to defend the victims better, but that violence is a problem of men which must therefore be tackled by men.</p>
<p class="contents">That being so, I readily endorse what has been said here on the subject. I shall respectfully submit a written declaration to you, Mr President, I hope on behalf of a large number of honourable Members, asking you as the President of Parliament to take steps to set up a commission on children"s rights.</p>

For goodness sake, what type of conformism is society being taken over by? Would anyone here dare to say that if he does not wear this white ribbon, it is because he is in favour of violence against women?</p>
<p class="contents">There were other periods in history when it was more difficult to wear the white rosette, as did young knights who fought to defend the most martyred queen in our history, Marie‐Antoinette. In France, where I come from, talking about violence against women would involve mentioning all those women who were guillotined during the French Revolution, the Carmelite nuns of Orange and all the acts of persecution. It would mean having to mention the 3 000 French women who were deported to Algeria in 1962 amidst total indifference.</p>
<p class="contents">The European institutions did not want to hear a word about it. These women were deported to houses of pleasure of the <span class="italic">Fellaga</span> army rabble in Algeria. Jasmina and a friend of hers were saying to me only yesterday in my office that yes, they are frightened every day, frightened of being threatened with their lives or being raped. That is the reason there is violence against women. Why not say so then? In some areas in my country, there are more cases of rape each day than there are burnt‐out cars. This year, 700 cars have been burnt out in Strasbourg. Yet, how many more rapes were there? Nothing is said about this because it is a millstone around our necks. It certainly must not be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">However, why not talk about the presence of displaced persons on our territory who have the same morals as those who are fighting over in Algeria, and who are raping women and slitting people"s throats? Talking about violence against women would mean having to talk about the infamous group, ‘<span class="italic">Nique ta mère"</span> , which has been glorified as a so‐called anti‐racist group. It is despicable that it dares to have a name like that, and yet the records are selling thanks to capitalists promoting them, as is seen in FNAC and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking about violence against women would of course mean having to talk about abortion, which is the worst kind of violence, and which has become commonplace nowadays; it would also sadly mean having to talk about self‐destruction, a type of violence sometimes forced on women by the propaganda with which we are all familiar. Finally, talking about violence against women would mean having to admit that the death penalty, which is necessary for the most abominable assassins, must be reintroduced for those capable of such forms of torture.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Waddington </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I would like to begin by warmly congratulating Commissioner Gradin on her speech on the issue of violence against women. This is a very significant day. It illustrates a real determination for a Europe‐wide campaign against violence to women. All the work we have undertaken in the Committee on Women's Rights and in this Parliament in the last few years illustrates the influence of Parliament and the Committee on Women's Rights in taking a determined stand against violence to women.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect to see action across every Member State. We know the difficulties we have already experienced in getting this far. There have been objections from many quarters. Yet we have reached the point, that we know there are going to be new actions, new research, new initiatives, new projects, all of which will contribute towards raising awareness of the issue of violence towards women and combating it. I am sure all of us recognise that we have a responsibility to work in our own Member States, in our own networks, to combat violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliamentary Labour Party have accepted that and we are beginning our own campaign this week. We intend to consult with practitioners in all the regions of the UK and to prepare a platform for action. We also want to develop partnerships between our own non‐governmental organisations and those in other Member States so that we can share good ideas and good practice. We want to extend that globally to work with countries like South Africa. I have just returned from that country and the issue of violence against women is very high on the agenda. There is a great need for all of us to work together globally.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Commissioner Gradin we also want men to stand beside us. It is men in this Parliament and men in the various committees that have been dealing with this issue who, for budgetary and legal reasons, have often resisted the work we have been doing. It is men who are the perpetrators of violence against women and men have to take this seriously. I think the white ribbon campaign is excellent and I want to see British men, and men in all communities and all towns wearing that white ribbon and supporting women across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One in four women experiences violence and virtually every woman is vulnerable to violence. Every woman supports this campaign. The European Union is known for combating oppression and opposing violence. Let us make sure we oppose it in our own cities, towns and homes.</p>

When she was appointed in 1995 she made this topic one of her priorities and despite a great deal of discouragement she has actually won through and we are now having a major debate in this Parliament about a subject that was often sniggered about but rarely taken seriously until she decided to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to congratulate the staff who are running the Daphne Programme. They are always available and always very supportive. Mr Simpson is perhaps the person we know best. He has made a real campaign out of this and a real mission for himself. These programmes – Daphne, STOP and Grotius – came into existence following the tragedy of the Dutroux murders in Belgium.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a tragedy but also proved to be a catalyst when finally the political classes woke up to the fact that there was a really serious problem.</p>
<p class="contents">If I concentrate my remarks on children in this debate it is not because I am not totally at one with my colleagues who have spoken about the need to confront very seriously the major problem we have in all our societies with violence against women; but increasingly, in the last three or four years the issue of children's rights and the protection of those rights have begun slowly but finally to take their place amongst the political priorities in many of our countries. All too often the real movers and shakers in this area are the NGOs who are, invariably, inadequately funded and constantly knocking on the door to try and bring these issue to the public. For that reason we need a dedicated unit within the Commission to draw together the many programmes. They are quite small, there is not a lot of money in them, but they are in danger of fragmentation if things continue like this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that all of us in our own countries, as Mrs Waddington has said, have to get the men to recognise that children are not just the responsibility of their mothers.</p>

However, I should like to make one remark in connection with this. Like Mrs Banotti, I note that the Committee on Women"s Rights has to some extent taken possession of the Daphne programme, which is the result of the initiative taken by the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and which to begin with was mainly directed towards the campaign against paedophilia.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Mrs Kestelijn‐Sierens, I should not like current events to result in this programme being redirected slightly, guaranteeing protection for women only and neglecting its other mission when every day children are the victims of unthinkable acts of cruelty. I therefore urge the Commission to continue to earmark a substantial proportion of the funds for important measures undertaken by organisations whose task is to search for children who have disappeared and support families who are victims of this type of tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would say to the House that rather than tearing each other apart for the sake of a small amount of funds, I wish that all the different parties could join together – not only today but also when we discuss the budget – in calling for a significant and substantial increase in funds for a purpose which is quite obviously first and foremost a humanitarian one.</p>

I should like to add ‘with admiration and dignity", as women represent 50 % of the world"s population and are responsible for the remaining 50 %.</p>
<p class="contents">In modern societies, a woman is called upon to perform many roles, as mother, wife, simple companion, scientist, worker, politician, and as a woman in the arts. Today a woman can claim these roles as her own and on an equal footing with men, with whom she can also share them. I believe that the European Union has made a significant contribution to bringing this about. The European Parliament especially has taken decisions to strengthen equal rights and equal opportunities legislation on behalf of the women who live in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet it is a sad fact that, even today in our modern and civilised societies, we see that prejudice still exists in relation to the position of women. The practical implementation and observance of the regulations we institute cannot always be taken for granted and is often difficult to establish, as discrimination is something which does not always happen directly. Let us not forget that there are countries where women and children still lack the most basic rights and where women do not know what is going to happen to them or how important their children are.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to remind you that, above all, women continue to be responsible for passing on our culture, our identity and our values from generation to generation. That is why modern society needs them more than ever, especially as a vehicle for culture and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want the legal protection of women"s rights to have any substance and if we want the opportunities and rights of women to be put into effect, we must ensure that they receive the support they need to enable them to fulfil their roles. Today more than ever, we must place greater emphasis on education, training and health and on allowing women to grow up with dignity. Women must be able to take advantage of their rights and to take on their responsibilities. They must be able to pass on the precious values our society needs today and to cross the threshold of the new millennium with faith in justice and in the freedom of mankind.</p>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are well aware that violence against women is not a public health problem, although as in the publicity against tobacco, we can say that violence and violent men seriously damage the lives and health of women and children.</p>
<p class="contents">Violent people are not sick people. We must make it quite clear that they are criminals. Nevertheless, we are now faced with a challenge that has been laid down by the European Commission: we must readapt the objectives of the Daphne programme to fit a different legal basis, namely the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I know just how much your personal commitment and efforts have allowed us to truly begin to cooperate in the fight against violence within the European Union. But I would like to ask you what effects you think the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam might have in the coming months in terms of our approach to combating violence. Will it mean that at a later date we will be able to modify the Daphne programme again or extend its scope? I am worried about this because as you said, despite the broad interpretation of the concept of health, the fact is that all references to cooperation or programmes concerning the trafficking in women have been removed from the programme, yet we know that this is a Community programme. I disagree with Mr Crowley"s defence of the principle of subsidiarity. The Community provides an added value in combating trafficking in women and children, the abuse of children and paedophilia, and this is important when the European Union has to act not only in the context of cooperation under the third pillar, but also in collaboration with NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Commissioner, I would like you to give us some reassurance about the broad interpretation of the concept of health and to tell us what effect the Treaty of Amsterdam might have, since I wonder whether it might not be better to wait until it enters into force.</p>

<p class="contents">It is vital that Europe should feel duty‐bound to take action concerning both general and sexual violence against women. All of us – all of our governments, the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council – have been striving over this past year to achieve a single currency and a single bank, to ensure that the euro is capable of holding its own against the excessively powerful dollar. We all strive to give financial matters pride of place; but we must try equally hard to ensure that the campaign against violence, particularly violence against women, becomes a cornerstone of European culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Mention has been made of Daphne and of pursuing new aims: I agree with what has been said here, but I would call for new and steadily increasing funds for the programmes and projects under Daphne relating to children and women. I must thank the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, for having mentioned in her speech the question of so‐called anti‐rape jeans. A tragi‐comical judgment handed down a month or so ago, in Italy, caused astonishment around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, provocatively, I am wearing jeans and displaying them for all to see, not to attract attention but because the Italian Supreme Court and Court of Appeal have declared that a woman wearing jeans cannot be raped. Jeans are a guarantee against rape.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not wish to judge the Court of Appeal, but to highlight a lack of culture. The Europe which we create must be one of culture! Let me quote an item from yesterday's Italian press, originally published in an Austrian newspaper: the miniskirt is dangerously provocative. In Austria, a woman in a miniskirt has been dismissed because of her attire. However, the problem is that everyone rushed to the defence not of the woman, but of the man who dismissed her, because apparently it was he who had been provoked and suffered sexual harassment. Mrs Gradin said that women must be protected; but we must also look after men wherever they need looking after, as men and as human beings.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Marinucci </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(IT) </span> Mr President, I shall speak later on the Hautala proposal, and I shall refrain from commenting now on 8 March. Instead I would turn to the Commissioner, Mrs Gradin, and begin by taking this opportunity to thank her for her hard work. I believe that Mrs Gradin's dedication to this topic – her strength, intelligence, good will and generosity – will go down in the annals of the European Union. She is without doubt responsible for the fact that, in recent years, there has been a series of actions aiming to overcome violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">On this point, I would ask that we take a positive view of the transition to Article 129, in that it confers much greater powers on Parliament. This House should theoretically be pleased, because progress might perhaps be more rapid at the end of the day. It remains to be seen, however, whether the programme will stay as before. I am all in favour of looking after men; indeed, I am convinced that only if we do so will they at last stop thinking that women can be bought, robbed and seized rather than being won over. I also agree to looking after women who have been the victims of violence and have suffered physical as well as psychological damage. But we are also committed to other actions under Daphne, and all I wish to know is whether the move from Article 235 to 129 will alter the content of this programme. That is precisely what we would not want.</p>

Without wishing to repeat what colleagues have said, if the European tide has been turned in this area, then we owe it largely to her.</p>
<p class="contents">I would echo what Mrs Marinucci said concerning the scope of the programme under Article 129. Let me give an example: in Italy, as elsewhere, women's organisations have for years supported, protected and housed women who have suffered violence, helping to reintegrate them socially. They have done so partly through refuges, where women can take shelter, along with their children, and can receive psychological and legal support as well as help in returning to work. In my view, if Article 129 really were restricted to health matters alone, it would greatly curtail the activities which are already under way and need to be extended. I therefore believe that, although we in Parliament certainly do have an important role under Article 129, since we can step in and bring matters to a rapid conclusion, we share Mrs Gradin's desire to see this programme up and running by early 2000. It really would be a shame and a retrograde step, in my opinion, if all the actions originally scheduled for Daphne could not be included in their entirety.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gradin, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I wish to thank everybody for a very interesting debate, and the Committee on Women's Rights for the support it has given to this campaign concerning violence against women, and also for the support for the Daphne programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have been concerned that we have had to change the legal base for Daphne. It must be said that we had a long debate in the Commission before we presented this programme to the Council and Parliament and we came to the conclusion that Article 235 would have been the best base. That is why we proposed it to both institutions. During the debate at least five countries – Germany, Britain, France, Denmark and Belgium – were very categorical that they could not accept Article 235. They wanted Article 129. In my view, it is better to get Daphne decided, and then after a year we can see whether the programme can be improved. Perhaps the programme is narrower than we had originally planned but let us get it started now, and then we can review the situation later.</p>
