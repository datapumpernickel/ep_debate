<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Marset Campos (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, thanks to its own process of consolidation, the European Union has an ever more important role and ever greater influence on the global stage. As part and parcel of this process of globalisation to include the East, the Mediterranean, North America and Africa, closer relations with other regional blocs are being forged. The agreement, which was recently reached with Mexico and to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Castañeda, attached considerable importance is a move in this direction. According to Mr Castañeda, this agreement, whereby his country is able to rely upon a positive input from Parliament and the European Union, will act as a kind of stimulus to Mexico to improve the conditions under which people live.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Latin America, special importance is attached to the Association Agreement with Mercosur – an agreement modelled on the Treaty of Rome as a response to the process of globalisation and as a means of improving Mercosur’s relations with North America.</p>
<p class="contents">This process began in 1995 and was made concrete in the Declaration from the First Summit between the Heads of State and Government of Latin America and the Caribbean and the European Union, held in Río de Janeiro from 25 to 29 June 1999. Since then, meetings with organised civil society have also been taking place. In this connection, it is to be regretted that the European Parliament nonetheless has no part to play in defining the mandate for the negotiation of agreements with third countries. True enough, the agreements give top priority to the commercial sphere and to economic development, but other considerations also have an important role to play: the fight against poverty, the promotion of cooperation and the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law and respect for human rights. This agreement was conceived as a transitional legal instrument between the third-generation agreements and the more broadly based interregional agreement which, at the same time, covers the political, economic and trade liberalisation dimensions.</p>
<p class="contents">The commitment signified by these agreements with Mercosur and Chile is therefore unique. The directives adopted by the General Affairs Council on 13 September 1999 are effective as from the date of the Summit I have just mentioned. However, we think that a number of changes need to be made. Bearing in mind, too, that the European Parliament represents the will of European society, which is not only a commercial and economic society but also a society full of concern for justice, fairness, solidarity, culture and the social dimension, Parliament hopes to use this report to introduce new directives expressly embodying the following requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the legal basis of the new agreement should consist of Article 310 (formerly Article 238) of the EC Treaty, together with the second sentence of the first paragraph of Article 300(2) and the second paragraph of Article 300(3). It is important to provide the agreement with a legal guarantee and to give expression to the fact that the negotiating parties do in actual fact have a whole legal tradition behind them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is necessary to include practical mechanisms for the provisions of the future that will enable the objectives proposed by the CFSP – international cooperation and the development of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights – to be based upon the principle of economic and social cohesion and to tend towards reducing imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new directives need to be based both upon international conventions – I am thinking of those concerning ethnic minorities and indigenous peoples, as important in Mercosur as in other countries – and upon agreements connected with the International Labour Organisation. In that way, monitoring mechanisms might be established, designed to improve the specific ways in which unions operate and workers are organised and providing not only for joint participation in the UN and other international bodies – something which would lend more importance to this agreement – but also for the existence of explicit mechanisms for dialogue in matters relating to the common European security and defence policy, as recommended recently by the Institute for European-Latin American Relations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to increase and improve the specific participation of civil society, as well as to examine the conditionality whereby it is assumed that this Agreement has to be subordinate to the World Trade Organisation despite the fact that both the European Union and Mercosur have enough of a solid reputation to reach practical agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also necessary to improve relations with other countries and, as far as is applicable, to eliminate the current division of the process into two phases. In order to achieve this, Parliament must be able to approve this report, which has been adopted unanimously by the Committee on Foreign Affairs following considerable help from the Commission’s Secretariat General. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If I could summarise this debate in just one point, I would say, Commissioner, that Parliament is using these reports to call for the negotiating directives to be revised. Why should it make such a request? Firstly, because it is inconceivable that negotiating directives should not mention the legal basis of the agreement. In the opinion of this Parliament, as Mr Marset Campos has already said, the only possible basis is Article 310 of the Association Agreements. This Parliament acknowledges that these are ‘mixed’ because of the subject matter – in which, that is to say, jurisdiction falls both to the Member States and the Community. Parliament nevertheless feels that the division of the negotiating process into two separate phases is discriminatory and should be corrected. The first of these phases, which has already begun, concerns general trade issues and the second, which will begin on 1 July, concerns negotiations on tariffs and services. I, however, feel that, in practical terms, it would not make a great deal of sense to request the directives to be amended just for this purpose, given the closeness of the date.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more serious, Mr President, is the inclusion of a clause making the conclusion of these agreements conditional on the completion of a new round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation. We are not sure that this round will take place and, if it does, when it will finish. This condition has not been imposed on any other country or bloc of countries and we in Parliament therefore feel, Commissioner, that this obstacle must be overcome. Parliament is therefore calling for a review of the current negotiating directives so that this anomaly can be eliminated and overcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to hear the Commission’s opinion on this matter, specifically on the connection between the conclusion of these agreements and the completion of the new round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">During the discussion of the report – in the drafting of which, Mr Patten, we enjoyed an excellent working relationship with the services of the Directorate-General for Latin America and those of the Mercosur and Chile division – we heard that one of your colleagues, Mr Lamy, who is responsible for trade relations, did not support the idea of revising the negotiating directives unless the Council accepted the idea first. Since this agreement is an agreement of political association, economic association and cooperation, which includes trade liberalisation, but in which political will must, and I think does, prevail, I should like to hear what impression the Commissioner responsible has of the political momentum of these negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add, Commissioner, that if this aspect of the political dialogue is to have any credibility, there is one essential requirement which must be respected: that of adapting our discourse to the reality of cooperation and of turning words into action so that we move beyond simply rhetorical declarations. Latin America needs support and opportunities, not handouts, and trade relations provide an excellent opportunity to use action to demonstrate political will.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the forthcoming Summit of Heads of State and Government of the European Union and Latin America, I would like these negotiations with Chile and Mercosur to have reached a sufficiently advanced stage and, if possible, to be concluded. I know that Chile and Mercosur are different cases and I wish to publicly request that each of these sets of negotiations be conducted on its own merits, something we requested in the reports that are to be voted on this morning. This must be done, however, with the aim of ensuring that the negotiations have reached an advanced stage or have been concluded with a view to this Summit, for which we must provide ample material over the next six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament feels, and has expressed this view on numerous occasions, that the commitments given at the Madrid Summit and these agreements are an urgent imperative and a mark of the European Union’s renewed belief in Latin America. The comments that I have just made about trade apply just as much to cooperation, because even if we acknowledge the size of the contribution we have made to the region, which in absolute terms adds up to a sizeable amount, we feel that there is, to some extent, a degree of unjustified discrimination against the subcontinent compared with the treatment of other parts of the world. I do not think that we can address new priorities with the same resources: the priorities designated by these agreements, such as the renewal of the agreements with the Andean Pact and with Central America and the priorities arising from the Rio Summit. At this time, therefore, before the budget is drafted and presented, and although I understand that the pressures on our budget are great on the eve of the introduction of the euro, I would ask the Commissioner responsible to give an indication, to give a sign different to the one given in last year’s draft budget for the region, with the aim of making the forthcoming Madrid Summit more productive.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in Parliament, one of the two branches of budgetary authority, we too are fully aware of the difficulties involved in this exercise, but although in recent budgetary debates we have been able to show that the European Parliament remains supportive of Latin America, it is my view, and I repeat, that significant progress must be made on these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I wish to conclude by expressing my thanks to Mr Patten’s staff for their cooperation in drafting this report, for the exemplary working relationship we have enjoyed with our colleagues in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, as Mr Marset Campos stated, and also for the support provided by the services of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many thanks to both of them for their detailed explanation, first here in the House and secondly in their reports. The association agreements with Chile and also of course with Mercosur are valued highly by the European Union. Therefore we support the Commission in its negotiations and also regret of course that the European Parliament is not yet formally involved in the definition of negotiating mandates. Turning to the matter in hand itself, and I speak now on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we feel that the free trade area which we wish to establish with both Chile and Mercosur must conform to WTO rules. Secondly, we do not want to damage the regional economic and trade relations between Chile and her neighbouring countries but rather to encourage these relations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a matter of urgency, a point also emphasised by Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra. We do not want to wait until the round of WTO negotiations has been concluded. Let me remind you as well that the new Bush administration in America has already announced its intention to make the Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) a main focus of its external relations. The question then immediately arises: Do we want to leave Latin America to the United States, in a kind of division of tasks, whereby the United States takes care of Latin America and Europe takes care of Eastern Europe, or do we want some kind of presence in Latin America? I feel that it would be neither in our interest nor in the interest of Latin Americans if the world were divided into two in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">When all is said and done, I believe that there should be a regulation which promotes the integration of the South American continent and also takes account of the historic links between Europe and Latin America. I would also like to say, as regards our policy on Latin America in general, that I urge the Commission, the Council and also us here in Parliament, to give Latin America a higher profile in our external relations and in our debates.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, and I must once again mention this here, we no longer have at our disposal as important an instrument as Irela, the Institute for European and Latin American relations, which provided great assistance in the past, even occasionally when dealing with more delicate matters. This is now regrettably as dead as a doornail.</p>
<p class="contents">I would incidentally like to give an example of just how important this institute was in Latin America. Only recently, a member of the Irela supervisory board, Celso Lafer, was appointed Brazil’s foreign minister. This then shows what a high profile we gave previously to our relations with Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would ask the Commission, together with Parliament, to look for a solution to enable a sensible replacement regulation to be found and to enable us to have at our disposal an instrument that can give these historic and important relations with Latin America the profile they deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Point 2 should end with the initials GATT. The subsequent phrase appeared in the draft statement but was deleted in the rush to prepare the final version, which I had to complete in just 24 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to the text before us, I would like to refer to the commercial aspects of the association agreement between the European Union and Mercosur. It will bring together almost 600 million consumers, that is, about 10% of the global population. In 1998, the only year for which statistics are available, the volume of trade between us amounted to EUR 42 000. A 125% increase has been recorded over the last eight years, with a European Union surplus of EUR 6 400 million.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth pointing out in this connection that the European Union is Mercosur’s main trading partner, five points ahead of the United States. It is also the main supplier to the area. Furthermore, if we look back in time we find that European countries have always made their presence felt most strongly in this part of Latin America, doubtless as a result of the special historical and cultural ties between us.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement is therefore extremely important. It is unprecedented at global level, enabling the only two subregions in the world who have created common markets to form an association for commercial purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to express my support for this interregional association agreement, which could be a milestone in the history of world trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Díez González (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, in the European Parliament’s resolution dated 14 December 2000 concerning the indictment of General Pinochet and the consolidation of democracy in Chile we stated clearly that the best way for the European Union to support the process of consolidating democracy in Chile was through an ambitious agreement on political reconciliation and economic association and cooperation. Particular emphasis was to be laid on the human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should congratulate ourselves on the speed, consistency and high degree of consensus with which Parliament, through the Committee on Foreign Affairs, has risen to this challenge. The proposals have already been outlined by both rapporteurs. I therefore only wish to highlight two points. Firstly, as previously mentioned, the crucial importance of the legal basis of the new association agreement for the Committee on Foreign Affairs. This basis must be Article 310 of the Treaty. A number of reasons for this have already been given, notably that this legal basis guarantees Parliament’s assent.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I must stress that the Committee on Foreign Affairs feels it is crucially important that the conclusion of these agreements should not be conditional on the outcome of the World Trade Organisation round. On this point, perhaps Commissioner Patten could let us know his views as to how the differences over agriculture might be overcome, particularly as regards Mercosur.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of these two recommendations, I should also like to highlight how the Committee on Foreign Affairs has contrived to imbue both proposals with a markedly political spirit. This is doubtless the result of the committee’s composition and outlook. Issues relating to foreign affairs and cooperation have been emphasised over and above the tendency to stress the importance of economic and trade relations. The latter are no less important but must not dominate.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fully aware that whatever the pace of negotiations, strengthening the political nature of our relations with Mercosur and also the process of integration could impact on Chile. This might serve to counter the influence of the United States in political, economic and commercial relations with Chile, and also the plan to relaunch the American Free Trade Agreement. We would therefore be well advised to carefully monitor any action the new United States administration might take in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to congratulate the Commission and Mr Patten for keeping faith with his predecessor, Mr Marín. They have shown great loyalty and responsibility – I would term it political responsibility – in being true to the outline of the initiative launched by him.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to put a question to Mr Patten, though he has just left. He is well aware of the importance of the nature of the parliamentary cooperation to be set up between Chile, Mercosur and the European Parliament for the institutional development of the agreements. I should like to let him know in advance that like many other members of the Committee on Foreign Affairs I favour a model along the lines of that set up under the Europe Agreements. That model is based on joint parliamentary committees with a view to improving the current system of delegations. I would like to know what the Commission and Mr Patten’s views on the matter are. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In both cases, as the two rapporteurs point out in their respective explanatory statements, these new Association Agreements with Chile and Mercosur currently represent the highest priority of the Union’s external policy towards Latin America. The extent of the economic relations between the European Union and these countries, the need to strengthen the political role of the European Union as an autonomous and influential actor on the world stage to counter the preponderant influence of the United States, the concrete support given by the Union to all initiatives aiming at strengthening democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights in South America means that we cannot go back on this move towards a new phase with regard to the transitional framework agreement that came into force in 1995 for Mercosur and 1999 for Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, as the only democratically elected institution, cannot confine itself to supplying a mere opinion; in the context of the forthcoming institutional reform, this House must gain a more incisive role by obtaining an explicit assent. So this is a significant moment, Mr President, a moment not to be wasted. As chair of the delegation for relations with South America and Mercosur, I must draw your attention to this, so that Europe and South America may continue their efforts to reach a solution, irrespective of the conclusions of the multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, Europe still has within its reach the chance to build a privileged relationship with the Mercosur countries and Chile, a relationship ratifying a fresh start in our dealings with this land which, for so many reasons, is close to our own continent, a land in which we can still play a leading part. So we must give a new boost to these global Association Agreements, which must be concluded without wasting any more precious time, and which – it is extremely important to emphasise this – must not have just economic and commercial connotations, even though these are extremely important, but must include political and development cooperation aspects. These are the features which mark out what is different about Europe, our heritage, of which we are duly proud and which we cannot and must not abandon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, those of us who have recently visited the area in question – I myself have just returned from Argentina and Chile – certainly wish to convey how very sceptically the European Union’s involvement in relations with Latin America is perceived. These relations are quite inadequate, and scepticism is particularly marked in the field of the social economy of small businesses and trade unions. I had the opportunity to discuss the situation with them just this week in Argentina and Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot but agree in principle with the report being debated today. In general I also support everything aimed at increasing economic and trade relations with the countries in the area. In addition, I am in favour of the involvement of civil society in this and other aspects of the association agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, this support is tinged with criticism. Although reference has been made – for instance by Mr Marset – to international agreements on ethnic minorities, we believe that the fact that our group’s amendments have not been acted on in this and other areas is a serious shortcoming. True, progress has been made in the field of workers’ rights, incorporating ILO conventions. However, there has been no reference to the code of conduct for multinational companies adopted in the OECD. It has been argued that that is not Europe whereas in fact European companies are setting up in the countries concerned. No environmental measures have been adopted either. Furthermore, the new negotiating mandate does not include the specific references we had requested to structured and institutionalised involvement of civil society in this political dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore endorse in principle what has been said in today’s debate on the association agreements. However, we wish to reiterate our criticism of other aspects we consider essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These are, firstly, the agreement between the European Union and Mercosur, and secondly, the agreement with Chile. I wish to point out that the agreement with Mercosur may constitute the first agreement in the world between two customs unions. Parliament must therefore give due recognition to the importance of these agreements, not only because they will contribute towards improving relations between the European Union, its Member States and the countries of the southern cone of the American continent, but also because they will foster greater balance in the development of partnerships for cooperation in Latin America. This will act as a counterbalance to the growing influence in the region of the North American Free Trade Area movement (NAFTA). From this point of view, these agreements are strategically important and deserve our protection at a political level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make two additional observations, Mr President. The first is that I, like the rapporteurs, feel that the Council’s decision to make the signing of the agreements dependent on the conclusion of the WTO negotiations is a negative one. I am pleased, however, to note that Portugal and Spain agreed, at the recent Luso-Hispanic Summit in Sintra, to unite their efforts to separate the agreements from the conclusion of the WTO round of negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of my second comment is to state that the mandate for negotiations considers both the political and cooperation approaches in addition to the trade aspect, which is to be expected. I would not be surprised – and incidentally I am not opposed to this – if the agreements consequently took on the form of association agreements, or even if the Council clearly defined the legal basis of this mandate, which would determine the nature of these agreements. This is not an insignificant question, particularly insofar as it determines the European Parliament having more or less power to act with regard to the final content of the agreements, as the rapporteurs have made quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we should remember that the national parliaments in the Member States will still have to ratify these agreements, thereby giving them the necessary democratic legitimacy. Furthermore, to the best of my knowledge, no agreement between the European Union and third countries has to date failed to be signed because the legal framework implemented in a given case has been inadequate. We should not, therefore, create legal obstacles where they do not exist. Our greatest concern should be that we sign agreements that are effective and mutually advantageous to the Union, to the Member States and to the communities for which they are designed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the US administration has made it known several times that relations with South America will be one of the key points of their foreign policy, improved cooperation between the EU and the Latin American countries has become a necessity for the European Union, not only economically but also in terms of world politics. Hence, the recommendations specified here quite rightly not only contain conditions for improved economic cooperation but attempt to define the problem in terms of a global programme for the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the recommendations listed in point 2, i.e. the encouragement of the development and consolidation of democracy and the rule of law as well as respect for human rights and the reduction of inequalities between sectors of society and within regions, are just as important as the expansion of trade. The sphere of ‘political dialogue’ needs perhaps to be defined more accurately or, due to the heavily hierarchically structured society which still exists in South America, large sections of the populations will remain excluded from this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the EU has good prospects with South America, perhaps in direct competition with the United States, though without repeating the mistakes made by the Americans who have justifiably in past decades repeatedly been accused in their relations with South American countries of too often purely defending the interests of power politics regardless of current democratic developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They constitute a particularly important set of documents. Together with the agreement signed with Mexico, they are enabling us to update, relaunch and move forward relations between the European Union and a group of states. The latter represent a very significant part of Latin America from the demographic, economic and political point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">This has a particular bearing on economics and trade. We should take into account that the other party we are dealing with ranks fourth in the world in these fields. It also has great potential for growth. I do, however, believe that the cooperation and political coordination which ought to be set up on the basis of these agreements are no less important. Close political links with Latin America have always been a priority for Spaniards. Nevertheless, I feel that it should be obvious to any European that the continent in question constitutes an entity which, given its history, culture and current state of development, is far closer to what is understood by Europe. In particular, it is close to the European Union venture. The Latin Americans are the closest to us as regards values and democratic aspirations. No other group shares our commitment to strive for social justice and national dignity to the same extent. The latter is, however, tempered by many decades of work towards supranational integration and responsible and coordinated involvement at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">These agreements pave the way for ever closer political cooperation between Europe and Latin America. Perhaps we shall then be in a better position to set our own course. In recent decades both Europe and Latin America have been heavily influenced by our common uncle. For them, he lives just north of the Rio Grande. For us, he is just across the Atlantic.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between Europe and Latin America should allow us to make sound progress towards a world order based on democracy and solidarity. This is necessary to ensure world peace. In the light of globalisation, it is also essential for the survival and consolidation of democracy, the rule of law and the social progress we desire for all our people.</p>
<p class="contents">This vision of our relations with Latin America is complementary to and coherent with the provisions of the Cotonou Convention affecting the African, Caribbean and Pacific community signed recently.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think we are on the way to fleshing out a key chapter of what the European Union’s common foreign and cooperation policy ought to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must avoid thinking of this agreement simply as a free trade agreement, which is an almost natural tendency for something that was once just an economic union; today, however, it would be an oversimplification, dangerously favouring just a small elite and not the peoples involved, to whom we wish to propose a global association agreement which in fact has its own political dimension and its own momentum in the processes of cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Latin America, the Mercosur countries and Chile are not just the fourth-largest trading bloc: they are also a continent in which the highest priorities of the European Union’s foreign policy can be fulfilled, and here I am thinking of the fight against poverty, the consolidation of democracy, the fight for human rights and workers’ rights. In its global and political dimensions, this Association Agreement can make a valuable contribution. In this context, it seems deplorable that in the Council’s mandate to the Commission there is no indication of the legal basis of our Association Agreement. We believe it is a fundamental agreement not only for attributing competence, autonomy and responsibility to the European Union’s foreign policy, but especially for managing, at last, to make up our great disadvantage in initiative towards Latin America compared with the United States, for asserting our capacity for political initiative and our competence in our foreign policy towards Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">A last point: we must enhance and provide for the participation of civil society. I see civil society not as a trinket, something mundane, a purely aesthetic necessity; I see it as a real, genuine resource in democratic terms, to which Parliament wants to give a say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are clearly entering a crucial moment in the negotiations for association agreements with Chile and Mercosur. The negotiations are well on track. We have had three negotiating rounds, part of the last of which I attended myself. It was a considerable success. Preparations for the fourth round of negotiations to be held in the second fortnight of March are in full swing. It is fair to say that after one and a half years of negotiations, we are approaching the most intensive phase. Political dialogue, cooperation and trade issues figure very high on the agenda of the next session. Negotiating texts have been exchanged. Work has even started on the preparation of the tariff and services negotiations, including agriculture, which are going to begin in July.</p>
<p class="contents">This has all been possible thanks to our serious commitment to these negotiations. No-one doubts that the Commission wishes to do all we can to strengthen ties with Mercosur and Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">During the course of this year I want to accelerate these negotiations. Much progress has already been made in the political and cooperation fields but major progress is still needed on the trade side. I hope we will see a leap forward on non-tariff barriers and business facilitation in March. In July, we expect progress with negotiating offers on both tariffs and services.</p>
<p class="contents">As my honourable friend pointed out earlier, the second European Union – Latin-America Summit will take place in Madrid in Spring next year. It is still too early to speculate on what concrete progress we should expect by then but it is always clear, as the honourable gentleman said earlier, that by the time of the summit, negotiations must have established a critical mass. This critical mass should be sufficient in some areas to finish discussions. It should also be possible in other areas to conclude negotiations as soon after that as reasonably possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is to attain a high and ambitious level of political and commercial interaction with Mercosur and Chile. As Parliament knows, no sector is excluded from the negotiations. Our main guidelines are achieving a strategic political partnership, strengthened cooperation, and a WTO-plus deal on the trade side.</p>
<p class="contents">It is no secret that while Chile fully shares this comprehensive approach, Mercosur has a rather more limited objective, aiming primarily for greater market access in agriculture. We should continue to insist on a comprehensive global and balanced agreement which aims at a deeper political and cooperation relationship as well as wide and far-reaching trade liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The two reports that we are discussing are both comprehensive and extremely useful. They make a number of sound recommendations – most of these are based on the possibility of modifying the current negotiating mandate provided by the Council. That may be desirable at some point over the coming year but, at that this point in time, we are naturally focused on achieving successful rounds of negotiations in March and July rather than on stopping the discussions and going back to the drawing board with the Council. We had a full internal debate on this two or three years ago. At present, the Commission is keen to get down to work and do the job it was instructed to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me just make a few concrete comments as regards the specific recommendations. First the matter of the legal base. The final agreement will be an association agreement not a mere trade deal. Our future strategic partnership goes well beyond trade. However our legal advisers tell me that the exact articles for the legal base could only be determined at the end of the negotiations. I agree with this opinion. For the time being we only have the outline of agreement. We need to wait for the final result, as we have done in other similar negotiations, before we look at our own legal base.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of democracy, the rule of law, respect of human rights and good governance. These are all basis tenants of our negotiating position and they are the cornerstone of the agreement that we want to reach. These issues have already been discussed during the third round in Brasilia and Santiago and we have reached consensus with Mercosur and Chile on them. I am personally committed to ensuring that these essential elements underpin our future association agreements with Mercosur and Chile.</p>
<p class="contents">Then labour rights. These are also an integral part of the negotiations. They are currently being discussed in view of the fourth round in March. We need to ensure that labour rights and greater prosperity advance hand-in-hand. Greater prosperity should help lead to a deepening of democracy and that should mean greater respect for basic rights, including of course labour rights. So we support an approach in the association agreement which assures labour rights through cooperation and promotion of the relevant ILO Conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">I come to greater political cooperation including security. This was already established during the third round in Brasilia and Santiago. We will work together for the promotion of peace and international security on the basis, of course, of our own internal rules and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Civil society was mentioned in the reports and by a number of speakers. Transparency and accountability are essential. Civil society should be part of the agreement. We have already agreed on proposals during the third round to include civil society in the institutional framework of the agreement. In addition, the Commission organised a successful conference with civil society last October to promote discussions on the negotiations. We have also created a website in August of last year which provides a full breakdown on the negotiations for the general public. So as the House can see we are making a real effort to enhance the transparency of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members and the reports themselves refer to the possibility of eliminating the link to the proposed new WTO round. I certainly do not rule out this possibility but this will depend first of all on whether we have a new WTO round at all. We obviously hope that happens, and the sooner the better, but we have not yet got that proposal off the ground. It depends as well on the progress we achieve in future negotiating rounds with Mercosur and Chile. We might consider this option if sufficient and substantial progress is made. It is suggested that we should eliminate the two-phased negotiating approach. The House will know as well as I do that this approach was the result of a compromise solution between Ministers during the General Affairs Council of June 1999 in Luxembourg. This compromise formula broke the deadlock in Council and opened the door to the approval of the negotiating directives.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much appreciate Parliament’s support on this important issue but it is presently more a matter of principle than practice. I am afraid we are now too far into the process to turn back. We only have four months more to go and only one negotiating round until July when the second negotiating phase is meant to start. So I think we should get on with the job and prepare meaningful global negotiations from July onwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by underlining once again that the Commission is absolutely committed to successful negotiations with Mercosur and Chile. We are determined to get on with the job and make as much progress as possible. Negotiations are in full swing. Preparations for the next round are on track. With or without changes in the mandate, the Commission is working to make these negotiations a success as quickly as possible. I hope I can count on Parliament’s support to that end.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, can I refer to two questions which I received during the debate. First of all, Mrs Díez González asked me a question. I am afraid I left the Chamber for about 60 seconds of her speech. I will not go into the details as to why, but if I tell the House that I am present in Parliament the whole of the morning she will perhaps appreciate why I needed 60 seconds outside the chamber, but I can respond very positively to her remark. She asked whether there would be a joint interparliamentary committee. The Commission strongly believes that there should be. We can respond very favourably to the honourable lady’s request and we will be discussing exactly the mechanism that we can use shortly with Mercosur and Chile. So we can give a very positive response to that important proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the honourable gentleman Mr Knörr Borràs, asked me about the OECD Code. We cannot oblige countries that are not members of the OECD to follow the OECD Code. I understand the importance of the point he raised but we cannot make it obligatory for non-OECD members to follow the OECD Code. I repeat I hope that we can count on Parliament’s support in the weeks and months ahead, and I am sure that the close attention being shown in this debate underlines the fact that we will able to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
