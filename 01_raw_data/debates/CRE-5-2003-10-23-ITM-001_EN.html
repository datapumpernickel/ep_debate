On Monday, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) published its new scientific recommendation for 2004 and has now, unfortunately, been obliged to confirm the disastrous state that cod stocks are in, including in the waters to the west of Scotland, in the eastern English Channel, in the Skagerrak and in the Kattegat.</p>
<p class="contents">ICES has now advised that fishing for these four stocks be closed down. This, of course, puts us in a massive dilemma. Can we justify basing our decision solely on ICES’ argument in favour of replenishing stocks, which would result in our having to prohibit not only fishing for cod, but also for a whole range of other fish, and, in due course, in thousands of fishermen facing oblivion? Or could we find a way out by improving our plans for stock recovery, so that, although stocks would recover more slowly and would also involve some elements of uncertainty, fewer fishermen would be forced to abandon their trade? This is certainly a difficult decision, but it is one we will have to take before we can adopt any kind of plan to replenish cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">The outline that we are debating today is a general one, and serves as a good basis for a cod stock recovery plan that would secure us the chance to revert to normal management conditions. It starts by identifying the lower limit below which scientists regard a stock as threatened with collapse. The plan contains formulae for calculating total allowable catches (TAC) on the basis of scientific estimates of current stocks. If the stock is larger than the lower limit, the TAC will be set in such a way that the stock can increase by 30% in the following year. It introduces limitations on the fishing effort, allocated to the Member States in proportion to their share in the total allowable catch of cod. It also contains measures to improve the monitoring and control of the vessels whose fishing effort is subject to management measures; these include provisions on prior notification and on the requirement to land cod in designated ports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stihler (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the issue of cod stock recovery is an important one. It affects not only my own country of Scotland, but also the rest of the UK, Ireland and Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the International Council for Exploration of the Seas (ICES) warned us that young North Sea cod measured in early 2003 were at their lowest level in 20 years. Worries over repeating what happened in Newfoundland, where the cod never returned, haunt us all, and the ICES advice is stark: 'These cod stocks are at such a low level that we have had to resort to recommending zero catches as a final line in the sand'. Zero catches means no fishing in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal sets out a package of measures which, if followed, is believed to allow the safe recovery of this valuable stock within five to ten years. The Commission is not alone in this objective. Yesterday's cod recovery proposal from the Scottish Fishermen's Federation also stated that: 'restoring cod to its historic level of abundance remains an important objective for fishermen, since a revitalised cod fishery would transform the economics of the whole demersal fishery'.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal attempts to achieve an absolute minimum size of stock, sets guidelines for setting total allowable catches (TACs), introduces fishing limitation through Kilowatt days and deals with the monitoring, inspection and control side of fisheries management</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have tried to say to the Commission that all action must be taken to recover stocks. We cannot use a one-size-fits-all approach across the areas covered by the plan. We need a flexible approach based on scientific assessment allowing fishing to continue for other species. Where it can be proved that fishing for other species in a particular area does not adversely affect cod recovery, fisheries should continue to be allowed and the concept of spatial management needs to be fully investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">On research, we need to look seriously at the interaction of cod and other commercial fish species such as haddock and whiting. This evidence should involve fishermen as well as scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of industrial fisheries also requires a thorough investigation. We constantly receive mixed messages on this issue and we need clarity. Regional advisory councils are vital to the future of a sustainable EU fishing policy. If we are going to be successful in our objectives of cod recovery, we must work with fishermen. I was happy to see this week's Commission proposal providing a blueprint for these regional advisory councils and how they would work, with two thirds of the membership of these new organisations coming from those active in the fisheries sector. I hope we will be able to improve dialogue and cooperation between all those concerned in order to secure a sustainable future for our industry.</p>
<p class="contents">On the socio-economic impact of these measures, the Commission's proposal does not go far enough. Some of the communities most directly affected are in remote areas truly on the periphery of the European Union. Parliament has already recognised the importance of the socio-economic issues in its resolution of March 2003. To be fair, so too have some of the Member States. The Scottish Executive has given GBP 50 million, with GBP 40 million for decommissioning and GBP 10 million for the direct socio-economic impact. However, we have to be very clear that it is up to national and regional authorities to take up the possibilities available to them in assisting the sector during this difficult time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see Member States carrying out socio-economic impact assessments on the recovery plan. On the basis of these reports, we would better be able to assess the problems and to mitigate any negative effects. I would like to see Member States having these in place one year after the implementation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On fishing effort limitation, the principle of proportionality must apply. The reference period used must take into consideration the pain the industry has already suffered through any decommissioning process. On inspection control, we need to extend satellite vessel monitoring, as suggested by the House of Lords report of May 2003. It seems a sensible measure and I welcome the fact that the Commission intends to come forward with a separate proposal on satellite monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the revised cod recovery plan will be painful for the fishing industry and dependent communities. There is no point inflicting a lesser degree of pain or indeed any suffering at all if the measures implemented do not bring about the desired result. Yet, if stock recovery is not achieved, the outcome will be increased socio-economic hardship in any event. Successful recovery of the stock must be the priority. What is needed is a package of measures which is both effective and minimises the pain to the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It means that the Commission is complying with its commitments under the common fisheries policy. I also appreciate Mrs Stihler’s work and her report, together with the cooperation that she and I have enjoyed, in my case as draftsman<span class="bold"> </span>of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That committee’s amendment according to which the precautionary principle would lead to drastic measures being taken and to the Member States having the opportunity to take measures in addition to the common ones in order to protect and preserve stocks has been adopted by the Committee on Fisheries, and that is something I am pleased about. As we heard earlier, the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) will tomorrow present its annual report on the fish stocks in our oceans. Again, a total moratorium is recommended, which should make the doubters realise that measures really must be taken. We know that the Council, which can no longer put its head in the sand, must take action and adopt this plan. It is the fourth version that the Commission is presenting to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though I am satisfied with the Commission’s proposal and believe that it is a move in the right direction, I should also like to have seen the Baltic Sea included, because we know that cod stocks are just as threatened there. The International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission has, moreover, come up with further plans, which sounded quite good in October. I therefore withdrew my amendments concerning the Baltic Sea in the Committee on Fisheries. At a later meeting in October, the International Baltic Sea Fishery Commission deviated from its own principles concerning what should be done. It is completely ignoring the scientific advice and states that the catch is 45% larger than what international advisers claim. That is very serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Not taking the measures recommended by the international advisers is a waste of fisheries resources. The advisers consist of 1 600 researchers from 19 countries, and not listening to these researchers constitutes a waste of what could be flourishing fishing communities and a flourishing industry. In the Baltic Sea, we could have fished three times as much as we are doing today. Take a genuinely sound decision here in the House now, as I hope will also be done by the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have heard once again, the ICES has stated that cod stocks are in such a dire state of collapse that it is recommending the complete closure of the cod fishery in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the West of Scotland. It claims that years of stringent conservation measures have failed to rebuild stocks and that only the total shutdown of these fishing grounds will enable any meaningful recovery.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we know from bitter experience, that when the scientists once again call for the complete closure of the cod fishery, they also mean the virtual closure of the haddock, whiting, plaice and prawn fisheries, where cod is caught as a by-catch. Let me say this now to Commissioner Fischler and say it very clearly, because if there are any more cuts at the December Council meeting this year, it will spell the end of the UK white fish fleet. And I do not mean any more drastic cuts like last year, I mean any more cuts at all. The two previous massive decommissioning rounds have reduced the British white fish fleet by around 40%. The harbour workers and ancillary staff who rely on the white fish fleet for a living are now teetering on the brink of bankruptcy. Any further cuts will be fatal. It would mean that, even if cod stocks ever do recover, there will be no UK fishermen there to catch them.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to attack the scientists. There is nothing to be gained from shooting the messenger, but this most recent ICES report once again highlights the vital importance of listening to the advice of the fishermen as well as to the boffins. Last year scientists told us that haddock stocks were dwindling. The fishermen said this was rubbish. Now the scientists agree that there are an estimated 400 000 tonnes of haddock spawning stock biomass in the North Sea. So who is right?</p>
<p class="contents">Could I in addition say that it appears the scientists are not listening to each other when arriving at their grand conclusions. According to new scientific research from the respected Sir Alistair Hardy Foundation in Plymouth, which has been monitoring the North Sea for the last 70 years, stocks of cold water plankton, on which cod larvae feed, have been driven hundreds of miles to the north by an unprecedented rise in water temperatures. This perhaps explains why there is a great abundance of cod being caught around the Faeroes, Iceland and Norway, but none left in the North Sea. So for heaven's sake, let us start listening to the fishermen as well as the scientists. The fishermen have a vested commercial interest in seeing cod stocks recover. That is the only way we are going to get a decent living for our fishermen in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miguélez Ramos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the Group of the Party of European Socialists is glad that finally the Commission, in accordance with Parliament’s request, is presenting a specific recovery plan for cod, separate from the recovery plan for hake, since, as we have always maintained, the situations of the respective stocks differ considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, points out, for three years the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has been saying that the cod populations in the North Sea and off the west of Scotland are in serious danger of total collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group calls on the Commission to promote the best possible scientific opinions in order to provide knowledge at all times of the state of each resource in each fishing ground so that, on the basis of these rigorous scientific opinions, we can implement recovery plans, which may or may not involve drastic measures which – we must not forget – always lead to the scrapping of ships, unemployment for fishermen and other workers dependent on the fishing sector, and furthermore represent a serious blow for those European regions most dependent on fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that the precautionary approach must be a residual criterion to be taken into account only when reliable and safe scientific opinions are not available, but under no circumstances must it replace these scientific opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing communities, as Mr Stevenson said a moment ago, demand a clear position, on the part of both the Commission and Parliament, in favour of prior, safe and well-founded scientific opinions, which take account of the sector’s opinions and which, as well as the state of resources, calculate and evaluate the socio-economic consequences of the conservation measures, and we have been asking the Commission for this for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Over-fishing is a determining factor, but it is not the only cause of the problem of scarcity of resources. Knowing the causes is essential if we want the recovery plans – this plan for cod and other future ones – to achieve their objectives, since if we restrict ourselves to reducing catches without tackling causes other than over-fishing – and I would mention the disruption of the food chain or sea pollution – we will perhaps find that the years will have passed and fish populations will not have increased.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ascertain the effects on the cod populations in the Irish Sea and the North Sea of the extraction of more than a million tonnes of fish of species other than cod, but which are, however, a source of food for cod. We also need to know the impact of industrial fishing on other populations of white fish, because that may perhaps provide the key to explaining the decline of cod and hake. We want the Commission to investigate the causes of this collapse of the species. We support the idea of a recovery plan which makes it possible to re-establish the stock and my group therefore supports the idea that the highest annual change, upwards or downwards, in any total allowable catch (TAC), should not exceed 15% after the first year of application of the recovery plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would say that Mrs Stihler's very clear and comprehensive report improves on the Commission's proposal in three major respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it introduces greater flexibility by allowing amendments to the geographical areas covered and by providing for additional Kilowatt days in response to appropriate technical measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it calls for certain reports. These are variously on the effects of industrial fishing, on the socio-economic impact of the regulation and on how far the regulation itself is achieving its objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it seeks the close involvement of regional advisory councils. The Commission's recent announcement of its proposal for establishing such bodies is welcome and we look forward to speedy progress in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures, together with the emphasis on constraints on fishing effort being proportionate between the Member States and on improved satellite monitoring, are essential if our beleaguered fishing communities are to engage with the regulation in any positive way. We must, however, look beyond the regulation to other means of helping cod recovery and of moving to sustainable fisheries overall.</p>
<p class="contents">The Scottish Fishermen's Federation's proposals for spatial management deserve serious consideration in this regard. Although the Scots are hardest hit, the impact is much wider, including the Irish, Danish and the Dutch, and we can learn from each other. One example is the self-monitoring currently practised by the latter. This again goes to show just how important a role regional advisory councils can play.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the House will support this report, which seeks to make the regulation far less of a blunt instrument than that fashioned by the original proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been clear now for many years that cod needs to recover from the excessive pressures put on it by modern-day fishing. Like many other species, stocks are far below sustainable levels, and this has led to massive socio-economic problems in coastal communities.</p>
<p class="contents">People are losing sight of the point here and putting the cart before the horse. The socio-economic problems have arisen from an ecological problem. If you tackle that you are tackling the socio-economic problems, instead of going at it in the opposite direction. There has been over-fishing for many years because of the TACs being set too high, and, basically scientific advice has not been followed. The Council has asked for a proposal for a recovery plan, which the Commission proposed in 2001, but the Council still does not seem to have the courage to adopt it. This is the fourth attempt.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has many good ideas including: outlining conditions under which fishing can be permitted; rules for deciding about fishing, given various levels of stock abundance and also attempts to improve control and surveillance requirements and an initial management of the effort.</p>
<p class="contents">The ICES press release of Monday, which Mrs Stihler has already mentioned, shows that stocks are in grave danger. This is a clear illustration of the danger of setting excessively high quotas, but this has been going on for years and it is still continuing. Last year, several TACs were set higher than ICES advised. The extreme example is the Irish Sea, with TACs set on average 28% above scientific advice over the past ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it any wonder that stocks are actually in trouble? ICES talks of drawing a line in the sand, but ministers and industry and many of the politicians even seem to be burying their heads in the sands, and this is the problem. Ministers actually have to move away from this Luddite position of ignoring scientific advice and take the scientific advice on board.</p>
<p class="contents">It is claimed that the common fisheries policy is getting on to a sustainable basis as a result of the reform of 2002. There have been some advances, such as better provision for control with improved cooperation among Member States and the possibility of effort limitation, in addition to classic limits on the amount of fish caught and recognition of the precautionary approach which is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not all good. The MAGPs, which we will come back to later today, have disappeared and there is no further requirement for reduction. This all sounds good on paper but it depends entirely on the political will to implement. The Commission is making a sincere effort to improve things, and the Greens will, as usual, support the Commission. However, there is a crucial level for the survival of the stocks. But in the Irish Sea the Commission's proposal would allow fishing below a stock level of 6000 tonnes, whereas ICES is now advising closure until stocks reach that level. It is vital that the Commission reflects ICES advice when recommending TACs for the next year on these stocks. We can no longer ignore ICES. Mrs Stihler has mentioned the situation in Canada. That will happen here if we do not take a progressive position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the draft of the future treaty contains no separate provisions relating specifically to the CFP. In the conclusions of the Convention, fisheries policy has been downgraded to being a mere accessory of the common agricultural policy, instead of being openly acknowledged as having a distinct and separate existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask all my colleagues in this House to impress on their national governments the need to find a formula to rectify this, by defining the specific objectives of the common fisheries policy in the final version of the future treaty. This is something that will not unravel anything, nor will it upset balances in the final outcome. There is still time for this to be done. 'Where there is a will there is a way'.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mrs Stihler on her excellent report, which supports the main thrust of the Commission's plans, as would I or anyone who has the slightest interest in conservation. Like Mrs Stihler, however, I believe there must be greater flexibility. There must be far greater local participation in these decisions. Member States and regional advisory councils must be able to propose alterations both to the geographical scope of the plan and the exact arrangements designed to reduce fishing efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Commission: questions will be asked and answers sought if this recovery programme is used as some form of covert operation to introduce a secondary decommissioning programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, will you please confirm to this House this morning that you will be proposing adequate compensation to offset some of the socio-economic effects of this proposal?

The question is how.</p>
<p class="contents">In its definitive recovery plan for cod, the Commission introduces an effort limitation system. This system has already been proving its worth in the Netherlands for a long time in the form of the ‘days at sea’ system, a system that enables effective control of fishing pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the plan also has the inevitable drawbacks. It only applies to vessels over ten metres in length, even though shorter vessels do play a part in cod fishing. The same goes for sport fishing. Industrial fishing, which regularly makes large by-catches of cod, is even left virtually untouched. The proportionality of the measures to be taken is unclear. The recovery plan should be less of a hindrance to the activities of fishermen whose by-catches of cod are small than to those of fishermen whose contribution to the problem is comparatively great. Incidentally, the impact of the various types of fishing can only be gauged accurately if the discards, too, are landed. There is no proposal to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The extremely drastic action that the Commission proposes for the long term – five to ten years – is based on a particularly alarmist diagnosis made by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Two types of consideration cast a serious shadow, however, over the scientific rigour and objectivity of this analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the failure to take account of the realistic observations made by the professionals, who claim that there has been a geographical shift of cod towards the northern part of the North Sea. This migration is attributed to the significant and undisputed warming of the waters. Scientists have failed to study this phenomenon and instead concentrate solely on the size of fishermen’s catches. This is a widespread problem, which affects the entire common fisheries policy (CFP) and it is fortunate that the Committee on Fisheries has asked the Scientific and Technological Assessment (STOA), at my behest, to provide us with information on the effects of global warming on fish stocks. This inadequate credibility of scientific opinion is also a matter of concern to the Council, which has just decided to allocate more substantial appropriations to improving it. This failure to take account of the views of fishermen also highlights the lack of appropriate coordination between the two sources of information, the scientific and the professional. This is another major flaw in the CFP, and this is also acknowledged by the Commission, which wants the future transnational regional advisory councils to be the forum in which these two categories of data will be addressed jointly. When the quality of data is inadequate, we know full well what happens: the scientists take refuge behind the precautionary principle, by interpreting it in the broadest possible way, and the Commission tries do outdo it, each party protecting itself as comprehensively as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second consideration that makes one wonder about the quality of the ICES’ evaluations is their systematic exoneration of any significant effects of industrial fisheries on cod stocks. It is strange to say the least, that the ICES talks about profit and losses for a type of fisheries that clearly has a significant effect, given the tonnage caught and the nature of targets, on cod stocks. Our rapporteur does address this point but far too cautiously. I suppose it is a start, though.</p>
<p class="contents">This was, incidentally, almost the only point on which the report diverges slightly from the Commission’s original proposals because it confines itself basically to supporting them as they stand, without subjecting them to any form of critical analysis and without proposing any changes. We are somewhat surprised that a parliamentary report should say so little about the genuine suffering felt by the communities that will be hard hit by this plan, communities that we represent.</p>
<p class="contents">The fishing professionals concerned are particularly concerned at the implementation of the new instrument provided for in the reform of the CFP, which is to reduce the fishing effort. This essential point should have been debated at length and questioned in this Chamber, because what we have here is an archetypal recovery plan, which will become increasingly widespread. The fact that it is replacing a bad, expensive and ineffective instrument does not make the fishing effort a good instrument. The Commission intends to implement this measure before it has convincingly demonstrated its relevance and feasibility. It is extremely worrying that calculating reductions in the fishing effort should lead in practice to writing off examples of exceeding quotas, illegal catches and ‘black fish’, to the detriment of those who have stuck to their quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">This process, Mr President, is not undermined in the slightest by the report, to which we cannot, consequently, give our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are glad about this and we are also happy with the report, on which we congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Stihler, despite the fact that originally she opposed our amendments to differentiate between the two species. Time has proved us to be right.</p>
<p class="contents">Recovery plans are very delicate and serious issues, which must be approached with recourse to the greatest possible scientific knowledge and with the greatest possible support from the sector involved as well, given their significant socio-economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Without the participation of scientists and fishermen, either directly or by means of the regional advisory councils, as proposed in the report, it is not possible to make a real, credible and transparent proposal, which is not only valid for cod, but for any other species or sector involved, as in the case of hake, whose sector we expect to hear soon in our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the consultation and we would also like to call on the European Commission to adapt the current Regulation (EC) No 2792/1999 laying down the detailed rules and arrangements regarding Community structural funds in the fisheries sector, so that the recovery plans are always accompanied by socio-economic measures cofinanced by the European Union in order to alleviate the negative consequences of the adoption of these recovery plans for the sector involved. This is the minimum we can ask for in order that the fishermen affected accept and comply with the plans laid down – whether they take place in Community or non-Community waters – whenever they affect European fleets, as in the recent case of the proposed recovery plan for halibut in NAFO waters. For all these cases, we must now provide for a general compensatory mechanism within the framework of the regulation I have mentioned, and we therefore call on Commissioner Fischler, for whose presence we are grateful, to make a proposal to Parliament in this regard. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our knowledge and experience to date, especially off Newfoundland, is not encouraging. Moreover, we cannot exclude the possibility that we have already passed the point of no return, the point beyond which not even the most radical measures will afford sustainable cod fishing in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I can only say to you that while we sympathise with the victims of this disaster, we must also draw the right conclusions from it. We must ensure that our biological resources are no longer decimated on the say-so of an irrational common fisheries policy, and that this tragedy never happens again anywhere else in Europe. Actively aided and abetted by the Commission, the Council has recently opened up most of the Azores Exclusive Economic Zone, and is now threatening to allow predatory fishing methods, including bottom trawling, throughout much of that Exclusive Economic Zone. That goes against the democratic will of this Parliament, and against the opinion of the scientific community all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this measure, the Commission has taken a step which might lead to a repeat of the tragedy we have witnessed in the North Sea, this time in those sections of the Central Atlantic Ridge that have up to now been successfully protected from depredation. We urgently need a new fisheries policy, therefore, that enshrines in Community law the conventions of international maritime law, the right to property as defined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the precautionary principle, always preached and never practised. We need a fisheries policy that does more than reel off obituaries in the aftermath of measures that neither permit nor encourage sustainable fishing.</p>

We would not be facing so many crises if European management had been a success, would we?</p>
<p class="contents">Who has a vested interest in restoring stocks to sustainable levels? It is fishermen and fishing communities and only fishing communities. Why then is it continually the case that they feel that their views, their interests, and particularly their expertise, are ignored in management decision-making? Looking from Scotland it is impossible to justify or to accept the apparent inequitability of management decisions of late.</p>
<p class="contents">Scots are using the largest mesh sizes in all of the European Union and yet are taking the biggest catch cuts, while those using smaller meshes fare better.

In any case there will not be one in time for a cod recovery plan to be adopted. We all know that the Council 's output on this subject will probably ignore our views as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are very often accused, even by the Commission, of ignoring the science in their determination to defend their national interest in the Council. I just wish that Scotland had a Member State government which would defend its national interest in the fisheries council. Last December the then UK Fisheries Minister continued a long tradition of actively voting against Scotland's interests in the Council of Ministers and the new Minister, who finally managed to get himself to Scotland this week, where 70% of the UK fisheries fleet is based, told fishing communities to get real – presumably asking them to accept that there will be more pain to come because he knows that he will do nothing to help.</p>
<p class="contents">The social and economic pain being felt by families in Scotland's coastal communities is very real. They know the realities of recent decisions and their effects on them. It is totally unacceptable that the UK Government has absolutely no intention, yet again, of doing anything other than increasing that pain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There, too, I was frequently asked how best to deal with the serious danger to resources and the consequent threat of fishing being closed down.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I believe that we politicians cannot generalise when answering questions like that. If I say no, that an endangered resource is not to be barred to fishing, I may have to reckon with the resource not lasting for long, so that only a short time now remains in which it can be used, the inevitable consequence of which is that the socio-economic situation will deteriorate. If, on the contrary, I say yes, and that the resource should be barred to fishing, this may well promote the replenishment of the stocks, but even then many jobs will be lost in the fisheries sector and in the businesses that depend on it, never to be replaced, and it may be that regions will lose expertise that will never return there.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to effectively counter the threats posed to resources, especially of cod – which are indeed grave – whilst also taking into account all the consequences of our actions, I am now more than ever convinced that our primary need is for a comprehensive strategy for developing coastal regions, which means concerted action, the political will to protect resources, a checklist to be completed and processed, which shall be binding upon all. What I have called a strategy must involve all the stakeholders: biologists, researchers into marine ecosystems, and environmental campaigners just as much as politicians in the localities, in the capitals and in Brussels, and, last but not least, the fishermen and the fish processing industry. All of them have to shoulder their share of responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Just as I have called for there to be what is termed a chain of responsibility in the area of maritime accidents, so I demand that there should be one in this area too. I urge that this strategic concept now be taken further with action of this kind. All the information we have indicates that it is five minutes to midnight!</p>

<p class="contents">Can I first of all congratulate the rapporteur on her very timely report. No doubt we will all have the usual shoot-out just before Christmas on TACs and quotas and we can see the lead into that coming along. For a long time – in fact for as long as I can remember – there has been a problem with cod stocks and we seem unable to find a solution to it because all our efforts to date have quite clearly not succeeded. We are told by the scientists that everything that has happened to date has not worked. We are told by the fishermen that the scientists have got it wrong. As I have said before in this House, we are stuck in the middle trying to find out what is right and what is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">We have quite clearly not got it right to date, and I think we have to ask whether the scientists have got it right. Has what we have done to date achieved anything? I have to ask you, Commissioner, because in Box 7a in the Irish Sea, where the fishermen of Northern Ireland fish, those spawning grounds have been closed for the last four or five years to allow the new larvae to come forward. What, according to the scientists, has that achieved? Surely it should have achieved something or at least we should know if it has brought some response?</p>
<p class="contents">The recent ICES report will spell total disaster for the white fish industry in the United Kingdom as a whole and will certainly destroy the Northern Ireland fleet. I believe we need a more regional approach. I believe we need an input from the people at regional level and we need to look at other measures that will add to cod recovery. We have to look at what the effect will be on other species fishes.</p>
<p class="contents">I realise it is not easy and I realise you have a very difficult problem, Mr Fischler. Yet the common fisheries policy does not make it easier and you cannot resolve this problem unless you get the fishermen on your side, That is what you must try to do, because they are central to this, they are part of it and they are going to suffer most from it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This includes the areas of TACs, managing effort through days at sea – based on stocks size consistent with the precautionary principle – and of course Chapter 4, which most importantly deals with measures to police, monitor, inspect and survey the effort management system. All stakeholders must be intimately involved in a bottom-up approach if stock recovery is to be achieved. Always presuming in the first place that the scientists have been looking for the stock in the right areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole area must be managed by the stakeholders through the regional advisory councils, if not, we will never bridge the deep divide that exists between fishermen and scientists at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed action plan, the joint inspection structure and any new fisheries control agency must involve all the stakeholders in introducing a harmonised code of conduct for inspections. This must include the fishermen, national authorities and scientists, and the Figueiredo report later today will deal with that.</p>
<p class="contents">As for last week's Fishery Council outcome on the Irish Box. Could you Commissioner, indicate clearly, on the record, how you will ensure there will be no increase in effort in the most sensitive southeast area of what was the Irish Box. This has now been excluded as a conservation area, with a serious reduction in the Irish Box which now is only to cover the southwest area.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate goal has to be sustainable fisheries through regional management, by opening up the governance of the common fisheries policy and helping to overcome mistrust and scepticism. We urgently need integrated regional management of the Irish Sea fishery. The status quo is no longer an option. I commend the establishment of the Pan-Irish Sea Alliance and wish them every success in delivering results to their vulnerable coastal communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that we do not need, as other colleagues have said, first- and second-class fishermen. But unfortunately, with the quota management system under the common fisheries policy, it is exactly what we have: first- and second-class fishermen. Some will have to stay with their boats tied up watching fishermen from other nationalities fish their very shores. That is the prospect facing fishermen in the south and east of Ireland at the moment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also hope that her coming marathon, I think it is in New York, is just as successful as this report. The situation with cod fishing will then turn out well, too.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem in relation to cod stocks is well known; only our approach to the problem keeps changing. On the one hand, the ICES is now suggesting that we should stop all fishing, and, on the other, Canadian biologists maintain that there is no point, that it will not lead to the recovery of cod stocks. That means that the problem is intractable and can only be solved if genuine constructive cooperation is achieved between the Commission, the regions and the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, it is extremely important that the efforts and involvement of fishermen, in particular, play a part in this. It is almost impossible to tackle this kind of problem except by giving fishermen’s producer organisations a strong position: joint management of quotas, trying together to reduce by-catches as much as possible, and also looking together at how to counter the consequences of fishing effort limitations. In that regard, it would be good if the Commission were to make a generous commitment of Structural Funds for the regions hit hard by a reduction in cod fishing. Perhaps those funds can be used to attract new employment to those regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my support once more for Mrs Stihler’s approach, and I hope that the Commission will take this report extremely seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Until now the plans have focussed on cod and hake resources in the north and, although there will soon be other proposals affecting other stocks, such as hake in the south, today we are talking about the re-establishment of cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that there are certain elements missing from the Commission’s proposal. Firstly, the lack of instruments to confront the socio-economic impact of the plans for the recovery of fishing grounds. I would like to stress the consequences of recovery plans for coastal regions or areas dependent of fishing. Therefore, within a reasonable time period – no more than a year, naturally – the European Commission should present a report, accompanied by proposals to alleviate the social and economic repercussions of the measures adopted, on the basis of the information communicated by the Member States. Commissioner, it is not a question of failing to defend the recovery of stocks, but of defending the fishermen and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">This week, the ICES published its latest opinion on the situation of stocks of various species and there is little optimism to be had from it. While the Commission should monitor the various scientific opinions, it is not sufficient to automatically accept this type of proposal with serious repercussions of many kinds – social, most importantly: we must call for the presentation of compensatory measures to prevent traumatic situations in the regions dependent on fisheries, for fishermen and for their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe, and I will end here, Mr President, that the involvement of the sector must be the third essential requirement for the success of the proposals on the recovery of stocks.</p>

There will be other opportunities to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to the questions raised by setting out the Commission’s position on the individual amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am unable to accept Amendment No 1 on the grounds that drastic measures are called for, not by the precautionary approach, but by the fact that cod stocks are below biologically safe levels and are therefore threatened by collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, though, very much able to accept Amendment No 2, although I would suggest a clearer form of words indicating that the fishing effort should be constrained in proportion to the Member States’ catches.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 came as a surprise to me, since, as you are aware, I have called on the Member States, not once but repeatedly, to inform us of the socio-economic impact of the recovery plan. I also asked them to notify us of any additional financial requirements they might have. The Commission has, unfortunately, received no replies to these enquiries. I have also drawn the attention of the Member States to the fact that they can reprogram the funds in the FIFG in order to support the sector. None of them have availed themselves of this facility.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 is superfluous, as the Commission can, in any case, propose changes to the geographical areas in question.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Amendment No 6, I have to tell you that these technical measures can, if need be, supplement restrictions on fishing effort, but cannot replace them.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 is superfluous, as, if fishing vessels are not on either List 1 or List 2, then they are not permitted to land catches of the species mentioned. The fishing effort is calculated on the basis of the list in Article 9.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 8 will not work, as the definition of ‘days absent from port’ must correspond with that laid down in other regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that Amendment No 9 is to the point, as satellite monitoring systems will be required to be installed on all vessels over 15 metres in length with effect from 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have to reject Amendment No 11, I would at the same time like to point out that ICES is engaged in completing its ecosystem study on the influence of industrial fishing, and we will take appropriate account of any new knowledge that emerges from it.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept the first two paragraphs of Amendment No 12, but am obliged to reject the third. We cannot instruct the Member States to access any funds to cushion the socio-economic impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 13 is, I think, a very good one, as there is a need for the annual review of stocks that it proposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am obliged to reject Amendment No 14. No new definition of the tasks of the regional advisory councils is required as they are clearly laid down in the new Framework Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
