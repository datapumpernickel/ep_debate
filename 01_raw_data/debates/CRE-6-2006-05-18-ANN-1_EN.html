<p>(DE) Having come to an agreement following almost three years of deliberations, the Council, in February 2006, adopted a directive on reduced rates of VAT. The Council did not believe that it served any purpose to amend Annex H of the sixth directive, specifically by including in it the products to which the honourable Member refers. The Directive applies only to labour-intensive services of the kind listed in Annex K of the Sixth VAT Directive and which, being rendered locally, cannot result in distortions of competition.</p>

<p>For the 12th year in succession, the European Court of Auditors has refused to sign off the EU budget, because it was able formally to account for the proper use of only nine percent of expenditure. A business manager involved in such wrongdoings would soon end up in prison. It is specifically in the payment of EU subsidies – which are administered by the relevant authorities in the Member States – that irregularities repeatedly arise. Rather than constantly looking for new sources of funding – in the form of EU taxes, for example – and raising expenditure, it is high time that the fight against fraud was stepped up and money wasting was finally brought under control.</p>

<p>(DE) The Council shares the concern that the honourable Member has expressed at the Court of Auditors’ inability, for what is now the eleventh year in succession, to issue a Statement of Assurance (termed a DAS) in respect of the transactions to which much of the EU’s annual accounts refers. The Council has regularly and repeatedly addressed this lamentable state of affairs in its discharge recommendations, in particular in its recommendation in respect of the Budget years 2002 and 2003<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. When it came to the financial year 2004, though, the Court of Auditors was able to establish that progress had been made in developing the supervisory and control systems associated with the pre-accession strategy and with parts of the common agricultural policy in which the Integrated Administration and Control System was being properly used.</p>
<p>The Council has examined the Commission communication on a timetable for the creation of an integrated internal control framework, which would make a positive statement of assurance more likely.</p>
<p>The Economic and Financial Affairs Council, in the conclusions that it adopted in relation to this communication on 8 November 2005<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, confirmed that a ‘positive DAS’ was an ambitious medium-term goal, and went on to make a number of recommendations relating to such subjects as simplification, control systems, measures to be taken by the Commission, the role of the Member States, declarations and decentralise management of EU funds and audit issues. A number of these aspects are also reflected in the InterInstitutional Agreement between Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which was signed this morning.</p>
<p>Where the combating of fraud is concerned, the Council attaches the greatest importance to the protection of the European Union’s financial interests and shares the honourable Member’s view that it is in the interests of the EU to take effective action to make the EU’s expenditure more effective and make better use of the resources allocated to all programmes. </p>
<p>On 8 November 2005, the Council also adopted conclusions on the special report No 1/2005<a href="#defann_2_3" name="refann_2_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of the Court of Auditors on the management of the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF)<a href="#defann_2_4" name="refann_2_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, in which it strongly urged both OLAF and the Member States to step up their cooperation in order to achieve better coordination of their anti-fraud activities and improve the exchange of information.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Commission is contemplating submitting an amended proposal relating to Regulation No 1073/1999, and the Council will carefully examine it.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council wishes to point out that the President of the Court of Auditors, when presenting the Court’s annual report for 2004 to Parliament on 14 November 2005, stated that the Court’s qualified opinion was to be interpreted neither to mean that all the transactions to which the payments budget for 2004 referred were defective, nor as an indication that fraud had been committed.</p>
<p>In line with its 8 November 2005 conclusions, the Council will continue to endeavour to improve sound financial management in all areas of the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing complies with new international standards in containing specific and detailed provisions on the determination of the identities of customers and beneficial owners in relation to business relationships and transactions covered by the directive.</p>
<p>The directive applies, inter alia – as indeed already did the so-called ‘Second Money Laundering Directive’ of 2001 – to casinos and provides that the identity of all visitors to casinos is to be established when they purchase or sell gambling chips with a value of EUR 2 000 or more. Casinos subject to state supervision can also comply with this requirement by checking the identity of patrons as soon as they enter the casino. The directive also applies to those activities in which those institutions and persons subject to it engage over the Internet. The function of these rules, which were drafted in accordance with the international standards of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), is to effectively combat the use of games of chance for money laundering purposes in the European Union.</p>

<p>(DE) The legal framework in the European Union provides comprehensive protection against money laundering and terrorist financing. With the Second Directive on money laundering the European Union took a major step towards ensuring harmonised implementation of the international standards of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF).</p>
<p>On the basis of new developments during the revision of the FATF standards the decision was made within the European Union to take account of these as soon as possible, and to revise the 2001 Second Directive on money laundering: Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing came into force on 15 December 2005 and repealed Directives 91/308/EEC and 2001/97/EC.</p>
<p>Pursuant to Article 45 of Directive 2005/60/EC Member States must bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to implement the Directive by 15 December 2007. Until such national measures are in place it is impossible to judge the Directive's effectiveness. Pursuant to Article 42 of the Directive, meanwhile, the Commission is required to submit a report to the European Parliament and the Council by 15 December 2009, and at least at three-yearly intervals thereafter, on the implementation of the Directive.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0367"></a>

<p>(DE) The Council has a continuing interest in combating VAT fraud. The work it does in relation to Value Added Tax is intended not only to simplify the obligations on market participants but also to safeguard the collection of tax by state treasuries and combat the evasion and avoidance of tax.</p>
<p>This includes an increasing number of Council decisions under Article 27 of the Sixth Value Added Tax Directive and the Council’s work on the proposal to amend the Sixth Value Added Tax Directive with certain measures to simplify the collection of VAT and to combat tax evasion and avoidance.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has emphasised, the combating of VAT fraud has an important place in the working programme that the Austrian Presidency has presented together with the future Finnish Presidency.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency organised a high-level meeting in Vienna, on 6 and 7 February of this year, the primary subject of which was the issue of VAT fraud.</p>
<p>It informed the Council, at its 14 February meeting, of the results of this meeting. It was on this occasion that the Commission announced its intention of reporting to the Council before the end of June concerning the work already carried out on the matters discussed at this meeting.</p>
<p>It is also worthy of note that the Commission wishes, pursuant to its legislative and working programme for 2006, to present to Parliament and to the Council a communication on the strategy whereby tax evasion may be more effectively combated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0275"></a>

<p>In May 2006 the European Union will be required to take a decision on the requests for introduction of the euro submitted by Lithuania and Slovenia. This will be the first genuine enlargement of the euro zone, which will at the same time see the introduction of euro banknotes and coins. According to various political speculations, some new Member States do not have the necessary financial prosperity to form part of the euro zone. The Director of the European Central Bank has stated that it is not enough to meet the Maastricht criteria at the time of assessment, but also in a longer-term perspective.</p>
<p>Among the eleven countries which joined the euro zone on 1 January 1999, no fewer than six have failed, at one time or another, to meet the price stability criteria. In Ireland, for example, inflation was higher than authorised between November 1998 and June 2005.</p>
<p>Inflation in Lithuania may not exceed the Maastricht criteria by more than 0.1% despite the fact that it was lower than the limit set by the criteria for six years.</p>
<p>In assessing the situation in the new countries applying to join the euro zone, will consideration be given to the experience of euro zone countries as regards exceeding authorised inflation rates and infringement by certain euro zone countries of the Stability and Growth Pact requirements? Does the Council not consider that account should be taken of external factors, such as the rise in energy prices and the fact that it is actually impossible to have rapid economic growth and price cuts simultaneously? Would it not also be appropriate to improve the Maastricht criteria themselves in order to avoid an unintended fall in commodity prices in Finland and the Netherlands, which have a lower rate of inflation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The requests made by Slovenia and Lithuania for assessments to be made of those countries’ chances of adopting the euro raise new questions on the future of the euro zone. Before the introduction of the euro, certain parameters (e.g. inflation) were calculated on the basis of all EU countries, because none of them had adopted the euro at that stage. It would now be appropriate to calculate inflation only on the basis of parameters of the countries in the euro zone. To calculate average inflation on the basis of countries that have not even made a commitment to fulfil the Maastricht criteria on inflation is today illogical and hinders enlargement of the euro zone. Some countries have artificially reduced inflation by lowering duty on alcohol and petroleum products, making it more difficult for countries that reject state control of their economies to join the euro zone.</p>
<p>What steps does the Council intend to take to ensure that enlargement of the euro zone is not held back by artificial measures? Are there plans to amend the Maastricht criteria (which are entirely technical in nature) to ensure that the requirements laid down for countries aspiring to join the euro zone are supported by economic logic?

<p>Under the procedure, the Commission and the European Central Bank report to the Council on whether the Member States in question have achieved a high degree of sustainable convergence.

<p>In December 2005 the Commission presented a proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on payment services in the internal market; the proposal sets deadlines for both national and cross-border payment transactions.</p>
<p>Providers of payment services are to be required to credit payments in euros within the European Union to the payee's account essentially within one day. To allow the banks time to adjust their infrastructure to the new requirements, this deadline may be extended to a maximum of three days until 1 January 2010 – subject to an agreement to that effect.</p>
<p>The negotiations on this proposal for a directive within a Council working party have commenced under Austrian chairmanship, and are making rapid progress. In addition, there are close contacts with the European Parliament, and in particular with the rapporteur of the committee responsible (ECON), so that an agreement can be reached with the European Parliament and this directive can be adopted as quickly as possible under the codecision procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0297"></a>

<p>(DE) The Council considers it very important that there should be further improvement in financial management, and that controls should work correctly and effectively, so that, in the medium term, a positive statement of assurance (DAS) can be given for all transactions underlying the EU’s accounts.</p>
<p>With regard to the financial year 2004, the Council regrets that payments relating to CAP expenditure, which is not covered by the integrated administration and control system (IACS), to structural measures and to internal and external policy areas are still materially affected by errors. However, the Council notes with satisfaction the progress found in that financial year in areas where supervisory and control systems are implemented and allow for appropriate risk management, that is, revenue, commitments, administrative expenditure and pre-accession strategy. The Council is pleased to note that, with regard to CAP expenditure, the Court was able to conclude that the IACS, if properly used, is an effective system for limiting the risk of irregular payments.</p>
<p>The Council commented on the question of declarations at national level in its conclusions of 8 November 2005. As the honourable Member is aware, the President of the Council, Mr Finz, raised the question of national declarations when presenting the Council’s discharge recommendation at Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control on 20 March 2006. He stated that with regard to compatibility with administrative structures in the Member States, particularly those which are federally organised, this would entail considerable difficulties, pointing out how important it is that, in keeping with the EC Treaty, the Commission's ultimate responsibility for Community funds be maintained. He further pointed out that, in the Council’s view, the introduction of such statements could lead to an increased administrative burden and additional costs for Member States. With regard to the aim of attaining a positive DAS, then, the Council proposes an approach based on improving existing declarations at operational level with greater Member State involvement.</p>
<p>During the negotiations on the new Interinstitutional Agreement (IIA), too, the call for Member States to be obliged to issue national declarations at political level was made by Parliament’s representatives. Parliament, the Council and the Commission ultimately reached agreement on a provision in the IIA which reads as follows:</p>
<p>A. Ensuring effective and integrated internal control of Community funds</p>
<p>44. The institutions agree on the importance of strengthening internal control without adding to the administrative burden for which the simplification of the underlying legislation is a prerequisite. In this context, priority will be given to sound financial management aiming at a positive Statement of Assurance, for funds under shared management. Provisions to this end could be laid down, as appropriate, in the basic legislative acts concerned. As part of their enhanced responsibilities for structural funds and in accordance with national constitutional requirements, the relevant audit authorities in Member States will produce an assessment concerning the compliance of management and control systems with the regulations of the Community.</p>
<p>Member States therefore undertake to produce an annual summary at the appropriate national level of the available audits and declarations.</p>
<p>This decision of principle taken by the institutions on the control of EU funds also made it possible to find an agreed solution to the question of declarations by the Member States.</p>
<p>On the basis of that decision, the Council would point to the scale of the work still to be dealt with so that a positive DAS for all transactions underlying the EU’s account and an effective integrated internal control framework can be brought about.</p>
<p>The Council therefore calls on all those involved in implementing the budget to continue efforts to improve financial management so that reasonable and verifiable assurance can be had that controls are in place which work correctly and effectively.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The Council conclusions of 5 May 2006 on the Commission White Paper on financial services policy for 2005-2010 included the following: ‘The Council … welcomes the initiatives proposed by the Commission, stressing that progress in the greater integration of retail markets is a challenge for 2005-2010 in order to strengthen competition and ensuring an appropriate level of consumer protection; notes also the importance of strengthening consumer input and therefore stresses the need to facilitate an appropriate involvement of consumers and SMEs;’.</p>
<p>Along these lines, in autumn 2005, the Commission had adopted a Green Paper on mortgage credit law after carrying out a consultation process; and in February 2006 it set up a Mortgage Fund Expert Group (MFEG) to identify existing barriers to pan-European funding models and frame possible proposed solutions.</p>
<p>At present, in addition, negotiations are taking place under the Austrian Presidency on two further directives in this area. The consumer credit directive is intended to create an integrated internal market for consumer credit.</p>
<p>Likewise, the directive on payment services in the internal market, on which discussions at Council working party level got off to a successful start in January 2006, is intended to secure benefits for consumers and industry by improving market access and increasing competition.

<p>(DE) The honourable Member is right to point out that the Austrian Presidency’s priorities include the promotion of growth and employment not only at the macro-economic level but also in terms of improved conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency has made considerable progress towards achieving these goals, not only as regards the formal adoption of legislative acts, but also in successfully bringing several major policy initiatives to fruition. In view of the honourable Member’s interest in the connection between the macro-economic objectives and the role played by SMEs in achieving them, the Council wishes to point out that:</p>
<p>On the basis of the contributions from the various Council configurations, the Council, in its Spring Conclusions<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, unreservedly endorsed the revival of the Lisbon Strategy and stressed the significance of small and medium-sized enterprises for the creation of growth and new jobs.</p>
<p>Thanks to the work done by the previous Presidency, negotiations on the proposal for a programme for competitiveness and innovation to run from 2007 to 2013 have now progressed to such an extent that it is highly probable that agreement will be reached at first reading before the end of the Austrian Presidency.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency is endeavouring to move forward the deliberations on the proposal for the seventh research framework programme and the services directive in order that these dossiers, which are subject to codecision, may, in close cooperation with Parliament, be completed successfully and as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency is actively supporting the Commission’s efforts at achieving, at international level, and in particular in the context of WTO negotiations, market conditions characterised by real and fair competition, in which European enterprises can hold their own in doing business.</p>
<p>On 13 May 2006, the Council adopted conclusion on policy on the role of SMEs in growth and employment<a href="#defann_13_2" name="refann_13_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in which it highlighted the fundamental importance of this policy area, which has so many horizontal connections to others.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency will, in May 2006, be submitting to the Council, for final adoption by it, draft Council conclusions on industrial policy. These constitute a response to a Commission communication on the same subject<a href="#defann_13_3" name="refann_13_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Presidency has initiated a wide-ranging dialogue on industrial and SME policy with interested parties, which includes conferences on important aspects of them, and this dialogue will be continued. Particularly worthy of note in this context are the Fourth European Business Summit (EBS), which was held on 16/17 March 2006 in Brussels under the heading of ‘Building a Europe of Excellence: Turning knowledge into growth’ and also the EU Conference on progress in implementing the European Charter for small business, which the Presidency will be staging jointly with the Commission on 13/14 June in Vienna.</p>
<p>The Austrian Presidency will also be conducting a review of the strategy for sustainable development<a href="#defann_13_4" name="refann_13_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, on which the various Council configurations will state their positions, since environmentally-friendly models of production and consumption can significantly stimulate growth in the internal market while at the same time improving the competitive positions of European businesses in global markets.</p>
<p>The initiatives for the simplification of legal acts and for better lawmaking will be continued with; they have already had a considerable effect on the adoption of current legal acts and on the drafting of new Community regulations particularly in terms of the ‘Think Small First' principle, which is to be applied to all legal acts relating to competition policy.</p>
<p>The examples given above demonstrate conclusively how much the present Presidency is doing to achieve major progress on the Lisbon goals, notably in terms of micro-economic policy, internal market policy and research, which are primarily the responsibility of the Competitiveness Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The [Council/Presidency] is satisfied with the application of the new rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. The Spring notifications show a positive development in that the deficit for 2005 has decreased not only in the euro zone (from 2.8% of GDP in 2004 to 2.4%) but also across the 25 countries of the EU (from 2.6% in 2004 to 2.3%). Overall, an equally positive view can be taken of the evaluation of the stability and convergence programmes. Action is needed, though, to further improve the sustainability and quality of public finances in a number of Member States. It is also intended that the current acceleration in growth should be used in the interests of a consistent policy of consolidation.</p>

<p>The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) has pointed out that, since the end of the 1990s, one third of the total number of victims of shipwreck has been made up of passengers on passenger vessels, car ferries and other ferry boats, giving rise to serious doubts about the existing system of assessing safety for this category of vessel. Technical safety standards are drawn up, in practice, partly by the IMO through international conventions (so-called 'institutionalised' standards) and partly by the shipping registers through their technical regulations ('class regulations').</p>

<p>(DE) The honourable Member rightly points out that far too little use is currently made of Europe’s waterways. Through greater use of spare capacity on Europe's rivers and canals, inland waterway transport can help make energy use more efficient and reduce air pollution.</p>
<p>To exploit the potential of inland navigation to a greater extent, the Austrian Presidency has declared promotion of this transport mode to be a priority task. On 17 February 2006, the Commission submitted a communication on an integrated European action programme for inland waterway transport to Parliament and the Council. At a high-level meeting attended by representatives of the Member States, the non-EU Danube riparian states, the leading international inland-navigation organisations and economic stakeholders in Vienna on 14 and 15 February 2006, there were intensive discussions on this issue and a findings paper was adopted. Accordingly, the Presidency is seeking adoption of conclusions on the Commission communication at the Council meeting on 8/9 June 2006. The Council conclusions are intended to give decision-takers at all levels, in line with their respective remits as determined at present in law, appropriate political signals for framing the necessary legislative proposals and further initiatives to promote inland navigation under the next Presidency.</p>

In 1999, the Directorate-General for Foundations illegally declared it confiscated and, after taking the case to the Turkish courts, managed to have it transferred to the Turkish Institute for Foundations.

<p>(DE) The Council is aware of the events to which the honourable Member refers and is following developments with close attention. With regard to freedom of religion in Turkey, the Council has repeatedly emphasised how important it considers this issue to be. Allow me to refer you once again to the fact that this is one of the key areas in which tangible progress is urgently required and in which concrete steps now need to be taken to adopt and implement appropriate legislation; this is all the more true now that accession negotiations have been started. Religious minorities and faith communities are continuing to experience difficulties in connection with their legal personality, with property rights, training, residence and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clerics, schools and internal management. The EU is particularly concerned about the fact that the state is continuing to confiscate the property of non-Muslim religious minorities. Among the short-term priorities of the accession partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006 is the enactment of an act resolving all the difficulties faced by non-Muslim religious minorities and faith communities in line with currently applicable European standards.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that developments relating to freedom of religion will continue to be closely monitored, and, where necessary, raised at every level as part of the ongoing reform process in Turkey in line with the conclusions of the December 2004 European Council, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised accession partnership. It is quite clear that whether or not Turkey makes progress in moving the reform process forward, and its compliance or non-compliance with its treaty obligations and the requirements of the accession partnership, will have an effect on how the negotiating process develops.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Allow me to refer you once again to the fact that this is one of the key areas in which tangible progress is urgently required and in which concrete steps now need to be taken to adopt and implement appropriate legislation; this is all the more true now that accession negotiations have been started. Religious minorities and faith communities are continuing to experience difficulties in connection with their legal personality, with property rights, training, residence and work permits for Turkish and non-Turkish clerics, schools and internal management. The EU is particularly concerned about the fact that the state is continuing to confiscate the property of non-Muslim religious foundations. The need to enact a law comprehensively resolving all the difficulties encountered by non-Muslim religious minorities and faith communities in line with the relevant European standards is one of the short-term priorities in the revised accession partnership adopted by the Council in January 2006. I should also like to point out that this accession partnership requests Turkey to transpose in full the rulings of the European Court of Justice regarding human rights.</p>
<p>The Council can therefore assure the honourable Member that developments regarding freedom of religion are being, and will continue to be, monitored closely and discussed at all appropriate levels as part of the ongoing process of reform in Turkey, in full compliance with the Council Conclusions of December 2004, the negotiating framework for Turkey and the revised accession partnership (it was most recently discussed, for example, by Mrs Plassnik at the troika of foreign ministers with Turkey on 8 March and at the Joint Parliamentary Committee on 4 and 5 May). It is quite clear that progress in the reform process and Turkey's compliance with its treaty obligations and the accession partnership will have an effect on progress in the negotiating process.</p>
<p>With regard to relations between Turkey and Cyprus, the EU has consistently stressed to Turkey how important it is for significant progress to be made regarding the normalisation of these relations, and it will continue to do so. The European Council did welcome Turkey's decision to sign the Protocol regarding the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement and thus to take account of the accession of the 10 new Member States, but in this connection I should like to point to the declaration by the European Community and its Member States of 21 September 2005, which emphasised, amongst other things, that the recognition of all Member States is a vital element of the accession process. The declaration also points out that the Union attaches considerable importance to normalising relations between Turkey and all the Member States as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The EU will be monitoring and assessing the complete implementation of the Protocol regarding the adaptation of the Ankara Agreement this year, because the commencement of negotiations on the relevant chapters depends on Turkey meeting its treaty obligations to all Member States. If it does not fully meet all its obligations, this will impede progress in the negotiations as a whole. In addition, the Council will also follow up the progress made on this issue in 2006.</p>
<p>It is therefore clear that the Union attaches considerable importance to these issues, and I should like to conclude by assuring the honourable Members once again that progress in these areas is being followed very closely.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0338"></a>

<p>(DE) The Council would point out that G-6 activities do not fall within its powers and that it is not therefore its responsibility to take a stance on proposals put forward in the G-6 framework. The Council does not normally express its views on media reports concerning meetings taking place outside the Council framework.</p>
<p>However, as regards the Member's first question, the Council can state that the proposal recently put to the G-6 is aimed at introducing police back-up teams which could be set up in the event of a serious terrorist attack. These teams are to be made up of experienced police officers from the various Member States and are intended to assist the Member State in which the attack takes place. The proposal is not therefore aimed at setting up a European anti-terrorist police force.</p>
<p>As regards the second question, the Council would point out that it has never discussed setting up a European police force to combat organised crime.

<p>The revised proposal is currently being examined by the Consumer Protection and Information Group to enable the Council to hold a policy debate on the basis of this preliminary work at its meeting on 29 May 2006. At the beginning of the detailed examination of the document, the Council working group held an in-depth discussion on the level of harmonisation and the principle of mutual recognition. These questions will also be central to the policy debate. A further controversial point which emerged was the question of the fees in the event of early repayment of credits by consumers. Some Member States allow consumers the right to make early repayment without extra cost while others make provision for such early repayment only against payment of a fee. One of the main issues is on what basis the APR, which will enable consumers to compare credit costs, including with those in other countries, is to be calculated.</p>

<p>(DE) Inasmuch as Mr Beglitis's question relates to the result of the elections to the Palestinian Legislative Council on 25 January 2006, the Council would point out that the EU and its partners in the Middle East Quartet have congratulated the Palestinian people on their free, fair and secure elections. However, as the High Representative, Mr Solana, stressed to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on 5 April this year, we cannot have 'business as usual' with the Palestinian Authority until Hamas expresses its unequivocal intention of respecting the principles of the international community – namely non-violence, recognition of Israel's right to exist and acceptance of existing agreements. The Council confirmed this position on 10 April, recalling that the new Palestinian Government's failure to adhere to those three principles would have unavoidable consequences on direct aid for this government; this was also stressed once again in the conclusions on the Middle East peace process adopted by the Council at its meeting on 15 May. It must not be forgotten that these three principles are not new guidelines invented for the Hamas-led government, but criteria that originate from the long-standing Oslo Process. These principles are also in line with the Palestinian President Mr Abbas' peace platform.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr Beglitis's question on economic aid to the Palestinian Authority, the EU has repeatedly stressed that it will provide the necessary aid for the basic needs of the Palestinian people. To this end, the EU is working actively with its international partners in the donor community to find ways of continuing to provide the Palestinian people with the necessary aid, whilst at the same time ensuring that this aid is not used for purposes contradictory to the aforementioned three principles. The Council deals with the issue of aid in more detail in point 3 of the conclusions on the Middle East peace process of 15 May 2006, which states that the Council 'welcomed the willingness of the Quartet to endorse a temporary international mechanism, the objective of which is direct delivery and supervision of assistance to the Palestinian people. The EU is working urgently to develop such a mechanism which as a matter of priority will be aimed at contributing to meet basic needs including health services. It will consult International Financial Institutions and other key partners, and invite other donors to actively join in the effort to establish the mechanism as soon as possible.' It therefore cannot be said that the EU is imposing an 'economic embargo' or 'economic sanctions'.</p>
<p>As far as Mr Adamou's question regarding the peace process is concerned, the Council's conclusions of 15 May 2006 call for an early engagement between the Israeli Prime Minister and the President of the Palestinian Authority in view of the urgent need to relaunch the process towards a negotiated settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict leading to an independent democratic and viable Palestinian State living side by side in peace and security with Israel and its other neighbours. As before, the Council is prepared to explore all the possible ways in which it can make an effective contribution to achieving this goal.</p>
<p>With regard to Mr Beglitis's reference to 'Israel's continued refusal to implement the November 2005 agreement', the Council would first of all point out that the opening of the border between the Gaza Strip and Egypt, which is based precisely on this agreement, the implementation of which the EU is supporting through its mission to support border controls at the Rafah border crossing, has been a real success so far. The opening of this border crossing has had a direct and distinctly positive effect for the Palestinian population in the Gaza Strip, and the EU will continue to work with the parties involved to enable further sustained progress in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0354"></a>

<p>To prevent instability on the borders with its new neighbours, the EU has undertaken, in several official statements, to play a greater role in resolving the conflicts in the South Caucasus. However, it comes as no surprise that the priorities for the term of office of the new EU representative for the South Caucasus, Peter Semneby, are practically the same as those of his predecessor, Heikki Talvitie.</p>
<p>What roadmap has the Council given its new Special Representative for the EU's involvement in resolving conflicts in the region? In the Council's view, should the new Special Representative participate directly or as an observer in the peace negotiations to end the frozen conflicts in Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh?</p>
<p>Are there are also plans in the medium term to send EU monitoring teams and peacekeeping troops to the region? Given the rising tensions surrounding these conflicts, how high is the EU's credibility in the eyes of the countries of the Caucasus, and the international community in general, should fresh armed conflicts break out in the region?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The South Caucasus region is currently undergoing major upheavals. The size of the region, its strategic position as the gateway between Europe and Asia, its natural resources and its economic potential, mean that its role and importance have considerably increased.</p>
<p>As long ago as 2001, the European Union expressed a willingness to play a more active role in the south Caucasus, and since then it has endeavoured to step up its policies regarding the region. The clearest and most specific sign of this move towards a greater presence by the EU in the region was the appointment of Ambassador Heikki Talvitie as the first EU Special Representative (EUSR) for the South Caucasus in July 2003.</p>
<p>On 20 February 2006, the Council appointed Ambassador Peter Semneby as the new Special Representative for the period from 1 March 2006 to 28 February 2007. At the same time, the mandate of the EUSR for the South Caucasus was extended, including with regard to issues of conflict resolution.</p>
<p>Pursuant to the Joint Action appointing the EU Special Representative for the South Caucasus, one of the EU's objectives is, in accordance with existing mechanisms, to prevent conflicts in the region and to contribute to the peaceful settlement of conflicts, including through promoting the return of refugees and internally displaced persons.</p>
<p>In order for this objective to be achievable, the EUSR has the task of contributing to the settlement of conflicts and of facilitating the implementation of such settlement in close coordination with the United Nations Secretary-General and his Special Representative for Georgia, the Group of Friends of the United Nations Secretary-General for Georgia, the Organisation for Security and cooperation in Europe and its Minsk Group, and the conflict resolution mechanism for South Ossetia.</p>
<p>The EUSR's team assisting the Georgian Border Guard will continue its work at least until the end of February 2007. A functional border control system could also make an essential contribution to resolving these intractable conflicts.</p>
<p>In terms of conflict resolution, the EU Special Representative must, according to his mandate, coordinate closely with the existing conflict resolution mechanisms. In the course of May, Special Representative Semneby will undertake consultations with Moscow and Washington and with the United Nations.</p>
<p>On the basis of the talks that Mr Semneby held on his first visit to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, the Council estimates that there are good conditions in place for further cooperation with these countries, including with regard to conflict resolution.</p>
<p>As part of his mandate, the EUSR is also required to propose guidelines for future EU measures. Mr Semneby will present Secretary General/High Representative Solana, the Council and the Commission with an interim report by the end of June 2006 at the latest, and with a comprehensive report on the fulfilment of his mandate by mid-November 2006.</p>
<p>In its declaration of 21 February 2006, the European Union reiterated its support for a peaceful resolution of the territorial conflicts in Georgia, based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia within its internationally recognised borders. It also stated that it supported the initiatives taken towards peaceful resolution of the conflict and believed that the Georgian Peace Plan would serve as a basis for that resolution. All of our efforts should ultimately be directed towards a permanent solution. The parties should now attempt to find acceptable solutions through dialogue, and renounce unilateral measures that could increase tensions. It is very important to build trust and confidence. At the end of May, Mr Semneby will travel to South Ossetia and Abkhasia.</p>
<p>At a later date, and in agreement with all the parties, it may be examined in the context of conflict resolution whether a peace-keeping mission to South Ossetia may be required, and, if so, what its composition should be. In the context of the OSCE needs analysis and the Brussels Donors' Conference, the EU is currently assessing what additional aid it can provide in the conflict region.</p>
<p>The EU is also prepared to help with regard to Nagorno-Karabakh. It is prepared to participate in a donors' conference if appropriate and to look into how it can best contribute to peace-keeping measures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0361"></a>

However, it is clear that standards of ‘special protection and assistance’ provided to children in need differ widely across the Member States.

<p>(DE) The Austrian Presidency has given a high priority to improving the competitiveness of European businesses in line with the relaunched Lisbon Strategy that was adopted in June 2005. At its Spring summit from 23 to 24 March 2006, the European Council adopted conclusions containing important political guidelines for implementing the reforms provided for in the Integrated Guidelines (2005-2008) and in the national reform programmes adopted by the Member States; these conclusions were based on the papers produced by the competent Council configurations in response to the European Commission's progress report on the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p>The March European Council also introduced, amongst other things, the following measures that will make a significant contribution to Europe's position as a business and investment location with prospects for the future:</p>
<p>investing more in knowledge and innovation, aiming at the overall objective of 3% by 2010;</p>
<p>improving workers' qualifications and at the same time providing efficient social protection systems;</p>
<p>reducing red tape and administrative costs through better and more transparent legislation;</p>
<p>creating a more favourable environment for SMEs, such as establishing a one-stop shop for setting up businesses.</p>
<p>In addition, the topic of globalisation was the focus of discussions at the informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council in Vienna, at which three CEOs were present. At this meeting, the finance ministers clearly stated that the increasingly international division of labour was basically making a contribution to better employment and income opportunities and that the challenges of globalisation could not be met by protectionist measures. However, it was also made clear that these employment and income opportunities were not equally distributed and that policies must ensure that as many people as possible can benefit from the advantages of globalisation. This requires appropriate opportunities for education and training, effective labour markets and an efficient social system.</p>
<p>In addition, the Austrian Presidency, in close cooperation with the European Parliament, has made considerable efforts to adopt in good time the most important implementation instruments needed to improve Europe's competitiveness on the global market; these include the Interinstitutional Agreement on the Financial Perspective (2007-2013), the Seventh Research Framework Programme and the Framework Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation. Although it is still too soon to venture a prediction on the exact result of these negotiations, you can already be certain that the Austrian Presidency has given considerable impetus to the implementation of the relaunched Lisbon reform agenda.</p>
<p>Ensuring that the fruits of globalisation are distributed equally to all countries, population groups and levels of education is a complex matter, affecting many areas of policy (not just at EU level), in particular international trade, education, development and social policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0377"></a>

<p>On 24 March 2006, a delegation from the Committee on Civil Liberties visited detention centres for illegal immigrants in Malta and witnessed the gravity of the situation there. Parliament has adopted a joint resolution on the crisis experienced on a daily basis by Malta, which lacks the resources to cope with the continual arrivals of illegal immigrants. Furthermore, Malta is devoting 1% of its GDP to this crisis, while 10% of its security forces are engaged in dealing with it. Parliament's resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2006-0136_EN.html">P6_TA(2006)0136</a>) points out that, despite its efforts, Malta is unable to fully apply Regulation (EC) No 343/2003<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ('Dublin II') and calls for it to be exempted from its provisions. Parliament has called on all Member States to assist Malta in its efforts by each sharing part of the burden, bearing in mind that Malta is not the final destination of the illegal immigrants who land there. It has also called on the Council to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Malta itself as soon as possible in order to discuss the crisis.</p>
<p>As also requested by Parliament, the Commission should propose the setting up of a fund for humanitarian emergencies such as the current immigration crisis in Malta and take steps to amend 'Dublin II', with a view to sharing the task of considering asylum applications among all Member States, rather than leaving it to the country in which they first arrive.</p>
<p>Bearing in mind that this is a Community problem, will the Council say what measures it is considering or has already taken in response to the calls made in the resolution adopted by Parliament?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) The Council is fully aware of Malta's problems in relation to the presence of illegal immigrants. In this connection, the Council is currently examining proposals from the Commission to set up a number of Community funds forming part of the framework programme for solidarity and management of migration flows for the period 2007-2013. Three of these funds, relating to refugees, external borders and repatriation, cover measures that aim to provide financial support to Member States in emergencies when immediate aid is required. The legislation establishing these three funds needs to be enacted in accordance with the codecision procedure; the Council is currently working closely with Parliament to ensure that this legislation can be adopted as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With respect to the 'Dublin II' Regulation, the Commission needs to report to Parliament and the Council on its implementation, and in this connection it may also propose amendments to the Regulation, which would then need to be adopted by Parliament and the Council under the codecision procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) First of all, I should like to point out that the successful conclusion of the accession negotiations and the signing of the accession treaty, as well as the Commission's comprehensive monitoring report from 2005, have all confirmed that Romania continues to meet the political criteria for EU membership and the EU's requirements in general to a satisfactory extent. As a candidate country, Romania must continue to comply with the EU's human rights standards, including, in particular, the requirements in the European Convention on Human Rights and the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. It goes without saying that the Union will continue to closely monitor developments in this area.</p>
<p>Mrs Manolakou's question relates to the draft law currently being discussed in the Romanian Parliament.

At the same time, it has been pointed out that it is of the utmost importance to maintain and develop contacts with the democratic forces in the country. A major problem in this respect is that it is currently difficult for Belarus nationals to travel to the EU owing to the existing rules on granting visas.</p>

<p>(DE) The Council wishes to thank Mr Sjöstedt for his question. It fully shares his concern regarding the situation in Belarus and would refer in this connection to the recently extended restrictions imposed on those responsible for the abuses of human rights.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly expressed its clear support for the activities of civil society and democratic forces in Belarus. It is in constant contact with the various forces in the democratic opposition and civil society, particularly with independent journalists, and it is currently looking into various options for further building on its support for these people under the extremely difficult conditions of which the honourable Member is no doubt aware.</p>
<p>The Council has also emphasised, primarily in its conclusions of 10 April 2006, that it intends to strengthen and facilitate direct contact between the people. Under the Common Consular Instructions, those Member States that apply the Schengen acquis with no restrictions can charge a lower fee for issuing visas to citizens of Belarus under certain circumstances. The other Member States will also take account of the Council Conclusions in issuing visas for Belarusian citizens.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Council is still open to the idea of a dialogue with Belarus regarding the gradual development of bilateral relations, including in the context of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the European Neighbourhood Policy, provided the Belarusian authorities demonstrate that they really are willing to respect democratic values, human rights and the rule of law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0388"></a>

<p>On 1 February 2006, the Commission presented a white paper on the EU's communication policy (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2006&amp;nu_doc=0035">COM(2006)0035</a> final).

<p>The European Federation of Journalists (EFJ) adopted a sharply worded resolution on the Commission's white paper at the organisation's annual meeting held on 7-9 April 2006. The EFJ takes the view that the Commission's proposal aims to persuade the media to report 'all the good that the EU does' and that the communication strategy is therefore contrary to independent and critical journalism. The EFJ states that the Commission is trying to transform journalists into 'communication officers' and, in a press initiative, has also rejected proposals for a communication charter, code of conduct, EU television and an EU-funded news agency.</p>
<p>The EFJ is the largest organisation of journalists and represents 280 000 journalists in more than 30 countries. The organisation receives financial support from the Commission. Does the Council consider the sharp criticism which the EFJ levels at the EU's communication policy to be justified?

The Annex<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of this report is a working document of the Commission’s services. It includes an analysis of the e-communication market in Europe, market data, and chapters on the regulatory and market situation in each Member State.</p>
<p>As stated in the reply by the Commissionner in charge of information society and media on behalf of the Commission to the written question<a href="#defann_37_3" name="refann_37_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> made by the honourable Member in February 2006, Article 3 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) provides that Member States must ensure that each of the regulatory tasks attributed to national authorities is undertaken by a competent body. The concern expressed in the working document with regard to Spain is about the availability of the resources needed for the national regulatory authority (Telecomunications Market Commission - CMT - in Spain) to work efficiently in the performance of the tasks assigned to it under the regulatory framework (c.f. Recital 11 of the Framework Directive). The concern expressed is not about how the decision on the relocation of the national regulatory authority (NRA) was taken, nor about the location itself. These are issues within the exclusive competence of the Member State concerned. Similar cases in other Member States have also been referred to, since the proper functioning of the NRAs is crucial for the correct implementation of the regulatory framework.</p>
<p>As stated in the working document in relation to the human resources of CMT, “operators complain about the resulting legal uncertainty and possible impact on the performance of the CMT.” It should be noted, for example, that the first three draft measures proposed, following the market analysis procedure, were notified to the Commission only at the end of September 2005, i.e. over three years after the entry into force of the EU regulatory framework and 15 months after the pre-consultation processes carried out by the CMT. In these circumstances, the significant loss of staff by the CMT, for whatever reason, is a matter of concern. It is precisely in order to reinforce regulatory certainty that the working document reflects this concern.</p>
<p>On this basis, the Commission does not share the assumption of the honourable Member that the statements contained in the report are not accurate.</p>
<p>As regards the seat of the European agencies, it is the Heads of State and Government gathered in the European Council, and not the Commission, who decide on the location of the different European agencies and other decentralised bodies of the European Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the honourable Member’s concerns about the exposure of minors to violence on TV. Protecting minors from harmful content is of paramount importance. As a result of cultural differences, there remain, however diverse views on the methods to be used to achieve this goal.</p>
<p>According to the Commission, the protection of minors is a shared responsibility of parents, industry and regulators. Due to the arrival of the internet and other digital technologies, the world has changed considerably over the past few years. Nowadays, children are often more digitally literate than their parents. In this changing environment, parents need to be empowered to make informed choices for their children. Co-and self-regulation, within the meaning of the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, can play a significant part in this process. Rating and labelling of content combined with media literacy and technological solutions are key tools to address these important issues. Through its legislative proposals as well as through its other actions, the Commission is endeavouring to ensure the best protection possible for our children within the bounds of its responsibilities under the Treaty.</p>
<p>As to the possibility of setting aside a specific day each year “where television stations across Europe would not transmit programmes using violent death as entertainment”, the Commission feels that this should be a matter for self-regulation. Finally, the Television without Frontiers Directive will be revised so that the general principles regarding protection of minors and human dignity are also applied to audiovisual content distributed through on-demand services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Connecting as many European citizens as possible to broadband data networks is the next step in the process of establishing a knowledge society.

<p>(EN) The Commission considers that broadband services are important and that public support should stimulate deployment in the presence of market failure. The Commission has identified the availability of a secure broadband infrastructure across Europe as a key element to achieve the objectives of the initiative “i2010: A European Information Society for growth and employment<a href="#defann_39_1" name="refann_39_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>”. Deployment of broadband in remote and scarcely populated regions is a key element to enable an inclusive information society across Europe.</p>
<p>More recently, the Commission has addressed the issue of public intervention for the provision of broadband infrastructure in remote and rural areas in the Digital Divide Forum (DDF) report<a href="#defann_39_2" name="refann_39_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. Results have been summarised in the recent Communication “Bridging the broadband gap”<a href="#defann_39_3" name="refann_39_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This Communication was launched on 20<span class="sup">th</span> March 2006. It recalls the broadband gaps and the instruments available at the EU level to help bridging them (regulatory tools, competition policy, and cohesion policy). The rigorous enforcement of EU telecom rules promotes competition and stimulates broadband deployment through market forces. A more coordinated and flexible EU spectrum policy contributes to broadband deployment in rural areas where wireless technologies are particularly suited. Public intervention, also through the contribution of Structural Funds and Rural Development Fund, may accelerate broadband deployment in the less developed regions and rural areas. State-aid policy will ensure that competition distortions are minimised.</p>
<p>Back in 2003 and 2004, at the request of the Commission, Member States put in place national broadband strategies. As markets are fragmented and progress is uneven, the Commission has proposed in its recent Communication on bridging the broadband gap an update of these strategies with concrete actions and clear national broadband targets.</p>
<p>As far as rural development is concerned broadband development in rural areas can be supported by the ‘basic services for the economy and rural population’ measure under Art. 52 (b) (i) of Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005<a href="#defann_39_4" name="refann_39_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, if in the question posed, the honourable Member raises the question whether broadband should be included in the Universal Service obligation, the answer would be, that following the recent review of the scope of Universal Service<a href="#defann_39_5" name="refann_39_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, there is no case for including it. Nevertheless, the Commission will look again at Universal Service obligations as part of the review of the Regulatory Framework for electronic communications during 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the past few months, the Russian authorities have made a number of declarations on new legislation aimed at restricting access to certain strategic economic sectors, including energy. However, the possible legislation relating to energy have seen some potentially varying statements by the Russian authorities and it is therefore difficult at this stage to express an opinion on a legislative initiative which is not yet fully clear. The Commission nevertheless intend to closely monitor this issue in order to examine the compliance of new legislative proposals with the overall objective of "fair and reciprocal access to market" and also with respect to international trade principles, in consideration of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement commitments and of the future accession of the Russian Federation to the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>With respect to the Energy Charter Treaty, the Commission has consistently urged the Russian Federation to ratify this instrument, which includes indeed certain provisions relating to investments in the energy sector, giving common rules and more predictability and transparency. The Russian Federation however has not yet ratified the Charter Treaty since its signature in December 1994. Previously the Russian authorities had set a condition of the successful conclusion of the Transit Protocol to the Energy Charter for their ratification of the Treaty. The Commission, on behalf of the Community, has continued the negotiations on the Protocol on this basis. It hopes these negotiations can be successfully concluded, in order to facilitate Russian ratification of the Treaty.</p>
<p>Such principles as:</p>
<p>open and transparent approach towards investment needs in production and infrastructure in Russia in order to secure our supplies;</p>
<p>market reciprocity, i.e. a level playing field in market opening, fair competition, environmental protection and safety, including nuclear safety;</p>
<p>fair transit for energy products through Russia;</p>
<p>third party access to export pipelines</p>
<p>are consistently being defended by the Commission in bilateral contacts with Russian authorities and, whenever possible, in close cooperation with the EU Member States in international foras and, in particular, the G8 where Russia is holding the yearly Presidency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0397"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the honourable Member’s view that in today’s world, energy security requires a common European response. The same applies to energy challenges relating to climate and competitiveness. The Commission has argued this in the Green Paper on a European strategy for sustainable, competitive and secure energy<a href="#defann_42_1" name="refann_42_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Commission is encouraged by the clear statements of the Parliament, Council and the European Council in favour of the development of an energy policy for Europe.</p>
<p>In the Green Paper, the Commission has indicated areas in which existing frameworks may have to be strengthened and it has put forward some new tools to help in the development and implementation of a coordinated or common EU policy.</p>
<p>Developing a European energy policy, a long term challenge, requires a clear but flexible framework: clear in that it represents a common approach endorsed at the highest level, flexible in that it needs periodic updating. As a foundation for this process, the Commission therefore proposes that a Strategic EU Energy Review be presented to the Council and Parliament on a regular basis, covering the issues identified in this Green Paper. This would constitute a stocktaking and action plan for the Spring European Council, monitoring progress and identifying new challenges and responses on all aspects of energy policy.</p>
<p>As regards Russia, the development of a common external energy policy should mark a step change in this energy partnership at both Community and national level. The EU, as Russia’s largest energy buyer, is an essential and equal partner in the relationship.</p>
<p>A true partnership would offer security and predictability for both sides, paving the way for the necessary long-term investments in new capacity. It would also need to ensure fair and reciprocal, transparent and non discriminatory access to markets and infrastructure including in particular third party access to pipelines. Transparency would be an important factor. Negotiations with Russia must be pursued with vigour; the EU must speak with the same voice and strongly. It is particularly important that Member States and the Commission speak with a common voice also in multilateral frameworks.</p>
<p>This year, the Russian Presidency of the G8 offers an opportunity for intensified pressure on Russia for ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty and conclusion of the negotiations on the Transit Protocol. It is important to note that during the preparatory Sherpa meetings and the G8 Energy Ministerial preceding the July G 8 summit, the personal representative or “Sherpas” from both the Commission and the EU Member States, that are members of the G8, as well as energy ministers and the Energy Commissioner, have been clear on passing the same message about market reciprocity, the right of transit conditions and third party access.</p>
<p>Alongside negotiations with Russia, diversification of supply routes is important. Diversification is progressing, helped by the Trans-European Networks programme, the Energy Community in South-East Europe, European Neighbourhood Policy, internal market developments and the growing competitiveness of Liquefied Natural Gas.</p>
<p>The Commission argues in the Green Paper for a clear policy on securing and diversifying energy supplies, both for the EU as a whole and for specific Member States or regions, especially for gas. To this end, the Strategic EU Energy Review could propose clearly identified priorities for the upgrading and construction of new infrastructure necessary for the security of EU energy supplies, notably new gas and oil pipelines and liquefied natural gas terminals, along with the application of transit and third party access to existing pipelines.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The increase of minimum gas and electricity interconnection levels between Member States is essential to build a truly competitive and single European market and to reinforce security of energy supplies in Europe. Equally, additional or better interconnection facilitates the development and reducing the isolation of the less-favoured and island regions of the Community. As pointed out by the honourable Member, Ireland is indeed one of these “isolated islands”.</p>
<p>The Green Paper on Energy proposed, and the European Council in March 2006 confirmed that priority should be given to “the realisation of priority infrastructure projects…”.</p>
<p>The revised guidelines on Trans European Energy Networks (TEN-E), which are expected to be adopted formally by the Council in Autumn, should certainly contribute to accelerate certain of EU TEN-E priority projects declared of European interest and allow the European Investment Bank and the Structural Funds to participate actively in the implementation of the TEN-E projects.</p>
<p>For Ireland, the integration of the Irish electricity system and the British system on the one side and on the other side the European continental system has indeed been recognised as a major European priority. In particular, it is worth mentioning two specific projects that will contribute to reducing the isolation of Ireland by for instance ensuring a 10% interconnection capacity target). The Commission is referring to</p>
<p>the link between Ireland and Wales (UK);</p>
<p>and the link between the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>For these links, Community support under TEN-E has been granted since 2000. Further financial support of a total of €2.84 Million has been allocated since 2000 to studies in view of strengthening the connection between Ireland and Northern Ireland.</p>
<p>In the gas sector, feasibility and technical studies were supported by the Commission during the period 1995-1999 concerning three major activities:</p>
<p>developing underground gas storage facilities in Ireland;</p>
<p>interconnection between North and South, including Dublin - Belfast pipeline;</p>

<p>In the last decade, demand for oil has substantially increased, primarily due to dramatic economic growth in China and India. Global demand has grown by 7 million barrels per day since 2000 of which 2 million barrels have gone to China and, although its oil consumption is currently less than 40% of China's, India's demand for oil is accelerating. Moreover, as both rapidly move from self-sufficiency to integration in the world economy, they grow increasingly dependent on global markets.</p>
<p>Does the Commission accept that these realities highlight the need to expand the concept of energy security in two critical areas: recognition of the globalization of the energy security system and the importance of markets to absorb shocks and allow supply and demand to respond with greater ingenuity than controlled systems; and acknowledgement that interdependence and the growth of energy trade require collaboration among consumers and producers to ensure the security of the entire energy supply chain? Does the Commission agree that these can only be achieved by engaging China and India in the global network of trade and investment, rather than allowing them to move towards a mercantilist, state-to-state approach, and would the Commission explain how energy security has affected the EU's trade and investment policies with these two countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission continues to closely follow developments on the international oil market and would agree with the honourable Member that the energy market has become increasingly globalised. For this reason, in addition to its regular participation in multilateral fora such as the International Energy Agency and the International Energy Forum, the Commission has embarked in recent years on a number of initiatives designed to enhance bilateral relations with important energy producers such as Russia and OPEC, transit countries such as Ukraine and major consumers such as China and India.</p>
<p>Indeed, with forecasts pointing to an increasingly important share of future energy demand being accounted for by both China and India, the Commission has recently enhanced its energy relations with both countries. With China, in addition to the energy industry conference held every two years, the Summit last September saw the signature of a Memorandum on Understanding (MoU) on an EU-China Energy Dialogue, as well as a Joint Declaration on Climate Change. The first meetings under the MoU took place in Brussels in March.</p>
<p>With India, energy relations have recently been enhanced with the first EU-India Energy Business Conference and the first meetings of three joint working groups on energy issues in the framework of the EU-India Energy Panel. Global energy security is also one of the three key issues for the forthcoming G8 Summit in July in St. Petersburg and the Commission has been very active in the preparatory work for this event. In this context, the Commission has stressed the importance of promoting the development of transparent and non-discriminatory regulatory frameworks, favourable investment climates. The discussions to date have also underlined the importance of bringing countries such as China and India into the energy security debate.</p>
<p>Energy security has clearly become a key issue and the Commission’s recent Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy called for a more coherent external energy policy that would “permit a better integration of energy objectives into broader relations with third countries”, investment trends, climate change, energy efficiency and renewables, and research and development of new technologies. Also, the Green paper mentions that there is a scope to make better use of trade policy tools to promote goals such as non-discriminatory energy transit and the development of a more secure investment climate. The Presidency Conclusions of the Brussels European Council of 23-24 March 2006 invited the Commission and the High Representative to “work closely together on the important issue of external energy relations and to provide input for an EU strategy that may be discussed at the next European Council meeting”. The Commission intends to take this work forwards with an EU Strategic Energy review, with concrete proposals to adress these challenges, at the end of this year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0323"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU-15 Member States were required to take the necessary measures to transpose Community legislation on renewable electricity into national law by 27 October 2003. On 4 April 2006, the Commission launched infringement proceedings against eight Member States who failed to meet this deadline. Greece is one of the Member States still not in compliance with Community legislation on the promotion of electricity produced from renewable energy sources.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that Greece has taken insufficient measures to enable an adequate promotion of renewable energies.</p>
<p>According to the latest report from the Greek authorities<a href="#defann_45_1" name="refann_45_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, a share of 8.8% of electricity from renewable energy sources was achieved at the end of 2005<a href="#defann_45_2" name="refann_45_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This figure is equivalent to the starting reference of 8.6% share of electricity from renewable energy sources in Greece in 1997. As the honourable Member points out, Greece has set up a national target of a share of renewable electricity of 20.1% of total energy consumption by 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that measures so far taken by Greece have failed to encourage greater consumption of electricity produced from renewable energy sources and does not meet the requirements set out in the Directive.</p>
<p>Several administrative barriers exist in Greece and one of the impediments of the proper development of wind energy is the unclear framework for sharing costs for grid reinforcement and that the overall grid access conditions including connection charges for renewable electricity seem unsatisfactory.</p>
<p>According to Article 3(4) of Directive 2001/77/EC<a href="#defann_45_3" name="refann_45_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Commission will report on Member States’ progress towards achieving their national targets on renewable energy sources before the end of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Energy is a complex issue and direct involvement of all stakeholders, from the government, business and civil society, is needed to assure environmentally safe, competitively priced, and robustly reliable supplies. It is therefore important to focus on seeking synergies. The Parliament, the Commission and the Council have consistently given significant support to the development of alternative energy sources.</p>
<p>International oil companies (IOCs) are undeniably significant players both in international economy and in the global energy sector. Many IOCs themselves run extensive corporate programmes dedicated to the promotion of alternative energies, be it in the field of solar, wind, biomass or other. Most companies themselves have an interest in supporting progress towards alternative energy sources. As examples, The Commission can mention that Shell invests in alternative fuels, and will produce 500 Megawatt hours from windmills in 2007. British Petroleum (BP) will also invest $ 8 billion over the next years into a company called “BP alternative energy”. BP allready operates some of the largest wind turbines in Europe, and should produce about 450 Megawatt hours of wind energy in 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission has been engaged in dialogue with European and global businesses. Through it, the Commission has been finding ways to engage international business, including IOCs, in support of its policy initiatives and actions, including investments in renewable energy sources.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0332"></a>

<p>(EN) Promotion of clean and efficient energy technology is indeed one of Commission’s main priorities. Some of Commission’s recent proposals clearly reflect this preoccupation:</p>
<p>The Green paper on energy efficiency<a href="#defann_47_1" name="refann_47_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Biomass Action Plan<a href="#defann_47_2" name="refann_47_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the EU strategy to promote biofuels<a href="#defann_47_3" name="refann_47_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, the Thematic Strategies on air pollution<a href="#defann_47_4" name="refann_47_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the urban environment<a href="#defann_47_5" name="refann_47_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and, more recently, the Green Paper on a secure, competitive and sustainable energy policy for Europe<a href="#defann_47_6" name="refann_47_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> discussed at the Spring European Council.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission intends presenting an Action Plan on energy efficiency by mid-2006 and developing a prioritised Action Plan on an energy Policy for Europe before the 2007 Spring Council.</p>
<p>Regarding the financing and economic support of clean and efficient energy technology, the Commission can also underline the existence of an important number of proposals notably in the framework of the forthcoming financial perspectives 2007-2013. These proposals regard notably the competitiveness of European companies, research and innovation, cohesion policies as well as the external dimension of the European Union.</p>
<p>Firstly, part of the budget for the new Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme<a href="#defann_47_7" name="refann_47_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> is aimed at encouraging the use of renewable energy, energy efficient technologies and best practices amongst companies in Europe. These objectives should notably contribute to the enhancement of competitiveness and innovation capacity in the Community, the advancement of the knowledge society and to sustainable development as well as to address the specific needs of small and medium sized enterprises. Support shall be granted to EU-wide promotion and dissemination actions and to the market replication of existing technologies that are to be utilised in a new and innovative way.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission also understands that Europe should encourage innovation and research that focus on the development of these objectives. The 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme of Research and Technological Development<a href="#defann_47_8" name="refann_47_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> recognises that there is no single solution to our energy problems, but deals with a wide portfolio technologies: renewable energy technologies, making clean coal and carbon capture and sequestration an industrial reality, new energy vectors such as hydrogen and environmentally friendly energy usage (fuel cells) and energy efficiency.</p>
<p>Thirdly, the Commission had also suggested that regional policy instruments should be used in promoting energy efficiency, low energy and carbon intensity development models and renewable and alternative technologies. The Commission would simply recall the Community regional development programmes<a href="#defann_47_9" name="refann_47_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission believes that the EU needs to have a clearly defined external energy policy which would also promote these objectives with other countries. In this context, a new external thematic programme has been proposed as a new financial instrument for cooperation with third countries<a href="#defann_47_10" name="refann_47_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The honourable Member can be assured that Commissioner in charge of Energy has made no statements to suggest or imply that Irish Government should consider selling portions of its State-owned energy firms (i.e. ESB and Bord Gais).</p>
<p>The Commission is, of course, aware of Article 295 of the Treaty and is committed to upholding the principles of this Article.</p>
<p>The situation in the energy markets in Ireland is characterised by a high level of market dominance of the existing state owned companies, particularly for electricity. In the light of the ongoing efforts to create a single market for electricity on the island of Ireland, such a level of dominance is counter-productive. Electricity and gas prices in Ireland are among the highest in the European Union.</p>
<p>In the newspaper article to which the honourable Member is referring, the Commissioner did indicate that, in the event of the Irish Government divesting existing companies, “[there] should be some additional conditions provided for newcomers in the Irish market to compete on the same level as the dominant companies.”</p>
<p>The Commissioner’s comments reflect experience to date with European electricity and gas markets, whereby competitive prices are more likely to be achieved where there is some degree of restructuring so that wholesale prices can be formed in a reliable way without suspicion of manipulation or the need for heavy handed regulation. These comments might therefore be seen as providing some advice to the Irish Government in the interests of promoting a competitive market on the island of Ireland.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0356"></a>

<p>(EN) The current high oil and gas prices, and their impact on electricity prices in Europe, are certainly raising concerns among European consumers.</p>
<p>The Commission would point, however, to the recent European Council statements encouraging the development of an energy policy for Europe with notably, a strong and coherent voice for Europe in external energy relations. It is clear from the comprehensive conclusions from this year’s Spring European Council that a strong external stance must go hand in hand with a strong internal stance, part of an overall energy policy for Europe. Thus, the current high prices and the concern about the evolving global energy situation may over time encourage the adoption of structural measures.</p>
<p>The Commission argues that sustainable, competitive and secure energy will not be achieved without open and competitive energy markets, based on competition between companies looking to become Europe-wide competitors rather than dominant national players.</p>
<p>This is part of the strategic response at the level of Europe as a whole which the Commission believes is necessary to deal with today’s energy challenges and has outlined in the Green Paper on a European Strategy for a Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_49_1" name="refann_49_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. An approach based on 25 individual energy policies, or many small markets, is not sufficent to deliver the common objectives of sustainable, secure and competitive energy.</p>
<p>In the Growth and Jobs Strategy, energy policy is one of the four areas identified by the Commission for short-term reform.</p>
<p>Any government measures that could impinge on the functioning of the internal market would go against the objectives of boosting efficiency through optimal allocation of resources and exploiting the growth potential of the European economy to the fullest extent.</p>
<p>In a longer term perspective, energy efficient and low carbon technologies constitute a rapidly growing international market that will be worth billions of Euros in the coming years. Europe’s industries and companies have the potential to be world leaders in these new generations of technologies, processes and systems. If protectionism holds back the development of competition in the internal market, it may also hold back the development of strong European players in these new and expanding global markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In the Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_50_1" name="refann_50_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission notes that each Member State and energy company chooses its own energy mix. The Commission does not suggest any change to the corresponding Treaty article.</p>
<p>It is clear that choices made by one Member State inevitably have an impact on the energy security of its neighbours and of the Community as a whole, as well as on competitiveness and the environment. What the Commission suggests in the Green Paper is an improvement in the information available to Member States for their national decisions on the energy mix.</p>
<p>The idea is that there should be an analysis of all the advantages and drawbacks of different sources of energy, and the knock-on effects of these changes for the EU as a whole. This analysis could be included in the Strategic EU Energy Review, to be presented to the Council and Parliament on a regular basis, and to the Spring European Council.</p>
<p>On honourable Member’s first question, the Commission does not believe that the ability of Member States to choose between different energy sources and the general structure of their energy supply will be compromised if the Commission provides this analysis.</p>
<p>The honourable Member mentions the Commission taking a view on the EU's overall energy mix. To be clear, what it raised for debate in the Green Paper is the idea of an overall strategic objective, a benchmark against which the EU’s developing energy mix could be judged, relating to the agreed goals of sustainable energy use, competitiveness and security of supply. Such a benchmark, the Commission believes, would combine the freedom of Member States to choose between different energy sources and the need for the EU as a whole to have an energy mix that, overall, meets its core energy objectives.</p>
<p>The Green Paper suggests, by way of example, the level of the overall EU energy mix originating from secure and low-carbon energy sources to be a possible benchmark.</p>
<p>On the honourable Member’s second question, the Commission does not have the power to raise objections if an individual Member State chooses to satisfy national energy requirements by using only a small number of sources and types of energy, as long as the existing Directives are satisfied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission acknowledges the importance of providing a longer term perspective, considering in particular the infant state of the renewable energy industry and the need to ensure sufficient investors’ security. On the basis of currently available feasibility studies, however, the Commission considers that prior to the adoption of targets beyond 2010 and to taking a position on a global target for the share of renewable energy in 2020, a more thorough assessment of the impacts of renewable energy sources is deemed necessary, notably with regard to their global economic effects.</p>
<p>As announced in the recently adopted Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission will bring forward a Renewable Energy Road Map that will consider which targets or objectives beyond 2010 are necessary, and the nature of such a targets, in order to provide long term certainty for industry and investors, as well as the supporting measures needed to make this a reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the question of the honourable Member on heating and cooling from renewable energies, the Commission would like to reiterate what the Commissioner in charge of Energy has explained on 14 February 2006 when the Parliament adopted the report of Mrs Rothe<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on this topic: The Commission is doing its utmost to address this important question. It will need to carry out an Impact Assessment to evaluate the best options to implement this action at the appropriate level in order to promote the production of heating and cooling in the most economical and environmental manner, also taking into account the social aspects. This assessment is complex due to the highly diffused use of heating and cooling from renewable energies, the difficulty to collect and analysis sound data and also the very wide range of actors involved.</p>
<p>The Commission expects to be able to present the results of this impact assessment in the second half of 2006. The Commission can reassure the honourable Member of its strong interest regarding this dossier and as a consequence it will be with pleasure that the Commission will come back to the Parliament with concrete proposals to finally better promote the production of heating and cooling from renewable energies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Indeed, the Commission is concerned by the recent increases in the price of oil and other energy resources<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. However, the Commission recognizes that prices of oil and most other energy commodities are set, or directly determined, by global markets.</p>
<p>A pragmatic if ambitious approach to dealing with high energy prices is needed. Already in September 2005, the Commissioner in charge of Energy presented a five Point Plan for dealing with high energy prices. This plan laid base for a systematic approach focusing on actions vis-à-vis the underlying factors of the rising energy prices.</p>
<p>This approach was further elaborated in March 2006 in the Green Paper on a European Strategy for Sustainable, Competitive and Secure Energy<a href="#defann_52_2" name="refann_52_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> which puts forward six priority areas of action:</p>
<p>towards a fully competitive internal energy market;</p>
<p>solidarity among Member States with regard to the internal energy supply policy;</p>
<p>a diverse, efficient &amp; sustainable energy mix;</p>
<p>an integrated approach to tackling climate change:</p>
<p>energy efficiency, renewable and low carbon energy production</p>
<p>an approach to energy technology and innovation; and</p>
<p>a coherent external energy policy.</p>
<p>These represent mutually interdependent domains in which the Commission intends to seek initiative in order to remedy the current situation. Collectively they represent a systematic approach, including internal and external action, completion of internal energy markets in Europe and a strategic approach to energy mix and R&amp;D.</p>
<p>The follow-up to the Green Paper, currently under discussion with European public and energy sectors’ stakeholders, should lead to lesser European dependency on external and finite energy sources bearing additional risks in terms of supply security and increasing greenhouse gas emissions. Such approach should increase the ability of European economy as well as its citizens to cope well with new global realities in the energy sphere.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) First of all the Commission would like to point out that the EU is not in the process of “dismantling the Common Agricultural Policy as advocated by the World Trade Organisation”. What really is happening in the context of the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) is that the Commission targets the binding in a World Trade Organisation (WTO) setting of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) that resulted from the reform efforts undertaken in 2003-2005. In doing so it encourages the trading partners of the EU to similarly reduce their trade distorting support.</p>
<p>One of the priorities in the ongoing negotiations concerns particularly the development dimension of the DDA. The Commission is making every effort together with its partners in WTO to make this round of trade talks a success, also in the sense that poor farmers in developing countries will benefit from new trading opportunities. Traditionally special and differential treatment for developing Countries is part of the negotiated trade deals. Currently again possibilities for developing Countries to take specific measures that target poor farmers are object of negotiations.</p>
<p>Already in the past the EU has opened export possibilities for the poorest developing countries in its “Everything But Arms” initiative. A commitment to follow this example is already contained in the Declaration of the Ministerial Conference in Hong Kong in December 2005. The Commission is confident that most developing countries will benefit from an agreement in WTO. It is also using its development policy to facilitate the adjustment efforts of these countries, and to support the weaker stakeholders in taking advantage of potential opportunities arising from a WTO agreement.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0305"></a>

<p>(EN) The aim of Recommendation 2005/737/EC is to foster the creation of innovative EU wide licensing platforms for a variety of online services (e.g., "on demand" or webcasting services). The recommendation will have been successful if a large number of online customers can obtain EU-wide licenses from these new platforms and if, overall, EU-licensing will lead to online service growth and help to overcome the time lag with which new online services are introduced in the EU versus the United States.</p>
<p>Effective dispute resolution should contribute toward the above-stated aims. While it is left to the Member States to create the appropriate dispute resolution mechanisms, the effectiveness of these mechanisms will be reflected in the amount of time it takes to settle any disputes in relation to the tariffs that apply to the new EU license. Effectiveness will also be reflected in the time it takes to settle disputes in relation to the withdrawal and entrustment of online rights for effective cross-border management. Finally, parties should be free, when negotiating EU-wide or multi-territorial licenses, to opt for the most effective dispute resolution mechanism among those available in the different Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

For the sites that have been classified as SPAs there is no additional assessment by the Commission, thus the Commission is simply evaluating the sufficiency of the Member State proposed SPA lists. Following the submissions of proposed SCIs, the Commission has planned the necessary bio-geographical seminars needed for the scientific assessment and evaluation of the new Member States' proposals. In 2005, three bio-geographical seminars took place, to address the proposals for the Alpine, Pannonian and Boreal regions, while the seminar for the Continental region is planned for April 2006. Additionally, two screening meetings took place in Cyprus and Malta in 2005; the proposed Sites of Community Interest of these Member States were scrutinised.</p>
<p>Following the assessment and conclusions of these seminars and screening meetings, the Commission expects further sites to be proposed by those Member States for which gaps have been identified. It is expected that additional sites will be classified and that the majority of the identified gaps will be resolved during 2006. Further more, the Commission intends to take up bilateral meetings with those Member States for which gaps remain to fill them, prior to proceeding with the preparation of the draft Community lists to be adopted by a Commission Decision in the course of 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission is not following a different procedure for Cyprus and Malta. Both Member States belong to the Mediterranean region, however, the proposals from both countries include lists of sites with a wide variety of local endemic species and biotopes that are not common for both of them. Because of this, it has been decided that a prior screening will take place in each Member State to identify gaps and when these gaps are filled by the expected new proposals, a concluding Mediterranean seminar will be envisaged for finalising the Mediterranean list for these two Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 22 March 2006, the Commission adopted a new Communication on “Implementing the partnership for growth and jobs: making Europe a pole of excellence on corporate social responsibility”. The Communication outlines the important role of corporate social responsibility (CSR) in achieving the new strategy for growth and jobs and invites companies to step up their commitment to CSR in the interest of sustainable development, economic growth and more and better jobs. In the Communication the Commission announces backing for a new European Alliance on CSR, which is an open alliance of European enterprises. Backing for this Alliance is an important part of a wider partnership that the Commission wishes to develop with all stakeholders involved in CSR, with a view to making Europe a pole of excellence in this domain.</p>
<p>The new Communication builds on the Commission's achievements in CSR. In recent years, the EU has helped to create an understanding of why CSR matters to all stakeholders. In formulating its policy on CSR, the Commission considered at length the views and proposals of all stakeholders. The European Multistakeholder Forum on CSR achieved a measure of consensus amongst participants, but significant differences of opinion remained between business and non-business stakeholders. In this context, the Commission has sought a policy approach that is most likely to achieve the aim of making CSR part of mainstream business practice amongst all enterprises, the vast majority of which are small and medium Enterprises (SMEs). The new Communication and the Commission’s backing for the new European Alliance on CSR respond to that ambition.</p>
<p>In the Communication the Commission states that “because CSR is fundamentally about voluntary business behaviour, an approach involving additional obligations and administrative requirements for business risks being counter-productive and would be contrary to the principles of better regulation”. What companies can achieve through CSR is complementary to what they are required to do by law. Needless to say the Commission reserves its right to propose legislation on specific social and environmental issues where and when it believes that such legislation is necessary.</p>
<p>The new Communication makes very clear that the Commission remains fully committed to facilitating an inclusive dialogue with all stakeholders on CSR. Social partners and Non Governmental Organizations (NGO) made an important contribution in the context of the Multi-stakeholder forum. CSR instruments are discussed more and more often in European sectoral social dialogue committees. The Communication identifies support for multistakeholder initiatives on CSR as one of the priority areas for Commission action. In the Communication, the Commission also explicitly recognises that “without the active support and constructive criticism of non-business stakeholders, CSR will not flourish.”</p>
<p>That is why we state that our “backing of the Alliance is not a substitute for further dialogue with all stakeholders”, and propose regularly to re-convene meetings of the European Multistakeholder Forum, which has not met since June 2004. The first meeting will take place before the end of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0313"></a>

<p>(EN) Parallel Trade is a lawful form of trade in goods between Member States of the European Union. It is based on the principle of the free movement of goods and facilitates the intra-community trade with similar plant protection products authorised in several Member States.</p>
<p>In its question the honourable Member refers to an amendment to the German plant protection act which is about to be adopted. By the amendment specific provisions on parallel trade will be introduced into German law.</p>
<p>During the legislative procedure, an alternative wording was discussed allowing products not authorised in the Member State of exportation and destination but either only in the Member State of exportation or only in the Member State of destination to benefit from the simplified authorisation procedure applicable for the marketing of parallel imports. The honourable Member is wondering about the compatibility of such wording with Community law.</p>
<p>In this respect it has to be noted that it is difficult for the Commission to comment on the basis of the wording of a single fragmentary sentence of a Member State’s law.</p>
<p>In any case, it has to be underlined that the factual circumstances the honourable Member refers to are not of parallel importation in its stricto sensu.</p>
<p>If the product imported is sufficiently similar to a product already authorised in the Member State of destination but not authorised in the Member State of exportation this could be qualified as a re-import, if both products are of common origin, or as an import of a generic. The marketing authorisation necessary for a generic differs in principle from the licence granted for parallel imports.</p>
<p>If the product imported has only an authorisation in the Member State of exportation the products shall be authorised in the Member State of destination before placing on the market according to Directive 91/414/EC.</p>
<p>These principles have to be taken into account by a Member State if regulating the placing on the market of plant protection products in its territory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) There is no measurement framework available that allows an objective statement on this issue. Nevertheless, a number of studies have identified interoperability problems as one of the barriers for the uptake of pan-European eGovernment services.</p>
<p>At present, interoperability is often an after-thought, not an original design goal. Individual administrations develop their own information systems (or such information systems already exist) and it is only when the need arises to share/exchange information with other administrations that interoperability issues are taken into account. Also, interoperability is not only a technical, but also an organisational (compatibility between administrative processes) and legal (compatibility between legal systems) issue.</p>
<p>Most interoperability issues are dealt with within the various policy areas (public health, security, etc), either within the context of Community initiatives (when Community legislation foresees that information is shared or exchanged between the Member States or between the Member States and the Institutions) or within the context of bilateral or multilateral co-operation between Member States. Such efforts are complemented by work done by the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) -CEN eGovernment Focus Group- and by guidelines (European Interoperability Framework and Architecture Guidelines) provided by the IDABC<a href="#defann_63_1" name="refann_63_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> programme. Such guidelines tackle non-sector specific ("horizontal") interoperability issues.</p>
<p>The recently adopted i2010 eGovernment Action Plan<a href="#defann_63_2" name="refann_63_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> emphasises the need to avoid barriers to the creation of cross border eGovernment services through joint work among Member States. It also proposes to focus on key enablers for high impact pan-European applications, notably putting in place by 2010 pan-European interoperable electronic identification and authentication mechanisms that will allow for easy to use and smart public services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Tourism has an important contribution to make to regional development.</p>
<p>Among the financial instruments available to the Union, the Structural Funds are the main source of funding for projects directly or indirectly linked with tourism. In the current programming period, tourism has a significant presence in structural interventions. Many programmes have strands specifically devoted to the development of tourist-related infrastructure or projects, protection of the heritage and other related activities.</p>
<p>The Structural Funds have contributed, for example, to the expansion of the Palma de Majorca air terminal in the Balearic Islands (Spain) (EU contribution of €4.5 million by the Cohesion Fund, for a total cost of €6 million).</p>
<p>In the next programming period, the Commission has proposed that, under the “Convergence” objective, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) shall focus its assistance on a number of priorities, among which tourism. The precise policy-mix, and thus the relative weight attributed to tourism in the allocation of funds, will depend on the specificities of each Member State.</p>
<p>In the area of tourism, eligible activities will include promotion of natural assets as potential for the development of sustainable tourism; protection and enhancement of the natural heritage in support of socio-economic development; aid to improve the supply of tourism services through new higher value-added services and to encourage new, more sustainable patterns of tourism.</p>
<p>In addition, the development of sustainable tourism can be also supported under the Regional competitiveness and employment objective and under the European territorial cooperation objective (both cross-border and transnational cooperation strands).</p>
<p>In particular, the ERDF intervention in areas with geographical and natural handicaps (as islands) shall pay particular attention to addressing the specific difficulties of those areas and may in particular contribute to finance investments aimed at, among other priorities, encouraging sustainable tourism.</p>
<p>The potential of an integrated approach between the European Social Fund (ESF) and the ERDF is to be taken into consideration as well.</p>
<p>Training does not go without the necessary infrastructure. Tourism development – often requiring infrastructure development- may also require investment in the knowledge of people –for example future guides - about the cultural, natural heritage or other issues.</p>
<p>The ERDF and the ESF may finance, in a complementary manner and subject to a limit of 10% of Community funding to each priority axis of an operational programme, actions falling within the scope of assistance from the other Fund, provided that they are necessary for the satisfactory implementation of the operation and are directly linked to it.</p>
<p>The Commission has already started informal negotiations with Member States on the national strategic reference frameworks for the implementation of operational programmes.</p>
<p>In the preparation of the national strategic reference frameworks and operational programmes, each Member State, in dialogue with the Commission, has to find the right policy mix for its own development path in the light of its particular economic, social, cultural and institutional conditions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0342"></a>

So long as the two types of plant are separate from each other, the rules on waste and combustion can be applied separately, provided that the product which is supplied by the waste processing installation to the combustion plant can be regarded not as waste but as fuel. However, as soon as these plants are linked, the rules which are laid down for waste apply in full to the large combustion plant. This can mean that, at a large power plant, unnecessary measuring reports have to be produced. It can also mean that when a fault occurs which has nothing to do with the operation of the waste processing plant, the operation of the combustion plant has to be halted within a few hours. Obviously this is untenable for a power plant or a CHP plant, because of the need to provide continuous supplies.</p>
<p>Could the Member States themselves solve this problem, for example by not applying the WID to a linked combustion plant in these situations, because the fuel produced by the waste processor is in itself no longer waste as defined in the WID?</p>

<p>(EN) The possible application of the Waste Incineration Directive 2000/76/EC at a large combustion plant is not dependent on whether or not there is a link with a waste processing plant. Rather, the determining factor is whether a large combustion plant incinerates or co-incinerates any "waste", meaning any solid or liquid waste as defined in Article 1(a) of Directive 75/442/EEC (the so-called Waste Framework Directive). If it does not, then even if a large combustion plant is linked with a waste processing plant, which supplies a fuel that legitimately no longer meets the definition of waste, the combustion plant is not subject to the Waste Incineration Directive, but instead will be subject to the Large Combustion Plants Directive 2001/80/EC (replacing Directive 88/609/EEC). If the combustion plant does incinerate or co-incinerate some "waste", however, then it will be subject to a combination of the requirements of the Waste Incineration and Large Combustion Plants Directives. In practical cases, it will be the competent authorities of the Member States that will assess whether or not a material is "waste", taking account of the definition of the Waste Framework Directive and the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>The possible linkage of a combustion plant and a waste processing plant may be a relevant factor in deciding whether the plants form one "installation" or two for the purposes of Directive 96/61/EC on Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). However, this does not affect the separate identification of the "co- incineration plant" and "combustion plant" for the Waste Incineration and Large Combustion Plants Directives respectively. These Directives apply only to the discrete parts of the "installation" that constitute the "plant" for their purposes, in this respect setting the minimum requirements for those plants, without prejudice to the application of the IPPC Directive to the installation as a whole.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The first officials from the new Member States were recruited on 1 May 2004 on the basis of successfully completed enlargement competitions prepared by the European Personnel Selection Office (EPSO).</p>
<p>As indicated in the Communication on “recruitment of officials and temporary staff from the New Member States (EUR-10) at the Commission”, the indicative overall EUR-10 recruitment target over the 7-year transition period (2004-2010) was set at 3441 establishment plan posts (i.e. posts for officials and temporary staff). Indicative recruitment targets were also established for each new Member State. These indicative targets were determined by considering the relative weights of each Member State in an enlarged European Union according to the following three criteria: the number of inhabitants, the weighting of votes in the Council and the number of seats in the Parliament. For Cyprus, the recruitment target was hence set at 110 posts. For comparison, Malta’s target was fixed at 83 according to the same criteria.</p>
<p>On 15 January 2006, the cut-off date for the figures released in the above-mentioned Communication, the Commission had indeed recruited 49 A*, B* ad C* grade staff from Cyprus. Notwithstanding difficulties encountered, 20 months after accession, this represents already 45% of the 2004-2010 recruitment target for Cyprus, which the Commission considers as a good result. For comparison, the global EUR-10 average is 47%. For this period, Malta indeed had a better result (68%). It should be pointed out, however, that since Malta accession brought a new official language to the EU, part of the maltese recruits consists understandably of translators. The same necessity did not occur for recruits from Cyprus, whose accession did not bring an additional official language to the EU. In addition, as far as senior management is concerned, Cypriot nationals are adequately represented.</p>
<p>The number of recruitments depends on several elements:</p>
<p>the availability of laureates on reserve lists. It is clear that in some competitions the number of successful candidates was considerably smaller than expected and did not satisfy the recruitment needs of the Commission;</p>
<p>the profile of the candidates;</p>
<p>language coverage;</p>
<p>the ability to pass a selection interview for their recruitment;</p>
<p>the needs of services; and,</p>
<p>the willingness of the laureates to accept the offer. In this respect, it must be stressed that a high number of candidates from the new Member States has refused the offer of the Commission.</p>
<p>Taking into account the fact that targets per nationality should be reached by the end of the transition period (2010), it cannot be considered that, at the present time, there is a significant problem as regards the recruitment of Cypriote nationals. The Commission will, however, continue to monitor and review all stages of the implementation of its recruitment strategy with the aim of ensuring that the Commission has an appropriate staff balance by the end of the transition period.</p>
<p>It should be noted finally that the above-mentioned figures do not cover the situation of the other Institutions, for which the Commission has no responsibility.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0347"></a>

<p>According to the information given by the Managing Authority of Berlin, ERDF funds in the form of a grant were allocated to the Bund-Länder-Gemeinschaftsaufgabe “Verbesserung der regionalen Wirtschaftsstruktur” to the company O &amp; K Orenstein &amp; Koppel (grant letter of 16 May 2000, total contribution: 3,06 Million DM / €1,56 Million, ERDF<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> part: 1,52 Million DM / €782.000). (In September 2003 the former O &amp; K Orenstein &amp; Koppel AG has been transformed into CNH Baumaschinen GmbH.)</p>
<p>As the negotiations concerning the closure of the production in Berlin with the enterprise CNH Baumaschinen GmbH are still ongoing, the question about a possible repayment cannot be yet answered. In case of closure of the CNH Baumaschinen GmbH’s production site in Berlin, the Land Berlin will ensure the recovery of various grants and the keeping of the building lease contract.</p>
<p>In line with previous replies to written and oral questions on relocation of firms, the Commission considers that the right of establishment anywhere in the Community is one of the fundamental freedoms as laid down in the Treaty and a cornerstone of the single market. The Commission does not interfere in the business decisions taken by enterprises or other economic actors.</p>
<p>Specialisation and shifts in the location of economic activity are part of economic development and are in fact necessary if growth and more and better jobs are to be achieved. Therefore, the Commission does not support the request of the honourable Member to apply an additional charge on companies intending to relocate.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Involuntary infertility is a serious medical condition and has serious negative consequences on the wellbeing of the couples concerned. Reproductive techniques such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) play an important role in remedying involuntary infertility. It is up to Member States to determine whether such treatments are covered by social insurance and whether they are provided by public health care systems. The Commission does not have information on public support for, or public provision of, IVF or other assisted reproductive technology.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the need to avail of detailed information on involuntary infertility. This is why it has invited its experts on demography and health in the 'Social Situation Observatory' to investigate the literature on this issue as part of their annual work programme for 2006. First results of this work are expected to be available in 2006.</p>
<p>The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (ESHRE) collect data on the use of assisted reproductive technology in most EU countries. The results of the Fourth European report on Androgen Replacement Therapy (ART) in Europe, conducted by the ESRHE, contain data until 2002 and cover all Western Europe countries. In the five years since 1997 to 2002, the numbers of treatment cycles have increased by 62%, from 203 225 to 324 238. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) accounts for approximately 96% of these procedures. The success rate across Europe was in 2002 an average of 26% (per aspiration) and 29.5% (per transfer) of treatment cycles resulting in a live birth. 24.5% of the IVF births in Europe were multiples (22.5% twins, 2% triplets or more).</p>
<p>IVF interventions in EU Member States account for 1 to 4% of all births. Information on the extent of unmet demand for treatments is not available. It is therefore not possible to estimate how many more children might be born if such treatments were more widely available. However, it is unlikely that the wider availability of assistive reproductive techniques would significantly contribute to increasing fertility rates in Europe.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently preparing a Communication on the demographic future of Europe as a follow-up to the Green Paper on Demography. While increased fertility will not stop demographic ageing, it is important to understand the reasons for Europe's very low fertility rates. Given the difficulty of reconciling professional and private lives, far too often, women postpone child births or have fewer children as a result. Creating the appropriate conditions for couples to have their children preferably before the age of 35, is likely to be a more effective way of dealing with infertility problems and of increasing European birth rates.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the concerns and constraints of developing countries.</p>
<p>This is the reason why the EC is highly supportive of Special and Differential treatment for Developing Countries (DCs), including the possibility for DCs to designate Special Products and to have recourse to a Special Safeguard Mechanism. The EC wants to treat Developing Countries according to their level of development. This is the reason why we do not, for example, expect Least Developing Countries (LDCs) to make any major concessions in this Round.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, ‘Doha Development Round is not a synonym for ‘Doha Agricultural Round’, nor is agriculture the only key to development. The argument that the greatest benefits in Doha for developing countries will come from freer farm trade is often only used to push the EC to make further concessions on agriculture. The World Bank's Global Development Report actually suggests that the vast majority of gains for developing countries lie in services liberalisation, industrial products and trade facilitation.</p>
<p>Over the past two decades, developing countries have moved beyond their traditional specialization in agriculture into manufactures. 62% of tariffs paid by developing countries are paid to other developing countries and mainly on industrial products. Liberalising trade in manufactures would easily match the benefits for developing countries of lowering barriers to farm trade. Countries that have grown most in recent years are those that have actually moved away from agricultural trade to trade in industrial goods and services.</p>
<p>The ability of poor countries to benefit from the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) will therefore depend on more south-south trade openness.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0375"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the view expressed by the honourable Member regarding the situation of human rights in Tibet. The EU has regularly raised, in the framework of both the political dialogue, including at the highest level, and the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights, the issue of fundamental rights in Tibet, including the case of individuals as well as the protection and maintenance of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p>It has been a long-standing position of the EU, in the context of its overall political dialogue with China, to call for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama as the only realistic way to reach a peaceful and lasting solution of the question of Tibet. The Commission therefore welcomes the fifth round of talks which took place in China from 13 to 22 February 2006 between the Chinese authorities and the representatives of the Dalai Lama to pave the way for establishing such a dialogue.</p>
<p>While acknowledging that the fifth round of talks has not produced any substantial outcome, the Commission, however, found encouraging the assessment by one of the Dalai Lama’s special envoys who considered positive the strengthening, at this occasion, of good personal relations between the Tibetan and the Chinese sides to the extent that it laid the ground for mutual trust and allowed for the first time for a clear understanding of where the differences lie, thus making the dialogue more meaningful.</p>

Furthermore, Malta is devoting 1% of its GDP to this crisis, while 10% of its security forces are engaged in dealing with it. Parliament's resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2006-0136_EN.html">P6_TA(2006)0136</a>) points out that, despite its efforts, Malta is unable to fully apply Regulation (EC) No 343/2003<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> ('Dublin II') and calls for it to be exempted from its provisions. Parliament has called on all Member States to assist Malta in its efforts by each sharing part of the burden, bearing in mind that Malta is not the final destination of the illegal immigrants who land there. It has also called on the Council to hold an extraordinary meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in Malta itself as soon as possible in order to discuss the crisis.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the reception conditions of asylum seekers, refugees and irregular migrants in Malta and is taking action to improve the overall situation, including the conditions in which they are accommodated.</p>
<p>The problems faced by Malta affect the European Union as a whole and need a global approach to the management of migration and asylum. The external borders of the European Union are under permanent pressure from irregular migratory flows and many people who undertake these journeys require international protection.</p>
<p>The European Council in December 2005 identified a series of measures that will enhance the EU's external policies on migration and asylum. The Commission is actively engaged in finding structural answers to the heavy migration pressure on EU borders, together with its partner countries. In this respect, the EU-Africa Ministerial Conference on 10 and 11 July 2005 in Rabat, reinforced cooperation with the African Union and dialogue with the main countries of origin are important initiatives.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is carrying out an evaluation of the Dublin II Regulation which will be presented in Autumn. It should be recalled that this Regulation reflects the main principles of the EU asylum policy – that a single Member State should take responsibility for the examination of an application for asylum.</p>
<p>However, the most immediate assistance available to Malta at EU level is through the EU financial programmes. The European Refugee Fund already provides financial support for Member States in bearing the consequences of receiving refugees and displaced persons. Support for the development of adequate reception conditions for asylum seekers is a priority of the European Refugee Fund and Malta benefits from the Fund's assistance in this area. The European Refugee Fund allocated to Malta €114.000 in 2004, €500.000 in 2005 and €600.000 in 2006.</p>
<p>In addition, most recently the Commission agreed to provide €120.000 in order to fund a project designed to improve reception conditions on Malta within the framework of the ARGO Programme.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Commission is going to make available, within the framework of the ARGO Programme for 2006, €2.7 million which could be immediately used by Member States for urgent situations, such as those faced by Malta. The funds could be used, for example, to improve the reception and administrative capacity of a Member State confronted with large numbers of irregular immigrants arriving at its external border.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to address specific situation such as those faced by Malta in recent months, amendments will also be proposed to the European Refugee Fund to enable Member States to access funds quickly and with a minimum of bureaucratic process to deal with the consequences of sudden arrivals of large numbers of people who may be in need of international protection. Specifically, the amendments will aim to support emergency measures to grant appropriate reception conditions for asylum seekers, including basic needs as well as fair and effective asylum procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands that illegally-sourced material refers to illegally-sourced timber. Its answer has been prepared accordingly.</p>
<p>Policy to address illegal logging and the trade in illegally-harvested timber has been set out in the EU Action Plan for Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). The Action Plan sets out a new approach, which uses the incentives and influence of the EU market to help in the fight against illegal logging and the associated trade.</p>
<p>The main elements of the Action Plan are support for improved governance in wood-producing countries, and a licensing scheme to ensure only legal timber enters the EU from countries with FLEGT Partnership agreements with the Community. These elements will be implemented through partnership agreements to be negotiated with wood-producing countries.</p>
<p>Other elements of the FLEGT Action Plan include the use of green public procurement policies by Member States’ authorities, and encouragement for complementary private sector initiatives based on principles of corporate social responsibility. These include codes of conduct, designed to exclude the import of illegal timber to the EU.</p>
<p>The licensing scheme and partnership agreements are in the process of being developed together with potential FLEGT partner countries. Once the agreements enter into force, the Community will be able to prevent entry of illegally harvested timber shipments from FLEGT partner countries through the provisions of Council Regulation 2173/2005 of 20 December 2005, the legal basis which has been specifically established for the licensing scheme. Furthermore, the partnership agreements themselves will include extensive provisions for in-country monitoring as well as procedures for corrective action when problems are identified.</p>
<p>Imports into the Community of timber species listed in the Appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) are subject to the controls foreseen by the Convention, which are transposed into Community Law by Regulation (EC) No. 338/97, as last amended by Regulation (EC) No. 1332/2005. Therefore no CITES-listed timber can be legally imported into the Community without the relevant import permit, export permit or certificate of origin, which can only be issued in respect of legally sourced timber. The Regulations provide for appropriate sanctions to be imposed for attempts to import shipments not covered by the relevant permits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-0383"></a>

<p>(EN) At the current state of development of Community legislation in the field of migration, no binding rules exist concerning the conditions of stay of illegally residing third-country nationals. It is therefore not possible to judge the compatibility of the referred national legislation with community law.</p>
<p>The attention of the honourable Member is drawn to the fact that the Commission, in its Proposal for a Directive of the Parliament and of the Council on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals<a href="#defann_78_1" name="refann_78_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, proposed a concrete provision (Article 13) which aims to provide for a minimum level of conditions of stay for those illegally staying third-country nationals for whom the enforcement of a return decision has been temporarily postponed or who cannot be removed for technical, health or other reasons. For this purpose, reference is made to a set of conditions, already laid down in an existing instrument of Community law: Articles 7 to 10, Article 15 and Articles 17 to 20 of Council Directive 2003/9/EC<a href="#defann_78_2" name="refann_78_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> of 27 January 2003 laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers. These provisions contain detailed rules on residence and freedom of movement, respect for family unity, medical screening, the right for schooling and education of minors, necessary health care as well as an obligation on Member States to take into account the situation of persons with special needs (minors, unaccompanied minors and victims of torture and violence). Once adopted, national legislation will have to comply with the standards agreed in the Directive.</p>
<p>Finally, concerning the broader issue of the protection of the rights of children in general, including children of non-EU nationality, the Commission would like to inform the honourable Member that a Communication setting the bases for a comprehensive EU strategy to actively promote, safeguard and fulfil children's rights in the internal and external policies of the EU will be presented in the coming months. This Commission Communication is the result of the decision, taken in April 2005, of the Group of Commissioners for Fundamental Rights – chaired by the President of the Commission – to launch a specific initiative aimed at fostering and further protecting children's rights, which have been identified as one of the main priorities of the Commission in its Communication on Strategic Objectives 2005-2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is deeply concerned by the extent of the theft of cultural objects and their illicit trafficking, especially during or following military conflicts. It is often not only the national treasures which disappear but world cultural heritage as well. It causes serious and often irreparable harm. This criminal activity engenders considerable profit with a limited risk due to differences between national legislation including criminal provisions and law enforcement tools to track and pursue the perpetrators.</p>
<p>The EU may provide a framework for cooperation mechanism and for exchanging best practice among the relevant public and private bodies. Thus Directive 93/7/EC on the return of unlawfully transferred cultural property sets up arrangements enabling Member States to secure the return to their territory of cultural objects which have been removed from their territory in breach of the national measures.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises the real need to adopt further legal instruments which would strengthen the fight against illicit trafficking of cultural goods at European and international level. Such proposals would take into account the opinion of all relevant public and private actors.</p>
<p>Following the recommendations of the Council and the Parliament adopted in 2002, the Commission has pursued the discussions on the reinforcement of the fight against illegal trade in cultural goods with a view to the adoption of the most appropriate legislation.

<p>(EN) The multi-sectorial agreement on respirable quartz (crystalline silica), signed on 25 April 2006, by 17 employers and workers organisations covering the majority of the EU users and producers of silica, is a positive step forward in the reduction of workers' exposure to this substance. The Commission strongly supports this important contribution of the social partners to the health and safety of workers in European industry.</p>
<p>The Commissions replies to the specific questions raised by the honourable Member are as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission confirms that the agreement reached by social partners on crystalline silica does not prevent any legislative initiative that the Commission would deem necessary in the exercise of its right of initiative.</p>
<p>The Commission has not changed, due to the conclusion of the agreement, its position, as stated in its communication "Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002-2006"<a href="#defann_82_1" name="refann_82_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, as regards a possible amendment of Directive 2004/37/EC<a href="#defann_82_2" name="refann_82_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. The inclusion of any substance within the scope of Directive 2004/37/EC is directly determined by its classification as carcinogenic or mutagenic categories 1 and 2.</p>
<p>The Commission recognizes that workers in the building industry are a significant proportion of EU workers that are exposed to quartz. This is why the Commission encourages the Construction sector to adhere to the agreement. The Commission notes that the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers in the EEC (EFBWW) participated as an observer at the beginning of the negotiations on this agreement.</p>
<p>The EU legislation on health and safety at work, including Directives 98/24/EC<a href="#defann_82_3" name="refann_82_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and 2004/37/EC, covers all sectors of economic activity, public and private.

<p>As of 1 May 2006, seven Member States have fully opened their labour markets (the United Kingdom, Ireland and Sweden – which had already fully opened their markets – and Spain, Portugal, Greece and Finland).

Italy has decided to significantly raise the quota for work permits for the EU-8 Member States. Germany and Austria have decided to maintain restrictions until 1 May 2009.</p>

<p>(EN) The competition rules of the EC Treaty establish the framework for ensuring undistorted competition in the common market. These rules ensure that media undertakings do not engage in anti-competitive behaviour or abuse a dominant position in what is a rapidly evolving media environment. These rules also ensure that competition between undertakings - irrespective of their private or public ownership - is not distorted through State aid which is incompatible with the Common Market. The Commission has clarified the State aid rules as laid down in the EC Treaty in a number of communications, including a communication on the application of State aid rules to public service broadcasting, which was published in the Official Journal in 2001<a href="#defann_86_1" name="refann_86_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. This Communication lays down the conditions under which Member States may grant financial support to public service broadcasters without unnecessarily distorting competition between public and private broadcasters. Concentrations between, or involving, media undertakings, to the extent that they fall under the Community’s jurisdiction, are also assessed in the light of EC competition rules.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it should also be noted that setting the rules for (media) ownership and assessing their implications for social, cultural and political changes lie within the competence of the Member States. This is of course subject to the need to ensure compatibility with Community law, particularly the principles of freedom of establishment, freedom to provide services and free movement of capital.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At Parliament’s April part-session I put a question to the Commission concerning the purpose, powers and composition of the High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment. The answer concerning the composition of the group, in which there is not a single representative of interest groups from the new EU Member States, is unsatisfactory. I am therefore asking an additional question which is directly related to the Commission’s answer (<a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2006-0230_EN.html">H-0230/06</a><a href="#defann_87_1" name="refann_87_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>).</p>
<p>The Commission explained that there were no experts from the new Member States in the High Level Group because the members of the group had been invited ad personam on the basis of their professional experience, and that they did not represent their national governments. The Commission stated that it had attempted to gather together experts in the areas of competitiveness, energy and the environment and that geographical distribution and national interests had played no part whatsoever. In view of this answer, I have the following questions.</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that there are no suitable experts in the new Member States who have equal expertise in the areas of industry, energy and the environment and who could work together with experts from the EU-15?</p>
<p>On what specific criteria did the Commission base its choice of experts?</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that experts from the EU-15 gathering information on the situation in all EU Member States will be sufficient to reduce the current large disparities between the so-called old and new Member States in the areas mentioned above?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The High Level Group on Competitiveness, Energy and the Environment is addressing the need for a more stable and predictable regulatory framework. By setting up this Group, the Commission seeks to promote the dialogue, notably with industry, relevant stakeholders and public authorities on issues of high policy priority in areas where competitiveness, energy and the environment inter-relate.</p>
<p>The High Level Group includes experts from the new European Union Member States. A Latvian citizen who has expertise in the public utilities sector of post-transition economies has been appointed a member of the High Level Group. Moreover, experts from the new Member States, notably Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic have been involved in the ad hoc groups that were created to provide relevant input for the reflections of the High Level Group.</p>
<p>The experts, participating in the various ad hoc groups set up to prepare the High Level Group meetings, have been selected on the basis of their expertise. They were selected and invited by the Commission on the basis of their specific competences and experience in the fields and issues being addressed by the ad hoc groups in which they were involved. These experts have been working at national, EU and international level. They have sent spontaneous applications or their names were suggested by stakeholders, including industry associations, trade unions, NGOs and other public and private organisations. This pro-active attitude of the experts and stakeholders is welcome and encouraged. There will be further possibilities for participating in the ad hoc groups that will be created in the future, or sending written contributions. The Commission will pay full attention to ensure a balanced representation in all these new ad hoc groups, including experts from EU-10 countries.</p>
<p>The High Level Group is mandated to give advice on policy challenges concerning the interrelationship between competitiveness, energy and the environment. Implementation of effective solutions to these challenges falls under the responsibilities of all actors, including industry, the Member States, the Commission, etc. To ensure that the meetings are not so large as to inhibit efficient participation, it is not possible to involve all the highly qualified people who have expressed an interest in participating. Nevertheless, the Commission debriefs a wide number of groups on which all Member States sit (including the Council Working Groups) on the work of the High Level Group and the main documents of the Group are available on-line (http://europa.eu.int/comm/enterprise/environment/hlg/hlg_en.htm).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Only three months ago, a large team of European observers was present as elections were held to the new Palestinian Legislative Council. Those observers verified that the election procedures were transparent and correct and declared that the Palestinians hade once again demonstrated their aspiration for and their resolve to operate within democratic structures. The election contest revealed Hamas to be the leading political force and, once again, everyone declared that they respected that result.</p>
<p>Recently, and because of the outcome of the election, the European Union decided to suspend the various forms of economic aid which it provided to the Palestinian Authority. The result of that decision is suffering for the Palestinian people since nearly all State officials have gone unpaid in recent months and basic commodities such as milk, bread and medicines are now luxury items.</p>
<p>How does the Commission intend to help put an end to the economic embargo on the Palestinian people and how does it intend to contribute towards the relaunching of a peace process?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the honourable Member that the Palestinian elections were transparent and that they demonstrated the commitment of the Palestinian people to work within democratic structures. The Commission supported the elections and respects their outcome. But the outcome has consequences - the emergence of a Palestinian Authority whose government is led by members of an organisation included in the EU terrorist list.</p>
<p>The Quartet and Council have therefore set out clear principles for engagement with the Palestinian Authority. The Council has stated that the EU could not continue business as usual.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of external affairs made clear what this means when she addressed this House on 26 April: the Commission has suspended payments going to the Palestinian government, but it has not suspended aid to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p>The Commission is all too aware that the economic, social and humanitarian crisis in the Palestinian territories is getting worse.</p>
<p>Therefore, since the beginning of this year, the Commission has stepped up our aid to the Palestinians. In February, the Commission announced a €120 million package of aid including help for the refugees, and with fuel bills. €100 million of this has already been paid. This represents an acceleration of our aid to the Palestinian people, not a suspension.</p>
<p>The Commission is looking at further measures to help the population along with other Quartet members and EU Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission is not imposing an economic embargo on the Palestinians as the honourable Member contends but on the contrary, it is doing all in its power to avert a crisis. But the Commission must be clear on one point: the key to preventing a humanitarian disaster in the Palestinian territories lies with Israel and the Palestinian Authority, not the international community.</p>
<p>The major issue is Israel withholding Palestinian customs and tax revenues. Withholding them means that basic services can’t be delivered, and salaries cannot be paid. The increased closures of territory in the West Bank and into and out of Gaza have also had dramatic effects.</p>
<p>The Commission is addressing these issues directly with Israel and in conjunction with international partners in the Quartet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
