<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maat (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, during the two months I have been working on the report, I have discovered that feelings run high on the subject of school milk in Europe. There have been many responses from schools throughout the European Union and also from school children. I found that remarkable in itself. There has also been much discussion because the Commission says let us go over to joint financing, which means reducing the European contribution. Many schools reacted particularly to this point and I have also noticed among my supporters that people wondered whether things would turn out all right for school milk, whether it would keep going as an instrument? In that regard I must say that I was very fortunate as a new Member of Parliament that, in dealing with the budget for 2001, Parliament in any case adopted my proposal to increase the school milk budget from EUR 53 to 83 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal now before us in the report that was unanimously accepted in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development – I would stress ‘unanimously’ – and it was particularly gratifying that all parties in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development support the report – boils down to the fact that more money is needed, EUR 96 million in fact. That does not come entirely within the budget, but the reality is such that, in view of the change in the dairy market, this small difference could also perhaps be found in the dairy budget. It is also for this reason that I would urge Parliament most strongly to support the report on school milk, because there is every reason to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is remarkable how casual we in Europe sometimes are about food. It is always there and in itself is no problem. But it is clear that school milk has an added value for the dietary pattern of children and contributes to a better diet, particularly in urban areas. This has been borne out by studies. The European Commission has also commissioned a study. I did find it to be rather limited, on the basis of a desk study, but in view of the considerable interest in Europe there is every reason to continue the regulation. There is extra money for education in the field of the Internet, the electronic superhighway and there is more attention paid to the environment and much attention to safe living and to social conditions and within this we should not neglect a sound policy on the proper use of food and undoubtedly on milk as well.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, and to see whether this regulation could be brought more up to date, I am pleased that the report has also been accepted in this sense in the Committee and I hope it will also be in Parliament. There is an expansion in the number of products that can be used in the school milk regulation. I am thinking of drinking yoghurt, low-fat cheese, skimmed milk and in this regard valuable amendments have been tabled by my own Group, and also by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, among others by Mr Pesl for Scandinavia. Many specific proposals have been made and that means that in this way we can adapt the school milk regulation in a better way and integrate it better into the current dietary pattern. That in itself makes for a stronger case. Anyone who thinks that the school milk regulation will rescue the dietary pattern is wrong. You must also be realistic. If this report is accepted by this House, every year about EUR 12 will be spent per child on subsidies for school milk and that is peanuts in my view. This can easily be justified socially within the budget and in respect of a sound nutritional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on the basis of the information provided I shall wholeheartedly recommend this report. I should like to thank the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for their unanimous support, that bodes well for the vote in this House. I should also like to thank the Commission for its willingness to provide the necessary information and also for preparing the report. I hope it will lead to a constructive position with regard to the implementation of this report. I understand that in any case the Council of Ministers will meet next Monday. It would therefore be an appropriate moment if Parliament were to approve this report and the school milk regulation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For more than 20 years, the European Union has been financing the free distribution of milk in primary and secondary schools. In recent years this action has amounted to an average annual expenditure of some EUR 90 million for more than 300 million litres of milk, benefiting around 10 million children and young people, or nearly 20% of eligible schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main reasons justifying this measure and why it should continue. The first is its social impact, as it ensures a minimum balanced diet for many children and young people who otherwise would not have access to one. The main beneficiaries are children and young people from disadvantaged social classes and poorer districts in both rural and urban areas. The second reason is that, as there is a structural surplus in the market for milk products, this measure also represents an incentive to dispose of milk in a far more useful and constructive way than by distributing it, denaturing it or exporting it to third countries at even greater cost. It is a pity that the European Union does not have more actions of this kind for other products, instead of dumping them on international markets by means of subsidies which are sometimes twice their price on those markets, which makes it difficult to understand the alleged objective of budgetary savings. The United States, which is famous for having a more individualist outlook with less solidarity, spends nearly 9 000 million dollars a year on distributing foods to schoolchildren, i.e. 100 times more than the European Union. And the European Union is now proposing to move away from 100% financing and is proposing 50% cofinancing, which will especially penalise less wealthy countries like Portugal. As a Portuguese national, I would be shocked if a measure of this kind were to be approved while my own country held the presidency of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is a good thing. I myself am a great supporter of school milk. In fact, I think that not only children but adults too should drink more milk. I regret therefore that there is no fresh milk available at the Parliament building in Brussels. I do hope that Mr Maat’s next battle will concentrate on making fresh milk available in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I do not support Mr Maat’s proposals. In the evaluation report on the school milk regulation that the Commission itself quotes, it says that if you only take account of the explicitly stated objectives of the regulation particularly to maintain and increase the consumption of dairy products and promote the sale of surpluses, the positive effects are marginal. Nevertheless, on 10 December, the Commission decided not to withdraw the measures but to halve the subsidy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have asked the Commission a number of questions in this regard. I asked Commissioner Fischler to what extent this measure corresponded with the subsidiarity principle. I believe that this measure could be implemented perfectly well by the national parliaments and that national MPs would be quite able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also not convinced about the scientific basis as far as certain aspects of public health are concerned. Moreover, when dealing with public health, the Commission must make a proposal on the basis of the chapter on “Public Health” in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it clear to me in the school milk regulation how much will be spent on administration costs. It is such a small proportion of the overall milk production that I feel that this weighs particularly heavily on the European Commission budget. I am also not sure what the financial consequences will be after enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not an opponent of school milk as such but I do object to the way we are going about it. I believe that the Commission must confine itself to the core tasks and leave other matters to the Member States. I support the Commission proposal but not the proposals of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been an excellent signal from the EU to the heart of the people for decades now, and we have been able to get it across via children, school pupils, schools and homes. In that respect it has to continue, and, as Mr Maat said, be brought up to date and this issue, which is in the common good, should be promoted.

One clear result, of course, of the proposal before us to curtail or remove this subsidy on school milk will be decreased availability of milk and a drop in the consumption of milk in schools. I ask you sincerely: is that what you want to see happening?</p>
<p class="contents">The nutritional aspect is surely the central element here and the continuation of the consumption of milk by schoolchildren is what we should be working towards. The proposals before us definitely militate against that.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I suggest to you what might happen as a result. There are two possibilities. Children will switch to consuming non-nutritional products or, God forbid, we will move closer towards a situation where children will have to pay for milk consumed, thus discriminating against poor children from deprived communities. We all acknowledge the aim here. It is to cut milk subsidies. But to use schoolchildren as the means towards that end is a sinister way to go about it, especially in a world that is becoming far more health-conscious by the day. This is the age of non-GM food and organic products, and the proposals before us represent a major step backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be clear. Several Member States will not operate this scheme at all if the present subsidy is withdrawn or decreased. That is the reality of the situation. This would be a catastrophe, not only for the health of schoolchildren – our future citizens – but to the viability of communities also.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a part of Wales, where GDP per head of the population is less than 75% of the European Union average, in other words, an Objective 1 area. I am not proud of that. It is an indication of our deprived status. Cutting the subsidy, however, would make my community even poorer, a community whose farmers have lost 80% of their income in 2½ years. This is not the European Union that I thought my nation had joined. We were looking to a Europe of cohesion that seeks to bolster its deprived communities and help its poorest citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the misconception that Member States will somehow foot this bill and make up the deficit on the basis that it is their responsibility to deal with health and social policy. Can I tell you that my Member State, the UK, is already prevaricating on the provision of additional money for Wales and for Scotland to match European funds, a point that I and my colleagues have already highlighted previously in this Chamber. This is not unique to my nation. Sadly, it affects other nations as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Farmers then are told to diversify, to become multifunctional. These are the buzzwords now in the European Union. Yet they have already diversified. They have already become as multifunctional as humanly possible. It is time we rewarded them, particularly in the peripheral and deprived communities of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Cutting this subsidy would destroy an industry already on its knees. We need to give a window of opportunity to these people and provide them with the assistance to sustain themselves as they undoubtedly face the most difficult period economically they have ever faced. It is clear to me that the proposals before us are not merely a means to curtail the subsidy, but rather, in the event of a lack of participation by Member States in the wake of the subsidy cut, to terminate it entirely.</p>
<p class="contents">This continued erosion of the milk industry is, I am afraid, part of a general trend that we are witnessing throughout the agricultural industry. Without people farming in our villages and communities, there will be no rural communities; nobody left to service the needs of those of us that sometimes visit rural areas for recreation. The process of amalgamating farms and the buying-up of farm units by consortia pushing up prices unrealistically is already well advanced in my nation of Wales and is becoming the sad pattern in other regions and nations as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we should call a halt to this general erosion of our rural communities. At the present moment in time, that requirement transcends the need to cut milk subsidies. Defending communities is far, far more important. We must keep our milk farmers farming and the communities where they earn their living as viable entities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Agricultural Committee deserve every support in this regard. Mr Maat has done well in a very difficult situation and I wish him every success.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is proposing to reduce the level of Community aid, by amending the regulation on the common organisation of the market in milk and milk products. The choice of cofinancing involves the risk that certain Member States might be reticent about supporting the project, mainly because of financial constraints, and the effect would be to reduce the amount of the available budgetary appropriation and thus establish discrimination between European schoolchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">Milk distribution in schools contributes to the maintenance of consumption of milk products, and those same milk products are vital to healthy nutrition for children, so that they can grow up healthy. Subsidising milk means teaching children balanced eating habits at an age when lifelong eating patterns and tastes are being formed. That role finds particular resonance in this age of eating disorders and unhealthy diets. For example, the increase in the number of obese children in Europe as a result of the culture of sweet, highly coloured fizzy drinks is alarming.</p>
<p class="contents">Must we remind people that milk provides a crucial part of our protein, calcium, vitamin and mineral requirements? It strengthens the capacity of young children who drink it to protect themselves against diseases caused by nutritional anarchy. Mr Maat rightly mentions the way eating patterns change with our changing lifestyle. Increasingly young people go off to school without eating any breakfast or without having any milk in their morning meal. Nor do we forget that some children from very deprived backgrounds skip breakfast for financial reasons. These children are exposed to dietary deficiencies and have difficulty concentrating at school.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is washing its hands of all this, while heading up lots of other programmes that cost a great deal more. Why undermine the very one which affects the health of European children? At a time of upheaval in the role of our schools as a training workshop for life, the distribution of subsidised milk …</p>

<p class="contents">In many countries and areas – such as where I come from in Northern Ireland – young children might not have had the opportunity to have that nourishment and that nutritional support supplied by milk if it had not been for the milk provided to them in schools.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hope and trust that they will begin to appreciate and to continue to drink milk. One thing which amazes me, especially when the agricultural community and dairy farmers are going through such difficult times, is that people are prepared to buy many other products and pay substantial amounts of money for them, but they are not prepared to pay the same amount of money for milk, either for themselves, or for their children.</p>
<p class="contents">Milk provides a very healthy and balanced diet, something we should all support. The European Union should take that on board. It is good value for money. We do not always achieve that. We are in a situation in Europe at the moment where we are pouring millions of euros into the agricultural industry, yet the farmers have never been worse off in their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to go back to the drawing board and ask ourselves what our priorities are. I want to thank Mr Maat. He has challenged us to look to the future, not just in relation to milk itself, but also to milk products and ways in which we can encourage children to drink milk.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is complete nonsense. It is totally wrong from a nutritional point of view and it is impossible to administer. Currently, full-cream milk is fully subsidised, semi-skimmed milk is semi-subsidised and skimmed milk receives no subsidy. The aim of schemes such as this is to do away with surplus stocks, and since full-cream milk contains the most butterfat, it receives the highest subsidy. We should instead award subsidies per pupil. I would have preferred it if we had set milk prices lower so that we could abolish the bureaucratic milk quotas. In the longer term we must change the EU's agricultural policy so that we can put an end to artificial excess prices and surplus stocks. However, the school milk scheme is one of the better schemes. It is not just beneficial to farmers. The scheme is also to the advantage of children and their parents, especially if it is changed so that it offers subsidies to low-fat products. Children do not need so much fat. Furthermore, a scheme with subsidies per pupil would be much easier to administer. There is an enormous amount of administration involved in the present scheme. I have received many complaints from schools which cannot work out how to administer the scheme. It is a real science calculating the fat percentages in milk and cheese. The schools often end up having to pay back large sums. It is not that they are out to cheat; they simply cannot work out how to administer the scheme. I think, therefore, that we must vote for the amendments of my good colleague and friend, Niels Busk. The scheme which he is recommending is administratively and nutritionally the only correct one.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And thanks as ever for the usual good work of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. I would also like to thank my good colleague and close friend, Freddy Blak, of the Socialist Group, for his support for my amendment. The school milk scheme concerns health and nutrition. Children and infants must learn healthy eating habits, and milk, with its protein and calcium content, is a very important part of this. On behalf of the Liberal Group, Mr Pesälä and I put forward three amendments which basically aim to make the school milk scheme a lot easier to administer, but which also seek to make the scheme more flexible with regard to the products which are subsidised. There are various traditions relating to which dairy products are consumed, and the scheme is simplified by awarding the subsidy on the basis of a quarter of a litre of milk per pupil per school-day. For products other than full-cream milk, the subsidy should be calculated on the basis of low-fat solids or a maximum butterfat content of 50%. In this way the scheme takes account of the differences in the milk traditions which exist in the different Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As soon as the term cofinancing is mentioned in terms of agriculture, people’s hackles rise. Many see cofinancing as the renationalisation of the common agricultural policy. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development is also against the Commission’s plans. With such a viewpoint, Parliament can make the most of it. Will we read in the newspaper tomorrow “European Parliament in favour of school milk subsidies – to the rescue of the dairy sector”? Are we not kidding ourselves and the sector with this attitude? Is massive opposition to cofinancing in the interests of the sector in the long term? I do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to make do with the financial package established in Agenda 2000 and to deal with the enlargement of the Union. If agricultural policy is not changed we shall not be able to pay for it. The Union should develop its policy within this context. The main question here is, how can we operate as efficiently as possible with the limited resources of the European Union? Must we continue to burden the agriculture budget with a school milk programme of about EUR 90 million a year? Is it not more sensible to seek possibilities of financing such programmes elsewhere? If we wish to guarantee the agricultural sector a reasonable level of support, then that is urgently required. If we do not do that, then the Commission will undoubtedly try in other ways to remain below the agricultural ceiling. What do you think about a reduction on the direct income supplements? Those who are against cofinancing bring such painful economies a lot closer. We do not wish to be part of that. Relieving the EU budget by means of creative solutions, such as cofinancing, seems to us a better option for the agricultural sector itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with the objection to the fact that school milk is distributed to people at meetings in this building who certainly do not need it.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You will have seen from the debate that the school milk scheme is a very sensitive issue indeed, on which there are many different shades of opinion, and that means that he certainly did not have an easy job.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the amendments proposed in Mr Maat’s report in effect totally reject the Commission proposal. I cannot therefore accept the amendments in question, which are Amendments Nos 1, 5, 6, 7, 10 and 12. I am still convinced that the cofinancing proposed would promote the commitment of state and municipal authorities – and that of school authorities and the dairy industry – which is, in turn, a prerequisite for the success of all of these efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite simply wrong to say that the level of aid will drop from schoolchildren’s point of view. The level of aid will remain the same, only the source of funding will change, and no one can seriously maintain that aid is only good if it comes totally from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also quite happy to concede that there are health, nutrition and social policy objectives here. But there is one point I wish to make, and this is also the reason why a particular Treaty article has been taken as the legal basis here: in the field of agricultural policy, we can only justify aid that leads to additional sales. If the real objective is to take social policy or health policy measures, then these should be financed under health and social policy and not, as it were, through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 9 are designed to cover a broader range of milk products under the scheme. In this respect the Commission would like to maintain the existing scheme, in which the selection of subsidised products is a matter for the Commission. Although I cannot therefore accept these amendments, I have no problems with the underlying message, which it is worth conveying, and that is that the current range of products needs to be reviewed, and I will ensure that this issue continues to be dealt with and discussed in the Management Committee for Milk and Milk Products.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Amendment No 3 is in the form of a statement, so that I do not think it would be appropriate to incorporate the text into the regulation. As regards the practical side of the proposal, I fear that this amendment would lead to varying levels of support in different Member States and to dramatic fluctuations in the level of aid within a short time. And as I am sure that no one would want that, it would be better to keep the existing provision, which is clear, based on objective criteria and which guarantees general stability.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reasons, I am unable to accept Amendments Nos 8 and 10, which are designed to link the level of aid to milk components other than fat. Finally, Amendments Nos 8 and 9 are intended to make it clear that the aid will be paid for a fixed quantity of milk per schoolchild per day. This would essentially mean maintaining the existing position, so that is in fact another argument as to why these amendments cannot be accepted. Thank you for your attention.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
