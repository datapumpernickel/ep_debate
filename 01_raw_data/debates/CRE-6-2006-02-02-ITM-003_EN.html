<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Margot Wallström, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I should like to thank you and the honourable Members for being here this early morning. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to present to you the White Paper on a European communication policy adopted by the Commission at its meeting yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first time I have spoken about the White Paper in this House. I first announced it during the debate on the Herrero report, which has been an important reference for my subsequent work. During the preparation stages for the White Paper I regularly informed the European Parliament about my ideas, meeting with the different political groups, committees etc., and I am sure that several of you will find the key concepts and messages of the White Paper quite familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">The feedback and encouragement I have received make me believe that I will continue to find, in this House, the most committed and precious ally when it comes to communication. Communication is first and foremost a matter of democracy. People have a right to know what the European Union does and what it stands for, and as citizens they have a right to fully participate in the European project. This is the key message of the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a worrying gap between the European Union and its citizens. Seven out of ten interviewed in Eurobarometer polls say that they know little or nothing about the European Union. More than half feel that their voice does not count when it comes to European issues. Trust in the European institutions is falling and so is the number of those who believe that Europe brings benefits to them or their countries. The perception of a communication gap between the European Union and its citizens is not new. It has been a subject of discussion in EU circles at least since the referendums that preceded the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. In this respect recent referendums on the constitutional treaty have been a harsh wake-up call.</p>
<p class="contents">Bridging the gap between the European Union and its citizens has become more urgent than ever. To move forward, the European project needs to be anchored in people’s wishes and expectations. It must belong to citizens, not just to a small elite based in Brussels, or in a couple of big European capitals. The White Paper is the Commission’s proposal to respond to this challenge and to lay the foundation of a European Union communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the main purpose of a European communication policy be? The White Paper argues for developing a working European public sphere, where the European debate can unfold and citizens can participate. This is a concept that the European Parliament embraced some time ago, and it is now central to the Commission’s vision of a communication policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper underlines the importance of developing a true European political culture, with pan-European political groups, pan-European media and fora or meeting places where citizens can meet and discuss issues of common interest. However, I shall clarify immediately that all of this is not to replace or diminish the role of national, regional or local levels of political structures and media activity; to the contrary, it complements them.</p>
<p class="contents">Probably the most urgent thing that is needed to bring about a European political culture is to make sure that European issues are reflected in national, regional and local debates. The development of a European public sphere is of course a very far-reaching project and it will take time. It goes well beyond the remit of the Commission. The role of the European Parliament will be crucial in this respect, but we know that we will only succeed if all those involved – and Member States, in the first place – are ready to commit and take responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the White Paper is a call to action by all EU institutions, by the European Union governments and political parties, by civil society and the media in all EU countries. It proposes that we start work in five main areas: first by defining common principles. An EU communication policy must be based on the fundamental recognition that all EU citizens have certain rights, for example, the right to fair and full information about the European Union; the right to hear the full range of views about the EU; and the right to have their voices heard by policy makers.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper proposes that these principles be enshrined in a framework document – a charter or perhaps a code of conduct – to which all the key players would commit themselves on a voluntary basis to agree on the principles for communication. We need those common principles to guide our common action and to give credibility and legitimacy to our communication activities; to make clear that EU communication is not about selling Europe or producing propaganda, it is about enhancing our democracy. It is a tool for citizens to assess whether or not their rights are respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The second work area the White Paper proposes is empowering citizens. How can an EU communication policy contribute to that? The White Paper identifies three ways forward: to work more together on civic education, to connect citizens with each other and to connect the citizens with the institutions. Civic education is a national or regional responsibility, but there is a European added value. The EU can help to ensure exchange of best practice and facilitate the development of common educational tools, so that the European dimension is better addressed. I meet this all the time when I travel to Member States. Teachers and all those involved in these activities say ‘do we really have to reinvent the wheel? Could we not have a better exchange of practices or material or experience?’</p>
<p class="contents">New forums for public discussion on European issues are essential for building mutual trust, respect and willingness to work together towards common objectives. Also, good two-way communication between the citizens and public institutions is essential in a healthy democracy. The present drive to make the EU institutions more responsive, open and accessible needs to continue to be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area in which the paper proposes working concerns the media and new technologies. The media are key players in communication policy and it is vital that public institutions at all levels of governance find innovative ways of working with the national, regional and local media. We also need to discuss together how to ensure that all views are fairly represented in these debates and how we can provide citizens with full, fair and factual information through a wide range of channels, not only the press, radio and television but also the internet. One of the proposals is also, as you have seen from the media coverage already, is that we should upgrade our existing Europe by Satellite – an interinstitutional service – and, for example, regional TV, which belongs to the users of the EBS service.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth working area is understanding public opinion. That is a challenge for policy makers. They need to stay in tune with European public opinion as citizens’ views on any issue can vary quite dramatically from one country or region to another. The European Commission has been a front-runner in developing modern tools, such as the Eurobarometer surveys, for analysing public opinion. Our White Paper encourages debate on how we could improve our use of these tools to make more in-depth analysis and use that more efficiently to feed into the policy-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth area for joint discussion is how to make the partnership work: we call it ‘how to do the job together’. How can EU governments cooperate more closely with one another and with Brussels on informing and consulting citizens? How can the European Union institutions work together more effectively and do more to decentralise their efforts? Local and regional authorities are well placed to engage in a real dialogue with citizens. How best can they channel the view of local communities to the Brussels policy makers? What more can political parties and NGOs do to raise public awareness on European issues and stimulate public debate?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not have ready-made answers to all these questions and we would not presume to lecture others involved as to what they should do. The White Paper therefore launches a wide consultation process and invites all those involved to think hard about these questions and come forward with their own ideas. We have never had a public consultation on communicating Europe. It is high time to do so if we are serious about putting citizens at the centre of our activities. I would like the European Parliament to be our closest ally and supporter in this process. The structures for this cooperation already exist and we can build on them to better structure and coordinate our work.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I should like to quote the philosopher John Dewey. He wrote ‘there is more than a verbal tie between the words common, community, and communication. Try the experiment of communicating, with fullness and accuracy, some experience to another, especially if it be somewhat complicated, and you will find your own attitude towards your experience changing’.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication helps understanding, builds common values and creates communities. That is what the European Union needs more than anything. Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing your views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I very much welcome your White Paper on a European communication policy. It comes at a time when the gap between Europe and its citizens is widening. A sense of alienation from Brussels pervades our electorate: alienation from its institutions and from politics in general. The poor electoral turnout in 2004 was sadly a clear reminder of the need for the EU to learn to communicate more with its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is not only a question of having <span class="italic">more</span> communication in Europe: we need <span class="italic">better</span> communication. And in order to communicate better, Europe also needs to listen more. European leaders have lost contact with their public and I agree with you, Commissioner, when you say in your communication that citizens expect Europe to offer them guarantees of prosperity, solidarity and security in the face of globalisation. Our citizens are not worried about the nitty gritty details of institutional reform, they are worried about their jobs, they are worried about Europe’s 20 million unemployed, so I certainly very much support your new approach which moves away from one-way communication to reinforced dialogue, from a Brussels-based to a more decentralised approach, from – as you say in your communication – institution-centred to citizen-centred communication.</p>
<p class="contents">I have certainly tried to do this in Scotland, in my own constituency. I started an essay competition amongst schools to try to inspire interest amongst school pupils in European affairs. Indeed tomorrow I am going to Aberdeen to address council leaders on the financial perspective, and that is European communication in action. However, you must ensure that this White Paper does not merely remain a consultation exercise, inconsequential and detached from the very same people whom it is trying to reach. We in Europe tend to be very good at debating, and less good at delivering.</p>
<p class="contents">Our ideas must be followed by action. I wondered, when you mentioned the importance of the Erasmus and Citizens for Europe programmes as a way of bridging the gap between the EU and its citizens, whether this is not slightly contradictory, given the fact that these programmes have actually suffered significant cuts in the 2006 budget. We may need better understanding and more details on how exactly you intend to finance this massive public relations strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Communication, transparency, open access to documents and involvement in policy-making are not even fully developed amongst ourselves, the MEPs, the EU’s representatives. This House represents the very people we are trying to communicate with, but sadly this Parliament is not consulted enough, or often when it is too late. It is often not listened to, it is often contradicted by the unaccountable and impenetrable workings of the Council. That is why, Commissioner, while welcoming very much your objectives and your efforts I urge you to consider adding another ‘D’ to your Dialogue, Debate and Democracy plan. That would be ‘D’ for Decision: a decision to act.</p>

The diagnosis is clear and the White Paper is detailed in its prescriptions for dealing with the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank the Commissioner warmly for the efforts she has invested in taking us this far in addressing this crucial problem. We will be discussing many of the group proposals in detail later. I would like to use this opportunity to make some general remarks about communications in general.</p>
<p class="contents">In communications less is more. The essence of good communication is to put a strong message in simple language. We need to explain to the people what we are doing and why it matters to them. Once they know that their interests are affected by our decisions, they will take care of the public sphere themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">The White Paper seeks investment in mechanisms, procedures and new technology to facilitate the channels of communication. That is a good thing, but it does not address the quality of what is to be sent down those channels of communication. It talks about connecting the citizens and about public-sphere debating. That is acceptable to us. However, before people do any of this, they have to care. Only then can they be empowered. We have to show them why they should care about what the European Union is doing. The responsibility in dealing with those problems lies with us all – all the institutions – and not only with the press room downstairs. Partnership is, therefore, also an important concept put forward in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, it would be good to invest in new websites and our own TV channels, but we already have the world’s largest group of accredited correspondents on our doorstep: 1300 journalists who are hungry to report good-quality stories to audiences all over the world. If we produced timely and newsworthy stories for journalists, then the headlines, websites, new TV channels and public-sphere debates will follow.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the reality is that most of our communication efforts are foundering because the EU fails on the basic issues. The EU offers one-size-fits-all news announcements instead of making more strenuous efforts to find new messages to capture the interest of specific media groups in our different countries and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite rightly, the White Paper places some emphasis on opinion polling and the need to understand European public opinion. But if it uses this resource correctly, why does the Commission persist in coming forward with such deeply unpopular proposals like the port services directive that we dealt with a month ago? The White Paper talks about the need to listen to the people, and rightly so. Here was a case of the Commission not even listening to its own Parliament, never mind the people. On that point, it is not enough to say that Europe needs to listen to the people: it also needs to act on what they say. What is the incentive for people to talk to us in Brussels if they have no assurance that what they say will matter or change what we are thinking of doing?</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome this White Paper because it is kick-starting a much-needed debate. This House should welcome the Commissioner’s important contribution. We in the European Parliament must play our part in ensuring that the European Union develops with the support of its citizens and that it serves their interests in the best possible way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gérard Onesta, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR) </span>Your communication on the White Paper started off very well, Mrs Wallström, inasmuch as I read on the first page that communication goes hand-in-hand with its content.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expected to find a political analysis of what is causing the breakdown in relations that everyone – you, us, everybody – can see taking place between Europeans and the European institutions. In that regard, I admit to being very disappointed because the self-criticism goes no further than the sentence I just uttered. In your opinion, we just need to speak more positively about Europe and that will quite obviously restore Europeans’ erstwhile confidence in their institutions and the Community project. Can one seriously claim, however, that the liberal objectives fully embraced by Mr Barroso’s team do not have some bearing on everything that is – rightly – worrying EU citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that you point out certain lines to pursue in your document. It contains some attractive formulas: decentralisation, participation and culture. Over and above those terms, though, what is there of any substance in it? I get the impression that you mistake communication for dialogue. Democracy is not just about communication; above all it is about the genuine involvement of nations via their institutions. When Mr Barroso says to us at the end of summer: ‘I have got the message, I am withdrawing the texts on which there is no consensus’, and withdraws dozens of them but retains the Services Directive, I feel as though I did not campaign for the same thing as him in the referendum, and that is something I cannot countenance. For my part, I did not feel that the Directive on the Protection of Workers posed a problem, unlike the Services Directive, which poses some problems in practice. It is not enough to dress up the policies; they perhaps need changing.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression that your approach is quite technocratic and elitist. Erasmus is a fantastic programme but, as the previous speaker said, it does not have a huge bearing on the nations because we do not have the resources for it to do so. Saying that we are relying on new technologies, which are seemingly the answer to everything, is perhaps tantamount to believing that multiplying the number of websites will be sufficient to deal with the problems arising from people’s opinion of the EU - problems that we are, moreover, aware of. Do we really need to relaunch a whole series of Eurobarometer surveys to know that our citizens’ concerns are to do with relocations, social precarity, uncertainty, the health crisis and environmental upheaval? I am almost certain that Eurobarometer is going to reveal to you what I have just told you in a single sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">What resources are you putting in place in the face of these anxieties? When I was draftsman for the Prince Programme in the framework of the 2005 budget, I recall that the Commission had proposed splitting the funds for this programme in half, and that was after the shock of the double ‘No’ vote on the draft Constitution. It was Parliament, in this Chamber, that subsequently multiplied the funds by six.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, your intentions are laudable but, once again, so long as you do not specify what you want to gain support for at political level, there will be no point in working on the packaging, on the little bow that you are going to wrap around it: reviewing one’s communication is a good idea, but reviewing one’s policy is a better idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More journalists are to be employed to tout their own virtues, and a fresh news agency is to be set up so that you can decide what the media are to write about the EU and so that you can provide each new item of news with an easily understood message, extolling the EU. The Commission does not need a communication policy. What it needs is transparency and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">It should start by opening the accounts to parliamentary scrutiny. Give the EU’s auditors access to all expenditure so that they can monitor this. Publish the names of those who are paid to give good advice in the Commission’s secret working parties. Open the drawer containing letters of formal notice, so that voters and elected representatives can see which aspects of our laws the Commission does not like. Tell us who in the Commission is voting for what. Are there, for example, Commissioners who have opposed Mrs Wallström’s communication plan or Mr Kallas’s Transparency Initiative. It is better to have transparency, democracy and proximity to the people than to have more money for public relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that we need a pilot programme to open up the great European debates, to open up the Councils in which the Ministers discuss issues affecting the citizens, with a clear code of conduct that makes the debate comprehensible. I believe that, following all of the constitutional problems, this pilot project could be seen as a sign of a will for transparency and open debate. I propose that that project be a public discussion of the Bolkestein Directive in front of the television cameras.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much talk about the transparency of the Council, but nothing concrete is ever done.</p>
<p class="contents">This would lead people to talk about this debate; a debate to present Europe to the public, to demonstrate positions clearly and so that the people know what is decided in relation to the issues that affect each of us in our daily lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add that, according to Article 8 of the Council’s Rules of Procedure, any member of the Commission or the Council can propose a public debate of this kind. You could propose this debate yourself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, action must follow. If we talk about reaching out to citizens we cannot cut down on the programmes where we actually do just that. On this point, we have exactly the same position as the European Parliament as far as I understand. We want a budget which hopefully is increased and definitely not reduced. This is also our position in the ongoing budget negotiations. We will make our views absolutely clear on that. We certainly hold the same position on that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Wiersma, I think you made a very valid point, because this is also about the participation of citizens. I have repeated that democracy is not just a spectator sport. It requires an engagement from citizens, but they also have to be able to acquire the basic knowledge about what is going on and how to exert influence. There is therefore also an obligation on us to make sure that there is access, for example, to civic education, where one can learn how it all works and how one can have a voice in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the services directive is a very good example of how simply telling the story does not help if the basis is not there, if the consultation has not been carried out. In the end we will have nobody advocating the proposal. I think that this is an example of where we really have to do the repair work. This is about engaging citizens. Yesterday, one of my colleagues at a Commission meeting said that when the Commission consulted children about a proposal on children’s rights, the proposal which came back had been completely turned around. Children have another order of priorities. We learned a lot from that consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what it is all about. It is about the ethics of communication. It cannot be disconnected from the policy because communication can only be as good as its content. It has to be about the policy content, what we want to do to change the reality of things. However, we also have to clarify which rules and attitudes towards democracy and democratic procedure we adopt. We must also clarify how communication and the ethics of communication are an essential tool in helping us. That is what we are establishing here: the tools, framework and procedures that enable us to communicate, to have a two-way dialogue with citizens. That is what we are trying to build here.</p>
<p class="contents">You are correct to ask about the budget. We are only asking for a few more staff to help during the whole consultation period. It is too early to say what we need for the concrete proposals because we are carrying out consultations about that. We have to come back on the specific proposals and action plans with proper impact assessments, budgets and concrete figures. For the moment, we are only setting the consultation period and putting that in place.</p>
<p class="contents">When I heard Mr Bonde’s description, I wondered whether we had been reading the same document. I have to respond to the whole issue of a press agency and this is partly a language issue. We have never had any other idea than to upgrade the service that exists today within the Directorate-General for Communications. It is called ‘Europe by Satellite’. We have very few people to carry out the service that provides pictures and sound for radio and television all over Europe. We do it in 20 languages. If we want to have better quality and more facts and figures and to better cover what happens in the Council, Parliament and the Commission, then we will need more staff and equipment. As I said earlier, this is how we help regional television or radio stations that cannot afford to send correspondents to Brussels. If we are serious about providing that inside, interinstitutional information, then we need the people to do it. In the end, we will need a highly professional person to decide what is most interesting from a journalistic point of view: should we send out a team to Parliament today, or should it be in another place covering a different story? We already do that, but with very few resources.</p>
<p class="contents">This does not conflict with the web-TV that Parliament has already decided to invest in, which covers what happens inside the institution, but complements efforts to better communicate with citizens. This has been the idea from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">The Brussels-based journalists are not happy. They see a risk of competition. I see very little competition in covering press conferences in 20 languages. I do not think this is a problem. However, everybody is trying to cover their territory. We have to be realistic. If we want the stories out there, at local and regional level and on radio and TV – which are the sources that most of our citizens use today to get information about what happens in the EU – then we need to invest in radio and TV. We are the only ones who can provide these pictures and sounds from inside the institutions. Nobody will be competing with us on that. This is what we want to do with our proposal in the White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">There was no vote on this. We have discussions and very rarely vote in the Commission. During the whole five years of the Prodi Commission we held votes only about five or ten times. So there was no vote, but strong support for my White Paper. I am glad to be able to tell you that. This is not only about voting. You are right in saying that we must tell the citizens that this is another political arena and that political discussion is crucial. We need to debate. We will have different ideological viewpoints on issues and the discussion will go on in the European arena. We have to help citizens to be able to follow and understand what goes on and to have a say. You will find some ideas on how to do that in our White Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with Mr Hammerstein Mintz. I hope we will see a pilot project where Council meetings will become open. This is also a way to end the blame game, where the institutions blame each other. In the end it is the citizens who lose out, because they are unable to follow or judge what is going on and what their ministers say in the Council. I agree that Council meetings should be open and citizens should be able to follow them. We will contribute whatever we can to make that possible. It is also the Commission’s position that openness and transparency are absolutely crucial in the context of improving communications. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s communication strategy is worthy enough in aim, but I doubt it will in fact achieve much because the reality of the EU as a whole, not just the workings of the Commission itself, are very far from ideal. The people are accordingly sceptical, it is not that they misunderstand the EU, they understand it only too well.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an old saying in Scotland that you cannot polish a turnip and no amount of presentation will disguise the fact that the EU has a structural problem which we are not addressing. The institutional mechanisms of, and subject matter dealt with by the various parts of the EU must be addressed in the light of enlargement, or risk continued stagnation. Only real reform will bring the EU closer to the citizen and it is upon that reform we should concentrate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
