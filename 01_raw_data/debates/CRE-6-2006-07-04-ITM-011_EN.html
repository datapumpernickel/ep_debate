<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pilar del Castillo Vera (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the report to be debated next is very closely related to what has just been debated.</p>
<p class="contents">Until now we have been debating the consequences of essentially industrial restructuring for the European economies and, in particular, for workers. The report we are going to debate next relates to those measures, approaches or policies that may have a positive effect in terms of resolving the employment situations faced by workers belonging to industries that close or relocate.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we are going to debate now relates to the factor that is fundamental to any possible solution to these situations and that has a decisive effect on the development of the European economies and hence the European societies' prospects for progress: it is simply the concept of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation is the key word; innovation is the concept that could offer us a possible solution to the problems that were being discussed in the last debate and others or, alternatively, take us further away from that solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Within that context and within the broader perspective of revitalising the Lisbon Agenda, the Commission presented a report that was intended to integrate a whole series of decisions that had been taking place since 2000 and until recently, which relate to innovation and which propose a series of measures for improving innovation in the European economies.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to comment on three essential aspects which are dealt with in my report. Firstly, education and training – and I would add mindset, since there is a huge problem here in terms of attitudes to dealing with innovation. Secondly, organisation, with a view to ensuring that innovation takes place more effectively. And thirdly, funding.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to education and training, I believe that they are fundamental – as certain Members pointed out during the previous debate. Life-long training, flexible training, training that enables people to adapt to the new needs of the market, are absolutely crucial if we want a society in which there are genuine opportunities for everybody at all times of change.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that there is a fundamental problem of attitude. A society that banishes the values of capacity for enterprise, of effort, of being self-demanding and, ultimately, of innovation which is linked to all of those factors will not be able to survive.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we must be very aware of what we are facing. Others are behind us, others have been successful for a long time, but European society, or a large proportion of European society, licks its wounds constantly, it complains constantly, with the paradoxical result that those with the most wounds are the ones that end up in the worst situation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential to promote a change of mindset, in order to restore those values that made European societies great societies that strove forward and that were in the vanguard of all of humanity's activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely believe that this is fundamental and, of all the aspects that we could discuss and which appear in this and in other reports, I would like to focus on this essential dimension: we in the European Parliament, in the Commission and the Council must reach a great agreement, a great pact, in order to ensure that the values of effort, of being self-demanding, of taking action, of enterprise, are instilled in Europeans from their birth and in their training. If not, we will be left behind. The clock is ticking here as well. If we do not move forward, European societies will be left behind, and we will be largely responsible for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all agreed that structural change has been with us since a long way back and will continue to be with us for a long time. I also got the impression that most people here in this House were of the opinion that the right answer to structural change is innovation. Structural change takes place when a product or a process is no longer modern enough. The answer cannot be to take it lying down and to leave it up to others; instead we must face up to this competition through innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would like to get to the point at which the capacity and readiness for innovation are understood as a leading political, social and economic principle of the European Union. This is not merely a technical exercise; innovation is in fact something that first has to be mentally understood, something that has to be willed. This also requires the readiness to accept change. We have put innovation at the centre of our strategy for growth and employment for good reason: because a non-protectionist economic order, one that is based on freedom, can only succeed by means of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">It needs a society that supports and promotes innovation, and it needs a political framework that promotes innovation. That is precisely what we are doing, and on two levels. We are doing this on the level of the Member States, and it is very important that there is a wide-ranging emphasis on innovation policies and initiatives in the national reform programmes for the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy, and that the Commission accords the highest priority to innovation in its reassessment of the Lisbon Strategy this year.</p>
<p class="contents">On the level of the European Union we have recently set out a great number of initiatives, all of them aimed at promoting innovation: from the subsidy rules that as was specifically requested earlier in the debate are specifically directed towards innovation, through to the general financial tools for setting up new and innovative businesses, all the way to means to enhance the use of intellectual property and to develop capacities for research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">We are striving for an innovation policy that forms an integrated whole. I am glad to be able to tell you that, at the Commission’s meeting with the Finnish Presidency yesterday in order to prepare the programme for the Presidency in the second half of 2006, innovation was at the top of the agenda, and was treated as the most important theme. I am very confident that this Finnish Presidency is especially suited to advancing the theme of innovation, because Finland is a prime example of how an innovation policy that is willed, focused and intelligently carried out can achieve the extensive modernisation of a country, making it competitive on an international level.</p>
<p class="contents">I always think that we should learn from the good examples of others, and in this case we should do just that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The promotion of technological research and the acquisition of scientific knowledge are the major challenge facing Europe in the 21st century. Nonetheless, research, development and innovation are defined as complicated, demanding and costly procedures which require special political, economic and social management. Thus, in order to achieve this specific objective, we need, among other things, to implement pioneering decisions and design high-risk investment programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what is mainly needed is the creative mobilisation of communities and the dynamic participation of the workers, both in the production and reproduction of scientific knowledge and in the new potential that it offers.</p>
<p class="contents">This finding could very soon be proven in the following four lines of action:</p>
<p class="contents">- by constantly upgrading the infrastructure of and action by educational institutes and research centres, given that the driving force behind development is the acquisition of knowledge by man;</p>
<p class="contents">- by disseminating scientific knowledge in the field of production, by redefining both the infrastructure and workers' skills and qualifications;</p>
<p class="contents">- by applying a policy to increase jobs and to redistribute income fairly, given that high productivity and poverty result in recession and unemployment;</p>
<p class="contents">- by fundamentally reducing working times, so that workers can regain their creative spirit and redress the balance lost between work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">The technological revolution presents two diametrically opposed economic and social prospects: on the one hand, the creative challenge and, on the other hand, the threat of extended inequalities. Whether we will produce and use scientific knowledge in a way that highlights once again the Europe of development, knowledge, solidarity and equality will depend on our political choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first point concerns research. I should like once again to point out that the Union has fallen behind in implementing the Lisbon Strategy in the area of education and training. I did, moreover, stress this point in my report entitled ‘Education as the cornerstone of the Lisbon process’, which was adopted last October. It has to be said that things are moving too slowly in this area, which, as the Commissioner was highlighting, ought to be a priority for the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the role of universities in research and the brain drain. I believe that it is more important than ever to highlight the major role assigned to universities in terms of creating and disseminating knowledge. As such, we strongly recommend that more importance be attached to them by means of developing synergies between the higher education sector, research, lifelong learning and the production sector. There is an urgent need for the European Union to stem the brain drain effectively and to put in place all appropriate measures to attract excellence to EU soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the last point that I wanted to highlight concerns job creation. There is also an urgent need for the Member States to make better use of the European funds allocated to them. I wanted to draw your attention here to the Member States that have rightly made job creation a key feature of their projects by investing more than 35% of the ESF funds in modernising their education and training systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Research and innovation are an integral part of the success of the Lisbon Strategy, as is collaboration between science and industry, in other words a knowledge-based economy. Mrs del Castillo Vera’s report, on which I congratulate her, and the European Commission’s proposals accurately highlight what we lack in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we lack financial resources. In the 2007-2013 budget, paragraph 1a, competitiveness, was cut the most. It was cut almost by half. Let us reiterate: we cannot achieve success for Europe without investment in research and innovation. We need to increase funding for science and new technologies in all countries. This task is the first and foremost objective for the whole European Council and future presidencies. National budgets are just as important as European budgets. Secondly, we lack ways of expanding knowledge and sharing knowledge. It is vital to create a real partnership within and between Member States and to exploit the potential of the whole Union within the framework of large consortia. It is vital to create a European research and innovation area, as innovation is an important word here, and to make optimal use of resources. Only transparency and exchange of information can ensure synergy between different programmes at Union, national and regional levels. In order to achieve this, it is necessary to create a single information technology programme for the whole Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another key to the success of the Lisbon Strategy, namely a real single market for goods, labour, services and capital. Without a single market it will be difficult for us to achieve success in research and innovation, science and new technologies. Only a real single market will give us better opportunities for growth and employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU cannot become competitive by reducing wages but must instead pin its hopes on developing new technology and human capital. In spite of the Lisbon Strategy’s objective of turning Europe into the most dynamic, knowledge-based region in the world, Europe constantly limps behind the United States and Japan when it comes to research and innovation. I think that, in this report, we have put our finger very precisely on those areas in which Europe fails to live up to its own objectives. Europe does not create enough knowledge and neither shares it effectively nor funds it sufficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Research is important, but we must also bear in mind that most European companies are not high-tech gazelle companies. Instead, they are small, traditional businesses. Those businesses too must also be innovative and become better at exploiting new market opportunities for new products and at devising new business processes that make better use of employees’ potential. The report succeeds in offering a broad perspective on the development of knowledge. I am particularly pleased about the integrated access to labour market and education policy, since it is only by combining businesses’ conditions for innovation with social, labour market and education policy that we can create space for employees’ creative potential. A highly qualified workforce adapts better to businesses’ quickly changing needs, and education also helps to spread knowledge. Europe has a need for more and better investment in education.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to emphasise that I consider equality to be a crucial dimension of the EU’s Lisbon Strategy. We cannot afford to ignore the equality perspective if we are to achieve our objectives for the competitiveness of the EU. It is estimated that the EU must attract and train between 600 000 and 700 000 new researchers in order to fulfil our research needs, and this figure does not take account of many older people’s withdrawal from the labour market. We simply cannot afford to ignore the research potential to be found in the female half of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Last of all, I should like to point out that, in our innovation strategy, we should, in my view, incorporate sustainability in relation to both the environment and social inclusion. Sustainability should be the basic principle, enabling us to ensure that the EU moves forward and thinks both in the long-term and globally. In this area, Europe clearly has a head start, which can in itself help ensure that we achieve the goals we set in the Lisbon Strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time like this, when the Football World Cup is on, the image that comes to mind in connection with this topic is that of the Japanese: they played wonderfully up to the penalty area, but then they did not score a goal. Then there was the match between Brazil and Ghana, where the Ghanaians gave perhaps the best showing of any African team, but did not score any goals. It is much the same with we Europeans when it comes to innovation: we are brilliant at inventing things, and we are brilliant when it comes to reaching the penalty area, but we cannot convert this into goals.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore grateful to you, Commissioner, and to the rapporteur as well, for this report and for your statements. I would also like to give my compliments to the rapporteur, who had to deal with shifting majorities in the committee, which led to there being light and dark aspects to this report. I will start with the darker aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take for example the problem posed by patent law. The law clearly demands that the Member States end the dispute about languages so that we can have a European patent. This formulation is too weak: since then it has become a question of much more than languages. What is needed is to find a skilful, interesting and intelligent combination between the London Agreement and the patent litigation system, in other words a litigation system where we very clearly have to create a court that would be responsible for dealing with patent law.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the reporting responsibilities that we demand for SMEs. We are asking the Commission to define a responsibility to report on how innovation potential is being measured. In doing so, however, we are quite clearly creating more bureaucracy. If we ask the Commission to demand these reports then it will do so from small and medium-sized enterprises, and they will thus be additionally burdened with bureaucracy. That is the wrong way to go about things.</p>
<p class="contents">The correct way to proceed, however, would be to adopt those points that will find a broad majority in this House: for example, if we were to promote business enterprises in Europe in such a way that failure in business were to become a genuine possibility, one that we could recognise and accept - as we can see in Anglo-Saxon countries. We should introduce measures to prevent the best researchers and innovators from leaving Europe, and we must create infrastructures so that European researchers can once again be at home in Europe, since there are indeed many researchers in the world who would gladly move back to Europe. We could also arrange additional subsidies for especially creative small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Together with the Commission, this House has adopted the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, the CIP and I am grateful to everybody that this succeeded in first reading in which we make pre-seed money, that is, risk capital available for these particular initial stages.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there are standards too. I am glad that we have turned to the issue of standards, since through standards and better standardisation mechanisms we could reproduce the success story that we saw in the case of GSM – Commissioner Bangemann was the one who initiated this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lisbon is not dead, but I would prefer Liverpool, since the Liverpool Process would mean that we could be three-nil behind at half-time in the Champions League Final and yet still win. That is precisely where we now stand. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When it comes to innovation, the large and the small must play together. The team is Europe, and we all need to combine our efforts in order to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate Mrs del Castillo Vera on her excellent report and thank her for her open and inclusive attitude to drawing up this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise three points. Firstly, when it comes to innovation, small is beautiful. If we want to create stable employment, if we want to instil a new culture that favours innovation, then it has to be instilled in the thousands and thousands of SMEs throughout Europe. The report therefore recommends that particular attention be paid to this point, in order to ensure the participation of small and medium-sized businesses and in order to achieve the necessary change in the field of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to point out that innovating also means opening up. It means promoting the flow of information, it means that we need an innovative strategy, in which there is a balance between the protection of industrial property and the free dissemination of technical knowledge and free and unhindered competition. In that way we will be able to promote solidarity, knowledge and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to say that innovation is green. Innovation means new methods for strengthening energy efficiency, ecotechnologies and clean production, in order to achieve a more competitive economy that creates more environmental and social well-being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do, however, wish to express my view that the Lisbon Strategy has failed in respect of growth and employment. Politicians often put blame on globalisation as if it were an anonymous phenomenon that cannot be influenced. It is not. At heart, it is political decisions that govern the impact of globalisation. As regards research and development, they are an investment in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, however, refers to area after area in which the EU has thus far failed in research and development. The report highlights factors of significance in changing this situation. I would like to point out that the basis for all successful research and development is a large degree of freedom within research, with as little regulation and control as possible. This means freedom for individual researchers, but also freedom for state and regional aid for research and development. That is often where the knowledge is. For this reason the comprehensive regulation proposed gives rise to a certain amount of concern. What research needs is not more regulations but more freedom and resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Like all other policies, the policy on research and development is not gender-neutral. Female researchers have great difficulties in terms both of the recruitment of new researchers and of access to research capital. This uneven distribution obviously has serious consequences for research and development. If the Lisbon Programme’s research and development programme is to be a success we must exploit the skills of female researchers. I support the idea put forward in the report that future research must prioritise the environment and sustainable development. This, together with the exploitation of female skills in research, could mean the difference between success and failure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot remain static; instead, we need continual advances. That is a truism, and one with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">It is known that for many years our work in research and development lagged far behind that of the frontrunners, USA and Japan. Even if this is, in the meantime, slowly beginning to change, there still remains a lot to do. We have to create better conditions for innovation. To this end we require an up-and-coming generation of researchers capable of competing on an international level. The low proportion of graduates in technical and scientific disciplines, combined with the brain drain towards competing economic systems that offer the temptation of self-led research should give us cause for concern, as should the problems that our universities have in retaining qualified lecturing staff.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also, finally, have to stand by our small and medium-sized enterprises, with which the greatest potential for innovation and job creation ultimately lies. If we fail to do this, these small and medium-sized enterprises will reduce their research and development activities, because they will be unable to take advantage of our complicated EU investment programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to congratulate Mrs del Castillo before commenting on two points which, in my opinion, could strengthen the momentum of innovation in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Point one: small- and medium-sized companies need to be networked with large companies and industry. Why? Because small companies are especially innovative, often more innovative that big companies. However, they are usually short of stable and suitable financing, while industry and big business have the capital, but are not always open to investing time and human resources in experimentation. Consequently, such joint ventures could have huge advantages both for small and large companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Point two: greater emphasis is needed on public procurement contracts. Why? Because public procurement contracts can, I believe, increase demand and function as a remedy to market vacuums and failures. Because, among other things, I consider that we need to seriously examine the promotion of open European competitions in line with the corresponding American model. Consequently, the Member States and the Commission must sound out the opportunities that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I should like to take the opportunity of this report to ask you: what European structures are presently supporting innovation in the European Union? Is there or is there not a need for more initiatives? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the fine speeches, we still do not invest enough in European research and development. The most recent data show that we still lag behind both the United States and Japan, and as for the new competitors, they are catching up with us, as was mentioned a moment ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Top-level research will not be transformed into innovation and employment with money alone, however; we need to create an innovative climate, which the Commissioner also spoke about. That will be the main feature of a modern industrial society. It will not come about by kicking a ball around, and it will not matter who runs the fastest, but rather who thinks the fastest. It is a matter of our attitude and willingness to embrace a coherent strategy in order to achieve results. When there is no innovative climate, money or strategy, you do not need anything else for failure. Public administration, universities and business should pool their strengths and specialise. Actually, the problem is that the differences between the Member States are enormous, and the speed at which things travel varies greatly.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a single market in researchers would be a goal worth supporting. The best researchers need to be where they can do the best research and innovation work. Several special Union programmes, such as Descartes or Aristoteles, have increased the mobility of researchers, but there remain barriers, which actually drive researchers overseas. European research policy must cover investment in the working conditions of researchers. This way we will establish innovation-based competitiveness. By its own example, Finland has shown that it is possible to build competitiveness founded on research and innovation based on a welfare society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to stress that information is a fundamental factor which Europe can exploit to increase its international competitive advantage. Providing resources and ensuring a competitive environment is the best way for the EU to help improve scientific research potential in Europe because it is not only ineffective for Member States to implement such programmes on their own, but it is often too expensive.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU should more effectively combat the brain drain by offering its best USA-bound scientists better scientific research conditions and funding.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the universities play a vital role in establishing and spreading information, and so, cooperation between higher education, research and the manufacturing sector should be consolidated.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to increase investment in scientific research, improve European competitiveness and create more jobs, we need increased and more effective contributions to information and innovation. Although, generally speaking, each state is responsible for encouraging increased and improved investments, in striving for a common market, the EU should contribute to these efforts with funds from its own budget, and thus, stimulate the more rapid development of scientific research and innovations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that the climate of creativity goes even beyond the climate of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verheugen has banked on the inventiveness of the Finnish Presidency, and rightly so: there are grounds for examining the Finnish education system, and, in doing so, one would see that this country has dared to go beyond ‘employability', that monstrous term that European bureaucrats have coined in order to promote entrepreneurship, and this from as early an age as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, Commissioner, I believe that the Lisbon Strategy is a fine example of the European Council's way of behaving like the Sandman. In 2000, the Council launched a prestigious idea, and, five years later, it has to be said that nothing has come of it and that the budgets have not taken account of the will of the Heads of State or Government to increase the research appropriations.</p>
<p class="contents">So, above all, let us do our work. I am grateful to the rapporteur for having mentioned the European Council’s annual report calling for monitoring of these appropriations, which we are promised year after year but which do not materialise: it is time that the national budgets were adapted so that we might finally succeed in creating synergies in research. I should like to launch a new appeal in this connection. It has come to my attention that the new European Research Council, which is due to be created by the Seventh Framework Programme, was going to give rise to a huge amount of bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I believe, if such is the case, that that would be going beyond what both the Council and Parliament wanted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which provides a very realistic diagnosis of the obstacles that the European Union needs to overcome in order for those actions to achieve the desired results.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer to three issues. Firstly, the need to create a single market that is attractive to researchers. It is clear that, in order to achieve the objectives it has set, the European Union needs more properly trained researchers and it needs to be able to use its human resources by promoting cross-border cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we must combat the brain drain effectively, we must provide incentives for the best foreign researchers to come to work in Europe, we must promote scientific education amongst young people, improve the working conditions of research staff, remove obstacles to mobility and promote the conditions necessary for women to be able to take part in the scientific and technological field under equal conditions with men. The football metaphor is of no use to us here, ladies and gentlemen: in order to make progress intelligently, the team needs to be mixed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to refer to the need to support the research capacities of SMEs. In this regard, I would like to stress the importance of the instruments proposed in the CIS and in the Seventh Framework Programme to improve SMEs’ access to funding, lack of which is their main obstacle when trying to improve their innovating capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to stress the proposal to strengthen the Structural Funds intended for research and innovation. The Structural Funds have been reinforcing R+D structures on the basis of a territorial distribution of resources by means of convergence criteria. It is therefore important to promote coordination between the different Community R+D programmes with the fundamental instrument of regional development policy: the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, those are the three points I wished to stress of a document that may be very useful in our future work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In my contribution I would like to emphasise the very important role of the implementation structures that may significantly influence the future success of European support programmes in the areas of research, development and innovation, including the Seventh Framework Programme and the Programme for Competitiveness and Innovation. The extent to which these programmes, in which we put such great stock, prove to be successful will depend on how well they are attuned to the needs of the target groups, particularly small and middle-sized businesses, universities, research centres and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">If my information is correct, the European Commission, namely the DG for Enterprise, is working on a new, more effective model of business support networks – Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres – with the aim of reducing administrative burdens. It is envisaged that these networks will be restructured through the development of consortiums at the NUTS I or NUTS II level. I regard the steps that the Commission has taken to boost efficiency and dismantle bureaucracy as being quite correct.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would like to urge you, Commissioner, in implementing these steps, to take into account the need for close interaction between entrepreneurs, research centres and universities, on the one hand, and intermediary institutions on the other. A regional level NUTS II for establishing consortiums is the minimum level required in order to provide sufficient geographical coverage for the comprehensive range of services essential to the job of successfully implementing European policy in this area. A decision favouring NUTS I, in other words the central level, might decrease the administrative burden on the European Commission but would definitely not contribute to reducing red tape at the national level; on the contrary, it would diminish the chances of the target recipients gaining flexible access to support programmes, particularly in outlying regions.</p>
<p class="contents">An equally important requirement for the envisaged consortiums should be to ensure the comprehensive range and high quality of support services. The establishment of consortiums through a shared network of Euro Info Centres and Innovation Relay Centres will encourage comprehensive and flexible service provision, while fulfilling the original aims of these Centres and generating much needed synergism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to broach two subjects: the issue of building the European research area and the issue of small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Building the European research area means building the single market for that most precious of commodities: knowledge. For that reason, we must apply the same determination to the construction of this market that Europe, as a whole, applied to the completion of the monetary Union and of the single market for other goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be launching the seventh framework programme in a few months’ time, and the Union still presents a very, indeed overly, varied landscape of national and regional systems for research and innovation and, consequently, we are not working together as a team. This is to the detriment of systematic cooperation and efficiency. If we want to fulfil the Lisbon Strategy, then all of the actors involved, in the public and private sectors, at regional, national and Community levels, will each have to make a contribution through complementary and synergistic measures, and develop systems that are not merely political but consistent and mutually compatible.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards small and medium-sized enterprises, many sources attribute the fall in productivity, and therefore in the productivity of the Italian economy, to the fact that there is little innovation in Italy. This is because, in many Italian companies, there is a perception that new technologies are basically pointless or superfluous. This negative attitude is linked to the small scale of our businesses, which have an average of four employees, but, although the phenomenon is particularly serious in my country, it also concerns most of Europe. In this connection, I propose that, over and above the various support measures for small and medium-sized enterprises provided for by Mrs del Castillo Vera's report – which I fully support – we launch training initiatives aimed specifically at small entrepreneurs, to make it clear to them that innovation has become necessary for survival.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I call on the Member States and the regions, while acknowledging research and innovation as a top priority, not to lose too much time in transposing the legislation and in starting to implement the various programmes and actions, because time is precious when it comes to innovation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we do not remember nearly as often that these outstanding intellects, almost without exception, gained this recognition far from their homeland. Most of these scientists received this honour while carrying out research in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">After some time, a team of Hungarian scientists at the famous Los Alamos research centre in the United States were referred to as Martians. In fact, everyone in America jokingly referred to them as Martians later, because their superior intelligence made it seem as if they had come from another planet. However, they were not from another universe, just from a different continent, Europe. It was the better research conditions and greater recognition which made them take the knowledge they had acquired in their homeland to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a 20th century story, but we should not think that the 'brain drain' has stopped. Europe still produces the most outstanding intellectual giants. However, if we look at a summary of the statistics on research and development, the alarming conclusion we come to is that we are still at a serious disadvantage in this area, compared with the United States and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">The report tabled before us correctly states that this lagging behind is due, on the one hand, to the fact that Europe is not producing a sufficient amount of research results which can subsequently applied in the business sector. The gap between theoretical knowledge and its practical application is seriously holding back Europe's competitiveness. The other reason for lagging behind is still the lack of resources. Achieving the target of allocating 3% of the EU's GDP to research by 2010 already seems like an illusion.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear then what needs to be done: allocate more resources, strengthen applied research and give more recognition to researchers as a profession, because without such action, the implementation of the Lisbon Strategy will remain beyond our reach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Poland, this has been influenced by the fact that many branches of industry have been taken over by foreign companies which have their research institutes, design offices and laboratories in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, our industrial research base has been shut down in recent years. Research results have not been effectively translated into streamlined production methods and services or innovation. This is partly due to multinational corporations choosing to compete in the field of research and innovation. Inventors of new ideas and patents have also had difficulties in gaining measurable profits. Other problems have included the blocking of possible competitors from the European Union by international corporations such as Microsoft with the aid of patents, limited budgetary resources and the restricted financial resources for military research.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we should, first of all, simplify the mechanisms allowing inventors to gain personal profits not only from patentable inventions but also from other inventions. Secondly, we should limit the monopolies of international companies which use their patents to block European competitors. If a patent granted in the Union blocks the growth of innovation in a given field through deliberate non-application for a given period of time, I would suggest that the idea behind the invention should be made available, free of charge, to other users. Thirdly, any large company should have to use their profits to create a technical progress fund for streamlining and innovation. It is a solution that has already been implemented in Poland once before. Small and medium-sized enterprises, however, could focus their resources with the aid of organisations such as chambers of commerce. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore appreciate the optimism and efforts of the rapporteur, who has tried to identify new ways of meeting Lisbon Strategy goals in this report on her own initiative. For Europe to be able to compete with the United States and Japan, countries taking the lead in the application information and communications technology, we need to boost the appeal of careers in research by offering incentives, an attractive environment and remuneration schemes that will motivate students to undertake research while studying at university. Member States are expected to play a special role in promoting investment in research and innovation, while facilitating and broadening public and private sector partnerships, particularly those with universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Key to Europe’s success are the vital small and medium-sized enterprises, which account for 65% of European GDP. These businesses in particular need support in the area of innovation and research, as they underpin the growth of services and markets based on new technologies. A basic precondition for establishing the framework for a conducive business environment is the availability of sufficient funding from the EU budget. For example, supporting the use of venture capital creates possibilities for accumulating financial resources for the development of creative ideas, ensuring the competitiveness of businesses at the start of their operations. We must remember to nurture entrepreneurial spirit from early on, as it serves innovation and encourages demand from the public for innovative goods and services. It is essential to make information on research and innovation available to the business community at large, and we must therefore build and support information centres at the regional level as well. These centres may then contribute to enhancing nationwide and cross-border cooperation. Allow me to make one final point: the year 2010 is rapidly drawing closer and it is becoming obvious that the European Union must transform the Lisbon Strategy objectives into action and must do so as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She sees in it a new stimulus for the principle behind the Lisbon Agenda, which many Europeans still view as the European Union’s ‘trademark’. The Communication simply recommends that the European Union should continue to favour research and innovation as vital stimuli for change in contemporary society, something it has declared to be a priority for many years, and that it should above all view economic development as a decisive instrument for stimulating the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">The ten new Member States staunchly support the creation of increasingly more attractive operating conditions for modern research centres in Europe. There are clearly certain concerns, justified by the fact that there are still visible legal and administrative barriers for scientists from Central and Eastern Europe wanting to participate in this research. The fact that the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy has accepted the amendments tabled to the report is therefore all the more welcome. These amendments were tabled with the scientists from that region in mind, especially those at the start of their careers.</p>
<p class="contents">It should also be emphasised that the committee has shown significant interest in the problems faced by small and medium-sized enterprises. In the rapporteur’s report, we even find a proposal to take particular account of the specific situation of micro enterprises and small enterprises. The scientific world views this as an appropriate framework for putting pressure on the European Commission to create an information database which will provide a record of the current state of scientific research. It will also be a kind of guarantee, bearing in mind the increasing expectations of the scientific world, that intellectual property rights will be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">This kind of new economic policy should create new opportunities for flexible choice of economic instruments that ensure, in accordance with the message emerging from our debate, continued growth in employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Catching up with the United States or Japan still remains an ambition, a dream. It is hardly surprising that actions do not follow words. The European Union has earmarked only 1.93% of its GDP for scientific research and development, whereas the USA has allotted 2.59% and Japan 3.15% of GDP to this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Low investment in research and development, as well as a lack of sufficient support for innovation, will not increase the potential for growth and employment in the European Union. That is why it is extremely important to guarantee the appropriate budgetary resources for aid instruments to small and medium-sized enterprises, such as the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme or the JEREMIE initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as fostering entrepreneurship and stimulating innovation, we must also continually invest in scientific development. Scientists should be given appropriate career opportunities and financial conditions to conduct their research. Otherwise, institutions in the United States or Japan will continue to succeed in tempting away brilliantly qualified European experts with better offers, and it will be these countries for which they win future Nobel prizes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, whom I honestly congratulate on the composite presentation of her report, therefore justifiably points out that, despite the fact that the European institutions recognise the vital importance of promoting research and innovation, the European Union as a whole is still failing to make adequate use of its potential, either in terms of human resources or in terms of funding capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">National reform programmes do of course all recognise as a challenge policies on research, innovation and their applications. For financing, it is not as important, in my opinion, to achieve a maximum target in terms of percentages as it is to reform public research systems, in tandem with the restructuring and the promotion of the efficacy of university scientific institutions and research programmes and, in general, with the spreading of interest in knowledge and research to renewed education systems and to effective lifelong learning programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">Facilitating joint ventures between the public and private sectors and cross-border cooperation are equally important investments for more research and the successful dissemination of innovation. Alongside state financing, the proper management of Community financial resources and financing mechanisms by the Commission and access to loans from the European Investment Bank is expected to safeguard an increase in research activities, especially by small and medium-sized companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of regional convergence in technological pioneering and development and the completion of the single job market, I consider that it would be a good idea to promote the participation of small and medium-sized companies in European technology platforms. However, the maximisation of returns is achieved with the promotion of human resources, with excellence and with creative cooperation between higher education and lifelong learning agencies and the business and manufacturing sectors. Thus Europe will become a global competitor in research, just as it has in football. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the speakers described the situation very well. In order to develop, one must invest. That includes investment in scientific research and innovation. Parliament’s motion for a resolution features this truism, as well as a detailed analysis of the situation and the direction that future actions should take. However, the statements that Europe does not seek to acquire new knowledge, that it cannot share knowledge and that it does not support knowledge financially all have a very ominous ring to them.</p>
<p class="contents">This must change! We must begin to invest more in basic research, and we have to expand the scope of public funding for research and development. Otherwise, we may be shooting ourselves in the foot. Unless we take the necessary steps, we will move from being a modern and dynamic Europe, which is regarded as attractive by many citizens of other countries, to being a technical, technological and economic backwater which Europeans will not want to live or work in, let alone like. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, she has brought our attention to three areas of weakness: the generation of new knowledge, cooperation in generating and using new knowledge, and funding. I should also like to draw attention to three areas that will, in my opinion, be crucial to the successful implementation of the Lisbon Programme: first of all, research; secondly synergising national and European policies and, finally, the European Technology Institute.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Commission has, in cooperation with the European Parliament and the Council, submitted a suitable proposal for the 7th Framework Programme for Research. We must bring negotiations on this research programme to a close as soon as possible so that we can start implementing it in time. Financial resources for this programme were pruned considerably during the financial perspective negotiations, which is why the research budget must be implemented in its entirety. There is no justifiable reason for any further reductions in these resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, EU–level measures can encourage individual Member States to take their own measures. We will only achieve satisfactory results if we combine EU–level action with that made by individual Member States. I therefore urge the Commission to follow carefully the action taken by individual states and give public prominence to examples of successful states or successful practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is also important to synergise areas of education, research and development, on the one hand, and economy on the other. It is important that the Commission acts to promote such cooperation – I am referring here to the European Technology Institute. In order that this proposal should not remain merely a political project, we must be acutely aware of the views of all interested parties. We have to foster genuine growth within the European Research Area and prevent finances from being cut further and used for the expansion of bureaucracy.

The revival of the Lisbon strategy's growth and employment objectives is an important aspect of this renewed legislative framework as too much delay has already been taken on the aim of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive knowledge based economy. In this respect, I can only support the report of Mrs. del Castillo Vera and its emphasis on improving the European research and innovation environment. More specifically, I would like to welcome the focus on the potential of small and medium size innovative enterprises for achieving Lisbon agenda's objectives as well as the demand to foster public and private funding to optimise Community's financial support. Finally, I it is worth underlining, according to Mrs. del Castillo Vera own-initiative report, that there is indeed an urgent need to better harmonise the coordination and the cooperation between the different national strategies if we really want to raise Europe's growth and employment potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
