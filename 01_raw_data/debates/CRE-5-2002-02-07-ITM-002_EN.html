<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kratsa-Τsagaropoulou (PPE-DE)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is a political vision and a vital project for the EU. But it is not just a sound method of promoting its economic interests; the main objective is to create an area of peace, security, stability and prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of European unification teaches us that, unless there is prosperity for all, men and women alike, there can be no zone of peace and stability. At present, the role of women in this process of cooperation is marginal or focused on the economic sector, with negligible results as regards improving their standard of living, whereas our committee believes that such a political vision should consider women to be instrumental in promoting cohesion, peace and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this own initiative report is to assess policy to date, to urge the European Union to implement all the necessary policies to promote the social, political and economic rights of women in the Mediterranean and to urge the partner countries to assume their responsibilities and rise to the challenges inherent in this objective by all possible means. Assessing the situation is no easy task, because there are considerable variations from one country to another. There is a lack of statistical data broken down by gender, an absence of studies by the European Commission and the national governments effectively evaluating the impact of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation on the promotion of women’s rights and a special regional Mediterranean programme has yet to be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, unemployment also affects women with a university education and illiteracy is on the increase. Early marriage and other entrenched customs mean that girls often drop out of school. There is evidence of entrepreneurship in the Maghreb, but the lack of financing and credit facilities tends to block women's initiatives. Violence, poverty and poor health among women are also commonplace, as is their absence from or under-representation in decision-making posts and, hence, their absence when Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is being negotiated and planned. Tradition and religious stereotypes affect legislation, the ratification of international agreements and the application of such agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee calls for the effective implementation of what has already been laid down in the Barcelona Declaration regarding progress towards democracy and respect for human rights and for the gender dimension to be incorporated in the three pillars of the Euro-Mediterranean partnership. It also calls for association agreements to incorporate an explicit provision on protection for<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>women's’ rights and also to provide for a policy<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>for monitoring such<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We are delighted that the study and the first regional Mediterranean programme for women have already been decided and we call on the Commission to take a global political approach, rather than confining the programme to vocational training, and to provide all the tools needed so that the issue of sexual equality can be dealt with in the broadest possible context, as it is in the countries of the European Union which apply this principle. The European Commission and the Commissioner, who is present here, are experienced in drawing up and applying this sort of programme in the Member States and candidate countries and we believe that this experience will stand them in good stead when it comes to drawing up the regional Mediterranean programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, our committee is in favour of supporting women's organisations in the partner countries and of networking them with women's organisations in the Member States of the European Union. We predict even greater potential for cooperation with women's organisations and social agencies in the candidate countries and the Balkans because the entire region is responding to the challenge of stability and peace by mobilising civic society. In addition, having noted that the European Investment Bank has no budget for financing and supporting women's activities, we are in favour of a study into the possibility of creating a Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank for the Euro-Mediterranean zone because we feel that this will give women and women's organisations a chance to develop and obtain facilities and credit. We are also in favour of setting up a database and observatory to monitor this progress and the compilation of data used to assess and plan future policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We also paid close attention to the problems of women immigrants from these countries in the European Union and we call for the red tape and other obstacles to legal immigration into the Member States of the European Union to be lifted, because we believe that they result in poverty, marginalisation and the exploitation of human and, more specifically, women's lives. These phenomena have been denounced repeatedly, both by our committee and by the European Parliament as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is the result of excellent collaboration with the other political groups and I should like to thank my fellow Members for their amendments and for working with us and to ask you to endorse the report in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Widespread illiteracy – especially in certain countries, as the percentages she presents indicate - early school leaving, without achieving a level of study which prepares them for later life, and a lack of participation in the labour market – especially amongst young women - are factors which, together with poverty and marginalisation, above all affect women in the majority of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the case despite the cooperation agreements, which contain many clauses, but never make it very clear that the situation of women should be taken into account amongst the objectives, and that the promotion of women and their access to better levels of personal well-being and to the labour market must also be amongst those objectives, so that they can pursue their own professions.</p>
<p class="contents">In these areas, health problems are one of the most serious situations they face, not only through a lack of healthcare, but also because of a lack of prevention. These problems affect the whole population in general, but particularly women.</p>
<p class="contents">This is particularly surprising, given that we know the MEDA programme has had problems in this House, because not even half of what was intended has been implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The MEDA programme, which is aimed at cooperation programmes in the Mediterranean areas, in particular the Southern Mediterranean, would be a wonderful instrument for creating specific programmes for women, aimed at promoting the role of women and increasing the living standards of women, which would be an advantage to the whole population, since we all know how important women are in the least-developed societies and, in particular, in traditional societies, where women bear the greatest responsibility for the family which, furthermore, usually includes a large number of children.</p>
<p class="contents">By means of the Euro-Mediterranean Forum of Women Members of Parliament we are well aware of the situation of these women, and we know what they expect from Parliament and the European Union. We therefore have the obligation to draw attention to these facts so that their needs may be met. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Kratsa, for being so willing to incorporate all of those amendments and issues which we in the Socialist Group have wanted to raise in order to supplement this excellent report. In reality, the work in committee has been a complete collaboration between all the groups, and I hope that the House will reflect this in its vote this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We have managed to achieve compromises on almost all aspects of a problem which has become very serious, because it affects the great majority of women in the associated countries of the Mediterranean. It is true that there are slight differences between the various countries, but, in general, the situation of women in these countries is of great concern: illiteracy, early school leaving, unemployment, violence against women and health problems, originating from their reproductive health and the lack of adequate services for women. The report exhaustively describes all these situations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and the Member States must renew their commitment to the women of the Mediterranean countries. In very many cases, cooperation agreements do not fulfil the commitment to deal with the special situation suffered by these women. It is what we call “the transverse introduction of the gender perspective", because the situation suffered by women is not the same as the situation of men and therefore it is necessary to analyse what this situation is from the outset, in order to provide the tools necessary to resolve it.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the regional programme within the framework of the MEDAs has once again been delayed and therefore this report is going to see the light of day long before this regional programme is implemented. I hope that by then we can take up the fundamental ideas contained in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot continue to lament the situation suffered by women in many countries of the world, especially in this region which is so close to us, without taking action. It is an urgent issue and we must promote the necessary mechanisms in order to ensure that the lives of women in these countries really becomes better and easier.</p>
<p class="contents">We must restate this commitment because there is no more time and we have to act. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to begin by saying that there are in fact two men from my group who have submitted to Parliament an appeal for equality that will also be forwarded to the President. This appeal, entitled ‘Enough is enough’, calls upon all the groups to consider what real progress they have made with equality and actively to take initiatives to improve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I should like to thank the rapporteur for her brilliant report, which deals very well with an area in which some time needs to be devoted to the position of women, and I would pick up on a couple of individual points which I should like to emphasise. First of all, I think it is incredibly important that we should acquire statistics, and I would urge the Commission to look at how we can improve the statistical base, for any discussion about women, men and inequality is a non-starter if we do not have the necessary statistics. Whether there is to be a supervisory body or data bank, or whatever, is less important. What is crucial is that we obtain statistics.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing is that, in my view, it is entirely right – and this is also related specifically to this appeal – that the Commissioner should ensure that women participate when the association agreements are negotiated. We are well aware that we very often only have men around the negotiating table. When that is the case, women have already been reduced in status, and their position does not become a topic of central concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing I should like to highlight is the issue of programmes. It is crucially important to investigate what practical programmes we can offer to secure better education for women so that they themselves will also be in a position to do more to promote equality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to emphasise that we were pleased with the constructive manner, namely by cooperation between the groups, in which this report came about. We concur with the rapporteur’s view that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation is, politically speaking, of crucial importance for Europe. Not only is this cooperation a safe way of promoting Europe’s economic interests; its key objective is to establish an area of peace, security, stability and welfare. In order to accelerate this cooperation, a better understanding between the European peoples and the peoples of the partner countries is necessary, as well as an active mainstream society which is capable of taking part in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of this, women occupy a key position. They must be encouraged to acquire their own political identity and for this purpose, they must be given the opportunity, via education and awareness-raising, of making up for an unfair disadvantage that has built up over the centuries. Women must no longer solely be regarded as mothers, no matter how important their role in bringing up children may be. They must also be seen – provided they gain access to education – as fully-fledged partners in the labour market and in politics. With a view to enlargement, women from the South must conclude a solidarity pact with women of the North, and they need to support each other in their justified demands. In this respect, Europe should function as a driving force. Our Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, headed by an inspiring chairperson, Mrs Karamanou, has an important role to play in this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I understand the sensitivity of the subject but, if we do not mention this word, we will not be able to address the root of the problem or cooperate with groups of women who are fighting in these countries for their freedom. The missing word is ‘religion’, in other words Islam and the political abuse of Islam by the ruling power.</p>
<p class="contents">The key obstacle to the emancipation or liberation of the women in these countries – as was the case for a long time in our own countries – is the equivalence of religion and politics, an equivalence which makes the provisions of the Sharia<span class="bold"> </span>the sole legal basis for laws on the situation of women in those countries, and this is becoming increasingly the case. None of this is mentioned in the report, and I understand the difficulty, but I also fear that our reticence will not help the groups of women in those countries who, unaided, are courageously starting to raise the issue of separating religious and political authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important laws on women are those making up what is known as civil law. Well then, all those laws which codify – and I repeat – codify discrimination against women are, albeit in different forms – directly applying the interpretation of the Koran. There are women there fighting for the separation of powers, there are women fighting for the Koran to be brought up to date. None of this features at all in the report, where the effects are listed but the cause is not addressed. I regret this, for I feel that we are lagging behind them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Certainly, listening to Mrs Bonino, we cannot deny the truth of what she has said. The two minutes’ speaking time restriction undoubtedly prevented her from going into more detail. This is an important issue which must certainly be dealt with using a different approach from the one adopted in the recent report, which focused on ‘women and fundamentalism’. If we take that approach, we will not be enabling either the women or ourselves to make any useful contribution to the growth – the cultural as well as economic growth – of these countries, and we will not be enabling these peoples as a whole to escape from a cultural and religious situation in which the human and civil rights of people in general and women in particular are being trampled underfoot.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel that the issue must be addressed from the perspective outlined by Mrs Bonino, for the matter has hitherto been little debated in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">However, with regard to this report, as it stands, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and make two recommendations to the Commission and the Council. They are contained in the text before us but I would just like to emphasise them. The first is that the presence of women at all levels of social, economic, financial and political life in conditions of equality, not least as regards decision-making, is a prerequisite for democracy and therefore for peace and well-being. In everything the Union does to pursue these objectives, it must ensure that the programmes we have already implemented or are currently implementing are totally inflexible in terms of respect for the protection of rights, and that none of the work carried out by the Council towards partnerships and cooperation ever fails to take into consideration the need for these rights to be respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we can refer back to the Beijing World Conference of Women, where, too, steps were taken towards women's empowerment and capacity building, and the MEDA programme actually provided us with the right instruments. I must say, though, that we lack the statistical data to carry out a more exact and more precise analysis. For example, the data is not in the report on the programme, and no yardstick has as yet been laid down against which progress can be measured.</p>
<p class="contents">Why was it that MEDA I and II included not even one regional programme exclusively devoted to women? Why is the democratic clause not applied with greater thoroughness where there is flagrant violation of women's rights, as with genital mutilation, for example? The Valenciano Martínez-Orozco Report gives important pointers to that. Why is fundamentalism not addressed in greater detail? I ask the women from the other groups, though, to pluck up the courage to introduce these issues into the Plenary rather than having their treatment obstructed in the Bureau.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask myself why women are barred from education in many countries. It is a destructive tendency. Particularly in rural areas, up to 60% of women are excluded from education, even from being taught about reproductive health. Why, for example, do our Member States, when dealing with immigration and asylum, not show a very emphatic red card to the illegal trade in human beings? In the Member State from which I come, for example, the recognition of gender-specific persecution or any persecution that is not carried out by the State as grounds for asylum is currently being made into an electoral issue, and the good starts we have made in our immigration law therefore end up being put out of the reach of women in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I think this is an area where women like us need to work together even more. With this report, we are setting a good example. Not only do we need more women performing social functions here, we also need them in our partner countries, and I emphasise again that the European Union must focus its instruments of cooperation even more intensely on women, so that it is to the advantage of us all that we, with the help of the democracy programme, empower women and open up dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report reminds us how important it is for the European Union to promote the role of women in economic and social life, both by means of Community policies and in the context of cooperation with third countries and the Mediterranean countries. I would simply like to add a few words on the current situation, which is impeccably described in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Although circumstances have improved for women in some Mediterranean countries, there is still a long way to go, in particular as regards access to education, vocational training and the labour market, but also in social matters, with regard to single and divorced women, single mothers and women in rural areas. The European Union should draw attention to any progress that is made and lend its support should the opportunity arise. The European Union must also ensure that the good intentions stated during discussions on partnership or association agreements are in fact followed by practical measures, with a view to increasing social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there is still much progress to be made. The promotion of gender equality in the Mediterranean countries is hindered by a number of obstacles such as the influence of cultural and religious traditions and the lack of social and legal structures. At a time when some of these countries are undergoing significant economic expansion, the integration of gender equality into all policies and, in particular, policies concerning access to training and the labour market, must be promoted, as women can only have access to positions of political, economic or social responsibility if specific measures are implemented with regard to training, backed up by appropriate social measures such as, for example, the establishment of childcare structures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Presidency has reiterated its strong interest in developing programmes such as MEDA and in partnerships between these countries and the European Union. This is an ideal opportunity to encourage our current and future partners to promote women’s economic, social and civil rights in order to create an active society involving both men and women, which, I hope, will enable an area of peace, security and prosperity to be created in the medium term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report will be a huge help to the women of the Mediterranean who, despite some improvement in their situation over recent years, still suffer sexual discrimination and inequality. Illiteracy, poverty, domestic violence, inadequate medical care and little involvement in professional and political life are the main aspects of life for women on the southern shores of the Mediterranean basin. However, what is worse, and here I agree completely with Mrs Bonino, is that women are the main victims of religious and political fundamentalism, of ultra-conservatism and of autocratic regimes who hang on to their power by controlling the sexual conduct of women, their way of life, their reproductive functions and even their mode of dress.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, irrationalism and fanaticism are the main obstacles both to the emancipation of women and to social and economic progress in general in these countries. Obviously, the best defence against the powers of irrationalism and fanaticism is to strengthen the worldly aspects of the state and legal democratic order. We must send out a clear message. No political system, religious movement, tradition or custom can take precedence over respect for the fundamental freedoms of women, human rights and the Rule of Law. As long as these basic aspects of a democratic state are lacking in numerous countries around the Mediterranean, there will only ever be a faint glimmer of hope of any improvement in the position of women and the resolutions passed and conferences held within the context of the Barcelona process will be meaningless.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we are calling on the European Commission to use every means at its disposal, especially when negotiating association agreements, to include clear-cut clauses and commitments protecting women's rights and the principles of the Rule of Law and recognising them as the <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>to social development in the countries of the Mediterranean and the promotion of the Mediterranean basin as an area of peace and cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I feel that the fact that this report has been produced is a very positive thing. I also thank the rapporteur for her efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I take the view that Mrs Bonino's reflections are something we should all share. What is lacking in the report is precisely the principal cause underlying the facts of this situation, which was analysed in the report, in part unsparingly; the cause of it, though, is not there.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it appears to me that we are, from the point of view of consistency, far too amicable, far too calm, far too balanced. Appeals are made, recommendations are made, requests are made, things are emphasised, but, in my view, far too little is demanded. I believe we must in future exert much more pressure on this issue. We must exert massive pressure on these countries and the societies in them, even with the suggestion of sanctions – and I do know that the word is not quite the right one. That means that we must convince them and give them to understand, that the failure to positively influence the placing of women on an equal footing in these countries will have consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly – and here I pick up on one of the Liberal Mrs Dybkjær's ideas – this is very much an issue for men too. I am a bit of a black swan here today, but I hope that those men who are not here today will, when the vote is taken, do the right thing and advance the policy of this report a few steps further – and I hope that they will also do so in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Barcelona process is basically a means for dialogue between the Community and the countries of the Mediterranean. Needless to say, this dialogue cannot simply be based either on the principles of the European Union or on the principles underpinning the regimes in these countries. It has to be based on international law, human rights conventions, the Beijing declaration, which these countries have signed – all the international texts and conventions which place women's rights at the heart of human rights, bringing us back to the question of the gender dimension of foreign policy. Because the Barcelona process is one of the ways used to develop the European Union's foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to inform the House that the Commission has already taken an initiative to adopt a text of recommendations and principles in the hope that it will be accepted by the foreign ministers and will govern every contract and agreement between the European Union and third countries as regards women's rights and the gender dimension of foreign policy. The Commissioner responsible for foreign policy issues and I have already held initial talks. The first conference of international experts on the matter has been organised and will be held some time in April. Our aim is to have an established programme of recommendations and agreements in principle at political level by 2003. Of course, we shall be holding separate discussions on this with the Committee on Women's Rights, I imagine very soon, once we have the full programme and timetable, so that we can discuss a specific text with the parliamentary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial tools for the Barcelona process are ΜEDA I and ΜΕDA II. But, as you rightly said, we have no reason to be especially proud of the results of ΜEDA I as far as the social sector and women's issues and rights are concerned. The difficulties are caused, in large part, by our inability to close the gap between administrative systems and, in even larger part, by differences in principle. The objective of the ΜEDA IΙ programme is to create a free trade zone between Europe and the Mediterranean countries in the long term, by 2010 and, within it, to implement programmes which will help these countries develop economically, along with social and economic measures to support this economic development. And, at the heart of these measures, there must be measures for women and for involving women in education, the job market and social and economic life.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the Commission's job, following the forum held during the Belgian presidency, to prepare a specific regional programme during 2002 containing measures on the job market, women's networks and easier access for women to financing by developing initiatives which also relate to training.</p>
<p class="contents">This report will provide a great deal of input into the final programme which the Commission presents but, in closing, I must stress that I believe that any regional programme, irrespective of how much funding it has, if it is not applied within the framework of international agreements – I repeat this because the approach on the European side is often considered paternalistic – so I repeat that this programme will only succeed and bring in the results we all hope for if it is applied within the framework of international agreements, the Beijing declaration on respect for human rights and respect for women's rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
