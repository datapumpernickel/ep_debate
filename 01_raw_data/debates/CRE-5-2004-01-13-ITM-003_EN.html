<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Almeida Garrett (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Parliament is today responding to the Commission communication on an operating framework for the European regulatory agencies, in which, as a follow-up to the White Paper on Governance, the Commission presented the general conditions for creating new agencies, the framework within which they are to carry out their activities and the Commission’s own responsibilities as regards supervising those agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish first of all, Commissioner, to congratulate you on this initiative and also on the broad criteria it contains. Parliament is pleased to note that due account was taken of its positions, which had already been set out in the resolution on the White Paper, with responsibility for the creation of agencies being attributed to the explicit choice of the legislator, on a case-by-case basis, through an act based on the provision of the Treaty which constitutes the legal basis for the specific Community policy which is to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">One important point that we wish to emphasise is the Commission’s acceptance that new agencies should be established sparingly and selectively. The use of such agencies is justified only in highly specialised scientific or technical areas, with a precise demarcation of the tasks to be performed and within a framework of responsibility and autonomy which does not call into question the unity and integrity of the executive function or lessen the Commission’s political accountability to Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As with everything in life, there is always a ‘but’. The report I am presenting today regrets the fact that the Commission has limited the scope of its communication to the so-called regulatory agencies to be created in future, within the institutional framework of the EC Treaty. It is regrettable that no reference is made to the existing agencies, when we all agree that there is a need to undertake in-depth assessment of the work of these agencies, to propose the reworking of some of their tasks and powers and, possibly, to update the structure and composition of their organs. These are concerns, as you know, Commissioner, that Parliament has expressed to the Commission through the parliamentary committees most directly involved in scrutiny of the agencies’ functioning and which today, once again, we emphasise.</p>
<p class="contents">We also deplore the fact that no discussion has taken place on the consequences that will ensue from the thoroughgoing changes proposed in the draft European Constitution, specifically the end to the pillar structure, the introduction of a hierarchy of legislation and the explicit provision made for judicial supervision of agencies’ acts. These must be properly understood in order to define the future legislative environment of the agencies more completely, coherently and boldly.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the limited scope of the communication, Parliament’s main concerns will always be to ensure the unity and integrity of the executive function at European level and the corresponding political responsibility of the Commission. You will also understand, however, that Parliament will pay particular attention to rules that enable tasks to be carried out transparently and effectively, to appointments to posts and cost management at the future agencies. We will, therefore, pay particular attention in the proposal for a future legislative framework to rules that impose on the agencies all the requirements for sound administration, for compliance with legislation on transparency, on access to documents, with the rules for protection against fraud and for protecting the Community’s financial interests.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to conclude by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control for their competent and judicious opinions and all my fellow Members who, by participating, served as co-authors of this report. Commissioner, we look forward confidently to the initiative for a legal framework for the agencies, which the Commission will present at some time in the future.</p>

Let us start with the facts: we currently have 16 agencies that were set up by the Treaties in successive waves to meet specific needs on a case-by-case basis. What characterises these 16 agencies today is indeed their diversity, in terms of how they operate, the tasks assigned to them and what they are called.</p>
<p class="contents">As we stressed in 2001, we believe that creating new regulatory agencies helps to improve the implementation of Community rules. The 2001 White Paper proposed that the Commission set out parameters, more precise criteria, for the creation, operation and supervision of these agencies. Our communication, the one that you are debating today, therefore seeks primarily to launch a process of reflection with you, and moreover with the Council, within a common framework, on the creation, operation and supervision of any future regulatory agencies, which we define as being actively involved in exercising the executive function at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">As your rapporteur has just mentioned, the work that they do is indeed at the very heart of the executive function. To avoid any misunderstandings – and I will be coming back to this when I respond to the debate, with reference in particular to the point raised by the rapporteur – this initiative does not cover the ‘executive’ agencies that help to manage Community programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">In a nutshell, what is the reasoning behind the Commission’s proposal? It is a balance between, on the one hand, strengthening the integrity and unity of the executive function – and we know that this is incumbent primarily on the Commission – and, on the other hand, providing the autonomy that these agencies must be able to enjoy if they are to plan their work for the longer term. It is all about striking this delicate balance. The purpose of the agencies is, on the one hand, to relieve the Commission of very technical tasks so that it can focus on essential policies. Nevertheless – and you reminded us of this, Mrs Almeida Garrett – the Commission must retain the final political responsibility for implementing regulations, because this is our particular responsibility to you and because we need to provide people with clearly identifiable remits to come before this House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is then this difficult balance that we are trying to improve, clarify and formalise, given that more and more of the regulatory agencies are meeting a need for an increasing level of expertise in a number of fields, regardless of short-term considerations. For this expertise to be constantly available and to ensure a certain amount of transparency, some degree of autonomy and, of course, supervision is also required. It is this balance that we are seeking and we await your debate to find out whether the way in which we have expressed this balance also reflects the kind of compromise that you might be able to accept on these tensions, which are inevitable, but which we wish to manage in a positive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission will note that there is substantial agreement between the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and the text presented by Mrs Almeida Garrett. In the field of regulatory agencies, there is a danger of us falling into the North American vice of the proliferation of agencies, which act in a completely autonomous manner and without any real control on the part of the legislative powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution contained in Mrs Garrett’s report are very significant. Specifically, when we get into the strictly regulatory field, we are talking about a legislative power and not an executive power. I would therefore call on the Commission, when drawing up a text with specific proposals, to prevent any reference which could imply the assumption of legislative powers by these agencies. In other words, we should try to ensure that, for any type of legislative delegation, there is an interinstitutional agreement, with the Council and Parliament as the legislative power.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must prevent the proliferation of agencies, regulatory or non-regulatory, because it appears that, at the moment, they have become a kind of Christmas present, which are given each year to governments, so that they can say in their respective capitals that they have achieved something from an institutional point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the legal basis and the tendency to invoke Article 308, the regulatory agencies would only make sense if there were specific European Union competence in that area, but not by creating special means for justifying that type of creation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important that the regulatory agencies are subject to the same type of scrutiny as the Commission. Even more in fact, given their distance away. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, of all times, when Europe finds itself in a crisis from which we have to extricate ourselves together, it is important that we ask ourselves how the various European institutions, including the existing and future agencies, can be embedded in the democratic structure of Europe: a democratic, transparent and efficient Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to reiterate that 2004 is a decisive year for Europe. It is a year in which it is vitally important to win back the confidence of the European electorate. This electorate looks at us and sees the European system as unwieldy and bureaucratic. Incidentally, the Heads of State or Government, who are fairly often found wanting, bear a large part of the responsibility for this. Citizens, who mainly see quarrelling between Heads of State or Government over the distribution of power and money, are naturally increasingly unable to grasp what this European cooperation actually means. It is not for nothing that we speak of a democratic deficit in the European Union that has to be filled. Europe is too slow-moving, frequently inefficient and incomprehensible to its citizens, and is thus achieving too little. This has to change, particularly with a view to the enlargement of the EU by ten new Member States on 1 May. That is why we must make Europe more efficient, more democratic. We must root out sluggish bureaucracy. In the first instance, this will of course be carried out by means of proposals in the European Constitution, which will hopefully become reality very soon. However, it will also take place in the case of subjects such as today’s – the creation of a framework for European agencies – which are not dealt with in the European Constitution. The focus is on the performance of essential tasks that are financed with European funds.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention a number of things that I believe to be essential within this framework. Firstly, direct scrutiny by the European Commission and political accountability to the Council and Parliament must be guaranteed when the European agencies are set up, and it goes without saying that those agencies must have a management that, on pain of dismissal, presents all problems of a genuinely political nature directly to the politically accountable Commissioner. I am sure we all remember the Eurostat case. Secondly, the confusing situation we find ourselves in at the moment, where we have no less than twelve different structures, must be replaced by a uniform structure that can be monitored and is comprehensible to all. Thirdly, the seat of an agency must be subject to criteria such as efficiency and cost-benefit analyses. That means no quarrelling over Parma ham and Swedish models.</p>

In the Øresund area, universities and business enterprises on both the Danish and Swedish sides formed a consortium and put forward proposals as to how good conditions could in practice be created for locating precisely this IT security agency in the area.</p>
<p class="contents">The Øresund region has a sound infrastructure, good international transport connections, very extensive IT facilities and strong environments for IT research and development. The universities would make facilities available so that the agency’s workers could have close contact with the research environments, and there was a desire to create buildings able to fulfil the agency’s demands. In short, here was an offer, in terms of location, that could guarantee a rapid start to the agency in an area easily able to attract qualified labour. I know there were other attractive environments in the offing in the Netherlands and Germany. What emerged from the efforts concerned, however? They were a waste of energy. The EU’s Heads of State or Government agreed that this agency should be situated in a town in Greece. I have nothing negative to say about Greece, but the decision-making process simply cannot be taken seriously. It is neither transparent nor comprehensible to the public.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very pleased with the report we are debating today, for it lays down a list of important and clear principles about the way in which decisions concerning agencies should be made in the future, about their operational frameworks and about how they should be placed in relation to the EU’s institutions, and I wish to congratulate Mrs Garrett on the good outcome. The decision concerning a new agency must be transparent and based on analyses of advantages and disadvantages. It must be the basis of a strong professionalism, and setting up an agency must not be a short cut to increasing administrative expenses. It is important for the Commission to have ongoing responsibility and for Parliament to have the role of supervisory power and not be governed by the agencies. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party’s amendments are to emphasise this, and I very much hope that there will be broad support for these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My first point is that this regulatory agency should have its headquarters, for reasons of cost, close to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that the functions of the regulatory agencies should be limited to the creation of secondary legislation linked to the Commission’s initiatives and should be subject to the approval of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I believe it to be important that the new regulatory agencies should exercise their autonomy subject to the direct control of the Commission and to the political control of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it should also be laid down that all the provisions of the Financial Regulation and of the Staff Regulations shall apply to the regulatory agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly and finally, the Commission should, before submitting any legislative proposal for the establishment of a regulatory agency, present an assessment of its budgetary consequences and of its profitability, as well as proposals for the redeployment and management of human resources.</p>

<p class="contents">If this goal is to be achieved, though, all the administrative units must be modernised; not just the Commission’s main offices, but also the subordinate offices, the agencies, and I can also see that the establishment, organisation and control of these is flourishing unchecked. There is too little transparency; often there is neither the necessary efficiency nor adequate control, and that is why the agencies of the future need to be put on a new footing.</p>
<p class="contents">In its report, Parliament now demands that an agency should be established by a law adopted by way of the codecision procedure. The joint involvement of the Commission, Parliament and the Council in this decision must become the norm in future. The legislative act of establishment must also stipulate where the agency is to be based. I could spend all my speaking time on what went on between Helsinki and Parma with regard to the food agency. That was a tragedy. Nothing of the sort must be allowed to happen again, and the choice of headquarters must be made by reference to competence and cost-efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to cut back the number of types of agencies; having fifteen agencies divided up into twelve types makes for an impossible situation. As these agencies are subject to the Commission, it is the Commission that should appoint their directors.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by thanking Mrs Almeida Garrett for this report, and by expressing the hope that it will get through.</p>

<p class="contents">- the urgent need for the Commission to clarify the appropriate legal instrument for defining the framework of general conditions governing the creation of these agencies, which would avoid the risks to which Mr Medina Ortega referred;</p>
<p class="contents">- the need for Parliament to be fully and permanently involved in appointing the members of the administrative board and in monitoring the activity of these agencies;</p>
<p class="contents">- the crucial need to monitor the legality of the actions undertaken by the regulatory agencies and by their administrative boards in line with the provisions of the draft Constitution drawn up by the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the Commission will take account of the proposals made in Mrs Almeida Garrett’s report, drawn up on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and once again I offer my congratulations to the rapporteur on the excellent work she has presented to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, on the scope of application of the text, your rapporteur indicated just now that she would perhaps have preferred the Commission to be a little more ambitious at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that for the time being we are only proposing instruments for future regulatory agencies. Why? The reason for this is quite simply that we want to start with what is immediately feasible and it seems to us that if we had to work initially on streamlining the existing agencies with their very disparate characteristics, it would have been difficult, if not impossible, to adopt a truly uniform approach. We therefore favour a uniform approach and wish to apply it first of all to future agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the legal instrument is concerned, I do not think that we disagree: a framework regulation is required, as you propose. This is a binding legal instrument for the application of common principles, which in this case is exactly what we are looking for. The advantage of having such an instrument on the regulatory agencies is that it would exist in parallel to the framework regulation on the status of the executive agencies, which was adopted by the Council in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the substance – and I think that we are in full agreement on all of these points – I noted that several principles emerged from your discussion: efficiency, supervision and responsibility, all subject to an overriding principle of parsimony, which I thought your rapporteur expressed very well.</p>
<p class="contents">On the principle of efficiency, we agree, and in particular we need to apply our good resolutions on efficiency to the structure and composition of the agencies. It is clear that if the administrative boards are excessively large and if the selection of the directors calls for permanent consultations then we will not achieve our aims. We therefore need to be disciplined enough to keep these in check and I think that we will be able to work together on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second principle is supervision. Many of you have said that whether it be from a legal, administrative or financial point of view, these agencies, which are, as it were, Commission outposts, need to be subject to greater supervision the further they are from the seat of the executive authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The third principle is the principle of responsibility. You said this and we agree with you on this point: the Commission bears the political responsibility and its agencies, even the regulatory agencies, work under the Commission’s political responsibility, which you must be able to call into question: it is, after all, your right and your duty to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, all of this, and I will conclude on this point, implies a principle of parsimony. We have to admit that it is sometimes tempting to resolve this or that problem by creating an agency; together we need to be able to resist this temptation. We need a good means for preventing proliferation and it would seem, having listened to your debate, that your intentions in this respect are perfectly in line with those of the Commission. I conclude then that we are well provisioned with criteria and principles that will enable us to improve the current situation, which is, it is true, starting to bear a strong resemblance to a plate of spaghetti. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
