<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Anneli Jäätteenmäki (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FI) </span>Madam President, the area around the Mediterranean is, of the EU’s neighbouring regions, the one which has perhaps had the most influence on the culture and history of the EU countries across the ages. Our language, our religion, the origin of our words and numbers have their roots in the Mediterranean region. The region is also strategically important, but most important of all, the countries which lie to the south of the Mediterranean are our neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">But history is history. 1995 marked a turning point in relations between the European Union and its southern neighbours. It was then that the Barcelona Process began. Today, 10 years later, Mediterranean policy is one of the main priorities of EU foreign policy. We might therefore say that in this respect there has been considerable change and development.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, 10 years later, however, we should perhaps ask whether we need the Barcelona Process today. Europe is so different from what it was when the process started. I believe and am convinced that Parliament’s unanimous reply will be that we do indeed need this partnership. Europe needs it, we Europeans need it, and, hopefully, our partners need it, much more than they did when cooperation at this level began. Nevertheless, we require more effective cooperation, and, indeed, more cooperation. It pleases me to say that the European Parliament has always been a strong supporter of the Barcelona Process, and many individual Members of Parliament have done much to take this partnership forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this situation, I want to mention a few issues which I hope the Barcelona Process will focus on more closely in the future. One is education. There is a high level of illiteracy in our partner countries. We in our own countries stress the importance of education and skills; it is the only way we can succeed. There the situation is exactly the same. I would like in particular to emphasise how important it is for young girls and women to have an opportunity to get an education and for the EU to invest in the eventual eradication of illiteracy. We here in the EU like to stress how important functional democracy is, but before we can expect democracy to work, people have to know how to read. The ability to read is therefore important for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to raise the matter of economic growth and the reforms relating to it. The EU has actively supported economic integration and free trade, and is indeed the biggest trading partner with the individual partner countries. More than 50% of these countries’ trade is with the EU, while just 13% is with the United States of America. There is, however, a certain dilemma associated with this. The brisk trade that exists between the EU and the partner countries is not reflected in any increase in the EU’s political influence. 50% of the trade does not mean that we hold 50% of the influence.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to emphasise the importance of the work of the Anna Lindh Foundation. I hope that more time and effort will be invested in this in the years to come, because the dialogue between religions and cultures is important. Unfortunately, it has to be said that the Barcelona Process has not been entirely successful in this respect, and this needs to be put right.</p>
<p class="contents">Migration is one important dimension of the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership, and today it seems that the problems are only increasing, so we also need to invest time and money in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that, as a representative of the Nordic region, it has been an agreeable experience working as rapporteur. I have learned a lot and I have also observed that that there is a need for dialogue between the cultures of Northern and Southern Europe. To my surprise, I have realised that at the moment there is not enough of it going on in the European Parliament either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its title – ‘The Barcelona process revisited’ – may at first sight appear rather surprising, but perhaps I may interpret it as meaning that its concern is with the strengthening and deepening of partnership between Europe and the other Mediterranean states, something that is quite clearly expressed in the motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">The tenth anniversary of the Barcelona process is not just an opportunity to appreciate past successes, which there have been, even though not everything we wanted to achieve has been; it is also particularly necessary that we should look forward, building on the foundations laid by these successes and, with determination and political courage, making full use of the potential of this cooperation for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Mrs Jäätteenmäki when she says that it goes without saying that the Barcelona process will continue to be needed in the future. It is for that reason that I attach particular importance to the major summit meeting to be held in Barcelona at the end of November, at which Heads of State and Government will, for the first time, be able to have their say on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has, at my suggestion, produced a communication of its own, to which I attach particular significance in view of the fact that it takes up the very same points that all of us in this House – for I have heard these same things from you – regard as especially relevant. There are three main ones, to which I would add culture.</p>
<p class="contents">First among these points is political reform, with, above all, the promotion of human rights, democracy and good governance, to which I shall return later. Second comes education and training; Mrs Jäätteenmäki is quite right to say that this is something on which we need to carry on working, an area in which we need to become stronger. This is a very particular concern of mine and I intend to see that something is done about it.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area is that of economic development. It is in this area that we have achieved perhaps the most successes to date, but it is also one in which we need to make further progress. I would like to come back to that and discuss it in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">There is of course more work for us to do in relation to culture, with the Anna Lindh Foundation, dialogue between civilisations and cultures, and this network’s potential for extension, being enormously important. The Commission is of course available to assist in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start by considering political reform, democracy and human rights, areas in which we cannot stand aloof, but must endeavour to support reform from outside. We cannot, of course, impose them; rather, we need to offer firm support and the possibility of supporting measures. That means that it is very important that the Neighbourhood Policy should build on the Barcelona process in making the right instruments available. Over recent weeks, I have visited many of these Mediterranean countries – Tunisia, Jordan and Lebanon among them – and see with what efficiency we can work with these instruments, even when, as is the case in these countries, human rights issues are addressed under different headings.</p>
<p class="contents">We have thought up something special in order to promote human rights, the plan being that we will – we expect from next year onwards, but certainly starting in 2007 – be making available complementary assistance in the form of a ‘Democracy Facility’. What that means is that the countries that are making particularly good progress with reform will, by way of support, receive at least an extra 10% on top of the funds that they already receive. I hope that this will give these countries an incentive to press on with still greater dedication and encourage others, which are currently dragging their heels, to do likewise.</p>
<p class="contents">This presupposes the extension and development of the political and security policy aspects of the partnership. It is because better use needs to be made of the political framework that I regard Parliament’s meetings in conjunction with Euromed as particularly important, but meetings of the Council of Ministers and meeting in troika format can also help promote further development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is essential that we consider the vital importance of education, not least in terms of its impact on society. In the Mediterranean countries, one-third of the population is under 15 years of age, and that means that we have to focus especially on education. The UNDP report on human development showed that education, and equal status for women in particular, will help drive development forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore made a special priority of the eradication of illiteracy, bearing in mind the UN millennium statement of intent that this should be done by 2015. I do hope that we will accomplish that. I would like to see girls and boys get the same opportunity to be enrolled at the same schools and to receive the same education. I would also like to see priority given to special support measures for women. We plan a scholarship programme for this purpose, which will provide, in particular, postgraduate grants for women, with the object of accelerating development in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also regard the problems surrounding migration as quite central among social issues. Today, for example, I welcomed Morocco’s Deputy Foreign Minister, Mr Taieb Fassi Fihri, and we did of course discuss current events in Ceuta and Melilla, to which we cannot be indifferent. We have to work together to arrive at solutions – solutions not only for the European Union as a whole in its relations with the Mediterranean in general, but also for the sub-Saharan states and Africa. While we must, of course, attempt to cut off people-smuggling, so that people do not become the victims of this terrible trade, we must also create additional development opportunities for these countries so that migratory movements of this kind do not occur.</p>
<p class="contents">While refugees must be treated in accordance with the Convention and with absolute respect for their human rights, the flood of illegal refugees must be stemmed, and this is certainly one of the key topics for the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, we have done much to ensure normal trade and a free trade zone by 2010, but much more remains to be done about services and agricultural trade, and South-South trade, also known as the Agadir process, must be further developed. Other vital topics include transport, energy, and the environment. There will be a conference on transport in December in Marrakesh; on the energy front, more and more sub-regional networks need to be developed. As regards the environment, the cleanliness of the Mediterranean should be guaranteed as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jäätteemäki quite rightly puts particular emphasis on cultural cooperation, to which we, too, want to give greater attention in future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course a matter of common knowledge that, although the Barcelona process offers the chance to get Israel and Palestine sitting around the same table, that same process is itself constantly overshadowed by the peace process in the Middle East, and so it is essential that we should make headway here. I have Mr Wolfensohn, the quartet envoy, who has done really good work here and whom we support entirely, in mind when I say that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to my proposal. Next month, the European Heads of State or Government will meet their Mediterranean counterparts to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Barcelona process. The Euro-Mediterranean Partnership was intended to provide the ambitious prospect of a better, varied future, simultaneously political, economic, social and cultural. The results, 10 years on, are mixed. We have created a forum for discussion and cooperation with our Mediterranean neighbours, which I welcome, but we are far from achieving all the objectives set. The conflict in the Middle East has not been resolved. The region is still unstable. Human rights and democratisation are not progressing, or are not progressing enough. The southern shore of the Mediterranean and its population have not benefited from the expected economic and social well-being. Unemployment, particularly among young people, is still too high and results in hopeless migration flows.</p>
<p class="contents">On the economic front, I will mention just one example: the end of the Multifibre Agreement, which has added to the difficulties experienced by the region. Although the new rules of cumulative origin, as proposed by Commissioner Mandelson, are moving in the right direction, South-South economic integration is still far from complete. We are the privileged partner of this region and all its hopes are turned towards us. Caring about these people primarily means responding to their concerns and their aspirations, in other words our ability to achieve greater social cohesion and sustainable economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Neighbourhood Policy proposed to us is a positive element, because it calls for greater democracy, even though the aid will have to be shared more broadly amongst our neighbours to the east and to the south. I hope that this new policy will pursue the objectives of the Barcelona process and that it will take account of the difficulties specific to this region. I am also concerned by the absence, in the neighbourhood and partnership instrument as proposed by the Commission, of a specific reference to the Millennium Goals.</p>
<p class="contents">In the global environment in which we live, liberalisation cannot be the answer to the problems raised. That applies to the protection of our environment – given that we are responsible for our planet – but, even more acutely, to the issue of public services that meet the basic needs of the people, namely education, health, culture, and access to water and power, which the Committee on International Trade, of which I am a member, proposed and which the Committee on Foreign Affairs did not adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the view that our work is not yet done. Let us be in agreement tomorrow to achieve a common goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The 10-year anniversary of the Barcelona process offers an excellent opportunity for us to take stock and, more importantly, to redefine our political vision and our strategy in the light of the new situation represented by the enlarged European Union, the challenges of globalisation and the increased threat of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona process deserves our special attention because it is the most integrated expression of the European Union's foreign policy, in that it is a multilateral, global partnership expressed through an integrated strategy. It is totally connected to the vital interests of the European Union, in that it can contribute towards peace and security in our area and can influence peace and equilibrium in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The results to date are not satisfactory. Both sides have been guilty of weaknesses and oversights. There has been a lack of perspicacity, political will, adequate financing and an inability on the part of the partners to promote reforms and cooperation between each other so that they become attractive markets and economies.</p>
<p class="contents">What I consider worrying is that this multilateral relationship and procedure has not helped to resolve the chronic problems, such as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the Cyprus question. It is also worrying that it has not reached the people. Citizens have not become participants and partners in this process, of which they are ignorant on both sides of the Mediterranean. They have not become aware of the challenges which require us to live together or of our points in common or even of the substance of our differences.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that the 2005 summit, 10 years after the first summit, will clearly include in its priorities this need to involve civil society in the Barcelona process.</p>
<p class="contents">We expect initiatives to be encouraged, such as the Euromed platform mentioned by Mrs Jäätteenmäki, and other forms of cooperation at all levels, such as between local authorities, regions and universities. The mobility of citizens in all social and professional groups must be encouraged. The role of the Euro-Mediterranean Ministerial Conference is very important and has already started to prove its worth and we hope that it will contribute to this mutual understanding and forging of a common conscience. We expect a real dialogue between cultures, in the full meaning of the word, which will not merely be a coming together to exchange business cards, but at which we shall engage in dialogue with a willingness to reveal our differences and find our points in common. The dialogue between cultures must encompass the full breadth and depth of the word; cultural standards, the interpretation of history, the way of life and the position of women. I am delighted, Commissioner, that you referred specifically to this, but I would like to point out to you that valuable work has been carried out by the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, not only in the opinion attached to the report, but also in a report drafted in 2002, which formed the basis for the first regional women's programme in the Mediterranean which we have today. What we are calling for is more than just education and jobs. We are calling for a real review of the situation of women and, on the part of the European Commission, for a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the results of our policy to date and for the integration of the gender dimension in all three pillars of the Barcelona process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Along with our US allies, this sends a clear message that we support, in this region, a strengthening of civil society, an open market economy, democratic pluralism and respect for fundamental human rights, including media freedom, independence of the judiciary and the rule of law and, in particular, women’s rights, as the previous speaker mentioned. Tunisia is an advanced country in the eyes of the Arab world in this respect. Environmental cooperation is also one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries, and in particular their growing populations, will provide growing markets for our own products. I believe that it is in the European Union’s interests to target substantial development aid through the current MEDA Programme, which, I believe, amounts to some EUR 3 billion per year, and eventually through the newly anticipated ENPI – the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument – to assist the Euromed group of countries with enhanced economic growth in order to prevent rising unemployment and rising tensions, which will in turn, from the EU security point of view, provide recruiting grounds for Islamist hardliners. We have seen that in the recent past during the Moroccan Casablanca bombings, the tragic civil war in recent years in Algeria and the rise of Hamas, Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad in the occupied Palestinian territories. We must remember, of course, that the tragic Madrid bombings were carried out by Maghribi Salafists.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also try to prevent large, uncontrolled migrant flows to the European Union. Otherwise, this will cause a total breakdown in the good intercommunal relations we enjoy at present.</p>
<p class="contents">We all hope for a free trade area by 2010. The new EuroMed Assembly facilitates dialogue between traditional enemies such as Israel and the Arab world. This forum uniquely allows them to resolve their problems peacefully. Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza, in my view, is a good start to putting the roadmap for peace back on the agenda. This Assembly is also a forum for the exchange of ideas between the Islamic world and the majority-Christian European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am optimistic about the spread of our democratic values in this region, with the recent elections in Iraq, Palestine and Lebanon and now, even, some tentative democratic moves in this direction from Egypt.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my political group, I strongly commend the Jäätteenmäki report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner who is here with us so late at night.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now ten years since the historic Barcelona Declaration, which led to the first Euro-Mediterranean Summit, which was hosted by Prime Minister Felipe González in his capacity as President-in-Office of the European Union. The prospect of the Euro-Mediterranean association that was opened up at that time gave us enormous hope. It is true that the results have been irregular and that there remains much to be done, but it also true that the obstacles and difficulties are and were immense, and it is not reasonable to ignore them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean, the cradle of European culture, has been and continues to be, in part, a sea of confrontations and conflicts. The Euro-Mediterranean partnership makes sense if it is the instrument used to remove those obstacles and to promote dialogue and cooperation between North and South, but also to prioritise South-South relations in those regions, which are greatly weakened.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Summit in November in Barcelona, Barcelona + 10, the important thing is to establish clear, viable and realistic priorities, which at the same time must be ambitious. We now have a reference framework, which is the alliance of civilisations, proposed by Prime Minister Zapatero and adopted by the United Nations, by means of the statement by its Secretary-General in July of this year. A necessary condition for achieving the objectives is a reduction in the tension in the region, in particular the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the real Achilles heel of Euro-Mediterranean relations. The main objective of this association is to create an area of shared prosperity, making progress on reducing poverty, overcoming the socio-economic gap between North and South, and, as has been said, promoting political reforms, democratisation and the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Many other issues have been arising in this debate: the problem of the management of migratory flows, discrimination against women, the serious environmental problems facing the <span class="italic">Mare Nostrum</span>, dialogue amongst the three monotheistic religions, the need for local and regional cooperation, the fight against terrorism, control of weapons of mass destruction, participation by populations, etc. But above all — and I will end here — the European Union and the Member States are particularly affected by the need for huge amounts of political will and economic commitment and to truly believe that, in relation to Euro-Mediterranean relations, we have a lot at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean is the European Union’s most vulnerable flank and if we do not take this issue seriously, we will pay the price in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The world today does look very different to the way it did ten years ago. We have had enlargement involving, for example, Cyprus, and have begun negotiations with Turkey and Croatia. The Neighbourhood Policy has been developed, and we have seen how, in many of our partnership countries, democratisation has progressed and, in certain others, unfortunately taken a step backwards. The fight against terrorism has become ever more important. The war in Iraq and the difficult process that Iraq is now going through on its way to democracy also has an impact on relations with the region as a whole. We have Iran and the problems surrounding the policy on nuclear fuel in that country. We have the Palestinian election and the withdrawal from Gaza but, at the same time, stagnation in the peace process. The exciting events in Lebanon and Syria and the ongoing tragic situation in Africa’s last colony, Western Sahara, show that there is still a very great deal indeed to be done in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, it is only natural to review and debate the Barcelona Process. It has created structures, and extremely important ones at that, and a form of more securely established cooperation between us. The association agreements with all the countries have led to more interchange, trade, projects and many shared fora, and it has given rise to a long-term commitment for the whole of the EU. Proof of this lies in the fact that there are Members from the whole of Europe, and not just from the south, debating in the Chamber this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a common history and culture and also common problems and solutions to those problems. The areas concerned, of which there are indeed many, include terrorism, migration, growth, development, trade, the environment and energy. Above all, however, the issues for the future are those of human rights and democracy. These are the most important areas of all and, in these, the Barcelona Process has in many ways failed. Even though the association agreements contain human rights clauses, these are not used because we have no sound mechanisms for dealing with serious human rights violations in the countries with which we cooperate. There is also sometimes quite limited interest in the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">These areas present the big challenge for the Barcelona Process in the future. We must restructure the whole of our cooperation so that it becomes a framework for a huge push for democratisation throughout the region. Nothing contributes more to stability than the transition to democracy. The least free countries in the whole world are concentrated in the Middle East region, and this creates a breeding ground for fanaticism, frustration and perhaps also terrorism. That is why, within the Barcelona Process, we must form strategies that push for extensive democratisation. We must support dissidents, civil society, freedom of expression and communities founded on the rule of law, etc. The means for doing all this are, of course, trade, interchange, educational programmes and cultural cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona Process must in that way become a type of alternative for countries that can never become EU Members. It must provide practical advantages in exchange for our requiring reforms. If we succeed in bringing this about, we shall have made an historic contribution. In conclusion, I wish to commend my colleague, Mrs Jäätteenmäki, for her very constructive report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am referring, of course, to the issue of human rights and democracy. If you are not convinced, you simply have to take stock of the situation regarding freedom of the press in the region – this was done at the invitation of Mrs Patrie this afternoon – or the situation regarding freedom of expression in Tunisia, on the eve of the World Summit on the Information Society. The proof can be seen in the number of violations of the rights to freedom of association, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly; a justice system that suffers major deficiencies in many countries; the torture which is commonplace, or even virtually systematic, in some countries, and the defenders of human rights who, all over the world, are the victims of numerous violations of their rights and are subject to a great deal of harassment.</p>
<p class="contents">The Barcelona process has therefore not kept all its promises on these issues. As Mrs Jäätteenmäki said, I believe that it has some shortcomings with regard to women’s rights, economic and social rights and the mechanisms put in place for an effective policy regarding democracy and human rights. Despite all that, the Barcelona process has made it possible to institute mechanisms and forums for political dialogue on these issues, and has therefore laid the necessary foundations to launch an ambitious policy of promoting human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">You said, Commissioner, that the issue of immigration would be at the heart of the discussions at the Barcelona Summit. Allow me, in this regard, to draw your attention to one point. I think that, with regard to the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration, we are encouraging countries to break international law. That is pretty clear and it has just been illustrated once again by the incidents at Lampedusa involving Libya, and more recently by the incidents in the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Mellila and in Morocco. By asking these countries to stem the flow of sub-Saharan refugees, we are encouraging and urging them to commit human rights violations. Before we try to quell the flood of those we call ‘illegal immigrants’, Europe itself has to define its legal immigration policy. However, you will be aware that we are making hardly any progress on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that civil society and Members of Parliament can help to improve the implementation of our policies on human rights and democracy in this region. That is why I very much hope that the Commission will be present in Rabat for the next extraordinary meeting of the Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1995, an irreversible process was begun in Barcelona, which aimed at closer cooperation between countries in the Mediterranean area. Pessimists will tell us that the results have been below expectations, that economic progress in southern Mediterranean countries has been insufficient, that political dialogue has been difficult and fragmented, that Europe has not been able to make itself heard properly with regard to human rights and democracy, that South-South economic cooperation is still in its infancy, and that results have not been satisfactory in terms of joint management of immigration. The international geopolitical landscape of today’s Mediterranean has certainly changed, and the ambitious project of the Barcelona Process must therefore be modified and adapted to this new international context if the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership is to meet the current challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin, however, with what has been done. We have set up joint inter-ministerial cooperation mechanisms – which will receive no further debate – for the common resolution of problems in that particular area. We have established a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly to supplement governmental cooperation, in which we work together under parliamentary rules. We have initiated a support programme worth EUR 700 million a year – MEDA – in order to channel resources and development between north and south, which today has achieved some quite attractive rates of implementation. We have set in motion the democratic process, which has started anyway, in coastal countries such as Lebanon, Egypt and, to a certain extent, Palestine. Association agreements have been signed between the European Union and all the southern Mediterranean countries, and there have of course been plenty of examples of cooperation, seemingly minor but very effective on a cultural level, which were all initiated within the wider framework of the Barcelona Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">All that has allowed us to understand one another better, whilst opening the door with a certain optimism to a second decade, when we must consolidate the positive aspects of the process, make more concrete our objectives and current planning, and correct any mistakes made, so that stability, peace, democracy and socio-economic progress may be results shared by an ever greater number of countries and citizens in the Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">One final point I wish to raise is the issue of culture, which is not only about education and training, but also about cultural heritage. If we safeguard our cultural heritage we can understand and respect each another better within the context of our own identities and diversity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is clear that the countries of the southern flank do not enjoy the same level of political development and/or economic prosperity. Nevertheless, the majority of these countries have to deal with various shortcomings, to a greater or lesser degree: political shortcomings, lack of democratic development and limited pluralism; economic shortcomings, because we are talking about antiquated economies, which do not have the capacity to generate employment for a growing population and are not sufficiently attractive to bring in the necessary foreign investment; and social shortcomings, high poverty and social inequality, illiteracy, discrimination against women — as has been mentioned — the public institutions’ lack of capacity, with negative consequences in terms of health, education, the economy, border control, and many other things.</p>
<p class="contents">The Mediterranean region must therefore be treated as a priority by the Union, not only due to the many historical, political, economic and social ties linking the countries of both flanks, but also for other reasons, such as security, including the terrorist threat, or the challenge of immigration. Cooperation between both flanks is therefore essential and must cover a very broad range of activities. Cooperation must operate in both directions — I repeat — in both directions.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of these neighbouring countries affect us, ours is a shared future; it is impossible to create a wall between the north and the south of the Mediterranean, especially in today’s globalised world. We must therefore enhance our relations with these countries, stimulate them and help them to overcome the shortcomings that I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we will approve tomorrow therefore insists on the need for political, economic, social and institutional modernisation and also improvements in relation to human rights. In this regard, I welcome the Commissioner’s words and the importance she attaches to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">We need impetus for reform — and I believe that we should all agree on this — on the southern flank. The European Union must not concern itself solely with the stability of those countries; stability cannot ultimately become an excuse for not moving forward. If we insist on the need for reforms in our countries, how can we not insist on the need for reforms in their countries? These countries must evolve. Otherwise, the problems will increase, and political and economic crises — including in the field of immigration and security — will only increase and ultimately it will be a lack of reform that brings instability.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of the Barcelona Process and the European Neighbourhood Policy. They must be fundamental instruments for the Union with a view, firstly, to demonstrating to those countries that they are priorities within our foreign action and, naturally, to helping them, to demanding that they also cooperate faithfully with us on resolving these problems affecting us and, finally, in order to stimulate them towards reform. A reform that can bring prosperity, freedom and, ultimately, more stability for these countries and hence for the whole of the Mediterranean basin.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like the next Barcelona Summit to be up to the challenge and I would of course like to end by thanking Mrs Jäätteenmäki for her efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is the connection between the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership and the Neighbourhood Policy, which was raised by the Commissioner. I believe this aspect must not lead us to focus solely on bilateral action plans, but should encourage us to create a geographical and political space that is both European and Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">The principal means of all that is the political dimension, which has increased, it must be said, because the European Parliament has contributed to the creation of a Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly, and the civil societies have set up the civil forum. What is missing are the governments. Where are the governments? I believe that to move forward with this process we need parliaments, societies and governments to engage somewhat more in dialogue, which in turn will enable us to create a more advanced human rights dimension. Finally, the sociologist Edgard Morin is quite right when he points out that it is not cultures, religions and civilisations that engage in dialogue, but people, individuals, men and women. I believe that the most serious limitation in all the years of this very generous and intelligent process has been the failure to make our different societies relate to each other, and because of that, terrorism and immigration today threaten to widen the gulf even further. I agree with our rapporteur when she says we must reinforce all the programmes and instruments that foster dialogue and understanding – and hence education, culture, training and information – between our societies. In short, we support our rapporteur because her report moves in that direction, and because Euro-Mediterranean politics need less rhetoric and a great deal more substance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the Union’s attention has been focused on enlargement, the new accession process and future enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, southern Europe and the southern basin of the Mediterranean often only received attention when problems or specific issues arose – as when thousands of immigrants arrived in Ceuta, Melilla or Lampedusa, or when the situation became extremely difficult for the western Saharan refugees in Tindouf. The human rights situation in the southern and eastern southern basin of the Mediterranean has not improved. There are no clear improvements in this field, or in democracy, freedom and transparency. I must point out that economic differences have also increased over the years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the European Union, Member States continue to be keenly attached to their bilateral relations with governments south of the Mediterranean. This clearly makes the partnership less coherent. This is an old problem of European politics not being able to act with a single voice, even in the relationship with such strategic areas as the area south of the Mediterranean. There is still the recurring question as to who is going to pick up the phone and speak on behalf of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I must mention another important deficiency in our intercultural dialogue. Some very important cultures and languages are ostracised and not represented. I should like to mention the Amazigh language and culture, which is neglected and even banned in several countries in northern Africa, and the Catalan language and culture. I hope that the next meeting in Barcelona will be an opportunity to achieve more visible and concrete results in a short time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to stress that this process is of importance not only for Malta and Cyprus, but also for the Central and Eastern European countries. Whereas some of the reasons for this are historical, others are very much more up-to-date and practical.</p>
<p class="contents">As recently as 20 years ago, the average Pole regarded Libya as the only Mediterranean country with which Poland maintained close relations. At the time, relations between the European Communities and the country were a great deal less friendly. Thousands of Poles worked in Libya, and a huge number of copies of Gaddafi’s ‘Green Book’ were published in Polish translation. The situation today is entirely different. Tens of thousands of Polish tourists visit Tunisia and Egypt every year, and a considerable number of Poles go on pilgrimages to Israel. Polish scientists are engaged in research in all the countries of the region, from Syria to Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is not only politicians and diplomats who take an interest in the broad concept of the Neighbourhood Policy, but also large sections of the populations in the new Member States. Problems relating to illegal immigration, respect for human rights, equal rights for women, the advancement of democracy and the economic development of the countries around the Mediterranean Basin have become our problems too.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe never has been and doubtless never will be an isolated island. Our relations with our closest neighbours are a measure of our solidarity and responsibility. By this I mean solidarity not only in terms of a duty towards partners within the European Union, but also in terms of a task that goes far beyond the borders of Europe and takes us everywhere that people desire peace, stability, the rule of law, economic growth and freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will benefit from the genuine implementation of as many of these values as possible in the countries neighbouring us to the south and east. The new EU Member States very much want to become involved in building a political partnership concerned with security, as well as an economic and financial partnership and a social, cultural and humanitarian partnership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was an unimaginable challenge: to resolve the structural and historical problems of the Mediterranean countries in one decade. But we have been working hard and we are beginning to find a solution to some of those problems.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the objective of a free trade area by 2010, rather than being a final objective, must be a stepping stone from which to move forward, and many other things must be added. We must enhance, at the same time as reforming, the Euro-Mediterranean process; we must stress the fundamental idea that inspired it and, in this case, transform potential achievements into a tangible reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the international situation demonstrates that the Euro-Mediterranean process is the best way to promote cooperation. Other strategies, based on aggression and threats, do not yield results. Nevertheless, the premium for moving forward, which is at the heart of this Euro-Mediterranean process, is proving to be effective. For example, I chaired the Delegation of European Parliament Observers at the legislative elections in the Lebanon, a Euro-Mediterranean partner; there have been elections, with problems, it is true, but there have been elections. And in other States as well, democratic progress has been made, although regrettably, in others, nothing is changing.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us move forward in democracy, human rights and equality. I would naturally like to stress the good aspects of your proposal. Let us also consider that we need a Euro-Mediterranean area of freedom, security and justice, let us accompany the free trade area with the essential concept of economic, social and territorial cohesion, which is as valid for our partners as it is for us, and let us also promote political participation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro-Mediterranean Parliamentary Assembly is an extraordinary success. We had the ACP-EU Assembly and this is the second institution we have created.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe, Madam President, that the Barcelona Summit will be positive, because it will enable us to create a Euro-Mediterranean citizenship within a process, the Euro-Mediterranean process, which is the best concrete manifestation of the proposed alliance of civilisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But at least the late hour of this debate has not kept us from making a sober assessment of the Barcelona Process, and the rapporteur is certainly to be commended for her candid report.</p>
<p class="contents">Ten years on, the Barcelona Process has not lived up to expectations and it would be fair to conclude that we do not have much to celebrate. However, this is not to say that we should be pessimistic; rather, we should look at the experience of the past ten years and demonstrate that we can learn from it.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are some lessons that I would like to draw. Firstly, we should avoid spreading ourselves too thinly. If necessary, we should admit that the Barcelona Process may have been far too ambitious and should focus instead on fewer priorities where we can truly make a difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must acknowledge that the problems of our Mediterranean partners are our problems too. Take immigration, for instance: the limitations of the Barcelona Process on immigration have turned into a massive problem at the door of European Union Member States. So, in helping our Mediterranean partners, we are in reality also helping ourselves. It could be a win-win situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must treat our Mediterranean partners like true partners. All too often, Europe has fallen into the trap of sounding patronising and appearing to dictate to them when this is not the right partnership approach at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the process needs visibility, both for EU citizens as well as for citizens of the member partners. Unless people see that the process can affect them and benefit them directly, they can hardly be asked to support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with it. Thank you, Commissioner, for your resolute proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether via the Barcelona Process, the association agreements or, more recently, within the framework of the European Neighbourhood Policy, Europe sets itself up as a partner of the countries on the southern shores of the Mediterranean. This partnership includes economic, social and cultural dimensions, but, above all, it must be based on mutual recognition of a political platform made up of shared indivisible values: democracy, fundamental freedoms, human rights and gender equality. Fundamental freedoms include the right to individual safety, freedom of conscience and freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when human rights activists are being prevented from holding their meeting in Tunisia, at a time when we are considering the conclusions of Mr Mehlis’s report on the assassination of Mr Hariri, we must remember that. In this regard, freedom of the press, which I would like to emphasise today, and the status of journalists are without doubt the best examples of this set of shared values. Without individual security for these journalists, there is no freedom of expression, and if the press do not have freedom of expression, there is no democracy! Freedom of expression is not a Western value: it shone more brightly under the Islam of the Umayyads than in the shadows of the Inquisition.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, following the assassination of Samir Kassir, following the appalling attack, more recently, on May Chidiac, I took the initiative, in agreement with my fellow members of the delegation for relations with the Mashreq countries, and also with the Committee on Foreign Affairs, to organise a hearing today, during which we have heard from journalists from all over the Euro-Mediterranean area. This morning, we submitted a symbolic appeal to the President of the European Parliament, calling for a free press in the Euro-Mediterranean area. My proposal this evening is that we should engrave the freedom of the press into the marble of the Barcelona Process as an indispensable condition of our partnership agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although some of these changes have been positive, a great many have been negative. I should like to draw the House’s attention to one of the former, namely the enlargement of the European Union to include Central and Eastern European countries, since it is my belief that these countries have something to offer as far as the Barcelona process is concerned. Their experiences of the transition from an authoritarian to a democratic regime, for example, or of implementing extremely successful economic reforms and overcoming the negative social consequences of these reforms, are still fresh in their minds. All these countries also have strong ties with the North African countries, be they of a political, economic or cultural nature. In some cases these ties date back many years, whereas in others they are more recent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to note that it is in our interests, or in other words in the interests of both Europe and of our partners in North Africa, to put the experience of these new Member States to good use, and to enhance the Barcelona process by means of their knowledge. I believe that we would then be more capable of working together to resolve the problems that we are debating today, such as migration, the slow implementation of political reforms and, in a large number of cases, inadequate economic and social reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1995, we set ambitious objectives, because the regional environment was much more favourable. Unfortunately, I fear today that the geopolitical regional scenario in the Middle East and the Mediterranean in general is not conducive to the implementation of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. The impasse in the peace process in the Middle East and the Palestinian question continue to have a determining and negative influence on Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. This was and is the basic precondition for the implementation of the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone spoke of results that were not particularly encouraging. However, I should like to comment on two main points. The question is how the Barcelona process will proceed in coming years. I believe that it is particularly difficult for the European Neighbourhood Policy to coexist with the Euro-Mediterranean process, when there are overlaps between objectives and policies. It is difficult for the European Union to persuade our Mediterranean partners of the honesty of its intentions without significant financing resources and with a limited Community budget. There has been institutional inflation in Euro-Mediterranean cooperation with the constant creation of new institutions and bodies. How will they operate without adequate financing? How will serious initiatives be implemented, such as that of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Zapatero, on the alliance between civilisations and dialogue between religions? At the Barcelona conference in November, wish lists will not be enough to persuade the Mediterranean partners. What is needed is a realistic roadmap and realistic priorities for the implementation of the objectives of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union’s Mediterranean policy establishes a Mediterranean partnership between societies based on the Jewish, Christian and Islamic faiths. At a time such as this, when fundamentalism is on the rise and the threat of terrorism is increasing, joint measures undertaken with universities, schools, civic institutions and churches to promote mutual understanding and tolerance among young people in the Mediterranean countries are of fundamental importance. I can tell the House that the new Member States are seeking inspiration in the experiences gained through the Mediterranean partnership as they strive to devise the Union's Eastern policy. The establishment of a common cultural area based on human rights and democracy, together with the rejection of fanaticism of any kind, is our response to the jingoistic movements operating in the world today.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue I wish to address is the problem of migration. Migration can be regarded as a threat, as has been amply illustrated in recent times by the writings of Oriana Fallaci. The real message of her books is that a new form of apartheid should be introduced in the European Union. At the same time, however, migration can also represent an opportunity to promote the development of Europe and the establishment of an international order based on peace and human dignity. The Barcelona process should serve as proof that such an order is feasible, and it should constitute Europe’s response to the threat of a clash of civilisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is clear to all of us that the Barcelona Process, of which we are celebrating the 10th anniversary, is a very important and historic process, even if we differ somewhat in our assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we can all say that the Barcelona Process has already made a difference, although it has not been exploited to the full. I agree with those who said that we have to deepen and reinforce it and we have to motivate ourselves to carry on the work.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you again, I am a passionate, I would even say activist for this Barcelona Process and therefore I have initiated this communication, of which I have spoken before, in which we have prioritised the most important areas, at least in my view. We cannot do everything at once: education, democracy, human rights and reforms and economic development are priorities, but we must not forget the cultural aspect and also our heritage – remember the Euro-Med heritage programme.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the difference between Barcelona and the Neighbourhood Policy? For some, this may be confusing. Let me explain. Barcelona is the multilateral platform, the multilateral process, it is the process from region to region. This does not exclude this complementary bilateral process in the Neighbourhood Policy, with a tailor-made programme for each country.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is that so important? As many of you know, different countries have different attitudes. I have just come back from Lebanon, where we are working with the Prime Minister on his reform project, together with our action plan. There, I am very hopeful. I was also in Jordan recently, where we will do everything we can to support the national agenda. The Moroccan Deputy Minister was here today and we will be working very closely with the Moroccans.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other countries where I am somewhat disappointed and where we need to work together. But it is for the countries themselves to make a difference and for us to support them. Although we have to share the responsibility and show solidarity, every country should first and foremost have ownership of its own process and reform. We should not forget that they have the primary responsibility for developing their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Euro-Med non-governmental platform presented its ideas in Luxembourg from 1 to 3 April 2005, and this very successful civil forum was organized with a series of national consultations and concluded with the approval of a statute and the charter of the NGO platform, as well as the election of a governing board. There were quite a number of proposals, which is certainly positive. That was reinforced in the declaration to be made in Barcelona. I know that the British Presidency intends to give those NGOs the right to speak and I think that is very positive and enriching for all of us.</p>
