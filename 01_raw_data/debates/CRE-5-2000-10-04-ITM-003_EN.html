<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paulsen (ELDR) </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, today we are to discuss, and perhaps vote on, a total of three reports which deal with this subject, two of them mine. They constitute the first steps on the long, long road towards ensuring food safety for all 370 million inhabitants of Europe. We might well hope that, before the whole of this package is in place, there will be very many more of us, as citizens, who are affected by these rules. This is the first step, and it is now also a question of establishing incredibly important principles before the work as a whole begins.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of my reports concerns foreign substances in animal nutrition. The most important changes which the Commission has proposed and which I support are to the effect that the directive should include absolutely every imaginable product intended for animal nutrition, including products used to feed what I call small animals, that is to say cats, dogs, guinea pigs etc.. The rules are designed to apply in the first place, however, to feedingstuffs for those animals we eat ourselves. After what has happened in the European market, it ought to be crystal-clear to us all now that, as human beings, we get to eat what we give to our animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The other important principle is the so-called dilution ban. This means that, if a batch of raw materials for foodstuffs has unduly high limit values, it should not be diluted down in undamaged batches in order in that way to escape the limit values. The Commission’s proposal removes those rules which entitle local and national authorities to local derogations. My report supports this.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the foreign substances in question are very rarely acutely poisonous substances, but are long-term and long-lived substances which can build up, such as dioxin and aflotoxin and heavy metals such as cadmium, lead and mercury. We know that the levels of these substances are constantly increasing in our food chain. The percentages are increasing slowly and continually in the earth, in feedingstuffs and in food. It is therefore important that we start the preventive process by removing a portion of these products from the chain. The percentages must not constantly increase in the body throughout life. We know, for example, that, in the long term, cadmium obstructs the kidneys in both animals and human beings. We know that dioxin and aflotoxin are carcinogenic etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree with all the proposals tabled by the Commission on this issue. Moreover – and this is important because it is to come up at the vote – the Commission wants to introduce something called an intervention level. For all these substances, there is, as it were, a natural background level of constant ‘white noise’. We shall never escape this altogether. We have therefore set a limit value which may not be exceeded. The intervention level is a level at which vigilance is to be exercised and provides an opportunity to launch an investigation when it is discovered that a substance in a product or in a geographical area is increasing above the background level but still remains below the level at which it must be banned, that is to say the limit at which we <span class="italic">must</span> intervene. This is a crucial and important point in preventive work. In the long term, it is very important that we should be able to begin an investigation in peace and quiet and try to stop the increase in a particular substance before it reaches this emergency limit value. This is something which everyone at each stage in the food chain should in fact help with. If we let the matter rest until the limit value has been reached, the measures to be taken become very drastic. It is then a case of catastrophe intervention of the ‘dioxin in Belgium’ type. It is important for us to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that we can cope successfully with increases in foreign substances.</p>
<p class="contents">In both of these re-worked draft directives, I have tried to use a form of language which is readable. A legal text should be precise enough for it to be possible to comply with it. I also believe, however, that it is Parliament’s responsibility to try to produce laws, rules and regulations in the European Union which can be understood by our fellow citizens who have to comply with them and who need to read them. I have therefore made a lot of the language more straightforward and tried to simplify matters and make them crystal-clear.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to limit values, which must be set extremely rigorously in the future to check unwelcome developments, I would ask you to take account of the problems which low limit values, for example for dioxin, will mean for, for example, fishing communities in the Baltic, in parts of the North Sea and probably in Mediterranean coastal areas. I would also ask you to take account of farmers whose fields border either very busy roads or industries which have contaminated large areas. Many of these instances of poisoning or cases in which heavy metals were dispersed occurred before there was sufficient environmental awareness and before it was known what the effects would be. We cannot find the culprits. I would ask that we take account of these individual fishermen and farmers in future because they are innocent and are being hit by financial ruin.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the directive on the official control of the field of animal nutrition, it is important that we really do have a form of inspection which is implemented and which is the same throughout the European Union. If inspection is not complied with and we are not in a position to inspect the inspectors, then all the thinking being done in connection with the safety of our fellow citizens will be undermined. The people of Europe cannot, however, properly rely upon such control’s really being carried out if there are major differences of approach between Member States and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second thing we must take into consideration is the fact that differences in the application of these inspection rules will mean serious disruption of the internal market. There will be a price to pay for safe food at every stage in the chain. It would therefore be dangerous if certain countries, areas or industries were to be able to escape inspection and compete over prices at the expense of safety. That would be an extremely undesirable situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority of the committee adopted amendments to the opinion, amendments to which Mrs Auroi did not wish to subscribe. That is why it now falls to me to deliver the opinion, and I want to make the House clearly aware of this conflict of views.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem we have been considering is that of minimum and maximum values and the issue of dilution. You know that, during the BSE crisis, Parliament constantly called for these stricter directives and regulations for animal feed, and we also insisted that there must be no dilution, because maximum values, of course, always mean that something is in the feed and that we are making animals or people the final repositories of such substances, however minimal their volume. At that time we said that, if we accept maximum values, there must also be a dilution ban.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur had proposed that basic substances, components, which were not authorised for human consumption should not be used in animal feed either and would therefore have to be diluted with other substances until their content fell below the maximum permitted value. She also examined the other side of the coin. There are areas where farmers grow basic substances which exceed these maximum values. What about the people who produce these substances? Mrs Auroi said that they were helpless to prevent the excessively high values. At the same time, those who obtain these feed products cannot help the fact that the farmers are unable to alter the nature of their produce! That was the essence of the conflict. I can understand why the rapporteur dissociated herself from the amended opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make a suggestion to the Commission as to how this problem could be tackled. If this type of dilution is permitted, there must at least be a requirement to notify the monitoring bodies, and the fact that such dilution occurs must be made public, because the public also need to be aware of this problem and discuss it.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Auroi (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we should bear in mind the fact that one of the new features in the White Paper on food safety was the ‘farm to table’ idea, which made farmers directly responsible for the quality and the safety of the animal and vegetable raw materials that they produce. Almost a year after the publication of this paper and following many food crises, many of them linked directly to animal nutrition, Mrs Paulsen’s report is the first investigation of the role of animal nutrition in food safety. This is something we must all welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the strong points of the proposal is the principle of non-dilution, which prohibits using healthy feedingstuffs to dilute a batch of animal feedingstuffs contaminated by, for example, dioxins. This is the position Mrs Paulsen, from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has adopted. This was also my position as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. The amendments proposed by members of the Group of the European People’s Party, Mrs Klass, Mrs Jeggle and Mr Sturdy, have made it possible to reintroduce dilution in the proposal adopted by the Committee on Agriculture. As I personally am not prepared to sacrifice food safety on the altar of the agri-food lobbies, I have withdrawn my name from the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Try as I might, ladies and gentlemen, I cannot understand the Group of the European People’s Party which, despite the successive crises, involving Belgian chickens contaminated by dioxins, French sewage sludge in animal feed or Dutch sump oils in cooking oil, wishes to continue to poison European consumers to some extent. Their idea is that we should not have to destroy a batch of products just because it is contaminated with dioxins! It would be much better to add healthy products until an acceptable level of pollution is reached.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People’s Party, now that we have the White Paper, the precautionary principle and the principle of food safety, the only acceptable level of pollution in feedingstuffs for animals that will end up on our plate is the zero level measureable today. This is because dioxins are products that build up in the body. If we were to continue to allow dilution, this dioxin present in animal feedingstuffs would first build up in the animal, and then, to an even greater degree, this toxic product would gradually accumulate throughout the consumer’s body.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore join Mrs Paulsen and the Commission and adopt the principle of non-dilution in order to make animal nutrition safe and to effectively protect European consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to inspections, the Commission’s proposal for a directive on inspections in the field of animal nutrition stems from the report by Mr Staes. This reiterates and specifies the factors that are essential if we are to overcome the kind of aberration seen in the dioxin crisis in the summer of 1999. This report seeks to prevent poor coordination between national and European institutions. As draftsman of the opinion, I approve of the main amendments proposed by the Commission, such as the establishment of national contingency operational plans, giving the Commission the option to adopt interim protection measures, the obligation on Member States to inform the Commission as soon as contamination or serious risk thereof is detected, and the creation of a legal basis in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be emphasised that inspections must take place on three levels in order to enable an emergency system to be established. The first level of inspection is the responsibility of the animal nutrition producing companies themselves as well as the farmers, who ought to be the most directly concerned with ensuring the quality and safety of the products that they use. The second level, of course, involves the Member States, who are responsible for carrying out inspections of food safety. The third level, which is the subject of this amendment, establishes the Commission as the supreme guardian of food safety, authorising it to intervene in emergencies, without necessarily consulting Member States, and to adopt any interim measures necessitated by the emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all well and good, but Parliament must nevertheless identify its new role in this process. A slot must therefore be provided, at least at the end of the process, for the Commission to inform Parliament of the decisions that it has taken. What will the role of the European food agency provided for in the White Paper be, once it is up and running? We must ensure, on the other hand, that this process does not cause the Member States, businesses or producers to shirk their responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The crises of recent years have made everyone, including ourselves, more keenly aware of the situation. One thing must be clearly emphasised: the dioxin crisis was the result of criminal infringements of the existing rules and regulations. The time has come for a review of the directives on food safety. In all our deliberations, however, we must be mindful of the entire supply chain; in other words, we need what Mr Glavany, the French President of the Council, has called a quality pact between society, industry and agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The correlation must be seen, from natural production via industrial processing to marketing. When setting maximum values, we must remember that nature has its own set of laws, that harvests vary from year to year and that farmers are ultimately harmed by environmental effects over which they have no control. For that reason I call on the Commission and the Council to create liability provisions which protect farmers and their land, by which I mean that they must make the compensatory regimes workable and ensure that the provisions are based on the polluter-pays principle.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1999 Directive was well thought-out, and it has already scored its first success by demonstrably reducing pollution levels. For that reason, I am starting to wonder whether we actually need tighter rules. What I think we really need is action against criminal offences. I should like to inform the House that Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, which the PPE-DE Group tabled, have been withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new in the present proposal is that it gives Member States scope to operate with action thresholds, which would enable them to use their own discretion as long as the established ceilings were not exceeded. In the context of a necessary European regulatory system, such discretionary scope surely entails a risk to producers as well as jeopardising trade and transactions. There are dangers, and from this dangers in the internal market as well. A prescribed European regime must therefore lay down the line that we all have to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely imperative that undesirable substances which are extremely toxic should be neither traded nor used in mixtures, and the withdrawal of the amendments does nothing to alter that position. Farmers have a right to flawless animal feed. Their economic success depends on healthy livestock. No rules can achieve anything if they cannot be strictly and comprehensively enforced. That is why the PPE-DE Group advocates effective controls, and we echo the rapporteur’s call for the food safety auditors in the Commission to be able to conduct unannounced on-the-spot inspections in close and constructive cooperation with the inspectorates of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that I have heard Mrs Klass, I am now in a somewhat calmer frame of mind. Looking over towards Mr Böge, with whom I cooperated very closely, and towards the coordinator, Mr Goepel, I wish to express my thanks to them too for the withdrawal of Amendments Nos 41 to 44, which would have permitted the various blending options.</p>
<p class="contents">I also say that very clearly in the context of the two reports we are dealing with here today. We want food safety, which means safe production from beginning to end of the food chain. That is something which this House has always unanimously advocated. During one of the greatest of all food crises, namely the BSE crisis, the House managed to cooperate in a spirit of mutual confidence, irrespective of party affiliations, and I should have found it very regrettable if, at such a juncture as this, a pseudo-interest group – for it would not have been a genuine interest group – had carried the day.</p>
<p class="contents">During the BSE crisis, we always said – and Mr Böge was the foremost proponent of this view – that dioxin-contaminated milk must never be mixed with non-contaminated milk as a means of reducing the level of the undesirable substance below the maximum permitted value. We dealt in exactly the same way with all other matters relating to the blending ban. That is why I am grateful to the Commission for introducing this new element to its legislative proposal and to the rapporteur for her master strokes which have introduced slight additions and improvements to the proposal at several points.</p>
<p class="contents">So what do we actually want? Of course we do not wish to treat the manufacturers of compound feed and other animal feed in any way unfairly, nor do we wish to be unfair towards the poor farmers. But it is not the answer simply to permit blending. Perhaps a register showing contaminated areas would actually be a solution. But I will not accept waste incinerators! Waste incinerators are no longer permitted to emit dioxins. If they still break the rules, it is not only to the detriment of farmers but to the population as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Klass, would you be so kind as to listen to me? I listened very patiently to you, although I sometimes find that difficult!</p>
<p class="contents">We must establish a register. We have long been demanding a dioxin register in the European Union which would show where contamination is occurring. And of course, where fields are close to motorways, we must look and see where heavy-metal contamination is occurring. In such circumstances I can certainly accept that farmers in those areas will go to their regional authorities and will tell the Commission too that regional planning, transport, road traffic and other factors are affecting the fields they have inherited from their fathers and that damage is occurring through no fault of their own. How shall we compensate them for this?. Mr Goepel here is making a gesture to indicate money. No question about that. Nor do I have any problem with allowing dilution or blending in the case of certain products, provided it is always carried out under the control of the Member State and of the Commission. That is something to be examined in due course.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say again that we shall be doing nobody any favours, nobody in this entire world – neither manufacturers nor farmers nor consumers – if we act here as if this were a conflict between farmers and manufacturers of food products or consumers. We all want the same thing and we have to say this very clearly here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One more word on inspections. Yes, the Commission must be able to take protective measures. It can do that in the domain of foodstuffs, and it must also be able to do it in the domain of animal feed. If all of us were served animal feed in the canteen downstairs for a period of time, if we were able to see on our own plates exactly what animal feed is, we should perhaps deal with the issue rather differently and be just as hard and as stringent as we are on the safety of food for human consumption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is now the phrase that sums up the policy on protecting consumers and the food chain that the European Union wanted. This was absolutely vital.</p>
<p class="contents">The dioxin crisis that struck Belgium over a year ago made a deep impression on people all over Europe. This crisis not only cost billions of euros, but also resulted in even more suspicion about what we eat. More than ever before, the public is calling on us to act and is demanding strict standards, which will guarantee healthy food. This directive is the first link in a long series of decisions to be taken on food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">What can I say in one minute?</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, we must insist on Amendment No 37, concerning dioxins. The standards that we are demanding are, admittedly, extremely high but, until more accurate scientific studies are available, we must not take any risks. PCBs and dioxins are toxic substances, even in very small quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur expressed what we should think of the principle of dilution. This would, to my mind, be an appalling message to send to consumers and producers. More than ever before, this consumer needs reassurance. This directive will contribute to food being, as I said before, healthy and of high quality from the stable to the table. This is what the public demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to state at the outset that when we talk about undesirable substances and products, we immediately tend to think of dioxins and PCBs, but there are also heavy metals and, more generally, long-lasting organic pollutants which are by and large, as we know today, hormonal disrupters. In other words, even tiny amounts of these substances can have an effect. We must therefore adopt limit values, which are arrived at realistically, since our environment is already polluted by this type of substance, but which, at the same time, must also be as low as possible in order to limit the risks.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it quite strange that the Commission’s proposal does not specify any limit values for PCBs and that it proposes limit values for dioxins only in the case of citrus pulp, which is really quite bizarre. The truth is that this is the result of a disastrous event that occurred two years ago. Incredibly high levels of dioxin were found in citrus pulp from Brazil due to the drying process to which they were subjected. Where heavy metals are concerned, there are many inconsistencies. The value limit for fish meal, for example, is different to the level proposed for non-marine animal derived products.</p>
<p class="contents">On all these matters, my Group has tabled amendments, which, broadly speaking, have been accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy – to whom I am grateful – despite the vote against by the PPE-DE Members. I hope that the latter will change their minds for the plenary sitting, because I cannot see any arguments that could justify the inconsistencies in the Commission’s draft proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that, given the prevailing attitude in the House, we can face the vote with confidence and hope to achieve a majority, which will enable us to put our point of view across at second reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The detection of dioxins in citrus fruits that have been imported into the Community to serve as animal nutrition revealed the loopholes in current legislation on inspections. The public is worried and is demanding guarantees. Any threat to animal health will also automatically endanger human health. Zero risk is, of course, impossible, but an early warning system must nevertheless be put in place. Member States must, moreover, pay close attention to monitoring the implementation of texts. On this point we are in agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think that it acceptable, on the other hand, to take advantage of this opportunity to extend the already myriad competences of the European Commission even further. It is all a pretext for further harmonisation as if viruses, germs and polluting particles were subject to the concept of freedom of movement.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us dwell for a moment on the profound thoughts of those who are obsessed with harmonisation. If there are germs, let us harmonise health services! If there are risks to food safety, let us harmonise what we eat through a common nutritional policy! Let us harmonise away and, to monitor the outcome of all these acts of harmonisation, we shall have nothing less than the obedient uniformed Community crack troops to ensure that our way of thinking is properly implemented, because our Member States are naughty little rascals we need to keep an eye on!</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we will not put up with this cult of harmonisation any more! Today, this idea of bringing everything into line, which is completely cut off from reality, is leading some people to call for spot checks, with no warning to the States in which Brussels has no confidence. This is unacceptable. But remember, ladies and gentlemen, that the legitimacy of our Community institutions and our own legitimacy depend entirely on the will of the peoples whom it is our duty to represent. It is time to break with a misguided interpretation of the principle of subsidiarity, which attempts to increase Brussels’s hold on our nations a little more each day.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is today emblematic. You intend to destroy the sovereignty of our States by any means possible. Did you not hear the political warning given on 28 September by the Danish people? Or do you think that there is “something rotten in the State of Denmark”? Maybe you have the same idea of democracy as the revolutionary Pierre-Louis ‘Prieur’ de la Marne, who told the Convention under the Terror, “The people must be made happy, despite their wishes. The people must be forced to be free”.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens are fed up with being forced to be happy, of being hampered a little more every day in their activities by petty, pernickety and stifling red tape. You ignore people’s sense of national allegiance and the role of the nation-state and the ‘single mindset’ which you embody is out-of-date and dangerous. It is smothering the idea of Europe. So for goodness’ sake, save Europe, by ceasing to offer up harebrained and fanciful ideas to the idol of harmonisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not oppose the Paulsen report – we fully support it. There is a significant reason underlying our contribution, particularly regarding Article 5, which stems from the fact that, although this is a major, coherent instrument, its scope is still limited, for it concerns production measures and does not deal in any way with the commercial side of things. As a result, we European consumers will find ourselves continuing to buy meat and milk and their derivatives that are produced on the world markets using animal feedingstuffs which are in no way subject to the thresholds and limit values defined by the European Union, under a system which allows raw materials to be acquired on the international markets, where producers are free to mix all types of ingredients and formulations before selling their products on Union territory.</p>
<p class="contents">We are calling for a comprehensive assessment of the issue precisely in order to afford better protection to farmers. In actual fact, a major measure such as the Paulsen report ends up having the adverse effect of opening the market to production systems whose quality is not sufficient to comply fully with the limits and threshold values which we require. This was the reason for our discussion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and, when all is said and done, we would not like a repetition of what usually occurs, which is that when it comes to major measures it is always the farmers who pay the price, when they are the only guarantors of a production/agricultural land ratio which Parliament must preserve at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore invite all the Members to discuss the issue responsibly. We have absolutely no desire to defend specific interests; we simply want a compliant production system which does not involve going outside the market with measures of this kind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what we are trying to do in this report, on which I congratulate Mrs Paulsen. Certainly the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy was the correct committee to bring these proposals forward in view of what we have heard. We have had to learn lessons from the dioxin scandal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now proposed deleting the derogation for compound foodstuffs and having the option of fixing action thresholds below the maximum permitted limits in cases of real emergency.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the rapporteur, I believe that there is a case for doing all these things and for looking at the substances she referred to when they are not in themselves toxic but show increases in the aggregated levels. Animal feed, which has proven to be unsafe, should certainly be removed from the food chain. That is not just a precaution, it is common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to sound one note of caution. Common sense has two sides. If we are going to propose that, for example, there should be a tenfold reduction in the materials which are permitted to enter the European Union for blending down by approved food manufacturers, we ought to be certain that there is a sound scientific basis for that proposal. The Commissioner will know that in my country the Independent Advisory Committee on Animal Feedingstuffs was worried that such a ban may actually drive out blending-down procedures into the world outside the EU where they are less likely to be correctly monitored and controlled for any future entry into the Union. The committee agreed that there needed to be upper limits for undesirable ingredients, above which the materials would have to be destroyed.</p>
<p class="contents">By the second reading we need to have the Commission's view on how the risk assessment will be carried out. That is a very simple request which is not connected with any specific amendment proposed this first reading. It may well determine, however, how we can vote at that stage. I suspect it will also determine how we are able to make the case which the Commission quite properly wants to make for clean food in Europe, outside the European Union, to those third country exporters who will be affected by the new levels and to the WTO, if any challenges to what we are doing are mounted there.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to hearing from the Commission how it will demonstrate that its response here is not only precautionary – which it clearly is – but also proportionate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is something that cannot be practically applied or monitored. For that reason, we should look into legislation which is reasonable in the sense that it could be monitored and implemented in practice. The sort of legislation that cannot be monitored or implemented in practice will naturally erode Parliament’s credibility, as will the fact too that we should draft such legislation. I will cite Amendment No 18 as an example. How can we monitor what a domestic animal roaming freely drinks or where it drinks?</p>
<p class="contents">The basic idea is right. Legislation must be all-embracing and comprehensive, but it must also be such as can be put into effect and monitored in practice.

Residual poison, pollution, poor animal husbandry and poor hygiene will result sooner or later in sick animals and, consequently, also in an increase in illnesses among human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, a lot of inherited knowledge and farmers’ lore has been lost in industrial agriculture, where animals have been reduced to production units and commodities. I am convinced that, with ecological agriculture, we should not have had the major problems we have today. The situation is now as we find it. The two proposals we are discussing today, concerning foreign substances and products in animal feed and official control of these, are therefore necessary and welcome. These proposals also mean a step towards a complete package of measures in favour of food safety.</p>

I am pleased that the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats have withdrawn the amendments concerning the problems associated with dilution. That saves me a very great deal of speaking time. However, it would be unfortunate if, for example, Amendments 39 and 40 were adopted, for this would mean that the opportunities for Member States to intervene quickly to combat newly discovered dangers would disappear. Experience has of course shown that it is precisely this that we need to do. We need to act incredibly quickly because people’s health is at stake. We must also constantly bear the precautionary principle in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the rapporteur’s proposals but shall vote against the amendments tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in the interests of farmers and consumers to restore consumer confidence in food. In this very sorry saga, farmers have in many cases been the innocent victims of circumstances beyond their control.</p>
<p class="contents">Central to this very wide debate is the White Paper on food safety which will for the first time propose an ethical framework putting Europe and its Member States at the forefront of world food safety. It has been brought about by the clear and unequivocal concerns of 370 million consumers in the European Union on the safety of the European food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States must conduct specific target inspection programmes in the implementation of these directives. They will be required to inform the European Commission when a serious risk of contamination is detected. The Union must also, by means of directives, establish a legal basis to harmonise the transmission of information on feed controls and food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment briefly on the directive concerning undesirable substances in products and animal nutrition. The chicken dioxin crisis highlighted the shortcomings in Community legislation and animal nutrition. It will end the possibility of authorising the use of raw materials for animal food in excess of the maximum limits laid down.</p>
<p class="contents">These directives are part of the most radical shake-up of the Community's food safety hygiene rules for at least 25 years. The new regulations will merge, harmonise and simplify very detailed and complex hygiene requirements which were previously scattered over numerous directives.</p>
<p class="contents">We have all learned our lesson from the food crisis of the 90s. I am confident that with this systematic set of uniform rules we are laying the groundwork for filling the gaps in the existing legislation and enhancing food safety throughout the food chain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the domain of EU consumer policy, I believe ‘from stable to table’ has few rival claimants to the title of Expression of the Year. If, however, we want to apply this principle of transparency consistently, our commitment must stretch from the farmer’s pitch fork to the consumer's table fork. Consumer safety begins with animal feed, with its ingredients, the declaration and, last but not least, the official inspections.</p>
<p class="contents">These three reports place us on the horns of a dilemma. As far as feed content is concerned, let me say that food safety is a highly sensitive issue. If scientific studies come out unequivocally against the use of certain substances, the precautionary principle must apply. I doubt, however, whether we shall succeed in introducing a zero-tolerance threshold. That would be dubious consumer protection and, what is more, it would surely be impracticable. I believe it would undermine the very legislation it was intended to reinforce.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the declaration of feed materials – the open versus the semi-open declaration – our dilemma is surely between consumer protection and economic viability. With today’s analytical methods, Commissioner Byrne, any recipe is as transparent as can be. Any manufacturers who therefore wish to discover precisely what a competing company is offering its customers have long been able to acquire this information.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by dealing briefly with two problems relating to the declaration. The number of those who seek precise details on ingredients is relatively small, according to my research. This brings me to the other point. The full declaration certainly costs money, and the farmer ultimately has to foot the bill. The official feed inspections are the final link in the chain of transparency in the sphere of animal feed. Unfortunately, however, despite all our efforts, it will never be possible to completely eradicate criminal practices. For my own part, finally, the quality of our food concerns me less than the eating habits of our citizens in general. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Irrespective of whether we eventually reach agreement, let me take this opportunity to thank all of the honourable Members whose constructive preparatory work has brought us to the present point in this discussion. Speaking for my group today as the draftsperson of the dissenting opinion in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I should like to make five points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the new proposal which was introduced by the Commission in December 1999 and which forms the basis of Mrs Paulsen's report seeks to change the system completely less than a year after the introduction of the existing directive in April 1999. The report abandons the distinction between feedstuffs, feed materials and feed additives. The new directive that will be put to the vote today does not materially alter the quality of animal feed in any way, since the proposed limit values applicable to the final feed product are the same as those in the present directive. The same is true of dioxin. What we are discussing so fastidiously is not going to be changed here. Moreover, in my eyes a crime is a crime!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, for farmers, who are, of course, the producers of primary feed materials, there will in fact be a change, because in future they will have to destroy considerably higher percentages of their feed materials. What we want is a comprehensive, prudent and practicable arrangement for all concerned. The question whether the text we are now being asked to adopt is appropriate, especially from a food safety or macroeconomic point of view, is extremely debatable. I believe it is not. From my own conversations, however, I know that I am not speaking for a majority of the House on this particular point. That being the case, it is important at the present juncture to make emphatically clear that compensation for these additional losses and shortfalls suffered by farmers, to which Mrs Paulsen rightly referred, is essential, that we must create directives to regulate this and that we must reflect on how we should deal with these things at the WTO negotiations and how we should regard imported products which contain such undesirable substances.</p>

We must attempt to improve food safety and to rule out any crises which not only put the confidence of the consumer to the test but also bring the entire agricultural sector into disrepute in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion on Mrs Paulsen’s sound report was emotionally charged at times, and I believe that now, with this discussion behind us, we can assume that, although the requirements prescribed for the feed industry are strict, we can ensure that by admixture, the quality will change in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the consumer is not prepared to wait for this to happen and I also have the feeling that, whilst the compound feed sector is still creating problems at the moment, it is ultimately the farmer, in fact, who ends up footing the bill for the damage done to consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome this regulation, because I believe that food safety is a question of choice. This means that, in this case, the interests of producer and consumer, farmer and product buyer must go hand in hand, and I have a feeling that the derogations provided for in Articles 6 and 7 make it possible not only to take a more flexible stance on certain points but also to adopt a harder line at the same time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Marit Paulsen has played a very creditable role in this work by drafting her report on undesirable substances in animal feedingstuffs and the monitoring of feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">In practice it is impossible to demand that animal feedingstuffs should contain no undesirable substances at all. Now we are confirming the maximum quantities beyond which a batch of feed could not be used. The Commission is proposing at the same time that the option of diluting a batch of feed that exceeds the maximum levels with one that does not exceed them should be abolished. This sort of practice has fortunately been unknown in the animal feedingstuffs industry up till now in many Member States. The Commission’s proposal is a welcome one, and clearly preferable to the amendment tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which would allow the practice of dilution to continue. Dilution would simply lead to unhealthy effects in the use and treatment of raw materials. The committee proposes the Commission’s proposal on this matter should be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">After the committee meeting I really felt we needed just to extend a helping hand to the producer. The farmer must obviously be compensated for the destruction of a batch of feed that is so contaminated that it is unfit for use, just as in the case, for example, of the destruction of animals with TSE. Compensation is necessary, although it is obvious that farmers themselves are concerned about the wellbeing of their animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee also adopted the amendment we tabled, reminding everyone of the division that exists in respect of rules for feedingstuffs produced on farms and commercially produced feedingstuffs. The good quality of the former is regulated by legislation on hygiene and the directive on undesirable substances in animal nutrition is most essential with regard to the latter. This division should also be maintained in the future. If hygiene legislation is inadequate in this area it will have to be amended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, today the House has discussed three very important proposals with implications for food safety: proposals on undesirable substances, inspections in the field of animal nutrition and finally the marketing of compound feedingstuffs. Individually and collectively, these three proposals will address major shortcomings brought to light by the dioxin crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the first proposal on undesirable substances, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms Paulsen, and the draftsman, Ms Auroi, and the committees for their very comprehensive report. The proposal amends the current legislation on undesirable substances. It forms part of the work programme of the Commission, which was welcomed by Parliament and the Council. The main principles of the proposal are: the introduction of the principle of non-dilution, the deletion of possible derogations for local reasons, the introduction of the possibility of establishing action thresholds besides maximum limits to act as an early warning tool and the extension of the scope of the directive to fix maximum limits for undesirable substances in feed additives.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal will without doubt enhance the safety of feed. Prohibition of dilution will reduce the overall contamination load of animal feed. Operators at every stage in the production chain will be forced to put systems and practices in place to ensure that the feed materials and feedingstuffs they produce are safe. It will encourage a proactive approach to reducing contamination in the feed chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore very pleased that Ms Paulsen's report endorses these main principles of the Commission proposal. The Commission can accept many of the amendments proposed in the rapporteur's report. However, let me first address the amendments with which the Commission cannot agree. Amendment No 18 explicitly proposes to include water in the definition of feedingstuff. I fully agree that the same rules concerning the quality of feedingstuffs have to apply to the quality of water consumed by animals. Although the definition does not preclude water being considered as feedingstuff, it is clear from the Community legislation that water has not until now been considered as feedingstuff, as is clear from the fact that Council Directive 96/25 of 29 April 1996 on the circulation of feed materials, containing a non-exhaustive list of the main feed materials, does not include water in the list. The Commission cannot, therefore, accept this amendment, but will consider it in the context of a future amendment to that directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission cannot agree to Amendment No 27, in which Parliament proposes to delete the possibility of defining acceptability criteria for feed materials which have undergone certain decontamination procedures. In my opinion this amendment misses its purpose. In any case the Commission cannot accept an amendment which would prohibit decontamination. However strict quality criteria need to be laid down at Community level for these decontamination procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 33 deletes the possibility of exporting non-complying consignments to the country of origin. The Commission cannot accept this amendment. The possibility of re-exporting non-complying consignments to the country of origin should remain open. However, in order to meet Parliament's concern the Commission accepts that it is appropriate to insert an additional provision that re-export is possible after informing the competent authority of the country of origin and receiving assurances that the contaminated lot will be safely disposed of</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission cannot accept Amendment Nos 35, 36 and 37, proposing to amend the maximum limits for cadmium, mercury, lead dioxin and PCBs in certain feedingstuffs, since amendments to the annexes have to be based on a scientific risk assessment and have to be made by the Commission following the committee procedure. In relation to PCBs, work is currently being undertaken by the relevant scientific committee.</p>
<p class="contents">It is expected that this committee will report in October, by which time we will be in a position to consider what appropriate action can be taken under comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will review the current provisions concerning cadmium and mercury as a priority and will ask the Scientific Committee for Animal Nutrition to provide a scientific risk assessment for these heavy metals. This has already been done for dioxins and PCBs and it can be expected that this scientific risk assessment will become available, as I said, in October.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these scientific risk assessments the Commission will propose to the Member States appropriate measures to limit the presence of these substances in feedingstuffs. The European Parliament will, of course, be fully informed.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, it is appropriate that the provisions of the annexes are periodically reviewed in the light of the developments of scientific and technological knowledge. Amendment No 38 is unacceptable as it falls outside the scope of this directive. Amendments Nos 39 and 40, proposing to delete the possibility of establishing an action threshold are similarly unacceptable. These action thresholds will act as early warning tools, alerting competent authorities and operators so that they actively prevent further contamination of the feed chain by identifying sources of contamination and measures to avoid repetition in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 41, 42, 43 and 44, proposing to reintroduce the possibility of dilution under certain conditions of contaminated feed materials are also unacceptable. I understand, from the contribution from Mrs Klaß that these amendments are being withdrawn. I am glad of that because they go against the main principle of the Commission's proposal, namely total prohibition of dilution of contaminated feed materials. In order to protect public health it is important that the overall contamination of food and the feed chain is reduced to a level as low as reasonably achievable. Dilution does not reduce the overall load of contamination in the food and feed chain.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I noted also the objections in Council to the total prohibition of dilution, but I am convinced that an acceptable solution can be found in order to prevent feedingstuffs becoming the waste bucket for contaminants.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second stage we will be able to address the issues raised by Mr Whitehead in relation to these particular matters.</p>
<p class="contents">Having extensively explained why the Commission cannot accept the Amendments Nos 18, 27, 33, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 and 44, I am glad to say that the Commission can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 34 and 45, as these amendments constitute an important clarification of the Commission's proposal with the understanding that with some of these amendments, in particular Amendments Nos 3, 4, 30, 34 and 45, further editorial changes may improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding Amendment Nos 20, the Commission can accept the insertion of a definition for consignment but the proposed definition itself needs further consideration as does the need to include other definitions.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I wish once again to thank Mrs Paulsen for the excellent report which can be supported by the Commission to a very large extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I want to turn to the second major proposal for discussion today with important implications for food safety. Once again I would like to thank Mrs Paulsen and Mrs Auroi for the broad support given in their reports to the Commission proposal concerning controls in animal nutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is the follow-up to one of my first commitments to improve food safety and provides for a system to exchange information in the field of animal nutrition, with particular reference to a rapid alert system and a legal basis to enable the adoption of safeguards measures for products produced within the Community and also the obligation for the Member States to have in place contingency plans to deal with feed emergencies.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the amendments tabled for adoption in this plenary session, I appreciate Parliament's support of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Commission, I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 18, 23, 25 and 26 because they provide clarification and increase transparency. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2, 14, 17 – the first sentence in particular – and 19 concerning the deletion of the adjective "serious" when clarifying a risk for consistency with our general policy laid down in the General Products Safety Directive. In other terms, not all risks need immediate action at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 5 and 22 on the rapid alert system as they are currently worded. The Commission agrees to the addition in Amendment No 5 of the reference to changes in the current rapid alert system and I quote "after certain changes". This should be sufficient, considering our commitment to establish a rapid alert system covering all the food and feed chain in the new proposal on the food authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In principle, I am not against Amendments Nos 15, 16, 20 – last paragraph – concerning the change from "decontamination" to "rendering the product harmless" however we will introduce some editorial changes in relation to that.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment Nos 17, I accept the principle that the use of dangerous products shall be prohibited and that they should be recalled. The amendment needs editorial changes to make clear that these actions are within the responsibilities of the Member States. We cannot accept Amendment No 21, second indent, (a), because there is a linguistic misunderstanding: "cross-contamination" is the appropriate wording to be used. I accept Amendment No 24, subject to editorial changes, in order to make clear that the possibility for the Commission to carry out inspection "without prior notice" only refers to operators and not to the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we cannot accept Amendment No 27 introducing in the recitals, reference to civil and criminal liability in the event of loss or damage. It is not necessary. The basic Directive 95/53 already stipulates in Article 19 that penalties for non-compliance shall be commensurate and have a deterrent effect and when a responsibility is proven in the court civil and/or criminal liability apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall therefore, the Commission can fully accept 15 of the 27 amendments. I am grateful to the rapporteurs and to the honourable Members of the committees involved for their substantial support. I hope that our cooperation will continue with the same positive results when this proposal is discussed at the second stage. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
