A great deal needs to be said about the implementation of Directive 95/29/EC and animal transport. The lack of adequate supervision, carriers who are slapdash at times and abuse during the export of animals for slaughter outside the EU give rise to much commotion. In addition, the unlimited transport of animals for slaughter by the EU has made a compelling contribution to the spread of animal diseases, including foot-and-mouth and swine fever. It is striking that the effects of this are more or less entirely shouldered by the animal farmers. Abuse during transport and the spreading of animal diseases directly impact on the image, and often the income, of animal farmers, while they are not to blame for these causes. Consequently, anyone who wants to adopt a pro-active stance in the fight against animal diseases such as foot-and-mouth and swine fever, anyone who is concerned about the difficult position European animal farmers are already in, or anyone who cares about animal welfare, will not put up with a culture of tolerance and chaotic rules for animal transport. The fact that Parliament has decided to present an initiative proposal to tighten these directives now sends a strong political signal to the Council and the Commission. After all, next month, the Council will be holding a conference on the European vaccination policy, and in this report, an initial proposal is made for effective prevention of infectious diseases. Additionally, the Commission will soon table proposals to tighten the rules for animal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">This report also reflects Parliament’s great displeasure at the implementation of existing legislation by the Member States and the Commission’s lack of opportunity to notify Member States. This report mainly aims to identify the key conditions which sound legislation on animal transport must meet. First of all, there is supervision. The supervision of animal transport in the European Union must be tailored to European needs by taking the following measures. First of all, 15 EU inspectors should be appointed with the task of submitting annual reports to the Council, the Commission, but also the European Parliament, as well as the parliaments of the Member States. Secondly, adequate regulations must be put in place for sanctions, both financial and in terms of licences. The third point concerns the introduction of an adequate European licensing scheme for carriers of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make the following observations with regard to transport times. We propose to limit the duration of the transport of animals for slaughter and productive livestock to four hours, or 250 km, with a possible extension to eight hours, provided that the carrier is licensed and the animals can lie down and have a supply of fresh water. As for animals intended for breeding and sporting purposes, we suggest a transport duration of two 24-hour legs by specialist carriers, provided that the animals have a supply of fresh water and feed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to possible exceptions, I should like to draw your attention to two problems. The Commission may grant exemption for areas with few or no slaughterhouses by increasing the said distances and durations by up to 50%. For small islands, but also for Ireland, and I wish to make a point of highlighting Ireland, transport by ship is subject to a separate arrangement. Furthermore, the said regions are disproportionately hit by tightened European legislation on food safety, and I would therefore suggest earmarking structural funds for those regions to invest in small, semi-mobile slaughterhouses.</p>
<p class="contents">The export refunds for the export of live animals for slaughter should be stopped as soon as possible, but that is only possible if an international discussion is held about the transport of animals for slaughter and by adding this item to the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendments, I should like to comment as follows. Together with the Liberal Group and the Socialist Group, I have tabled three amendments to enhance the report’s practical implementability. These concern Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 6, which deal, among other things, with temperature, but also a number of other practical points. I should like to express thanks to Mr Heinz Kindermann and Mr Neil Busk for their very constructive cooperation. As far as I am concerned, the report could also have been referred to as the Maat-Busk-Kindermann report. I assume that the Liberal Group will withdraw Amendment No 3 as it is identical to the joint amendment tabled by the PPE-DE, the PSE and the ELDR.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of tolerance and the feel-good factor surrounding the transport of animals must be brought to a halt. In the EU, literally millions of animals have been killed and destroyed in the last four years as a result of an explosive spreading of animal diseases including foot-and-mouth and swine fever. Abuse during animal transport and the shocking images of this are an indictment of European culture of which caring about animals and the countryside form an essential part. The sad truth is that in every single case, it is the animal farmer who ends up footing the bill at a time when meat prices are unacceptably low and consumer prices remain at an all-time high. Commission and Council, it is time for action, time to choose in favour of the quality of our animals and our countryside. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It does not go as far as the Environment Committee would have wished, particularly in relation to the duration of travel – the Environment Committee would have preferred four hours – however, if eight hours is complied with, it will be a really welcome advance in animal welfare. This is the first realistic report on animal welfare, Mr Maat has done an excellent job and I congratulate him. My group supports this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the report does not go far enough in relation to the eight hours, paragraph 1 is extremely important. The maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for further fattening should be welcomed because animals were being transported long distances over long periods in completely unacceptable conditions. Another important paragraph is paragraph 20, which calls for an end to the payment of export refunds on the export of live animals to third countries for slaughter. This is long overdue. The vast majority of European taxpayers are against the idea of their taxes being used to fund something that they fundamentally disagree with.</p>
<p class="contents">The onus is on the Commission to ensure that Member States comply with the rules. The Commission must take very strong action against any Member States which do not comply. They must be taken to court and fined.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the reduced need for long transport, it is extremely important to promote local abattoirs and also the trade in meat. It makes much more economic sense to have a trade in meat than a trade in live animals, because jobs are then created within the EU. The same applies to Ireland: it could make a lot more exporting meat than live animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think he has approached this subject in a very realistic way, many years of discussions on animal transport mean that, in my view, an emotional approach is no more use to us. Nobody, when talking about animal transport, means the kitten in the hand luggage on an aircraft, and nobody mentions the little dog on a lead on the Intercity train and certainly not the racehorse in its specialised horsebox on the motorway. No, in the Maat report we are discussing the well-being of animals on their way to be slaughtered.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I have been in this House for a very long time, and so it is to the Commissioner that I am speaking when I say this: On paper, or so it seems to me, we have produced variations on this theme for years, and we have been constantly demanding more. All the same, we are still repeatedly shocked by the often intolerable situations revealed in individual cases by the checks, which are far too few and far between. Better transport conditions are wanted not only, indeed, by campaigners against cruelty to animals, but also by producers and consumers. In reports and amendments, we demand expert staff, purpose-built vehicles with adequate space for the animals to lie down in, ventilation, supplies of food and water and, for animals for slaughter, journey times limited to a maximum of eight hours.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to end the payment of export refunds for live animals is one which I find quite crucial and also particularly deserving of support. There are objections to this, amounting in the final analysis to this being an interference with the market. Even Jewish ritual slaughter is brought into the argument. I could smile a little at that, for even that is now possible in the EU. It would be better to transport the meat afterwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I find that a person's weak spot is very often his or her wallet or purse. More inspection, more controls, high penalties and loss of the licence where offences are found to have been committed, these would bring about more effective improvements for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kindermann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report of the Committee on the Transport of Animals, which is under discussion this evening, has borne out what is repeatedly seen on television: the brutal way that animals are treated, the disregard of limits on journey times, the overloading of vehicles and many other breaches of current regulations on the transport of animals, none of which has been an infrequent occurrence. This situation is no longer tolerable, and the European public is right to demand speedy measures to remedy it.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, though, say quite clearly that European regulations on the transport of animals, when correctly enforced, already guarantee a high degree of protection to animals. As the Committee highlights in its report, the fundamental problem is that the regulations currently in force are applied only very inadequately in most of the Member States. Quite apart from the difficulty of transposing the directive into national law, this is attributable above all to Member States' defective control procedures and the far too weak sanctions imposed when breaches are discovered. Criticism arising out of these problems should therefore be directed mainly at the Member States. In my opinion, the Community control policy needs a thorough re-think here, as comparable problems exist in other areas of veterinary control.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, though, to enlarge on two further points. The abolition of export refunds for animals for slaughter, contained in this resolution, was decided on by Parliament in the course of the 2002 Budget procedure and has long been demanded by Social Democrats. In the past, Parliament has already given financially preferential treatment to meat as opposed to livestock for slaughter in paying export refunds, in order to remove the economic incentive from the export of live animals. At present, then, only about one-half in export refund is paid for livestock in comparison with meat. Even that, though, is not yet enough, and export refunds for animals for slaughter should be reduced to zero.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point I would like to make is that the proposal for a resolution calls for a maximum transport time of 8 hours for animals intended for slaughter, and that, too, is an old demand from the Social Democrats. There is to be no general maximum journey time, and prime consideration was given to the situation of remote regions and islands. Here, too, there will be limited exceptions to the rules on maximum journey time, which we greatly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like, on behalf of the Social Democrat Group, to thank Mr Maat for the constructive work we have done together, and I believe it will continue in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Partly in conjunction with Mr Kindermann, we have prepared quite a few amendments, and this has, in my view, turned out to be an excellent report. I should also like to thank the Commission which, without hiding anything, has clearly described how the Member States have implemented or, more to the point, failed at all to implement, the many decisions taken in 1991 and 1995. It is really frightening to see how European ministers sit and take joint decisions about something as important as animal welfare and the transport of animals under satisfactory conditions. They then travel home and totally forget what they have been involved in deciding, that is to say they do not transpose any of these decisions into national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We could have well done without the huge number of hideous television pictures we have seen of animals suffering in a wide range of appalling situations. Lorries have been opened, to reveal dead animals inside, with other animals trampling upon them. That situation is simply unacceptable, and it must be brought to an end now. It is therefore time to put a stop to our traditional practices of many years in the EU whereby animals are transported from north to south and from east to west. There is no good reason for doing this. Animals suffer as a result, and the call must now go out for animals to be slaughtered at the nearest abattoir. Obviously, we are also obliged to transport animals for breeding purposes from areas which excel in producing such animals to areas which have a need for new animals of this kind. I therefore look forward to the Commission’s now tabling proposals for common regulations governing the transport of animals, and I repeat: these must not be minimum regulations, but common regulations governing the transport of animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would first of all like to highlight my concern that the current debate has consistently failed to acknowledge the failure of many Member States to implement existing Community legislation in this area. The latest Commission report, together with numerous mission reports, has highlighted that there is a serious disregard of animal welfare in some countries. The Commission must show a much greater willingness to initiate infringement proceedings against Member States which fail to enforce this directive properly.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to journey times, I hope the Commission will follow the recommendations of their scientific advisory committees and propose workable limits that allow businesses to function effectively, whilst maintaining a high standard of animal welfare. I will be supporting the 8-hour or 500-kilometre limit, and strongly support the view that the climate conditions of each Member State should also be taken into consideration. However, in areas where these journey times are unrealistic, a temporary dispensation to the maximum 8-hour travelling time should be granted where there are no slaughterhouses within a radius of 500 kilometres. I am thinking particularly, in the UK, of the islands of Western Scotland, and of other parts of the European Union that are affected adversely in that regard. Although putting a limit on journey times is an important step forward, the treatment of animals en route, vehicle ventilation, overcrowding, and the definition of space and temperature requirements during transport etc. are equally important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent foot-and-mouth crisis provided evidence enough that the unnecessary long-distance transport of animals was a factor in the quick spread of that disease. I look forward to the Commission's policy plan scheduled for 1 January 2003 aimed at the regionalisation of meat production chains, so as to limit the long-distance transport of live animals in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Various associations, but above all individual citizens, have watched attentively to see what steps, if any, Parliament will take to prohibit intolerable conditions in the transport of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The report's concern is with the use of legislation to prevent animals in transit from being endangered or brought to a cruel demise. Nothing, though, must be left to chance, but there must rather be firm negotiations when the report is elaborated. Among the European rural model's special features, the expectations of society are a decisive element.</p>
<p class="contents">The BSE crisis and the consequences of the destruction of animals due to the foot-and-mouth epidemic have put a definite question mark against what had so far been achieved. An estimated 250 million farm animals a year are transported across the EU. The people involved have for years vigorously disputed how necessary or pointless this is. This basic regulation itself contains numerous practical and legal provisions on the transport of animals. It is clear that national authorities do not act in the same way everywhere, which shows how weak the animal protection clause really is. There is a lack of seriousness, transparency and honesty in this area. If, for example, hares living wild in Poland are caught with nets and transported into the EU in containers that are torment to them, just so that people can shoot them for sport as a leisure pursuit, that has nothing to do with sport and even less with the protection of animals. I would be happy if the Commissioner were able to say that it does not.</p>
<p class="contents">At this particular stage of negotiations on the enlargement of Europe, this incident bodes ill for well-regulated agronomy as the basis for protecting Europe's environment and species. The report before us opts, in this sense, for cooperation rather than confrontation between agriculture and animal protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These infringements are an indication that, in addition to transport rules, additional attention must be devoted to supervising compliance with these rules. In the past year, we have had to face yet another disastrous outcome of animal transport, namely the spread of animal diseases. One now notorious incident of the transport of calves across different Member States cost the lives of 265 000 animals. One of the conclusions we are drawing from the foot-and-mouth crisis is that agriculture must focus on the regionalisation of production and that the transport of live animals must come to an end. With this in mind, I give my wholehearted support to the report by Mr Maat. However, it is beyond me why in his amendments, he wishes to scrap the maximum and minimum temperature requirements inside the means of transport on the strength of the futile argument that everything is fine as long as the truck has mechanical ventilation. Animal protection groupings will certainly find it difficult to accept this argument. My amendments have the same objective as those by Mr Maat, except that mine still include the temperature requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the call to end the payment of export refunds in respect of live animals for slaughter. The evasion of European transport and slaughter rules by having animals slaughtered outside the Union under conditions which would be banned in Europe does injustice to the European farmers. The Commission would like to encourage farmers to produce quality products. Animal welfare forms an essential part of this quality which extends from farm to fork. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, once more in this Parliament we are giving in to the temptation to tell the Commission exactly what it should be presenting us with, in great detail, in the next proposals for a directive they submit to us, to the extent that we are practically doing their job for them. The rapporteur, Mr Maat, has done a great piece of work. I trust that the Commission and the Council will take this into account. Animals must be transported in conditions that are reasonably good; legislation should dictate standards to ensure that this is the case, and the authorities should verify compliance with these standards.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I would like to share two thoughts with you: firstly, that conditions should be the same for both long- and short-distance transportation. We should not demonise the long-distance transportation of animals, because that would lead to distorted competition in the internal market. And secondly, transportation conditions should also be the same for all animals that are transported, in cases where animals are being taken to the abattoir as in cases where animals are transported to be reared close to, or far away from, their place of birth, or in order to take part in a competition. These issues are not raised in the report, and I, Commissioner, would personally like to see them included in the next Commission proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would like to applaud and thank the rapporteur, who put forward an amendment on behalf of my group to delete the references made to temperatures, for it makes no sense to talk about temperatures without also referring to the corresponding relative humidity. Additionally, from Lapland to the Canary Islands, Europe is a very large continent with a very diverse climate, population density and socio-economic conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to draw your attention to the importance of transportation in the propagation of epizootic diseases. This is never related to the length of the journey, but we should be absolutely rigid with regard to standards and compliance with them. For example, the classical swine fever we had in Spain in 1997 was caused by piglets travelling from Holland. This can and should be avoided. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Your report, Mr Maat, deserves our full support, as it does not make any compromises to the detriment of animal welfare and again emphatically brings to the light of day deficiencies which have long been well known. There are particular expectations of the report since the vote in plenary which cut the budget for the export refund regulation. The agreement with which this met naturally gives grounds for hope that the Maat report will be adopted as a whole, especially as it has made past misdemeanours in animal transport policy particularly apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of points I would like to make, but time is too short. Let me perhaps just say in conclusion that checks and supervision must be improved, and the amounts levied in fines must be harmonised and raised to a level that will act as a deterrent for transport businesses. The same should apply to sanctions imposed on Member States. We are all acquainted with the problems, the European public is right to be sharply critical of the European institutions and of the fifteen governments.

The EU has the means to reduce these problems, but lacks the political will to do so. There exist directives whose purpose is to improve the conditions of animals during the time of transportation. There is, however, no control over the implementation of these.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat's report recognises this situation; it states that the directives issued on transportation are being violated. It sees problems which arise from the different driving and resting times which apply to the drivers and to the animals being transported. It pays particular attention to the export of live animals to countries outside the EU, which, of course, always involves the longest journey. It reminds us that such transportations are a cause of the explosive spread of infectious animal diseases. The most radical demand is that the Commission is being required to end payments of export aid with regard to animals being transported for slaughter, as from the start of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must respond to these requirements (which will form the opinion of Parliament) in such a way that the ethical/moral demands of the civilised world regarding respect for life will, in the EU, also be met in the case of animals destined for slaughter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Due to our peripheral location and our island status, as Mr Maat has recognised – for which I thank him – we have no realistic alternative to exporting our live cattle by boat, and we need to find export markets for nine out of the ten animals produced on our farms.</p>
<p class="contents">While I fully support the general principle of slaughtering animals as close as possible to the point of production, the reality is that many of the export markets available to us demand live animals rather than the processed products and for the foreseeable future the proper functioning of our market will require a balance between the dead meat and the live meat trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Regulation 615/98 links all payments of export refunds to compliance with strict animal welfare standards during transport, including full clinical examination of every animal. We must police and enforce this fully. The live export incident involving Germany and the Lebanon this summer resulted from the inexperience of the German authorities, as they are infrequent exporters of live animals and had no prior veterinary agreement with the Lebanese. Hard cases make bad law. I do not agree with the German agricultural minister's view that export refunds on live cattle can now no longer be justified. If Europe does not fulfil the requirements of third countries, they will get their supplies from far further afield, with little or no controls and regulation from an animal welfare point of view since there are still no internationally agreed standards on transport.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to have the highest possible standards not just in the interest of the animals but also of the producers, who will get a far better price for healthy unstressed animals. It is true that we must continue to review our standards of protection of animals during transport and each Member State must be willing to police and enforce the law. However, with over a million tonnes of surplus beef in the EU, export refunds will be required for some time to come and I will not be supporting any proposal to remove them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a long-running issue, and I unreservedly support the report Mr Maat has presented. We all know that there are already several directives on this in the European Union, and legislation to transpose it in the Member States. We are all in favour of comprehensive animal protection and opposed to methods of transport which inflict needless suffering, particularly on animals destined for slaughter. Were all these positive laws to be transposed and followed up everywhere, this debate would not be necessary. That is, however, not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Pictures of unacceptable transport conditions provide repeated evidence of this. We should, though, not lose sight of the fact that there are a few good things to report on this area. There are some examples of the transportation of animals which already meet the requirements of animal protection. The idea of slaughter in the immediate vicinity of the place of origin is also widely being put into practice. Slaughter as close to the farm as possible is something I greatly support. Modern methods of preservation make the export of meat even to distant areas thoroughly feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">We are right to demand feeding and watering breaks during the transportation of animals. We will also have to give future consideration to how to minimise stress to the animals when being unloaded or reloaded before and after these breaks. We could certainly aim to have the vehicles transporting animals to slaughter equipped in such a way that the animals could remain on board the vehicle during short breaks and be provided for there.</p>

The Member States should hang their heads in shame for the fact that the supervision of compliance with legislation is so deficient. I therefore welcome the proposals to step up the supervisory procedures considerably and to tighten the sanctions. Furthermore, a general time and distance limit should be imposed and far stricter requirements should be prescribed for <span class="italic">all</span> trucks. Improved facilities should not be an alibi for extending driving times under the guise that it is acceptable for transport in ‘business class’ to take longer. The use of ‘business class’ is quite ludicrous considering the sixth-rate treatment animals still receive before they are killed. Live animals should only have to endure very short spells of transport. Eight hours is indeed an improvement, but four hours should, in fact, be the absolute maximum. We must move towards regionalisation of the production chain with small, clean slaughterhouses. The recent foot-and-mouth crisis has illustrated once again that the stopping and collection places entail irresponsible animal-health risks, and these must therefore be abolished. Reforms need to be carried out promptly with a view to enlargement. Across Europe, animals should no longer simply be viewed as objects which are financially lucrative instead of as part of creation. Mr Maat, many thanks for the sound report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, it is a rare occurrence but, this time, I am forced to speak on behalf of my nation. In fact, the entire Italian beef industry is extremely concerned by the proposal, and not just because of the maximum limits it imposes on travelling time. Of even more concern to us is the fact that the proposal stipulates that animals for further fattening, which is a completely natural stage of the livestock rearing process, should be subject to the more restrictive measures laid down for animals for slaughter instead of the less restrictive measures laid down for breeding animals, even though the further fattening stage is a natural continuation of the livestock rearing process lasting a few months.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully understand the report’s objective, which is to replace the transportation of live animals with that of dead meat as far as possible. However, our situation is quite out of the ordinary, involving 120 thousand farms and a flourishing processing industry with business activities ranging from slaughter to packing, which would be greatly compromised by such a measure. Here are some statistics, Mr President, Commissioner: France has a cattle stock of over 20 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 5 million head; Italy has a cattle stock of 7 million head and an annual slaughter rate of 4.5 million head. Clearly, this consolidated production cycle, which is vital for the economy of our country’s livestock sector, would be completely disrupted by the introduction of a maximum journey time or distance limit. Moreover, there are no scientific grounds for such a limit and it would serve purely exploitative purposes and have consequences which, as I said, would be extremely difficult for the sector as a whole to bear.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be seen from this that the sole motive behind any proposal to place an absolute limit on travelling time is actually other countries’ desire to strip Italy of a substantial part of its slaughter trade and to take the place of our producers in supplying beef and veal to the Italian market. This is not the kind of Europe we want! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The subject matter of this report is animal welfare and animal transport in particular. We all know that this is a very sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I made clear when I presented the original Commission proposal that the views of the Council and Parliament would help shape the proposals which I intend to present early next year. The report under discussion here today shares most of the objectives of the Commission. However, there is one key building block missing in the construction of the Commission’s final proposals and that is the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which is expected shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">This opinion will provide the Commission with the necessary scientific advice on key issues such as travelling times and loading densities. On such issues, our actions must be guided by good scientific advice on animal transport conditions. Let me nonetheless indicate some general impressions on some of the key issues raised in your report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all on travelling time, I was very glad to note that some of the more extreme suggestions, such as a four-hour limit on animal transport, have not been supported in Mr Maat’s report. The consistent advice to the Commission is that the stress and risk to animals in transport arises primarily from three factors: travelling time, loading and unloading of animals and the conditions in which they are transported – ventilation, humidity, density and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already presented proposals for improvements in these areas or will be presenting them shortly. However there is too much emphasis in some quarters on travelling time. I consider that a reduction to four hours is simplistic and takes no account of the wider interests involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot ignore the interests of the farmers and the meat and livestock industry. Such a reduction would be viewed as an attack on their livelihoods rather than a genuine contribution to animal welfare. If we wish to retain their support for improved animal welfare then we must also respect their interests. I wish to work with them rather than against them and hope that you share this view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to turn to the issue of resources. Your report calls for the number of inspectors in the Food and Veterinary Office engaged on animal welfare to be increased to fourteen, compared with the current figure of four. The reality is that such an increase could only be achieved at the expense of other priorities, including BSE, foot-and-mouth disease, meat hygiene, residue levels and food safety generally, where the Commission is already over-stretched.</p>
<p class="contents">I have consistently refused to make promises on which I cannot deliver. It would be dishonest to do so, both to this House and to the European public. You stress the lack of enforcement of the current legislation in Member States. I fully agree. Member States must make the effort and provide the resources to ensure better implementation. It is a point which I have made repeatedly to the Member States in the Agriculture Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Judging from the correspondence I receive from Members of Parliament, the best way to achieve better enforcement is through legal proceedings against the Member States. However it should be pointed out that sometimes it is more effective to work with Member States than against them, so proceedings should be the last resort. They are, after all, responsible for the on-the-ground implementation of Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me be clear: where efforts to find solutions through dialogue do not succeed, the Commission will initiate infringement proceedings against the Member States concerned. In fact, proceedings are under way against several Member States and are under consideration for several more.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in this respect, I would call on the House to assist the Commission’s efforts in encouraging Member States to take animal welfare more seriously. In particular I would call on Members to remind your political colleagues in your own Member States of the need to put more efforts and resources into ensuring that the Community provisions on animal welfare are complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Maat, ladies and gentlemen, I will be returning to you shortly with the Commission’s formal proposals. This will provide you with the opportunity to shape the hard legislation on animal welfare. I can assure you that Mr Maat’s report will be a major influence on this legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
