I naturally understand the reasons he has given for Mr Patten’s absence.</p>
<p class="contents">As you all know, the Heads of State and Government of the European Union, some time ago, in June 1999, decided to form a strategic global partnership between the European Union and Latin America. More than two years have passed since that date and the truth of the matter is that we have to admit that no great progress has been made in reaching this objective set by the Heads of State and Government.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Mr President, is precisely the reason why the European Parliament has wanted not only to discuss, but also to adopt an own-initiative report in order to add fuel to the debate on the next summit, the second of the Heads of State and Government, which will take place next spring, and present a document that could offer a strategic vision with regard to these relations, in order that the European Union will not arrive at this summit empty handed, at least with regard to the responsibility of our institution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in the first instance, to praise the spirit of cooperation that the political groups have shown me during the production of this report, which has been approved by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy by an overwhelming majority (48 votes for, 0 against and 2 abstentions). I would also like to thank the committees who were asked to give their opinion for their cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, Mr President, we are asking for something of fundamental importance: that is that, just as the European Union has a common strategy for relations with Russia, with the Balkans, with non-EU countries in the Mediterranean or with the Ukraine, it should also have a common strategy for relations with the countries of Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">This strategy, Mr President, in my opinion, should involve three aspects: in the political sphere, a revision and updating of the biregional agenda; secondly, a renewal and updating of political dialogue at ministerial level; and thirdly, the constitution of a transatlantic, Euro-Latin American assembly, through the signing of a Euro-Latin American charter for peace and the implementation of a Euro-Latin American political and security partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">In the economic, financial and commercial field, Mr President, we think that the European Union should complete the agreements that are currently under negotiation with Mercosur and Chile. These agreements need to be concluded in a balanced fashion and, naturally, as quickly as possible, depending on their own merits. We think that there can be no distinction, at least from the European Union’s point of view, between first- or second-class countries or groups of countries. For this reason, we are asking the Commission, in the medium term, to put forward some negotiation guidelines with the aim of reaching new agreements with the Andean Community and with the countries in Central America.</p>
<p class="contents">I am talking, Commissioner, about the short and medium term, given that in the short term we believe, here in the European Parliament, that the facilities granted by the Community Generalised System of Preferences have to be maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same respect, Mr President, we are asking for the implementation of a global interregional association agreement that can give institutional support and total geographical coverage in relations with the subcontinent, in order, amongst other things, not to be second rate when compared with the developments that are being made in the United States. We are also requesting the creation of an area of shared prosperity through the strengthening of regional markets between now and the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, Mr President, that it is a shame that there should only be one country in Latin America which, although we have diplomatic relations with it and apply the Community Generalised System of Preferences to it, is not linked to the European Union by means of an agreement. I am, naturally, referring to Cuba. For this reason I think that – in the spirit of the doctrine of the European Union in general and in the spirit previously adopted by this Parliament in the Newens report in particular, we should seek a formula which, within the framework of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, would allow us to progress in order to find an institutional formula in our relations with this country.</p>
<p class="contents">In the social and cultural field, Mr President, we are proposing an emphatic and ambitious development cooperation policy in the social, culture, education, emigration, internal affairs and justice fields, with a whole series of concrete initiatives, that I will not explain here right now for lack of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe, and I think that my fellow Members believe the same, that the commitments made at the Rio Summit and the whole strategy formulated around the new commitment with Latin America should take shape as quickly as possible and give a strong impetus to relations with this region, although this should not be done to the detriment of economic sectors and the civil society. The next summit of Heads of State and Government will have to result, in our opinion, in a palpable success, sending a clear message with regard to this new European commitment with Latin America. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is indeed time for the European Union to revise its strategy on relations with Latin America. There is still a great deal of room for improvement, especially in the field of economic cooperation, and for us Socialists, this also includes Cuba, a country with which we must finally commence negotiations on a framework agreement, without any preconditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Economic cooperation must include and take account of appropriate social and ecological minimum standards; after all, we do not want to worsen the social inequalities in Latin America but help to defuse them, for these countries are still marked by massive variations in social conditions. There are wealthy industrialised enclaves surrounded by regions with crippling poverty. We therefore also call, in the field of structural development, for measures to achieve sustainable economic development which promote SMEs in particular. Above all, wherever it is necessary and appropriate, the groups concerned and civil society, especially indigenous ethnic groups, must be included from the planning stage onwards. This applies especially to the Puebla Panama project. The European Union should only participate in this project on the basis of clearly defined substantive agreements. Technology and knowledge transfer, but also the opening of the European market to the partner countries' products, are further steps which must be taken quickly. This House wants an equal economic partnership with the citizens of Latin America, not just with a handful of major corporations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not mean downgrading the importance of EU enlargement and the stabilisation of the Balkans; it simply means that the Rio process must not suffer the same fate as the Barcelona process or the policies on the Mediterranean. It should not take a terrorist attack for us to give relations with these marginal areas of Europe or the Latin American region, a region which has strong historical and demographic links with Europe, the attention they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament's own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca is therefore timely, coming as it does in advance of the Rio follow-up summit in Madrid in May next year. We need to develop a strategy and give greater priority to our policies on Latin America at every level in order to combat poverty on this continent, consolidate democracy, tackle organised crime and drug trafficking, and, finally, to protect our economic interests. The conclusion of the association agreement with Mexico has had a positive impact on the European business presence in that country, which has benefited both sides. The association agreement with Chile will, we hope, be signed in Madrid in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the negotiations with Mercosur are not progressing as smoothly. I hope that in this context, the Commission and the European Parliament will do their utmost to overcome the hurdles concerning Argentina and Brazil. Free trade is not a one-way street, and more or less concealed protectionism should be a thing of the past. We must also increase awareness of the Latin American region. The establishment of a Centre for European and Latin American Studies would be a welcome step. What Latin America needs, however, are not only association agreements but general strategies to promote an investment-friendly climate, and this can only be achieved if there is political stability and an end to capital flight. Not every dollar earned should be transferred directly to Miami. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The implementation of a global partnership and common strategy with Latin America, driven by Europe, is something that has always been worthwhile, but now more than ever, since 11 September, when international relations are clearly in a state of upheaval. This strategy and partnership driven by Europe comes at a time when a partner, in a different region, is going through difficult times, of which we are all aware.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as Europeans, we should have clearly defined ideas. The partner to which I am referring will get through its bad patch over time and will once again turn its attention to Latin America. It has a right to do this, but Europe has values and interests that are not always the same as those of the United States. We only have to mention the mere existence of Mercosur or Alca or, simply, the different positions we maintain with regard to areas such as the death penalty or the Permanent Court of International Justice.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the objectives of the common strategy that have been mentioned, it is laudable, of course, to aim for the implementation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability, in addition to the signing of a peace charter, a task that in my opinion would be difficult to achieve, but not as difficult as reaching equivalent objectives, such as those sought by the Barcelona process for Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, whose execution has not so far made it possible to solve the Middle East conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I applaud the intention of sharing prosperity through the creation of a free trade area by 2010, or thereabouts. However, I would like to allude once more to the Barcelona process in order to warn that the process that we are hoping to achieve for Latin America should take account of inequalities, that is to say, the different economic weight of the partners, because this could lead to trade being free for all, in theory, but, in practice, being subjected to the most onerous of burdens, that is to say, true inequality that as we all know can be widespread throughout Latin America. This could mean that our supposed free trade will become nothing more than a slogan. So, if our intention is to create a partnership between members who are supposed to be equal, when it is obvious that they are not, it is important that we can resort to a fundamental instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I am referring to a genuine development cooperation policy, which is the only thing that can minimise, although I fear this will not happen before 2010, the enormous socioeconomic differences that exist today between the European Union and Latin America and even between Latin American partners themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to remind the ultra-liberals that not only is development aid compatible with free trade, but that it requires it, except when free trade is understood to be solely based upon cynical and even cruel inequalities. On occasions, decent trade is not possible without efficient and transparent development cooperation providing the basis for a free, but fair, game. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that to give real substance to all that was decided in Rio de Janeiro by the first Summit between Heads of State and Government of the European Union, Latin America and the Caribbean, the solemn declarations must be made concrete by transforming them into facts, strategies and opportunities that can give new life to the dialogue between the European Union and Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be surprised, then, that the Salafranca report states firmly that the only way the European Union can establish a genuine, bi-regional strategic partnership is to launch a new joint strategy with force and determination, and that the best time to do so may be precisely at the Madrid Summit in May 2002. It is right, therefore, to lay the foundations straight away and to find the simplest instruments that can be most readily understood by the citizens of both the European Union and South America. The creation of a single EU-Latin American Transatlantic Assembly will be most welcome; it must have the broadest remit, including, particularly, the fight against poverty and social exclusion, and the fight against drugs and organised crime, and it must also focus greatly on the basic sector of education, culture and free trade which, as the previous speaker pointed out, must come about without generating inequalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy, as the rapporteur suggests, could be one of a single bi-regional solidarity fund, clearly identified and thus more easily controlled. But apart from the technical financial instruments, what is fundamental is that there should be clear political will, that we should take on a greater burden, that the Union can and must commit itself to implementing a strong development cooperation policy. The historical, cultural and blood ties that link so many Europeans to Latin America mean that whenever one of us is in Latin America, Mr President, we feel at home. These ties impose a moral as well as a political obligation on us to continue to uphold with renewed vigour the specific nature of Europe’s role, which is based on the strength of those values that have been at the root of our project for integration. It is also for these reasons that, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, I confirm our full support for this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This novelty will be seen in the way the relations between Europe and Latin America are to be organised around three themes: the first is the debate on the rules of the game in the process of globalisation and, particularly, the question of democracy and the reduction of poverty; the second is the question of regional political integration; and the third is the joint management of major environmental crises.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, although we in our group support the general approach taken by the Salafranca report, it contains a few elements which we believe still reflect a view that does not give enough attention precisely to the novelty of the issues we should be responding to. In particular, my group strongly questions the emphasis placed on the commercial dimension of relations between Europe and Latin America, especially the need for them to be subject to the current rules of the World Trade Organisation, rules which are widely challenged not only in Latin America but in Europe too.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we do not agree with the <span class="italic">a priori</span> positive assessment of the Puebla-Panama plan, which is a plan for large infrastructure works which will have considerable social and environmental impact. Before the European Union joins the financial community in contributing to the success of this plan, as called for in the report, I think we should carefully assess this impact. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it is precisely Latin America, with its growing organisational process, that offers more possibilities and at the same time has international repercussions that we should view positively.</p>
<p class="contents">The influence of the European Union on Latin America within the United Nations in terms of finding peaceful solutions for conflicts, is, my view, a cause for hope, when compared with the militarisation and aggressive use of force practised by the United States at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this issue is both important and appropriate, and Parliament is showing us that we are working in real time.</p>

<p class="contents">We do not agree upon certain, very specific, issues, but we will deal with these when the time is right.

Despite, however, certain promising prospects opened up by the first EU-Latin America-Caribbean Summit held in Rio de Janeiro in 1999, along the lines of a strategic partnership on an economic, social and ecological level, the concrete results so far achieved have been far from satisfactory. The reasons for this shortcoming are varied in origin and responsibility for it lies in different places. For the part that lies with us, there seems at times to be a kind of European self-inhibition, perhaps due even to the geo-strategic primacy, and not only that, of the United States throughout the American continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know, the countries of Latin America are confronted with joining the American free trade area, which may happen from 2005 onwards (so we are nearly there!). Now that there is a clear need to establish strong partnerships on the international scene, now more than ever, since the end of the Cold War, the European Union must not shirk any of its responsibilities or the challenges placed before it. One of the most important is precisely that of being able to define coherent joint strategies and endow them with effective political content.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus the proposals presented in this own-initiative report by Mr Salafranca, whom we congratulate on his excellent work, deserve all our support. Not only because they explain and list practically all the aspects that have to be taken into consideration in a joint strategy to intensify EU-Latin American relations, but they also deserve our support because they come at just the right time, prior to the preparations for the second Heads of State and Government Summit to be held next May. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Socialist Group in the Committee on Development and Cooperation agrees with the objectives set out in the resolution proposed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for which I would like to congratulate Mr Salafranca.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, we need to increase the content of the political agenda and deepen dialogue at all political and institutional levels, within the framework of a true partnership. We think that the signing of association agreements with the Andean Community and Central America is necessary, with the aim of creating a Euro-Latin American free trade area.</p>
<p class="contents">We also consider, however, that we need to give priority to the resolution of development problems in many Latin American countries, where there are 200 million poor people. We are particularly concerned about the Andean area, Central America and the Caribbean. In the Andean area, instability, institutional violence, problems of drug trafficking and the management of migratory flows have to be dealt with from a global perspective, that integrates development cooperation, trade liberalisation, institutional transformation, human rights and the rights of indigenous peoples in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of a Euro-Latin American area of peace and stability has to be founded upon the principles of human rights, democracy and the fight against drug trafficking. In Central America, aid to social development and the fight against poverty have to take precedence over any other initiative, such as the information society. To do otherwise would be to put the cart before the horse.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to make a special reference to the Caribbean and, specifically, to Cuba, as have other Members this morning. Cuba is not part of the Cotonu Agreement nor does it have an institutionalised relationship with the European Union. We think that development potential in Cuba, where, for some time, European companies have been investing, and the situation of its people merit treatment from the European Union that goes much further than the indifference it has shown to this country until now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Salafranca report is, generally speaking, very comprehensive and quite ambitious. I am only going to make one point, relating to paragraph 60, referring to the need for the Commission and the Council to provide adequate funding; and I would like to relate it to the report presented to us yesterday by the President of the Court of Auditors on economic management in the year 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report, in paragraph 5.5.8, something very serious is pointed out: that more than 25% of commitment appropriations allocated to Latin America in the year 2000 could not be used, because of administrative shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">It was not made very clear in the Court of Auditors report whether administrative shortcomings were restricted to those countries receiving Community aid or the Community’s administration itself.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the Commission, a series of measures have been referred to which would prevent this taking place this year or next, and Mr Salafranca himself refers to another issue, which is the need for extra personnel in the Directorate-General for Latin America.</p>
<p class="contents">Some time ago the Director of this Directorate-General told me personally, and I am talking about more than ten years ago, that the Directorate did not need more money, but more staff. I still have no idea whether this particular bottleneck has yet been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the proposals put forward by the Commission is to strengthen delegations’ decentralisation functions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to insist upon something Mr Salafranca has also stressed, which is that a very large country in Latin America with which we have a privileged relationship, Ecuador, still has no delegation, despite previous agreements and commitments made by this Parliament and the Commission itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular I want to state two points. First, that the pledge made by President Pastrana personally to this Parliament on the dismantling of paramilitary groups has not been, and is not being, honoured. So say the UN special representative on human rights, the Mexican observer commission and the relations of ten fishermen killed in Santa Marta, and of the 18 people forced face down on to the ground and shot dead by paramilitaries in Buga within the last month alone. This is a continued gross abuse of human rights and, as my own UK ambassador has said, in these troubled times the guerrillas and the paramilitaries are both terrorist groups and should be combated through all means as part of the current anti-terrorist programme. We feel that particularly due to the killing of the British backpacker Jeremy Parks on 28 October.</p>
<p class="contents">The Belgian Presidency rightly included action against paramilitaries as one of its four priorities in Colombia, in August of this year. Could the Commissioner please tell us in his reply what progress is being made as a result of the pressure that is being applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we support Commissioner Patten's proposal for a peace laboratory at Magdalena Medio. It is a major contribution towards the peace process, in contrast to the American military aid in Plan Colombia, which we have roundly condemned. But this Magdalena Medio region has been subject to an incursion by those same guerrillas. They are there, threatening campesinos that they must plant coca or they will die. They are there running their own businesses, having their own taxes and they want to co-opt NGOs to ensure that our European money goes to them to undermine the peace process rather than to support it. I call on the Commissioner now to show how he will introduce control and verification mechanisms so that our European money will achieve progress in the peace process, and not be abused by the paramilitaries to undermine our very aims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
