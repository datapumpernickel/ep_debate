<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President‐in‐Office, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, this week"s part‐session is the last in our term of office and my last as President of this House. It is therefore time to give credit where it is due: to you, ladies and gentlemen, and, through you, to all the people of the European Union whom I have endeavoured to serve during the last two and a half years.</p>
<p class="contents">In the letter I sent to you in December 1996 asking for your vote, I spoke of five challenges the Union, and therefore its Parliament, would have to face: five major challenges to be met in two and a half years.</p>
<p class="contents">The first was the conclusion of the Intergovernmental Conference, which was underway at the time and from which Parliament emerged a winner, with greater powers and in a stronger position to serve the people of Europe better.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we had to begin the negotiations on enlargement. Parliament has promoted these negotiations energetically and is continuing to pay careful attention to them. We hope to ensure that all the applicant countries are included in the process, with the only differences arising from the rate at which each country adapts.</p>
<p class="contents">Our third aim was to launch the euro. We participated actively and constructively in this process, ensuring that the transition to the new currency did not take place at the expense of consumers. We also wanted to guarantee that the new directives for the European Central Bank were given the necessary preparation and independence, and that this House, which represents all Europeans, received adequate information on monetary policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the financial perspectives and Agenda 2000 had to be reviewed. We contributed to this decisively through proposals and amendments aimed at maintaining and improving our common <span class="italic">acquis</span> . In my view, the coordination of the work of the many committees involved and the cooperation with the Council and the Commission have been of the highest order.</p>
<p class="contents">Our final objective was to prepare our institution for the coming European elections. These elections are not a matter of electing the poor relative of the Community institutions but of electing a Parliament that the people see for the first time as a Parliament that has great power and the ability to exercise that power.</p>
<p class="contents">The balance between the European institutions has, in fact, changed to become what was intended in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties: the appointment of the Commission and its political activities are no longer dependent on the confidence of the Council alone, they also depend – and this is crucial – on the confidence of Parliament. This confidence is not something that can be earned once and for all. The Commission must maintain this confidence right through its term of office and it must answer to Parliament when necessary, providing – without any reservations or reluctance – all the information the House needs to enable it to carry out its supervisory role.</p>
<p class="contents">For years, there have been calls for more democratic European institutions. We must not lose our nerve or seek a return to the previous balance between the institutions: that is of no use any longer. Democracy means having to be the channel for the European public"s growing demand for information, and to welcome or condemn what is being done in each case. This, rather than anything else, is what Parliament has done.</p>
<p class="contents">In my letter of nomination, I also talked about internal reforms and the uniform Statute for Members. Many reforms have been adopted in the last few years in relation to the way in which our House works: </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we have improved our standards and financial organisation; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we have completely changed the top levels of Parliament"s administration and introduced new systems of promotion and mobility at all levels; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we have increased the number of women in senior posts, although we have not yet reached the levels I would have liked; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we have regulated the transparency of administrative decisions, at the request of the Ombudsman; </p>
<p class="contents">‐ we have brought together and clarified the existing rules so that, from now on, both Members and officials will be aware of their rights and obligations, according to clear rules that prevent arbitrary behaviour or favouritism.</p>
<p class="contents">We also managed to find a satisfactory solution to the technical and financial problems surrounding our buildings in Brussels, thereby completing the efforts of my predecessors to provide Members with more functional and compact facilities. I hope that the same can happen with the building in Strasbourg and that work on that can begin during the next term of office. This recent stability in terms of real estate policy has allowed us to provide Members with new computer programmes and resources that make it easier for them to have direct contact with the people.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Statute for Members, I want to make it very clear that this is an ambition of Parliament and is in no way a discipline imposed by the Council, as some people claim. That is why I wanted to remind you that it was included in my letter. It was Parliament that asked for the legal basis for the Statute to be included in the Treaty of Amsterdam, and this request was met. It was also Parliament that presented the Council with a very comprehensive text, even before the Treaty entered into force, covering all the aspects of our situation as transparently as possible, even those aspects where it has always been our responsibility to take decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must welcome the fact that the Council has joined in with this movement – which is in my view unstoppable – and has made great efforts to reach a consensus among its members. But some parts of the text proposed need to be corrected in terms of their form or substance so as to ensure that fundamental principles are not violated. I am thinking here of the principle of fiscal equality among all Members: temporary exceptions may be permitted but never permanent ones. I am also thinking of the respect for Members" pension rights in relation to the years they have worked both within and outside Parliament and of other points of detail that I do not need to go into now.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, it is clear that we will continue to call for a uniform statute, we have gone ahead and adopted measures to control our allowances and travelling expenses and significantly reduce them without waiting for the Statute to be introduced. Few institutions or bodies – national or otherwise – within this Union are capable of taking such decisions on their own initiative, as we have done.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic aim of all these reforms was, and is – and the people should be aware of this – to increase the efficiency and transparency of Parliament. We hope to pass on to the incoming Members a House that is ready to face up to its institutional role and the challenge presented by greater awareness on the part of our fellow citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the results over the last two and a half years have been positive. However, there have been both successes and failures along the way. It would be remiss of me to overlook our most distressing failure: our inability to ensure that our repeated warnings about the approaching tragedy in Kosovo were heeded. Now we are having to watch with horror as the black clouds of hatred we warned of rain down persecution, blood and violence. We are having to watch how the absence of adequate instruments to implement peace there has left us powerless to prevent an act of genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, however, throw ourselves into helping the victims. This is what we are doing and we will have to continue our humanitarian work for a very long time. But it is not enough. We must now begin to pave the way for peace and to collaborate with the countries in the region to build a stable system of cooperation between them and promote development so that they can join our Union as soon as possible, a Union that is based on respect for differences and on the integration of its wealth and its cultural and human diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a Union where there can be no room for exclusive attitudes or racism and xenophobia. These evils always have a tendency to sprout new shoots, and we can never let up in the fight against them because, given the slightest opportunity, they can so easily turn into violence, suffering and death. Parliament has been – and will undoubtedly continue to be – one of the most active participants in this struggle.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I began with a personal assessment and have ended up with a collective assessment of achievements that have come about as a result of your work, your determination and your sound judgement, as well as the active and loyal cooperation of all the staff of the Secretariat who provide the House with their services, the freelance workers, the parliamentary assistants and everyone else involved. I would ask you to give them a round of applause to express our recognition of their work and our gratitude.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I think that we should give special recognition to our colleagues who are now moving on to new pastures in their political or personal lives. This House owes a great deal to their dedication and intelligence. They have helped build a more democratic Europe that is closer to the people and we should thank them for that.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have had the privilege of presiding over the work of this House in the firm belief that the best way of reducing the democratic deficit in the Union is by promoting this Parliament and raising awareness of it among the people of Europe. There can be no real democracy where there is no real parliament, nor can there be a real parliament if it does not cause the executive a certain amount of anxiety and inconvenience.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, there have been many moments of tension and many difficult negotiations throughout the last two and a half years. I have tried to face these with determination and with total dedication and effort, and without flinching when it has been necessary to defend Parliament"s decisions and actions. On no occasion did I wonder whether or not other institutions would be pleased with the way I was defending Parliament; I simply looked on it as my duty. When I was young, I was taught that that was the only way to act in politics with dignity, and I have tried not to forget that.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I will finish as I began over two years ago, by thanking you for your support and also for your criticism. I consider myself to be a democrat and I therefore take such criticism as it is meant: as help rather than an insult. In my view, it is wise to listen to critics and ignore flatterers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been moved by the passion of Europe, which has allowed the utopia of fifty years ago to become, for the most part, a reality. We must continue to develop Europe with this same passion and increasing unity, prosperity, freedom and solidarity. Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Loud applause) </span></p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Martens </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I should like to thank you for this assessment which you have presented to Parliament. I believe we can safely say, as you emphasised, that in the course of this term the House has developed into a genuine Parliament. The major achievement of your presidency is undoubtedly the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is thanks to your efforts, perseverance and credible convictions, coupled with the efforts of many Members, that Parliament won the right to genuine codecision in the legislative process. Everyone in this House knows that this would never have been achieved without your efforts. The European Parliament, our Parliament, has developed into a political institution whose voice within the European Union cannot be ignored and which has exercised its political and budgetary control with great authority and great independence. I consider this to be an exceptionally important development which also constitutes a democratic counterbalance to the European Union"s other two political institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">You carried through the parliamentary reforms which were initiated by your predecessor Klaus Hänsch, encountering many difficulties in the process. In many ways this was not an easy task, especially as the Council did not always fully understand the importance and complexity of the reforms and because – I believe – it was not sufficiently aware, particularly in the most recent period, that we could not allow certain principles of a free Parliament to be violated. The reforms have not actually been completed, which must have caused you some disappointment. But much more importantly than all of this I believe that you have acted out of your genuine belief in Europe rather than any kind of pragmatic <span class="italic">Realpolitik.</span> The European enterprise to bring peace, reconciliation and solidarity to the people of Europe is more than an ideal for you: it is your life"s work. I should also like to add a personal element here. This conviction has been passed on from father to son. I shall never forget the time when, in the early 1970s, as the young chairman of my party, I attended a meeting with your father in a cinema in Madrid. Few people were present and the circumstances were not easy, but under your father"s leadership we were even then able to clearly communicate the ideals and conviction of our beliefs, of the Christian Democratic values and principles and above all our belief in a federal Europe. You also embody these same principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there have been two Presidents during this parliamentary term, neither of whom, I believe, have held government office, but who worked and grew in stature here in Parliament. These two figures represented us with credibility and force before the Council. As prime minister of my country I noticed how the Presidents of Parliament were sometimes only allowed to attend the European Council for a few minutes. Fortunately this is no longer the case. Both of you, Klaus Hänsch and José Maria Gil‐Robles, represented and defended our Parliament in a very credible manner and achieved some outstanding results. I should therefore like to thank you both personally. We remain true to the ideal. We will continue to work towards it, albeit in very different circumstances. My sincere thanks for all you have achieved.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Green </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, on behalf of the Socialist Group, I should like to join with Mr Martens in paying tribute to your work, to your profile and to your commitment as President of this Parliament over the last two and a half years. You have presided over one of the most extraordinary periods in the history of the European Union and the life of this Parliament, as you yourself said in your speech: going from the intergovernmental conference, through the introduction of the euro and indeed through the unexpected ratification process of the new Commission – that though we had not quite timetabled or expected it – has also been dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">The last six months have been the most tumultuous six months of the life of this Parliament. You, Mr President, have ensured that Parliament's role in this entire period has been clear and has been effective.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pay, in just a few words, particular tribute to your sensitivity and your human qualities, if I may. You have been accessible to Members of this Parliament. You opened your doors in a new and innovative way to backbenchers, as President of the House. That has been very much welcomed and respected by Members here.</p>
<p class="contents">You have always been accessible, certainly to me, as leader of my group, when I have needed to talk or to see you, your door, or indeed your telephone, has always been accessible to me. I thank you personally for that. It has helped on occasion, as you know, to sort out or to ease certain issues and events through the life of this Parliament. I thank you on behalf of my group for that.</p>
<p class="contents">You are leaving the presidency at the end of what I have already described as a tumultuous six months. Parliament's prestige is enhanced at the end of this period. It is a coincidence, but perhaps a fortunate one, that this very week when we are in the last week of the life of this House, we are also in the first week of the life of the Amsterdam Treaty. It is fitting that it should be like that and we will notice the change to the rules that were made to bring in the Amsterdam Treaty. Yesterday, for instance, during the vote, 39 reports were dealt with in one and a half hours which is probably something of a record.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you, Mr President, for your role and the work you have done and would just like to join Mr Martens in saying that you are indeed a thoughtful, deeply committed and heartfelt European.</p>

It has been – indeed, even as we finish it – and remains an extraordinary and eventful term. It represents a term when European democracy itself, when parliamentary democracy has reached a new level of maturity. In some ways, as we enter, in terms of direct mandates, our twenty‐first year we have now achieved this new age of maturity. I believe, with your help, particularly when we have dealt with many of the sensitive political controversies of recent months and the Conference of Presidents, we have been able to hold together, with the stresses and strains and points of emphasis that groups may wish to bring to debates, a coherent parliamentary view. That is in no small measure a result of your role in the Chair.</p>
<p class="contents">I am aware also, of the extent to which, in your many years of service in this House, you personally were committed to issues of institutional reform. Therefore it must be an issue of great personal satisfaction that, having given so much of your particular attention to institutional matters, you should preside over this last session under the new Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">I can confirm in the several months that I have had the privilege of leading my own group the courtesy which you have shown to me – which I acknowledge here today – and also confirm the extraordinary openness with which you do your business. You are a frank and decent man to deal with. I deeply appreciate the openness you have shown to me when I have needed your advice and assistance. May your future go well.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Puerta </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span><span class="italic"> – (ES)</span> Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak at the end of our term of office, which is beginning to seem like the end of the academic year, when students finish their university classes and pleasantly say goodbye to each other, remembering certain students and teachers, and there is a generally friendly atmosphere. I am glad there are days like this when the heart rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that I completely forgot about this formal sitting. As a result, what I am saying to the House on a personal level has not gone through any political filter, and at the moment I have to say that I would vote for both you and Mr Hänsch again. This does not always happen.</p>
<p class="contents">My group asked for a political assessment and, despite all the criticisms we have made, the work of the various political groups throughout this term of office has been very valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress three aspects of your work. The first is your efficiency, which meant that you had to make yourself available at all times. The second aspect is your complete independence from possible pressure from governments and parties, and this is vital. You gave priority to your role as President of Parliament. Undoubtedly, there were ups and downs, but I will not go into them here. However, it is not easy to fulfill the institutional role to which you were elected with complete independence every day, Mr President, and I thank you for this. I am a member of a medium‐sized group – it is certainly not small, since 34 Members constitute a medium to large group – and I have to say that we have never noticed any discrimination. You have treated all the groups in exactly the same way, according, of course, to our degree of support among the people.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Parliament is concerned, I think it is fair to say that the dominant feature of our term of office has been that we have left behind our short trousers. Being a man I am using the example of short trousers, though of course I do not mean to be in any way sexist. We are now an adult Parliament. We no longer need to set out Parliament"s responsibilities over and over again.</p>
<p class="contents">The public are aware that this is a Parliament of truth. They are more aware of that than they are of the Treaty of Amsterdam, since, as a Spanish journalist said, the Treaty is colourless, odourless and bland. The Treaty of Amsterdam does not attract much attention, although we are very much aware of it in Parliament because of our legislative work.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have now become a mature and adult Parliament is very important for democracy, as democracy cannot work on the basis of good intentions or personal contributions alone, as we all know. It requires institutions that go further than human beings, that ensure that the work of Members who are not returning will be continued by other Members. That is the greatest merit of the institutions of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has often been critical of and hard on the Commission. Mr Santer is here today and I would like to express my own personal gratitude to him. We must thank Mr Santer for accepting Parliament"s role. And here I am also thinking about the future, when one day the Council too – the omnipotent Council – will have to come before Parliament to face up to its political responsibilities and account for certain decisions. When that happens, Parliament will have fully come of age to the benefit of the people of Europe.</p>

And I am happy to do so. But let me say in advance that I come from Schleswig‐Holstein and am also a Green, both of which make it difficult for me – unlike Mr Puerta who is so extremely good at it – to utter the usual words of praise. It is not the custom where I come from, nor is it the custom in my party!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I think I can assure you that we all have great respect for you. We really have been most impressed by your composure, your ability to handle differences and opposed views, and I personally have learnt to value not just your sense of fairness but also your awareness of the growing tasks facing this House, for during this legislative term this House has grown at least a head taller. And perhaps we have got over the problem of the short trousers – you know an incident occurred during the Conference of Presidents, at which I appeared in short trousers. Everyone survived that with great composure too – after all, it was very hot!</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament really has gained in stature and weight now. We have achieved that under your presidency, Mr Gil‐Robles.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I have not gained weight! That is a misinterpretation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter) </span></p>
<p class="contents">We have gained in political weight. I do not think anyone here in the House can mistake that. You, Mr President, have been active in your office and really stood up for the equal rights of all Members; you took active and successful steps to ensure that we now obtain a common European statute instead of a medley of national statutes. One instead of 15, surely that is a qualitative step forward! In that regard, and I do not think it is only my group that believes this, your term of office really was successful and you have done this Parliament great services. <span class="italic">Muchas gracias, Señor Presidente</span> !</p>

I do not wish to repeat what has been said by colleagues who have already spoken but it has been a very great two‐and‐a‐half years. We will always remember Amsterdam; we will always remember the European single currency. We will also recognise and appreciate in the future the stronger and greater links that you have established with the applicant countries, helping to foster democratic and parliamentary values there. We will always remember you as a person who has shown very great leadership at all times and someone who was open, friendly and accessible to Members of Parliament. That is important. But above and beyond that it is recognised that you are a man of strong conviction with many natural human qualities; a person of great energy and determination and a person who has always been positive and even‐handed; a person who is encouraging and indeed, a person who can be very firm and authoritative when that sort of authority needs to be shown, as we have witnessed on occasion.</p>
<p class="contents">As well, we will always remember you as a person with a good sense of humour. That has helped on occasions, particularly at meetings of the Bureau when we were getting bogged down on sensitive matters and you never failed to see the wood for the trees. You always got us out at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank you very sincerely for what you did in relation to bringing a greater degree of openness and transparency to the workings of this Parliament. This was essential. There was no way out of it; we had to face reality. You certainly played your part, following on from the very fine work done by your predecessor Mr Hänsch in ensuring that we could, at this particular time, be in a position to face the electorate in a way that we could withstand the criticisms and cynicisms that were going to be directed at us.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we can continue down that path despite the one or two problems that are there. In this regard I would say a special word of thanks and appreciation to the German presidency for the great work they did on the Statute and bringing us to where we are today. But for you, Mr President, for the presidency and Parliament helping, we would not be where we are. We still have that last furlong to travel. I hope that we get there.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe you had a very successful term of office, Mr President. I thank you for it. You put tremendous effort into it. Parliament has responded to your leadership. Parliament is undoubtedly becoming more and more, as a result of your leadership, meaningful to the ordinary citizens of the Member States. That is something we must continue to achieve right up to the end.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bonde </span> <span class="bold">(I‐EDN).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, a word of thanks is most certainly also due from your ever‐devoted, critical and constructive opposition. I too would like to say <span class="italic">Gracias, Presidente</span> on behalf of the Europe of Nations Group, and to acknowledge the fact that something happens to our Presidents when they are first elected. They suddenly change from being political opponents into cooperative, humorous, agreeable and impartial colleagues, and we really do have a very good, cooperative community within the bodies that control Parliament. And you are no exception in this respect. You have continued the work of Mr Hänsch, and I would very much like to thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I suppose that I can now be counted as one of the veterans of the House, and I can recall how at one time the political group chairmen would lead the way when it came to wasting expenses and being driven around in limousines with chauffeurs paid for by Parliament, while in the meantime travel refunds were being drawn from the Members' cash office for the same trips. That was not so many years ago, but now we have the opportunity to take stock, as it were, and to thank you for having helped, together with Mr Hänsch, to clean up this kind of waste. Since 1994, the President of Parliament has been at the forefront of the clean‐up operation. We must thank Mr Hänsch, because he set this work in motion, and Mr Gil‐Robles, since he continued it. But there was also a time when this House was a ‘Mickey Mouse parliament" which acted most irresponsibly in financial matters. Thirty‐eight times we have tabled a motion proposing that travel expenses should be based on receipts submitted. Hopefully this will now happen, but we must first get through an exercise this afternoon. Now all of the group chairmen are leading the way in the battle against abuse, whereas previously they were the leading abusers. So in this area at least, a change has taken place, but unfortunately the political group chairmen are still in the minority in this House. We shall see evidence of that this afternoon. Hopefully, the chairmen will get a majority behind them in the Parliament that emerges after 10 June, so that a clean‐up can finally take place with regard to travel expenses, because we are certainly not there yet. The proposal which has been adopted in the Bureau means that for my journey from Copenhagen to Strasbourg, I get EUR 450 more in travel expenses than I received before the cost‐cutting measures were set in motion. So there is still some way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">And so, Mr President, I would very much like to thank you for having also played a part in the campaign for greater openness within the EU. Over the past five years, a consensus has been created within Parliament with a view to working towards greater openness. And Parliament has decided by a large majority that all documents must be public unless we decide by a two thirds majority to prohibit access to them. There is a consensus on this stance in Parliament, but unfortunately this is not yet the case within the Commission and the Council. Under the Amsterdam Treaty, we are now contending with Commission proposals which do not mean a greater degree of openness, but perhaps if anything less openness.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank Mr Santer and Mr Oreja, because after 20 years' work we have succeeded in getting the Commission's internal telephone directory officially issued, with a covering letter stating that within a few months everyone else will also be able to get hold of it, once the prototype has become a real telephone directory. And so, after 45 years with a secret telephone directory, it will in a few months also be possible for the general public to track down the person in the Commission who, for example, is responsible for issuing telephone directories.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you, Mr President, for your helpful collaboration.</p>

<p class="contents">In your collective overview which, in my view, was given in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, which you have always strictly abided by and respected, thereby setting us an example to follow, you should have included the fact that this Parliament is coming to the end of its term of office and that it was unable to prevent war taking place on European soil.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate that took place yesterday Parliament was unable to put a stop to the many war crimes and crimes against humanity that are taking place. Instead, the resolutions, the debate and the reports by the Council and the Commission turned the debate into a whitewash of these crimes! This is not a good precedent for the next Parliament.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
