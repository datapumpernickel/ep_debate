<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vermeer (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it all started in November 2001 when the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> sank and tens of thousands of tonnes of oil ended up in the sea off the Galician, Spanish and French coasts, with residues of it staining even the British and Belgian coasts. It was a true European tragedy and once again, a tragedy that we needed like a hole in the head. The European Parliament appointed Dirk Sterckx as rapporteur, but due to circumstances in his own country, he has asked me to replace him. I shall therefore replace him on behalf of the Liberals and say a few words.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament is deeply disappointed, because after the disaster involving the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, we had already worked with the Commission constructively in order to tighten up policy. The upshot was two <span class="italic">Erika</span> packages, but another disaster had to happen first. In September 2003, Parliament approved an initial report by Mr Sterckx, which gave a detailed account of events and made a few recommendations. Its salient points were: first of all, tightening up the regime of ports of refuge and the request to organise a compensation system and secondly, the setting up of a temporary committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea (MARE) was set up in November 2003 and its brief was firstly, to look into recent shipping disasters, particularly the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the <span class="italic">Erika</span>; secondly, to analyse the social and economic implications; thirdly, to evaluate existing European and international rules; fourthly, to examine how the recommendations from the first resolution have been acted upon and finally, to formulate additional proposals, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">After six months of hard work, we now have a balanced report. It was not always easy to take a rational view of the situation, but fortunately, everyone pulled together and has adopted a constructive stance so far. As such, approval of this report will hopefully constitute an important step in the direction of a safer sea, because that was the key motivation behind the work of these past six months. Maritime safety is in everyone's interests, because another <span class="italic">Prestige</span> or <span class="italic">Erika </span>sinking off any coast does not bear thinking about. On behalf of Mr Sterckx, I should in any case like to thank Mr Jarzembowski, chairman of the MARE Committee, the people who we interviewed, including the master of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, who received a delegation of the committee, all coordinators and all fellow MEPs. Mr Sterckx deeply regrets that local issues prevent him from being here today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the report. Firstly, the clearing of the wreck. According to the Spanish authorities, 43 000 tonnes of crude oil have been recovered. Repsol, the company that will be removing the remaining oil from the wreck, states that the wreck holds another 14 000 tonnes. As indicated in the report, there are therefore still 20 000 tonnes unaccounted for that still constitute a threat. The cleared oil is being stored somewhere but is yet to be processed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the meeting with the master has exposed the contrasting statements, on the one hand, by the Spanish authorities who claimed that right at the outset 10 000 tonnes of oil ended up in the sea, and, on the other, by the master that on the first day, only 2 000 to 3 000 tonnes were lost via one of both openings. Moreover, the master's treatment does not exactly inspire people to work in shipping. It is quite a responsibility and it is very tough when you are personally put under pressure in this manner. This also applies to a huge number of colleagues of his. In this respect, the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is not alone, unfortunately; witness what has happened to other crew members in shipping disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still awaiting a report on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> by the flag state, the Bahamas. That is unfortunate and actually very unsportsmanlike when you consider the efforts we have all made to contribute to the activities. I should like to comment on another few proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, compliance with existing law remains a priority. We must first and foremost apply what already exists. We are delighted to be able to conclude that the Member States have caught up with regard to the directive on port state control and the classification bureaus. That is why we would suggest updating the text of paragraph 7 and rejecting the second part, because evidently, that issue has been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">A sound compromise has been reached in the committee on the European coastguard service. I have noticed that the final section of the compromise creates confusion and is at odds with our request for an independent decision-making and command structure at Member State level capable of enforcing the necessary decisions. The visit by the Englishman, Robert Middleton, to our committee was very instructive. I would therefore suggest removing the contradiction in Amendment No 26 and bringing paragraph 13 into line with paragraph 10.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off by saying something about labelling and tracing of loading units containing dangerous goods. This aspect has been included in the report, but I think that a quick scan from the Commission is required to indicate the level of transmitters we would need to deploy. We would probably need passive, but possibly also active, transmitters for heavy cargo. I would like to ask Mrs Palacio to look into this matter again. There are very simple, cheap transmitters, which can be attached to any cargo. These could be introduced tomorrow; the market is ready for them. I think, though, that it is important to look into these matters at greater length. I am looking forward to your response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am convinced that this work and the report being presented today will make a valuable contribution towards continuing to improve safety at sea in Europe and doing as much as possible to prevent further environmental catastrophes.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that now that we are reaching the end of the legislature, we can be proud that, among other things, it has been the legislature of safety at sea. There have been other terrible incidents like the <span class="italic">Erika </span>or the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>in the past, but the appropriate steps were simply not taken, practically no measures were adopted to prevent, alleviate or correct them or to safeguard against them happening again. In this case that was not what happened. In this case we have adopted measures and the Member States are acting, albeit not always in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated in my speech to the MARE Committee on 22 January 2004 as a result of the entry into force of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system on 5 February, the Commission has already begun the appropriate violation proceedings for failure to inform it of transposition measures for this Directive. I must point out that to date only Germany, Denmark, Spain and Ireland have informed the Commission of the measures they have adopted to incorporate this text, which is fundamental for sea traffic, into national law.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is, however, more satisfactory with regard to port State control and classification societies, as only one Member State of the Union of Fifteen has still failed to comply by communicating the measures it has taken to transpose the Directive on port State control.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Member States must have incorporated all Community legislation on safety at sea into their respective legal systems by 1 May. We are going to be absolutely firm on this point, because safety at sea is an important matter. I am well aware of your concerns regarding compliance with international and Community regulations by Cyprus and Malta and I want to tell you that we are being especially vigilant.</p>
<p class="contents">Following my last speech to the Temporary Committee, the Commission services conducted on-site inspections in those countries and we were able to verify considerable progress in incorporating Community law, although it must be said that we cannot yet say that the required objectives have been achieved. We need to continue to strengthen the administrative capacity of these countries. We will continue to monitor this in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">In the context of the application of the legislation in force you have highlighted three points. I will spend a few moments on one of them. With regard to places of refuge, the evaluation of plans for providing refuge for ships in distress conducted by the Commission in cooperation with the European Maritime Safety Agency has now been completed. In addition, last month the Agency organised a day’s workshop on this subject with the national maritime authorities, which enabled the Member States to exchange experiences on the application of Article 20 of the Directive establishing a Community vessel traffic monitoring and information system.</p>
<p class="contents">Currently the results of the evaluation process are being analysed in detail and, as promised, the Commission will be able to provide Parliament with a report that will include the conclusions of that evaluation and also the results of a study that the Agency was charged with on compensation for damage caused by the use of a place of refuge by a ship. Based on this information, and also taking into account what is raised in the conclusions of your report, we will assess any possible amendments or improvements to the texts adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to anti-pollution measures, I would like to inform you that the amendments made to the Regulation Establishing the European Maritime Safety Agency, which extend its powers to combating sea pollution, have been finally approved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will make the necessary amendments to the budget resulting from this change. I therefore call on the European Parliament to support the Commission’s requests to provide the Agency with the necessary resources in the debates on the budget for 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">We also believe that the publication of the black list of vessels that are banned from entering Union ports is an essential deterrent against this type of vessel approaching or travelling along European coastlines. As a preventive measure we are currently looking at reinforcing this concept.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the legislation currently being debated, I first of all wish to thank you for your support for the proposal for a directive establishing effective criminal sanctions for those responsible for sea pollution incidents. The Commission joins you in calling on the Council to take a decision on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the adoption of the Regulation on the International Safety Management Code, which seeks to promote a culture of safety and prevention of pollution, the Commission would like to thank you for the support that you gave in the plenary in February, and I trust that at its meeting in June the Council will adopt common positions on both subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the future prospects for maritime legislation I will say that I gave you a few clues in January, which the Commission is currently considering. I welcome the fact that the report that we are discussing today shows that our approaches are in line with each other and I particularly note its ideas on investigations following accidents at sea, increasing traffic monitoring in Community waters, stepping up port State control and applying minimum criteria for flag states in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these ideas, such as, for example, increasing the obligations of the Member States to pass on information on traffic or the role of the Agency in responses to incidents at sea are part of the plans that you have outlined for the creation of a coastguard service. I have explained the Commission’s position on this on various occasions. You stress, with strong arguments, the human factor and the correct application of the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers. This Convention was partially incorporated into Community law in 2001, with the adoption of the Directive on the minimum level of training of seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">The entry into force of the amendment to the Regulation establishing the Agency gives it powers to evaluate training for sailors provided in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to finish my speech by highlighting the role that the Commission plays in terms of international relations. This week, during our visit to Russia for the European Union/Russia Summit, as part of the Association and Cooperation agreement, we have the firm intention of pointing out that in order for the International Maritime Organisation to adopt the amendment of the MARPOL Convention, which includes an accelerated phasing out of single-hulled vessels by April 2005, Russia has undertaken to provide for early phasing out and therefore to require that it be carried out. I would like to point out that, as has been accepted among charterers, accelerating the phasing out of single-hulled oil tankers and replacing them with double-hulled tankers is not resulting in any increase in chartering costs or in a shortage of transport capacity. This shows that the Commission did a good job and proposed schedules that were ambitious but realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is closely monitoring the work being done on the IOPC regarding the modification of the international compensation system for oil pollution. Once again we regret the Council’s delay – and I use those words quite clearly – in requiring the Member States to ratify these agreements that have been adopted, which is going to delay the availability of the compensation if an accident occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Summer is coming. I hope that we will not have to deal with any tragedies of this nature in the next few months, but imagine the scandal if anything did happen and the Member States had not ratified the recent agreements on the level of compensation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that in the meeting of the Marine Environment Protection Committee held in London last week, the IMO designated the Baltic, the Canary Islands and the Galapagos Islands as Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas. In my opinion, this is a great achievement not only for the Commission, but also for the whole of the European Union, as the adoption of a series of international regulations in this field increases the protection of the interests of coastal States against the risk of pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware of the significance of the work done in the International Maritime Organisation and I therefore wish to reiterate my thanks to the European Parliament for its support for the Community’s membership of the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to promote the application of satisfactory maritime regulations, the Commission actively supports and promotes the work of the International Labour Office in the process of consolidating all the agreements on international maritime regulations, with a view to adopting a single agreement to which I believe the Community should be a contracting party.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are working in close cooperation with the International Maritime Organisation to increase the responsibility of the flag state through inspection systems, in other words to combat flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has shown how much importance it attaches to the Commission’s work. Following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> accident more than four years ago, during your mandate I wished to help drastically improve safety at sea, and I wish to particularly thank your for the support that you have given me and say, as I said at the start of my speech, that this legislature has been the legislature of safety at sea; the legislature in which, finally, the European Union has had the ambition and the decisiveness to genuinely protect its coasts and also to work at international level with determination, will and rigour to ensure that this protection is not only applied to our coasts and our seas but to all the seas in the world.

We agree with your description of it as the legislature of safety at sea, and you have played the leading role in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Mr Vermeer, I am glad that you are here with us today, although we regret that Mr Sterckx cannot be with us to defend his report. On behalf of my group, please pass on our congratulations to him for the commendable and honest work he has been doing in order to be able to present to this House today the most objective and comprehensive report possible with the greatest possible consensus, on a sensitive and difficult matter. I would also like to congratulate Mr Jarzembowski on his excellent work as Chair.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit of objectivity and consensus that I also wished to tackle this issue on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, both in committee and in plenary. My group, therefore, did not table many amendments, but those amendments were key as we believe that they affect significant points and, although we disagree on some approaches and would like others to be better thought through, I will only highlight those that I consider to be essential.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, our two amendments aim to correct statements in the report regarding fisheries in Galicia that are inaccurate and made rashly, without any basis, and could do a great deal of damage in the future. My obligation here is, without a doubt, to help increase safety at sea, but also to defend the truth and the fishing and shellfishing interests of Galicia, and to ensure that there is not a shadow of a doubt regarding the situation and quality of world famous products, which were managed and preserved before, during and after the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>in an exemplary manner. The fishing areas were closed during the accident and were opened as soon as the excellent Galician biologists, health professionals and technical staff advised that they should be, having carried out the strict tests required by Community standards. No one foresees that this will mean any future risk or undermine their profitability, as is being demonstrated by the market and by the research being conducted by the prestigious Spanish Oceanography Institute, with experiments being carried out on their own scientific vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">Galicia’s fisheries management system is a model for many others in the world and we cannot allow a document from a Community institution – which is not specifically on fisheries but on safety at sea – to question it with no basis and to accuse us of overusing our resources or overfishing. We do not, therefore, understand how other Galician MEPs from other political groups have been able to support this absolute nonsense with their vote in committee, which I hope they will now correct in plenary. I also hope that they will support our second amendment, which clarifies the current paragraph 51, as the reduction in extractive activity due to the closure of fishing grounds for preventive reasons is not linked to the ultimate decrease in resources, as can be verified on the website of the Fisheries and Maritime Affairs Board of the Regional Government of Galicia, <span class="italic">www.pescadegalicia.com</span>, which gives all the updated fisheries statistics for the whole of 2003 by species, and shows that some species that have decreased are fished in international waters and not along the coast of Galicia, which makes it difficult for them to be affected by the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>accident.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the rigour and accuracy that we want to see throughout the Sterckx report, defending the real situation of fisheries in order to support it, which you are aware that we want to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, paragraph 39 is also incorrect. The decision of various Member States of the European Union to ban ‘substandard’, or in other words ‘garbage’ vessels from their exclusive economic zones, may be controversial but has of course been the most effective one since the <span class="italic">Prestige. </span>Until international law is revised, as we ask in our amendment, now paragraph 40 (which is something that is going to take a long time) to amend, among other things, the so-called ‘inoffensive passage’ for these ‘floating bombs’, citizens want us to provide effective measures and there are few measures more effective than those taken by the French and Spanish Governments, supported by Portugal, Italy, Germany and the Council of Ministers of the European Union. These measures do not make it difficult to assist the ‘garbage’ vessel or its crew as they are escorted by naval ships, which provides them with the best possible means of assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious that, in spite of irrational and last-ditch opposition by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to try to minimise the responsibility of the Spanish State, particularly in management of the wreck, the truth has become clear. We now know that we are, in fact, faced not simply with problems of prevention regarding safety at sea, but also with problems concerning the management of wrecks. I must say, for myself personally, how sorry I am that the document we are presenting to you does not go into these matters in sufficient depth.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have two questions to settle. Firstly, that of the fate of Captain Mangouras who, it seems to me, is clearly being made the scapegoat – there always has to be one in such a case – and whose treatment is not worthy of a great democracy. I hope that the political change in Spain will allow the relaxation of the judicial control to which he is subject and that he will at last be allowed to return home. He will have suffered the lot, detention as well as having to lodge a very substantial security. Secondly, in Amendment No 11 and Recital 15, on which we expect to be defeated, we express our wish that the wreckage should be dealt with. We cannot accept that causes of long-term pollution should remain while people gradually turn away from them, trying to avoid the responsibilities of the Spanish State in this area. I think therefore that the Group of the Party of European Socialists will be very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we of course hope that the proposals for the future made in this report will be adopted. The Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that future packages will not all be called <span class="italic">‘Erika’</span>, but that there will be a <span class="italic">‘Prestige’</span> package to emphasise the fact that we have drawn the conclusions from this wreck and from this disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several questions at issue here, in particular the question of how responsibility is assumed. There are two schools of thought regarding these problems; those who want duties on polluting and those who want insurance. We are among those who think that the insurance arrangements must be strengthened and, in particular, extended to cover the degree of danger presented by the cargoes and not only their value.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have had many other things to say, but in two minutes I cannot go any further. I simply hope, Commissioner, that, as in the past, you would draw positively all the conclusions from this report so that we strengthen further the requirements of the European Union regarding safety at sea, particularly within the IMO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have you to thank for this, but we also owe thanks to our fellow Member Mr Sterckx for his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to the future, I have a feeling that it would be a very good thing if the Commission were to order a study into where the holes in the acquis communautaire lie. I had this feeling following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> package. We noticed that there were new holes – like those in Emmental cheese – that had been exploited. I sometimes have the feeling that we think we are making progress, but new holes are springing up. I should like us to look at these holes before another disaster occurs. We have tried to do this to some extent in the report, but I think that we are in need of additional expertise in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that you mentioned enlargement and Russia, and I think that this report is a historic one from the point of view of the Baltic Sea. The Baltic has never had as much mention in a report by the European Parliament as it has in this report. My thanks to all my fellow Members for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The international dimension emerges strongly and, in your speech, Mrs de Palacio, you point out what you are intending to do. I noted with interest that single hulls are to be phased out in Russia by 1 May 2005 at the latest. I should like you to elaborate a little on what you said on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that sufficient attention has been paid to the work being done by the working group that is considering changes to the international compensation regime. We know that the working group is going to meet in May, and that Spain, France and the Commission have presented a proposal. I think that the proposal to remedy the flaws in liability insurance and in liability throughout the maritime chain merits more attention here in Parliament. I should like us to think a little more carefully about whether we want the European system we are calling for, or if we should give more thought to this working group in the IOPC context in order to see what can be done there.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I hope that we shall work together on tangible rules for success with the Particularly Sensitive Sea Areas (PSSA) that have been designated. The creation of the new PSSA in London was a success, but we need to specify what is meant by these. At the same time, when the Commission evaluates the plans for dealing with places of refuge in other respects, I should like it to decide, with respect to item 14 in the report, whether or not places of refuge should be made public. The Member States need guidance, because this matter has been the subject of much debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The work in the MARE Committee has enabled us to look in depth at the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster and its environmental consequences, and the need to make progress on safety at sea. My colleague Mr Sterckx has produced an excellent report following discussions with experts and the meeting with the captain. It is clear that the decision to move the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>away was an error, so we urgently need to create a network of ports of refuge on European coastlines, and progress has already been made on this, as the Commissioner has said. As the report says, we need to provide this network with financial compensation for problems, including environmental problems, due to providing refuge for vessels carrying dangerous cargo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to be quicker and stricter in applying its Directives on safety at sea to the Member States and it needs to create the right conditions in cooperation at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is a positive report, our group abstained in the vote in committee because it does not include some matters that are fundamental for the safety of the environment and of seafarers. An environmental principle is amongst the content that we think should be adopted as part of the report: ‘the polluter pays’. It should therefore be incorporated into Amendment No 3 by the GUE/NGL and a new paragraph be added stating: ‘Decisions need to be adopted to ensure that those responsible for disasters pay the full costs of them: owners, charterers, owners of the cargo and classification societies, and in the interests of security, to ban flags of convenience in European waters’. The amendment on dignity for seafarers, their pay and valuing their work should also be supported. Measures cannot be taken without reviewing the situation of seafarers and considering exploitation and we cannot make one hundred percent progress on safety if we do not establish the situation of seafarers and their welfare in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">The GUE/NGL Group considers these amendments to be fundamental in order for such a positive report to be one hundred percent positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason, we voted for it in committee. It is still not what we wanted, however, and we therefore hope that the amendments we have tabled will be adopted. The report should be firmer and more unequivocal in condemning the behaviour and the culpable omissions of the Spanish Government and the Galician authorities with regard to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, and also in criticising the lack of European Union institutional, technical and economic resources for avoiding and responding to accidents at sea. The report should highlight the indifference and the neglect displayed by the Commission and by many Member States in the face of calls for effective measures to improve safety at sea and to help countries affected by disasters. It should also call, as a matter of urgency, for the International Maritime Organisation to recognise the culpability of the institutional system and of those capitalist companies – which I would brand as guilty – which govern maritime traffic, as well as demanding the measures needed to protect both life and maritime and coastal resources. In any case, given the temptation for those with vested interests to forget the disaster, we need to stress that the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> is not a historical issue, but that it can teach us lessons for the future, especially for Galicia, which of all the countries in the world has suffered the greatest number of such accidents over the last thirty years. The reaction of civil society in Galicia meant that the disaster became a political issue there, and for the European Union also, giving rise to a democratic movement that was intensified by the democratic struggle for peace and against the war in Iraq. This set in train the events that led to a democratic change of government in Spain, which was of momentous importance for everyone, including the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember the date very well: it was 13 November, the day on which my third grandson was born. Nevertheless, the threat of accidents like the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster is still hanging over us. This is very much the time for the European Union to spell out its willingness to make good the impact of a disaster which affected 2 000 kilometres of our coastline, from the Minho to Brittany. There is a particular need to support and strengthen the Galicia Plan, which is an undertaking on the part of the state to remedy the consequences of the disaster, an undertaking which the European Union and the new Spanish Government must fulfil without prevaricating, and which they must treat as an urgent priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that nothing, and certainly not a disaster, will happen to temper the Commissioner’s optimism and that neither the Mediterranean nor any other landlocked sea will be the arena for a tragedy of such proportions.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearings of the temporary committee on improving safety at sea have been most instructive. It has been revealed, for example, that the human element plays a role in 80% of accidents. It is therefore essential for crews to be given good training in safety matters. This must provide for efficient and coordinated emergency plans in the event of a disaster at sea. In addition, steps should be taken to ensure that crews have good conditions in which to work, in this way helping at an early stage to provide rapid and appropriate responses to extreme situations.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, we can only deplore the decision taken by the Spanish Government to tow away the vessel and wonder at the statements made at that time by its representative.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I welcome the somewhat belated transposition, by virtually all Member States, of the directives relating to classification societies and to port state control, to which the Commissioner referred, while waiting for a more positive attitude from Finland.</p>
<p class="contents">The worrying situation of certain new Member States as regards the implementation of international and European laws on maritime safety seems to me to lend itself to the creation of a rapid and complete body of expertise, especially since we may wonder at the relative inaction of the Council regarding criminal-law penalties for pollution of the sea. Without the introduction of such penalties, the hooligans of the sea will go unpunished and will continue to pollute the sea without scruple. In the interests of the ‘polluter pays’ principle, the polluters must be severely punished and, beyond that, each party involved in the transport of goods must be made aware of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, therefore, I should point out the equally important need for maritime safety to be accompanied by a genuine policy of prevention and punishment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What was surely needed was to carry out an exhaustive and rigorous review of the many weak links remaining in the chain of maritime safety, one that would be capable of producing operational guidelines linked together according to the different areas of competence, including the intermediate European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, many good intentions are expressed. The report, as amended, thus favours preventive action and calls for the joint construction of large anti-pollution vessels and the permanent equipping of fishing fleets with fuel recovery trawls. These are good guidelines. I should point out that a tonne of fuel recovered at sea represents ten tonnes of waste fewer to be treated.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also favours the setting up of particularly sensitive sea areas under the auspices of the IMO, which is what France wants. It is opposed to flags of convenience that do not meet the vessel inspection and safety standards. This is certainly a very sound reminder at a time when the European Union is itself becoming the world’s leading host for flags of convenience.</p>
<p class="contents">Very soon, however, the report cannot stop itself drifting off towards a series of federalist fads. For example, when it aims to encourage replacing Member States with the European Union at the IMO or to develop the inspection and restraint powers of the European Maritime Safety Agency, to the point of transforming it into a veritable federal authority; or again when it advocates the establishment of an integrated European coastguard system, while being very careful not to specify who would finance it and who would be in charge of it, but which would nevertheless have numerous functions, including, in no particular order, ensuring maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment, fisheries surveillance, protection against terrorism or even the assignment of emergency moorings and ports in the event of an accident at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the icing on the cake is paragraph 39 at the heart of the report, which by the way completely contradicts paragraph 40, and which condemns the only measure of immediate application taken following the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> shipwreck, that is very strict control of high-risk vessels, which could result in their expulsion outside the 200-mile zone, decided on jointly by France and Spain in Malaga. This device has nevertheless produced very good results. Of more than sixty in-depth checks carried out so far by the French, one vessel made a gallant last stand, and sixteen were expelled. The prospect of being ordered to make very expensive detours is clearly an effective deterrent to the use of dangerous vessels. Vessels in distress are obviously not covered by this procedure, as this report nevertheless pretends to believe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, therefore, the Sterckx report leaves a strange feeling. What credibility should be given to it when, instead of advocating, as one might logically have expected, the widespread application of measures proven in practice to be the most effective against the hooligans of the seas and the greatest deterrent to them, it condemns them on the basis of the other inaccurate considerations, on the pretext that they do not come from European institutions but are the result of close cooperation between Member States directly concerned?</p>
<p class="contents">Ideology does indeed make you blind. On the pretext of increasing safety, here we have a suggestion to decrease safety by challenging the right of the Member States most directly affected by maritime risks to provide effective protection for their coasts and their coastal populations. Instead of being encouraged to continue, they are being discouraged from doing it. Instead of good practices being applied more generally, they are – I quote – ‘rejected’, a quite paradoxical result, Mr President, for a committee set up for the purpose of proposing measures to improve safety at sea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank you, Commissioner, because I believe that, in the course of this legislative period, we have succeeded in establishing a close working relationship between Parliament and the Commission in order to try and put the finishing touches to the legislation on safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">We have lived through the disasters of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, from both of which we have been able to draw conclusions regarding bad management and we must make use of them. This has been shown clearly by the discussions of our committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We must first turn our attention to all forms of pollution because, while there are maritime disasters, there are also, unfortunately, continuing instances of pollution, in particular those caused by the daily degassing. Under the ‘polluter pays’ principle, we must tackle this problem and adopt measures which are applicable from day to day. Hence the unannounced inspections of vessels, the establishment of a European coastguard service, which must be operational and have human and technical resources at its disposal equal to the tasks assigned to it, and then, of course, the need to monitor the quality of crews so that they can take the right decisions at the right time.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures adopted then have to be implemented. A short while ago, the Commissioner noted that Member States have been very slow in implementing the directives and regulations. On this matter, I think that good information on the successes and failures is important, not in order to denounce one or other Member State but rather to encourage them to outdo each other in achieving the objectives set.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as ports of refuge are concerned, it is true that there are many questions remaining and that States are not rushing to give a list of such ports. In the face of the concerns and questions of inhabitants who do not want to see shipwrecks turning up outside their windows, I wonder whether we should not proceed differently and perhaps, quite simply, fit out major ports situated along our coasts with adequate technology and equipment, so that such technology and equipment can be made available at any time that a disaster or accident occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is also important to note that European authorities, whether national or local, must continue their partnership with the people working in maritime transport. It is not sufficient to state systematically that the people working in this sector are not reliable. Some are, whereas others really are seagoing hooligans. We must – and I think the Commission has a role to play in this respect – support the moves by those who would clearly like to change the image of their industry. From this moment, they are taking responsibility in efforts to modernise their fleet and, of course, to train their seagoing personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, I believe that we in this House must remain vigilant so that the work done here really can bear fruit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The institution thus carried out its responsibility for political monitoring of what was and continues to be a European disaster that goes beyond the limits of a single Member State and took on board the consequences by promoting the sea traffic policy, which is the responsibility of Community and international bodies, although the decisions to implement it are left in the hands of the leaders of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Talking of the Member States, Parliament has had to put up with hijacking manoeuvres and a lack of cooperation on the part of those who were then in charge of the Spanish Government. It is usual practice in Parliament’s temporary committees for ministers to give their points of view. This was not the case and the majority of the groups feel that between 13 and 19 November 2001 hasty and badly thought out decisions were taken which resulted in an accident turning into the greatest environmental disaster in Europe of the last few decades.</p>
<p class="contents">After five months of hearings we are still wondering what made the Spanish authorities in charge order that the vessel be removed to the high seas. As the European Parliament stated in its resolution last year, this decision considerably increased the proportions of the disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is tabling several amendments, but following on from Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna’s speech, I would like to say that, while we think that Amendment No 2 from the PPE-DE Group is entirely superfluous and we are neither in favour or against it, we, and myself in particular, as a Galician and vice-chair of the Committee on Fisheries, think that Amendment No 1 is irrelevant and, what is more, dangerous, because no one has questioned the rigour of the scientific testing or the healthiness of the food chain. We would not have opposed an amendment to remove the word overfishing – if the honourable Member thinks it is so serious – although we still believe that the original wording of paragraph 50 is entirely inoffensive, as it only mentions the risk and the possibility of overfishing and in no way claims that it is already the case. I will say once again, however, that we are not entirely in favour, and we will therefore vote against, because we think it is quite dangerous to bring back the ghost now and question the rigour of the scientific tests and the healthiness of the food chain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Among other things, the report incorporates the necessary criticism of the Spanish authorities regarding management of the tragic disaster of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. It deplores the fact that it has been made impossible for the master of the vessel to leave Spain during his trial. It asks the essential questions concerning the amount of fuel still on board and the dangers that remain as a result. It emphasises strict monitoring of adherence to shipping routes and the coordination of measures to be taken in the event of an accident; it recommends that the Maritime Safety Agency should have more power. Finally, the report would like to see better protection for the Baltic, a better instrument for tracing dangerous vessels in order to locate them in the event of a disaster. It also formulates a number of requirements concerning international legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although all these proposed measures are positive, they do not, even so, seem to me to go far enough compared to the measures already proposed in the <span class="italic">Erika I</span> and <span class="italic">II</span> packages, even though the measures in these packages are indeed important and must be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Much was expected of this report from the Temporary Committee, and, indeed, it still is. I am sorry that the amendments calling for better cooperation and coordination of national actions have not been accepted in favour of a European coastguard service, which my group does not support. Before the vote just now, following the example of Mrs Bergaz, I am going to stress a number of proposals which we wish to have taken into account in the report and which can be found in the amendments proposed by my group and others.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety at sea will not be improved without a review of the conditions under which seafarers work, without an end to the overexploitation that is to be found on many vessels, and without offering worthwhile pay with harmonisation at European level. Stronger measures against flags of convenience are essential. It is also necessary to look seriously at how to make the main parties responsible, shipowners, charterers, owners of cargoes and classification societies pay. What is more, the question of full compensation for the victims of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> still remains unresolved.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself truly believe that the report is worthy of our support, but I am anxious to say that my group will look carefully at how its proposals are taken into account in the vote on the amendments in order to decide on its final vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that the fact that the vessel was sailing in an unsuitable condition was the responsibility of the owner, the captain, the oil company that owned the cargo, but above all, it was the responsibility of the classification society ABS, whose inspection conducted in the port of Dubai four months before it sank had not been correctly carried out according to the audit subsequently conducted by the International Association of Classification Societies. ABS also inspected the ship <span class="italic">Panam Serena </span>that exploded in Porto Torres, Sardinia on 1 January this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore already tabled an amendment urging the Commission to carry out more effective monitoring and to audit classification societies and their inspectors regarding the quality of their work. It also urges the Commission to put a stop to any collusion or conflict of interests that there may be with owners, charterers, oil companies, etc. There needs to be greater transparency in this and also in the International Maritime Organisation, which receives a large proportion of its budget from States that are known as flag of convenience States, but where the real control is in the hands of other States, some of which are European. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee worked consistently in an excellent atmosphere, and everyone attempted to resolve the problems in a sensible manner. Many thanks. My special thanks, obviously, go to the staff of the secretariat, under the leadership of Mr Darmis, without whose extremely professional administrative support the rapid but, at the same time, careful work of the committee, including the important trip to Barcelona, would not have been possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The hearing of numerous experts with various backgrounds, representatives of the Commission, the European Agency for Maritime Safety, the Irish presidency of the Council, the General Secretary of the IMO and, not least, the acting Vice-President, Mrs de Palacio, in my opinion provided the committee with a broad foundation for its recommendations and assessments. We once again investigated maritime accidents subsequent to those involving the <span class="italic">Erika </span>and the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>and mainly concentrated on the statutory measures introduced since then at European level to improve safety at sea and their implementation in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Of the 56 conclusions, I would like to emphasise four of a general nature. I will not go into the details. I believe, however, that four conclusions are so important that they should be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities have successfully stopped the leak of oil from the wreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>and submitted a timetable for the further pumping away of the oil out of it, so that additional harm to the environment and fishing should be avoided. We still have the problem that the waste extracted from the sea in the last few months and in the last few years must be carefully recycled, but that is a special problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in our opinion, the Spanish courts should urgently bring forward the judicial proceedings in respect of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> accident and change the conditions applicable to the captain, so that he can return home until they start.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the new regulations resolved on with the ‘Erika I’ and ‘Erika II’ packages of legislation are essentially the right ones for achieving a substantial improvement in safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly – and this is the key point – there is still inadequate transposition of the safety regulations into the national law of some Member States, and therefore into reality. Accordingly, Madam Vice-President, we support the Commission in its investigations into the implementation measures, in particular with regard to the question of the provision of emergency resting places and crisis response places. Commissioner, stick to it, put pressure on the Member States, and this House will support you! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore wish, from this position and in the time available to me, to express my surprise at the blunt statement by the representative of the Spanish Government of the time that, in the event of a similar accident to the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, they would again decide to remove the ship from the shore. I would also emphasise the findings in the report on the treatment of the master of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the fact that this sort of treatment was also seen later, in Pakistan, with the crew of the <span class="italic">Tasman Spirit</span>, a matter on which Parliament passed a resolution. These seamen have already been released and returned home. Pakistan is ahead on this count of a Member State of the European Union!</p>
<p class="contents">I further wish to denounce a distortion, no my mistake, a clearly deliberate misrepresentation in the translation into Greek – and only Greek – of the discussion with Captain Mangouras referred to in the report. The translator, by adding a phrase which does not exist in Mr Sterckx's text, presents the master as maintaining exactly the opposite of what he actually maintained and agreeing with the action taken by the Spanish authorities. I would remind you that the matter of the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> and the setting up and operation of the MARE committee were given broad coverage in the Greek media, which of course obtain their information from Greek texts. It would therefore appear that the translator wanted to exonerate the Spanish Government and its Greek supporters, come what may.</p>

What usually happens is that industry is incriminated, the crew is incriminated, the states tend to shirk all responsibility and it is obvious that this is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">If only things were that simple, because we would have resolved the problem. The problem with safety at sea is obviously not Mr Mangouras, the Greek master, who should have had better treatment from the Spanish authorities, as the Sterckx report rightly notes, nor is the problem purely and simply single-hull tankers. It is also the maintenance of ships, as demonstrated by the recent shipwreck of the double-hull cargo vessel, the <span class="italic">Rocknes</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>off the coast of Norway, it is that we do not have ports of refuge, in violation of Community legislation, it is that we do not conduct proper port controls, again in violation of Community legislation. It is overall, if I may say so, that the Member States do not apply what is generally speaking the good Community legislation which we have in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing, therefore, that we need to do is to apply Community legislation and then we also need to look at the measures proposed in the Sterckx report, select certain basic priorities and take additional measures, such as creating a European coastguard.</p>

<p class="contents">What matters most now is to deliver on what has been agreed. This can be done, above all, by investing considerably more in monitoring existing measures. We must invest in global cooperation, also in order to tackle international maritime safety problems that fall outside of the European Union. Another point of crucial importance is consultation with, and the tackling of, flag states that take safety measures rather lightly. I think that what we all want is for so much to happen in the next few years that we will never have to hold a debate of this nature in Parliament again and that the risk of accidents of this nature will go down considerably, partly as a result of what we in the European Union are doing. Needless to say, coordination and cooperation among Member States is of key importance. The report contains many proposals to that effect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must learn from each other and we must try to apply the same procedures. Reference was made a moment ago to the experiences of, and the meeting with, the English coordinator. From that, it transpired that the United Kingdom has adopted a very clear line of command in the case of accidents. This must also be done at European level. As such, we support the proposal on the setting up of a European coastguard service. That is a fair objective. However, it is important for us to examine first how this can be done via research, projects and experiments. We are all in favour of giving the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), the new institution, an important role during the further development of policy in this field, including controls and suchlike. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am especially grateful to him for his work because, seeing the title and the aim of this Temporary Committee on improving safety at sea and some of the numerous amendments proposed, one gets an impression of the difficulty of his work as rapporteur, as well as the impression that the political opponents of the party in government of the Autonomous Community of Galicia and also in the Spanish Government were more interested in the partisan and party debate and in trying to erode and wear down the governing party politically than in looking forward and trying to efficiently and effectively improve the various aspects of safety at sea: social, economic, fisheries, tourism, environmental and health.</p>
<p class="contents">It could seem as though we are living in different countries since, with some exceptions, some of which existed right at the start, as an inhabitant of the region most directly affected I think it can be asserted that the activity in the fisheries sector was initiated at the right time and with all possible guarantees, in accordance with the technical and health reports. It can also be asserted that, according to the opinion of a large majority of the professionals in this sector, the catches have not suffered; that neighbours and tourists who have come to Galicia in great numbers over the recent Easter week, possibly with some specific problems, which there always are, found our beaches to be clean, and that help and assistance have arrived punctually and, furthermore, that we can all be proud of our civic solidarity, in the knowledge that the peoples of Europe are resolved to overcome their former divisions and to shape a common destiny, as called for in the preamble of the future Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will refer to the purely social aspect, since maritime activity is a human activity, and every professional maritime worker also has the right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity and also requires measures intended to raise the prestige of maritime occupations in order to make them more attractive to young people in general and young Europeans in particular. Thank you for this, Mr President, and thank you, Commissioner, for all the progress we have made under your drive and direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a note, Mr President, to say that the situation of Captain Mangouras corresponds to a legal decision and legal decisions must be respected whether you agree with them or not. Mr Savary, if political change affects the independence of the judiciary it would be very serious, because the separation of powers continues to be a fundamental pillar of democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Is Parliament really asking Mr Sterckx for an own-initiative report on safety at sea in this situation? This would not be very logical. Everyone is aware that what Parliament is asking for is an investigatory committee on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, precisely in order to clarify what has happened and to avoid repetition, in order to establish that seriously damaged vessels should not be sent to the open seas to sink, but that ports of refuge should be provided. This committee should have made it very clear that this should not be repeated, that we cannot get away with pollution and that not everything can be resolved through commercial relations and political dependencies. None of this appears in Mr Sterckx’s report. The experts have been ignored, not to say scoffed at, and I am sorry that Mr Sterckx has reneged on the pact that he made with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats in order to have, at this time, the President of the House that we have.</p>
<p class="contents">I must, however, give Mr Sterckx some bad news: in his investiture report, the President of the Spanish Government has decided to create a monitoring committee on the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. We will be able to continue clarifying and providing information in spite of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to take this opportunity of congratulating Mr Sterckx on his work on maritime safety. This compliment also applies to the Commissioner. The report that is now before us is succinct and clear and has avoided duplication in respect of the September resolution. I have tabled a few amendments in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, and all of them have either been approved or included in the rapporteur's compromise amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to my concerns. First of all, the European coastguard service. A majority in this Parliament is – quite rightly – in favour of a far-reaching form of cooperation between the different coastguard services, with the establishment of a common European coastguard service as the ultimate goal, if necessary. For this coastguard service, as well as for the existing European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA), it is of major importance to have sufficient powers to be able to carry out the work in the field of maritime safety effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, far more attention should be paid to the maintenance and state of the ships. Accordingly, a poorly maintained double-hulled tanker will constitute a greater risk than a well-maintained single-hulled tanker. I have also expressed my misgivings about the registration labelling of containers and vessels containing dangerous chemicals and substances. This is further to the loss of very toxic cargo from the <span class="italic">Andinet</span> in the North Sea, in which apparently, the substance in question did not correspond to the description on the bills of lading. I am also anxious about the increase in the export of Russian oil via the Baltic Sea along the EU coastline, because very often, this involves the cheapest substandard tonnage.</p>
<p class="contents">Since my own report concerning the introduction of criminal sanctions has run aground in the Council, I am delighted to see that a few Members, including the rapporteur, are calling on the Council to reach a decision in this matter as soon as possible. Internationally, there are plenty of options in legislation to tackle the situation. The problem, though, is that the Member States do not enforce the rules to which they have committed themselves through treaties. It is precisely those Member States that reject controls by means of Community legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, the European coastguards. Secondly, seafarers’ living and working conditions, which must be as good as possible on board. Thirdly, flags of convenience, making every effort to drive them out, and strengthening our position within the International Maritime Organisation. Fourthly, implementation of the regulations relating to port reception facilities. Fifthly, work on the concept of freedom of the seas, which is an old concept about which seafarers care but which will have to be studied carefully. We no longer transport wood, wine and stones but much more dangerous materials. Sixthly, ensure greater traceability of petroleum products. You know that the techniques for doing this exist, a sort of petroleum DNA, and when degassing is carried out or ballast tanks are emptied, this is a new lead for detecting the culprits.</p>
<p class="contents">There, Commissioner, you have a number of points on which it must be possible to work during the legislative period that is about to start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, sadly, the case that in particular it took so serious an accident as that of the tanker <span class="italic">Prestige </span>finally to improve safety in maritime traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, I would like to emphasise that we will have succeeded in doing that, if we implement the measures indicated in the report and follow them up. This needs a maritime network rather than another bureaucratic skyscraper in the big city of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective protection of the coast can only be achieved through greater safety at sea at the multinational level. Any particularist approach by small states must be relegated to the past. What is effective is if, in the context of joint protection of the coast, synergies can be recognised and, through a joint organisation, people and materials be aligned with each other and the best possible use made of them across the countries and seas of the region. For me, therefore, coastal protection, environmental protection or whatever you would like to call it is also a form of regional and structural support across Europe. I take such protection to mean preventive measures for the protection of the environment and, in the context of a joint monitoring of the coast, also an effective resource for combating crime at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I am proud of this and I am sure that the catalogue of measures we have decided on will achieve its objective. This will be to the benefit of everyone in the European Union, in both the present members and the new ones, in the short, medium and long term. A revival of the maritime ecosystem and increased readiness for investments in maritime routes, the maritime motorway of the future, will be the payoff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

All the laws or directives that we pass here are, at the end of the day, worth nothing if they cannot be monitored and enforced. For this reason, we need very rapidly in the medium term a European coast guard service, not least in view of the new and emerging risk of terrorism. We cannot sit and wait until terrorists attack vessels in European waters, but rather we must counter them in good time through a coast guard service.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that the Baltic is a sensitive maritime area. As a committee, we called for obligatory pilots in the Baltic, but we are aware that this cannot be achieved without Russia. For this reason, we ask you, Commissioner, to combine with the Commission and the Council in putting political pressure on Russia to ensure that Russia also at last complies with the international regulations in the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is that we are aware that 80% of all accidents at sea are attributable to human error. Hitherto, we have devoted great attention to technology. In the future, we must concentrate more on the human factor, which means that we must direct our attention more specifically to the training of captains, officers and crew in accident management, fire protection and emergency measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Last year I produced a detailed policy proposal calling for the establishment of an EU coastguard, which I submitted to the European Convention for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster in November 2002, the issues of European maritime security and safety have been given a much higher priority on the European agenda. The enduring environmental damage caused by the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster demonstrates that Member States acting alone are under-resourced and ill-prepared to face such disasters. In addition, the traffic in EU shipping lanes is increasingly heavy and the number of collisions and disasters that have occurred in EU waters points to the need for more effective coordination in avoiding potential maritime disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, our coastal waters are being exploited by organised crime for trafficking in arms, drugs, cigarettes and human beings. Additionally, given the present geo-political climate, we must consider how we can prevent the potential threat of terrorist attacks using the seas of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Often EU leaders seek to make the EU more relevant in the daily lives of their citizens. Establishing an EU coastguard would be a tangible way of doing this because it would tackle the real concerns of those we represent. I therefore welcome the Sterckx report. I welcome the fact that it has adopted my proposal for the establishment of an EU coastguard as the best means of improving safety at sea in the long term, and in addition has called for a clear decision-making and command structure for dealing with maritime emergencies.</p>

<p class="contents">I would start by requesting, ladies and gentlemen, that we all be fair and that we try to be a bit impartial. If we must be critical, we must go back much further, as before the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, before the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, unfortunately, the European coastlines had been polluted, assaulted, by a series of dreadful accidents. I would recall the <span class="italic">Amoco Cadiz</span>, off the Breton coast, or the <span class="italic">Aegean Sea</span>, off the Galician coast, to name but two cases previous to those cited, which are as alike as two peas in a pod. At that time, dreadful disasters took place and nothing was done, ladies and gentlemen.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we can feel proud that now something has been done. This time has been different from that time, in the eighties and nineties, when nothing was done, whilst, for example, the United States, following the <span class="italic">Exxon Valdez</span> disaster, took a series of measures that now allow them to assert that their coastlines are much safer, given that there can never be zero risk.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, as a politician, the past only interests me in order to be able to avoid repeating mistakes and look towards the future. The future is where we are and this is what we are all working on together.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, we can be satisfied and say that in the future, in current reality, the European coastlines are safer than four years ago. We can be satisfied with everyone’s participation, and the Commission is aware of the joint effort we have made.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also say that the Council has taken the corresponding steps forward. It is, however, true that the decision of the Commission and Parliament has been much more systematically clear than that of the Council. I am not referring to each of the countries of the Council, as they have different sensibilities, but to the Council as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">To move on the issues relating to the true situation of Community law, we are first of all monitoring the timetable closely. When the months envisaged for transposition come to an end, any Member State that does not report the transposition of a regulation will be summonsed to legal proceedings before the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Luxembourg. I have told you, ladies and gentlemen, we have already initiated a series of proceedings in some Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, regarding the reality of internal application, even when the transposition has been carried out, we are, thanks to the European Maritime Safety Agency – we have present here today its Executive Director, Mr De Ruiter, who is doing a fantastic job – making systematic inspections <span class="italic">in situ</span>. This allows us to verify whether, as well as incorporating a certain number of rules into national law, this is also reflected in practice. We will also produce the appropriate and relevant reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, you have asked about the situation of Captain Mangouras. Look, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is not able to intervene in the legal systems of the Member States. Neither can the governments intervene in the legal decisions of the Member States. There is a separation of powers. In this respect, I suspect, as has already been indicated, that a political change in the Spanish Government will have little effect on the opinion of the judge on duty. It would be catastrophic and disastrous if the judge on duty were to obey the political impulses of the ideals of the government in power. I would find it regrettable and I am sure that the judge on duty is doing his job. In this regard, consider the precedents, such as the fact that the captain of the <span class="italic">Aegean Sea</span> – I would like to remind this House that this was a vessel whose owners were very close relatives of the owners of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, as close as brothers and brothers-in-law – who was responsible 14 years ago for a catastrophe similar to that of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> on the Spanish coastline, left without allowing them to bring him to justice, because he took advantage of his bail to, quite simply, get on a plane and never again set foot in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case, what is happening is that the judge on duty is taking precautions as there is some very specific background that is particularly unfavourable in terms of the behaviour, at least in this case, in a very similar situation, of some companies that are particularly involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As one of you, ladies and gentlemen, said a short while ago, although the majority of crews, captains and officers are reliable, reasonable and respectable people, there are exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now comment on spills. The great disasters, according to the statistics, represent less than 10% of marine pollution. Most pollution, although it is true that it is more diluted and, therefore, less visible, is continuous spillage, bilge cleaning, the cleaning carried out on the open seas by unscrupulous vessels. In this respect, I would like once more to thank this Parliament for the backing it has given to the Commission proposal to penalise those who voluntarily cause this sort of pollution of our seas. Regrettably, the Council is not in favour, which is causing problems.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal, as Mr Poignant has said, includes such subjects as traceability and sensors to monitor how the large vessels that put into our ports manage dumping and bilge cleaning. All this is also in line with the measure that we previously adopted for harbour installations to collect waste and to allow the vessels putting into European ports to carry out cleaning within these installations.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifth, I agree with Mr Ortuondo Larrea that the classification societies have a great responsibility. The classification societies should be the guarantee and, in this respect, Mr De Ruiter, the European Maritime Safety Agency and also the Commission are monitoring and analysing their behaviour because, as you know, ladies and gentlemen, we have increased the responsibility of the classification societies following the <span class="italic">Erika</span> disaster and we can even withdraw their power to recognise and certify vessels in relation to European ports. We are working on it and I agree completely on its importance, as well as the chain of responsibilities that another of you indicated previously comprising the maritime transport operator, the ship owner – not only the captain, who also is responsible – and the various elements appearing in the transport chain. This must be done, however, not only at European Union level, but also at the level of the International Maritime Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">With that, we arrive at the sixth point of my intervention. We are talking about an entirely international and globalised activity. In this respect, we can adopt a series of measures at European regional level, but there are other measures that can only be adopted, or will only have any real effect if adopted, at international level. This comprises our fight against flags of convenience, although to some degree we are already penalising them, because of the criteria by which the vessels that must undergo port controls are selected. The flying of certain flags automatically causes that vessel to be a priority control objective and, therefore, it is moored for longer and experiences more problems, etc. Therefore, to a certain extent, we are already looking at this problem, but we will only be able to go further when at international level, which is what we are pushing for, all questions of auditing and of the responsibility of the Member States issuing the flag are clearly reinforced.</p>
<p class="contents">The minimum rules regarding crews are also international. In this respect, the International Labour Organization must make progress regarding the qualifications and training of maritime personnel, not only for European crews, but also for international crews that put into our ports in vessels from third countries and to whom our European regulations cannot be applied. It is, however, clear that we require the seafarers and the crews of our vessels to have undergone training that makes them much safer. We simply have to compare the reality of the accidents in vessels with a European flag with that of third-country vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">It is necessary to continue this work and, in fact, throughout this legislature we have established and adopted measures to strengthen and improve the quality of crews and also the prestige of maritime work, making it more attractive, making it a viable life option for our young people to join a merchant ship as a seafarer, officer or captain. In this respect I think that, for example, during the Greek Presidency, a series of measures were taken and I hope that there will be a commitment on the part of the British Presidency to take up all these initiatives that we are working on to make the occupation of sailor more attractive to young people in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">You are aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the coastguard problem is important to the Commission, but we know that for now it will not be resolved. For this reason, we must back what is attainable at the moment: greater cooperation and coordination between the coastguards of the different Member States and, of course, an expansion of the role of the European Maritime Safety Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">Very recently, we adopted a regulation to amend the powers of this Agency, including the power to manage anti-pollution activities in the event of accidents, in order to be able to tackle them by means of European measures that are equal to any needs that may arise, but we have also expanded its powers in the spheres of safety and security<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">I would appreciate it, therefore, if we had financial backing in the budgetary debate, because we are discussing financing for 2005 and we need funds to be able to establish the anti-pollution measures and, specifically, the cleaning vessels we were discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish on a very clear issue, directed at Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso. Look, Mr Gorostiaga, you know as well as I that I will be able to come here. Aralar upholds the same ideals as your party, apart from the fact that it condemns terrorism. You know that your political party has been declared illegal by the judgment of a judge in Spain, not by a government decision. It is true that this judge was basing his judgment on legislation adopted democratically and legitimately by over 90% of the Spanish Congress of Members and that, from that moment, your approach is defensible, but what is indefensible, not only from the point of view of the Spanish, but also of Europeans, is not condemning a very specific example of terrorism, that of ETA. In this respect, I would like to remind you that your party has been considered a terrorist organisation by the European Union by means of a decision of June 2003.</p>

We are neither Spaniards nor French: we are championing a political course to self-determination for the Basque country. We are not championing terrorism of any kind, contrary to what the Commissioner said. We are championing a political path for the Basque people. If we are in a European Union based on democracy, and if the Basque people were to decide on a particular political future for their country, everyone should respect that decision.</p>

The report itself, although it is very much lacking in some areas, is highly critical of the Spanish authorities, and in particular of the statements made by Spanish leaders and of the failure to make the conclusions of the investigations more widely known.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also positive that the report emphasises the need for more attention to be paid to the maintenance of ships and to their condition, even in the case of double-hulled vessels, which may represent a greater potential hazard; that it advocates agreements under the auspices of the IMO on the speedy and independent investigation of shipping disasters; that it calls on the coastal Member States to establish a clear and independent decision-making and command structure for dealing with maritime emergencies; that it calls for an investigation of the scope for introducing mandatory insurance; for financial compensation for places of refuge; for a system of penalties to combat illegal discharges; for an audit of the classification societies; and for the Member States to transpose the relevant Community directives and to ratify the international conventions; for the training of seafarers; and to retain the dignity of the seafaring professions.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret, however, that the report does not mention improvements in workers' social conditions and that our proposals to abolish flags of convenience, to make all parties responsible for the payment of damages, and to support investigations of the authenticity of maritime certificates issued, were rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that these amendments, which we have tabled once again, will be accepted in the plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
