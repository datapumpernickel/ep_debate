<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maria Carlshamre (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society. It is everywhere and it affects the whole of society directly and indirectly. I am grateful for what I perceive to be a growing understanding of the scope of this problem. I want to thank my fellow MEPs in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities for the valuable help and support I received during this work. I am also pleased that Commissioner Franco Frattini has shown a strong and honest commitment. We now have a serious opportunity to recognise all women who have experienced violence but not justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The cornerstone of my report is that we need correct figures. At EU level there are no reliable studies. However, three national prevalence studies in Finland in 1999, Sweden in 2001 and Germany in 2004, indicate that previous assessments have vastly underestimated the extent of the problem. Using the United Nations’ definition of violence against women, these studies show that 40 to 50% of women in these three countries have, at some point in their lives, been subjected to violence by a man. I should like to emphasise that: between 40 and 50% of all women between the age of 16 and 67. The corresponding figure for the whole of the EU would be incredibly high, at between 80 and 100 million women.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously effective measures must be based on correct facts and figures and the need for similar studies in other Member States is urgent. The magnitude of the problem in itself indicates that all Member States are repeatedly violating the basic rules of civil liberties and the rule of law on a scale that we have yet to understand. You may think this an exaggeration. It is not.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to invoke a classic liberal. More than 300 years ago, the British philosopher, John Locke, introduced a fundamental idea: a government should be regarded as a tool for the defence of fundamental rights, the most fundamental civil right being the right to life and physical safety. This is the moral, normative basis for the state and its reason for being. Citizens agree to obey the laws, but this presupposes that the state fulfils its basic commitment to protect the lives, freedom and property of its citizens. Any state which fails in this task has broken the contract. When it comes to violence against women, the failure is measurable in all Member States of the Union. All violence is a challenge to our civilisation and to the rule of law. But men’s violence against women is a specific challenge to the contract of which all common policy is an expression.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a systematic difference in the way crimes of violence are treated, depending on the gender of the victim. Violence against men typically happens in public, perpetrated by another man, often a stranger. Violence against women typically happens in private, perpetrated by a man known to the woman, very often a man with whom the woman has or has had a relationship. The most crucial difference, politically, is that private violence against women is not prosecuted as seriously as public violence against men. The issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, there is also a history.</p>
<p class="contents">Violence in the street from a stranger, primarily affecting men, has been a criminal offence in Europe for centuries, but it is quite recent that violence occurring in the home was made a criminal offence. Well into the latter part of the 20th century, Europe had many laws which excused domestic violence by men against women. This legacy lives on in our Union. We can see it in case law, attitudes and perceptions about the less serious nature of private violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society. Men’s violence against women has also been a way of keeping men, in general, in power.</p>
<p class="contents">When the UN General Assembly in 1993 adopted the declaration on the elimination of violence against women, it was the first time a UN document had placed men’s violence against women in a gender-power perspective. It explicitly links violence to the superior position of men. What we need to do now is to act. First get the figures right and then proceed to the proper solutions. The issue of men’s violence against women is not a small issue on the fringe of society, it affects us all. I demand zero tolerance of men’s violence against women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Violence against women is certainly today the most widespread instance of the violation of human rights worldwide. It is a form of violence that knows no geographical barriers or age limits among the victims, nor does it make any distinction on the basis of class or of cultural or family origins. It is truly the most widespread crime in the world, against which the European Commission and the institutions of the European Union have an institutional and moral duty to take a firm stand.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome the report before us because it addresses the main areas that Europe’s institutions need to tackle. The Commission has launched a number of initiatives to help the Member States adopt strong preventive and reactive policies designed to eradicate violence against women. We are developing legal instruments to encourage close cooperation between Member States on policing activities; on the definitions of crimes, which often do not coincide; and, of course, on strengthening those measures designed to target and eradicate such crimes from civil society and to afford more effective protection for the victims of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the initiatives mentioned in the report come under the Daphne programme, with which we are all familiar: they include victim support and training measures, programmes to reintegrate victims of violence into society, study and research projects, the development of European policies, data gathering, and the definition of indicators, which are unfortunately still lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">The Daphne programme, which the Commission intends to continue and develop further, covers all forms of violence, including domestic violence, which is one of the most serious kinds. Unfortunately, these crimes are not represented in legal statistics because, in the vast majority of cases, the victims do not report violent episodes that take place within the family home. The measures in question also include a relentless fight against female genital mutilation, an horrendous practice that we must punish severely, and so-called ‘honour crimes’, which we should rename ‘dishonour crimes’: it is best not to term it an ‘honour’ crime when a man beats a woman for that kind of reason.</p>
<p class="contents">The report mentions the need to gather data and draw up statistics, since reliable statistics are one of the basic requirements for making more effective decisions at European level. The Commission is working on that and, in collaboration with Eurostat, has set up a European system of statistics on crime and criminal justice: violence against women is, of course, one of the areas on which we shall very soon publish statistics calculated from the measures and the data that the Member States make available to us. I believe that by June 2006 we shall for the first time be able to publish a series of European statistics on crimes and the judicial response to crimes, and they will obviously contain a chapter devoted to violence against women.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of female genital mutilation, the Commission has financed a large number of projects, all under the Daphne programme, which have produced positive results. I can also add that, in the area of European immigration and asylum measures, the directive on minimum standards for granting refugee status defines acts of sexual violence against women as sufficient grounds for granting refugee status. I can also assure the rapporteur that, although female genital mutilation is not explicitly included in the text of the directive in question, the Commission does regard it as an act of violence perpetrated for sexual purposes, and it is therefore included among the reasons that, in my view, justify the granting of refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">I have given this example, Mr President, in order to stress the need to tackle the issue of violence against women at a European level and from every possible angle: from trafficking in human beings, to migration policies, to equal opportunities – hence the need for non-discrimination. In more general terms, we need to use the courts, employment policy and social policies as practical enforcement instruments. I feel institutionally, politically and also morally bound by these objectives, which will therefore be specific priorities for our work over the coming months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Violence against women is not a marginal problem; women from all social groups can be victims of violence. Sometimes high-achieving professional women think they are untouchable. Every woman can be abused. It cannot be said that this is not a problem for us or for EU women.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the report focuses on violence by men against women, and especially domestic violence, we should not forget that this is not the only type of violence, despite, undeniably, being the most common. Unfortunately, children are also often targets of domestic violence, as are men. Even though they are not the focus of our discussion today, we should not forget that these things happen too.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this kind of domestic violence should be allowed to happen. The rapporteur mentions the figure of 100 million women in the EU who have suffered from violence from men. The Commission estimates that almost 1000 women die in Europe every year due to violence in their partnerships. In Finland alone, the police make 80 000 house calls, and 17 000 of them are due to domestic violence – and we are a country which ranks fifth in the world’s gender equality rankings.</p>
<p class="contents">These are horrific figures. We need to act. So what can we do? First we should ensure that Member States take action in combating domestic violence. More efficient legislation and its true implementation are crucial, as well as coordination between all those involved in this field. We should also take into account the studies conducted in the United States which showed a clear correlation between animal abuse and domestic violence. It has been shown that many domestic violence cases have been preceded by animal abuse. This is something from which we in Europe could perhaps learn.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to more traditional type of violence against women, we have recently witnessed a rise in honour crimes and genital mutilation. I was very happy to hear that the Commission is putting more emphasis on this human right. Every woman has a right to decide about her own body. That is very important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As well as being a criminal act and a violation of human rights, men’s violence against women is a serious socio-political problem throughout the world. We in the Socialist Group in the European Parliament believe that men’s violence against women is linked to the unequal power relations between men and women, and the problem will increase if the Member States do not use legislation in order strongly and clearly to oppose such violence.</p>
<p class="contents">Men’s violence against women naturally has considerable social and human consequences. I always maintain that, behind every woman who is beaten, there are, more often than not, a number of children who, in addition to undergoing considerable physical and psychological suffering, believe that this is the way things have to be, a view that, in the long term, may lead to their adopting the same behaviour themselves when they grow up. We have to break this vicious circle. We often also forget the children in these contexts. It is important that children who see their mothers beaten should also be regarded as victims and be entitled to have their cases heard in court.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been demonstrated that violence against women is an important factor in the lives of women and girls who fall victim to human trafficking and prostitution. I would also take this opportunity to point out that we should combat the attitude that prostitution is comparable with the exercise of a profession. This form of violence and serious violation of human beings is absolutely unacceptable. Prostitution and human trafficking and all forms of violence towards women, including genital mutilation and violence related to notions of honour, fall into the same category. The EU must set a good example and take a stand on combating these expressions of discrimination between the sexes and of the unequal distribution of power between them. It is also important to do some preventative work in the form of research, information provision and the exchange of knowledge between the Member States. More often than not, the focus is, quite naturally, on the victims, but there is also a need for active preventative strategies aimed at the perpetrators of violence and at those in danger of becoming perpetrators.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want briefly to mention one of my own amendments dealing with the relationship between alcohol and violence. Alcohol is often a factor in acts of violence, and it is important that pleas relating to intoxication as an extenuating circumstance not be accepted by the courts where men’s violence towards women is concerned. When strategies for reducing alcohol-related harm in society are reviewed, account must definitely be taken, however, of the effect that alcohol has in triggering men’s violence against women.</p>

<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Carlshamre, whom I congratulate on her work, reminds us, amongst other things, that violence against women is a scourge that knows no national, religious, social or economic boundaries; on the contrary, as has been said, it is a universal phenomenon, relating to the inequalities in our societies in terms of the distribution of power and of roles between the sexes. It is for this very reason that the response must be firm, here in Europe and in other countries where, as in Mexico or Guatemala, the situation has become so bad that there is even talk of ‘feminicides’. The time for rhetoric and condemnation, however, is far behind us. Now is the time to act, to adopt measures in support of the victims, to apply proactive and preventive strategies and to establish effective, proportionate and dissuasive penalties. But in order for those measures to be effective, we must provide them with the necessary human and financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">A few days ago we celebrated the first anniversary of the law on gender violence in Spain. That date gives us the opportunity to insist, as the Carlshamre report does, that violence against women must be seen as a clear breach of the most fundamental human rights and that, as well as reactive measures, we must establish programmes of a holistic nature to deal seriously with the issue of the distribution of roles in our society and, in particular, the perception that persists amongst many men that women are merely objects at their disposal and that they therefore have the right to hit them or mistreat them, and even sometimes to kill them.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I fear that the real problem exists within the heads of many men, and that is where action must be taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of these manifestations, domestic violence is the most common, affecting millions of women in Europe. The rapporteur, whom I wish to congratulate on her work, has presented us with some figures, although it is known no studies have been carried out at Community level. Commissioner, measures must be taken without delay to ensure that this phenomenon is made more visible. After all, it is appalling that victims of violence die every year in the EU, including more than 100 000 women and many children, another area that must be taken into account.</p>

Nonetheless, as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I should like to point out that violence is not just a feature of male behaviour. It is an indication of a personality that has failed to develop properly, and it can occur in both males and females. Psychological violence perpetrated by women is less immediately obvious but can be equally damaging, as research into cases of violence in male and female same-sex relationships confirms. It should be emphasised that social factors play a very significant part in the spread of violence. I refer to aggression in the media and to the hedonistic and liberal lifestyle which is currently being promoted and which is subject to no restrictions, rules or prohibitions. It is a lifestyle characterised by a relentless tide of pansexualism and pornography and the belief that human beings are objects that can be bought and sold. Lastly, the recently advocated war between the sexes, which harks back to the Communist class conflict, has fuelled aggression rather than reduced it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with her, and I think that it is very important for all of us to adopt zero tolerance towards all forms of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">A chain is said to be only as strong as its weakest link and our society must be weak if it cannot protect its weakest link, which is to say its children. Feminist movements have been exposing violence against women and have always fought for women’s rights. As we observe the age of victims getting lower and lower, society must have the courage to protect young girls from violence and abuse. However, guilty persons are only occasionally exposed, and usually when it is already too late.</p>
<p class="contents">Sadly, tragic stories make good articles and increase the incomes of tabloid newspapers. Unfortunately for the victim, this is a tragic fact. Young girls usually do not get a chance to live out their childhoods – as a result of violence they become women and often mothers prematurely. It is for this reason that I too raise my voice today, in order to draw attention to this issue, and to help efforts aimed at stopping the violence that we all know exists in society, although we tend to rely on others to fight against it on our behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is very important to adopt laws, recommendations and regulations, but we must also support consistent implementation and compliance in our everyday lives. Not far from the European Parliament there is a young woman in the street with one or two babies holding out a cup and begging for money. As she is a woman from a different ethnic group, we pretend this is of no concern to us, throw her a couple of cents and walk on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Violence is an abuse of superiority by one party, but it has to be said that the failure to prevent violence is also a form of violence. Our basic attitude must be characterised by zero tolerance towards all forms of violence against women. Any solution will depend especially on teaching respect for other people and on intensive cooperation between governments, parliaments and non-governmental organisations. These bodies should jointly develop procedures for fighting this phenomenon.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistics are necessary, but our success primarily depends on effective preventive measures, all the more so since every instance of violence in families affects children as well, and is passed on to future generations. Communities and ethnic minorities with different cultures, and their own specific forms of violence, must also be the focus of our attention. Every state of the European Union must enact comprehensive and effective legislation in respect of domestic violence, which will criminalise certain forms of violence. Neither customary practices nor alcohol should be considered as mitigating factors. We must clearly demonstrate that violence is simply unacceptable in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I firmly believe that domestic violence casts shame on the democratic and highly-developed society we live in, as it constitutes violence committed against human dignity.

We cannot remain on the sidelines in a situation like this; it is our obligation to implement every instrument necessary to put an end to this social scourge. Violence against women is a breach of human rights, of fundamental rights, such as freedom, equality, life and non-discrimination. We must call upon the Member States to stiffen penalties and to implement complete legislation to respond to this reality. In this regard, Spain offers a clear example to the whole of Europe, with the law that it adopted last year to combat violence against women. Although such violence will clearly not come to an end overnight, this law represents a clear commitment to fight it decisively by means of all the necessary instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot deny that there is greater awareness of this problem today, thanks to the efforts of women’s organisations in their fight against all forms of violence against women. We can now say that it is no longer an invisible crime, but rather it is one that is collectively rejected. Such important aspects as the protection of victims must be accompanied by other measures, such as specific programmes on access to work or to social housing, so that this reality can be dealt with in a complete way, taking account of aspects relating to education, legal assistance and health and without forgetting that these violent situations often also affect minors within their families.</p>
<p class="contents">There can be no excuse not to tackle violence against women in a decisive and committed manner, because a society cannot progress while the rights of such a significant section of it – women – are being breached. We are talking about a serious social problem, and every possible effort will be required on our part if we are to put an end to it. The step we are taking today is a further step towards the ultimate objective. We must do everything possible, and more, to reach that objective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to create effective strategies for eliminating this serious social problem, it is necessary to have a thorough understanding of this phenomenon and the features of it that are specific to different nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Post-communist countries, including Slovakia, have long ignored this topic. Strong traditions have always kept domestic violence hidden behind closed doors. Another contributing factor has been the fact that some types of violence concerned very delicate matters. For that reason, the victim would often not report an assault, especially out of fear of the perpetrator, fear for the children or loyalty to the family. These countries, in particular, typically had low levels of reporting sexual assaults. It is estimated that the real number of cases is five to ten times higher than the number of cases reported.</p>
<p class="contents">Very often, women find it difficult to talk about violence, either because of the shock they have been through or out of shame, and do not believe that anyone can help them. Others do not even recognise the experience as violence. For these reasons, I agree with the rapporteur, Mrs Carlshamre, who emphasised in her report that priority should be given to increasing the level of awareness about this problem in society as a whole. The report challenges the governments and parliaments of the member countries to take steps aimed at eliminating the silence surrounding violence against women. Violence cannot be a private matter. It must become a public issue, an issue for all of us.</p>
<p class="contents">The accurate gathering of data is the only way to get to the essence of this serious problem and help to focus the efforts aimed at eliminating it. It is not only non-government organisations, media, research and educational institutions that can contribute to this, but also all of us who refuse to tolerate such a serious social problem, one that has become an obstacle to the development of a democratic society.

<p class="contents">The Member States of the European Union cannot overlook such a violation of human rights just because that violence is perpetrated within the family. We need strong measures and proportional, balanced penalties which act as a deterrent, as indicated in the report. Direct punishment should be supported by measures aiming to improve the balance of power between the sexes. I would like to emphasise yet another type of violence that represents and symbolises the unequal division of power better than anything else. I am talking about the selling of women’s bodies. The purchasing of sex constitutes violence and the perpetuation of violence. The seedbed of prostitution is most closely related to unemployment among women and the low wages paid to women. Continuing violence and the social problems connected with it make it very difficult to integrate women into the labour market. I concur with my colleague Figueiredo, who said: ‘Prostitution does not mean equal participation in the labour market’.</p>
<p class="contents">In my home country, I am trying to make the purchasing of sex a criminal offence. I do not want violence against women and inequality between the sexes to continue. I do not want the deterioration of the living environment that accompanies the bordello industry to continue to threaten our cities. The European Parliament should seriously discuss making the purchasing of sex punishable throughout the European Union. That would be a step towards equality between the sexes and a great contribution towards the abolition of violence against women. Thank you for your attention! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This form of violence has been going on for a long time, and women have suffered in silence, and not just their own personal silence, but also the complicit silence of their families, neighbours and the whole of society. As has been said here today, this scourge affects all sectors of society: the rich, the poor, the educated, the less educated ... Every single one of us knows of someone who has suffered from this violence. But not only should studies be carried out on the nature of domestic violence itself, but it is also worth investigating whether, when there is violence in the home, the person indulging in it also indulges in violence in the workplace, whether they also indulge in what is known as ‘mobbing’ and try to destroy the people around them physically and psychologically, because, when it comes down to it, people who do that are ill and they know of no way to express themselves other than through this kind of violence.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also therefore consider what measures the European Union must put into practice. It is all very well to legislate, but it is also important to provide temporary aid, to provide education and to implement programmes such as Daphne, because all of these help gradually to put an end to this scourge and this persistent blot on our society.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also the case, of course, that we must produce statistics and watch how they evolve, because if we are to provide real resources, if we are truly committed and provide the money needed to implement these essential programmes, we need to be able to see how they evolve so that we can put things right in time and be as effective as possible. We are dealing with public money and that money must be properly justified and, above all, it must be used for its intended purpose, which is no more and no less than to put an end to violence against any woman, not just here in the European Union, but also in third countries, which we help, but without demanding that the laws we apply here be complied with there as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, it is a problem affecting one in three women the world over. Violence perpetrated by men against women is a crime and a violation of fundamental human rights such as the right to life, safety, dignity and physical inviolability. As a rule, it is prohibited by law, but sadly it remains tolerated by society and statistics suggest that a billion women in the world continue to be beaten, forced to engage in sexual relations against their will and abused in other ways.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not exclusively a developing world problem. Even in the Member States of the European Union on average three women die every day as a result of domestic violence. This means that victims of domestic murders were living in our midst, not in some distant location. Violence within the family is a major social problem resulting from unequal gender power distribution throughout the course of history. In our times every state should safeguard the rights of all its citizens, and consequently combat discrimination and violence against women by drafting and implementing appropriate legal provisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is clear from the methodical report drafted by the relevant directorate of the European Commission and published in December 2005 and from research by the Council of Europe that violence against women is the main cause of death of women between the ages of 16 and 44.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though, as the Commissioner said, there is no global definition of violence against women, this phenomenon crosses borders and is not prevented by social position. Any woman may fall victim to violence and any form of violence constitutes an infringement of human rights and infringement of the rights to life, safety, dignity and physical and mental integrity. It is an obstacle to the development of a democratic society. It isolates woman from social life and the labour market. It may result in marginalisation and poverty. This social problem must be wiped out in view of efforts to integrate more women into the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Psychological violence – humiliation, threats and insults – is one form of violence which destabilises a woman's personality and upsets her behaviour, to the point at which she is unable to contribute to her environment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order for there to be results, violence must be expressed and that is why confidence in the authorities, in the departments responsible, in the courts, needs to be increased. The measures to be taken must be coordinated and I congratulate you, Commissioner, for having shown that you are prepared to take these measures by finding the appropriate legal bases and keeping the programme to combat violence separate from other issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
