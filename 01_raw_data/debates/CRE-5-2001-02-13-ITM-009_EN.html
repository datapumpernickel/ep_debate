In the question I ask the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for his opinion of the political responsibility of Mrs Loyola de Palacio following the report of the Spanish prosecutor, which confirms this fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this point of order is to ask you for express support in relation to what I am going to say. As well as finding it incredible that this question has not been considered a priority for an oral reply, I would like to tell you that, although it is reserved for a written answer, I already have in my hands a written reply, because a newspaper in my country has already stated: “In his written reply to a question put by the Socialist MEP, Juan de Dios Izquierdo, Mr Prodi has indicated that, on the basis of documents available to the Commission, he can only reaffirm his full confidence in Mrs de Palacio. Furthermore, in response to another Socialist question on the possibility that the case may destabilise the entire executive, etc.”</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have not yet received the written reply, as you might expect, and yet I have it here. I do not think that it requires much imagination to know which group has been behind the scenes, applying pressure so that my question should not be given an oral reply in Parliament and so that this newspaper should already know Mr Prodi's precise reply. Mr President, I would ask you to investigate the situation and to protect the Members of this Parliament, because this is not an example of the transparency which Mr Prodi promised us at the beginning of his mandate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor is it likely that I will ever be President of Parliament. I will communicate your speech to the President, and I can tell you that the President has received a letter from you and another one from Mr Berenguer. I believe that you will have received a reply from the President, which has probably been sent by fax. In it, I believe that the President – who, pursuant to Rule 43 of the Rules of Procedure, is assisted by her office, which is empowered to allow and put the questions in order – replies, and I have the reply before me, by pointing out the criteria she has used to put the questions in order. In short, I can tell you that the President and the services considered that the question was addressed to Mr Prodi, and he was not expected to attend the plenary sitting. The President of the Commission does not usually attend this Question Time. There are a number of Commissioners, including Mr Kinnock and Mr Byrne, who we know in advance will reply to questions. This is communicated to the Members of the European Parliament and they therefore ask specific questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the President of Parliament has decided, as well as considering the chronological order, to select the five questions which, in her judgment, are priorities and urgent, which are the five which make up the first part and which we are going to deal with now.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the explanation I can give you, with complete transparency. In any event, I take note of your comments, which will appear in the Minutes, and I regret that a newspaper from any country can make statements on written or oral replies which are yet to be given.</p>

I do not agree with the presidency's interpretation of the questions made by Members of this House. I do not agree with it because it seems that that interpretation can be seen as a way of reducing the legitimate initiatives of Members to monitor the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My question specifically asked whether the Commission – not the President, but the Commission – felt threatened by the words of a Spanish MEP, a member of the People's Party, in which he said that, if the Socialists criticised Mrs de Palacio for her involvement in the flax scandal which took place in Spain when she was Minister for Agriculture, they would threaten to bring down the Commission. If this is not considered by the presidency to be a priority, if this is not a question which, because it is not considered a priority, could not be answered by, for example, Vice-President Kinnock, then I am truly amazed.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, and while I express my disagreement, this is not what I wanted to say. Like my colleague, Mr Izquierdo, who was requesting support from the presidency, I wanted to say that it was unacceptable for replies addressed to Members of this House to be published in a pro-government newspaper in Spain, before the Members are made aware of that reply.</p>
<p class="contents">And, while strongly protesting at this anomaly, I would ask you to consider my question withdrawn. I do not want the Commission to reply to the ABC newspaper before replying to me. And since I do not want the Commission to go through the shame of having to notify the Spanish press of its replies before the Members to whom they are addressed, I am not going to participate in this behaviour and I withdraw my question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Intense concern has been caused in Europe by revelations concerning the development of leukaemia among members of the international forces who served in Bosnia and Kosovo, which has been attributed to the use of depleted uranium bombs. In reply to one of my previous questions (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0429_EN.html">H-0429/99</a>)<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission indicated that (a) the report by the Regional Environmental Centre for Central and Eastern Europe had been forwarded to the Environment Ministers of the Member States in June 1999 and (b) detailed analysis of the situation regarding funding for clean-up measures had not yet been carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the fact that no answers to this particular issue were forthcoming at the January part-session and that the Commissioner referred to a meeting of an independent group of experts, does the Commission not consider highly alarming the implications of the report for the health of civilians and servicemen in these areas? Who will assume responsibility for medical examination programmes for the populations of the areas affected by depleted uranium bombs? What are the conclusions of the meeting of independent experts to which the Commissioner referred and what additional measures are to be taken? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since that date the Commission has convened a meeting of the group of experts established under Article 31 of the Euratom Treaty to give an opinion on the possible health consequences of the use of depleted uranium.

The Commission has no plans to initiate medical examination programmes. As the honourable Member will know, it is a regrettable fact that the people of the region face a variety of threats to health from several sources and some of those threats are obviously environmental in origin.

At that time, the Commission's reply to Parliament related to the specific issue of the test-firing of shells in coastal waters, and it offered the view that such action would not have a significant impact on the environment. The Commission continues to hold that view on the basis of the evidence that, in the marine environment, the only exposure pathway is the slow dissolution of uranium. It is important to note that the amount of uranium that could be dissolved is very small compared to the natural abundance of uranium in all sea-water.</p>
<p class="contents">The movement of uranium away from the test-firing location by tides and currents could not, therefore, be distinguished from natural background concentrations. The Commission understands public concern about the use of depleted uranium materials for military purposes. However, the Commission draws attention to the fact that the firing of uranium penetrators at land-based targets has implications which are different from those of firing ammunition in the marine environment, because use on land can result in the dispersion of uranium oxides which may subsequently be inhaled, whilst that is clearly not the case in the marine environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the basis of that scientific reality the feeling of the Commission and all other scientifically advised persons and bodies is that the evidence of uranium deposit in sea-water is such that the firing of shells for target purposes in the marine environment does not make any significant addition to uranium concentrations. It is only on the basis of that widely accepted and well-documented scientific evidence that the Commission takes its view.</p>

Mr Hækkerup was very clear – there is absolutely no need for an amnesty law by the Belgrade authorities, since only the UN, represented by Mr Hækkerup, can decide whether to imprison, sentence, or continue to detain these people. The only issue to consider is their immediate release from Serbian prisons and their transfer to the UN mission in Kosovo. There is therefore no need for the Commission to put pressure on Mr Kostuníca to pass an amnesty law or to enter into a set-up which is completely illegal in international law. The Commission and Council must make Mr Kostuníca and Mr Djinjic comply with the orders of the international community, which is demanding the return of the 700 hostages to the UN authorities.</p>

According to our information, 28 children and young people were arrested by the police in a small town in south-east Turkey on 9 January. The local security forces alleged that these children had taken part in an illegal demonstration, that they had shouted out pro-PKK slogans, and that they had protested against the Turkish military presence in northern Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Children and young people aged between 9 and 16 were arrested and taken to a prison in Diyarbakir. According to information provided by the Turkish Union for Human Rights, these children have also been mistreated in prison. Following protests by the parents and the Turkish Human Rights Society, 22 children and young people have now been released, but six young people aged between 14 and 17 are still in custody. The Commission has made representations to the Turkish authorities on this matter in the strongest terms. The Commission has called for an immediate and full explanation of the facts. This incident is a matter of grave concern to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wishes to emphasise that whatever these children may be accused of, such accusations can in no way justify taking children into custody, throwing them into a prison far from their parental homes and detaining them there for several days. This kind of behaviour is totally irreconcilable with the human rights standards prevailing in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission expects the Turkish Government to address this matter immediately. This incident demonstrates that there is an urgent need for political reform in Turkey if that country is to move closer to the European Union and its values. The Commission recalls that comprehensive protection of human rights is one of the political criteria that the candidate countries must meet in order to open accession negotiations with the European Union. This is also reflected in the priorities of the Accession Partnership with Turkey presented by the Commission in November last year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The importance of the participation of all interested parties in the process has been recognised in several resolutions and communications. The Commission is actively supporting this through different initiatives. In particular, the Commission gives important annual financing support, amounting to EUR 830 000 in 2001, to the European Association for the Coordination of Consumer Representation in Standardisation – the organisation known as ANEC.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that consumer organisations identify this subject as a priority in order to allocate the necessary resources.

Consumer organisations will be consulted on the content of the mandates.

Does the Commissioner not think it a touch strange that representatives of the industry to be regulated, that is to say the industry which produces toys and other items for children, should act as chairmen of the standardisation committees whose job it is to establish rules, at national or other levels, for those products that are released onto the market? Does the Commissioner himself not think it strange that products with which children come into contact on the market are not tested, which is why no one can really assess their safety?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commissioner not think it a little strange that, in the most recent cases involving, for example, chocolate eggs, toy cap pistols and non-flame-proof clothes used by children for dressing up in, the judgment has in every case turned out to be favourable to the industry instead of in accordance with children’s interests? I think it is quite clear that there is a need for a new method of standardisation based on objective assessment criteria rather than upon subjective criteria that are in the interests of the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has recently been questioned on the safety of associated products, often consisting in a toy accompanying the food product in a separate background. In the light of the information collected by the Commission in cooperation with national authorities, the Emergency Committee of the General Products Safety Directive reached on 16 May 2000 the conclusion that no specific danger relating to the associated product has been identified. Non-food items, particularly small toys, or toys containing small parts are not risk-free. However, the risk would depend on the characteristics of the non-food product itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of a possible risk has convinced the Emergency Committee to explore the need to reinforce the existing instruments, particularly the protection offered by Directive 88/378 on safety of toys and the related standard EN 71/1. The competent services of the Commission are currently working on possible improvements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Alleged attempt by Commissioner Kinnock to gag ex-Commissioner Gradin</span></p>
<p class="contents">According to reports appearing in the Swedish press on 23 January, Commissioner Kinnock wrote to ex-Commissioner Gradin and her former chef de cabinet, Christer Asp, demanding explanations concerning comments they made about shortcomings in the way the Commission operates. After the resignation of the Santer Commission and the Buitenen affair, people thought the Commission had learnt the meaning of democratic openness and had stopped using authoritarian methods to gag its employees past and present. Will the Commission therefore say whether it is true that Commissioner Kinnock wrote such letters? What steps will it take to prevent a repeat of gaffes like this?</p>
<p class="doc_subtitle_level1">Question No 51 by Jan Andersson (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0081_EN.html">H-0081/01</a>):</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Commission's conduct in regard to freedom of expression</span></p>
<p class="contents">Former Commissioner Anita Gradin and the former head of her private office, Christer Asp, have been criticised in a letter from the Commission for having given public interviews to clarify how several million in aid intended for Bosnia under the ECHO programme could have disappeared. In the interview, Anita Gradin stated that she stood by the decisions taken in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the principal tasks of the present Commission is to shed light on the events that took place under the previous Commission and to make changes to prevent any recurrence. Public openness is a major factor in that process.</p>
<p class="contents">In what way does the Commission consider that the letter to Anita Gradin contributes towards greater openness and greater public confidence in the Commission?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The Commission's actions regarding criticisms by a former Member of the Commission</span></p>
<p class="contents">What is known as the ECHO scandal of 1997, when irregularities resulted in the disappearance of huge amounts of EU aid and documents relating to the case later disappeared from the Commission's archives, has been the focus of much attention in Sweden and Denmark. On TV programmes in both countries, former Commissioner Anita Gradin and her former chef de cabinet have voiced criticism of the Commission's handling of the affair.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to the comments they made, Commissioner Kinnock wrote to both of them arguing that they had no right to criticise the Commission as an institution. If, contrary to expectation, there is a rule which says that they do not have a right to criticise, it would represent a dramatic step backwards for free speech in the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kinnock,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am very grateful to the honourable Members for their questions about my correspondence with my friend and former colleague, Mrs Anita Gradin, and her former chef de cabinet, Mr Christer Asp. The questions enable me to report publicly and fully to this House on an issue that I know has aroused interest particularly in Sweden.</p>
<p class="contents">On 13 November 2000 Danish TV broadcast a documentary programme in which statements were attributed to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp that appeared to relate to an employee of the Commission who had been unanimously acquitted of specific charges by the last Commission after due disciplinary process had been followed. As a result of that broadcast, and as Commissioner responsible for Personnel and Administration, I was obliged to write to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp on 22 November to request confirmation and clarification of the reported remarks, in order to enable the Commission to establish whether or not the remarks in question would require any action by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">That was the sole purpose of the letter. It did not, either in tone or in content, demand explanations, offer criticism, seek to gag anyone or imply in any way that either Mrs Gradin, as a former Commissioner, or Mr Asp, as a former official, had no right to criticise the Commission as an institution. In order to make that absolutely clear, I will readily provide copies of that letter and all other relevant correspondence to the honourable Members as soon as I have confirmation from Mrs Gradin that she has no objection to that course of action. Mrs Gradin has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to such a release of correspondence but naturally, as a matter of courtesy to her, I prefer to have direct confirmation of her agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gradin replied to my 22 November letter on 29 December and I wrote a further letter to her on 25 January 2001. As I pointed out in that letter to Mrs Gradin, and as the House will be aware, the Staff Regulations applicable to all EU institutions make it clear that the Commission as an institution and as an employer is legally liable to assist employees in defending themselves against attack. That obligation also means defending an acquitted person against any questioning of their innocence of the charges on which they were acquitted. My 22 November letters to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp therefore related entirely to such legal obligations and considerations and to absolutely nothing else.</p>
<p class="contents">As I made clear in my letter of 25 January to Mrs Gradin, whilst all liberties of speech are precious and must be upheld, the expression of certain opinions – for instance those that may be considered to defame others – can have legal consequences in all democratic societies, and have specific implications for the Commission as an employing European institution. In that letter I also made clear beyond doubt that my letter of 22 November was not in any way an attempt to limit free comment or to prevent criticism of the Commission either by Mrs Gradin, or indeed by Mr Asp or anyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">All this will be evident to honourable Members when they have the chance to read the exchange of correspondence, as I hope they will. That will also enable them to see that the basis for consideration of the actions of former commissioners and former officials is the Treaty and the Staff Regulations. Mrs Gradin has obviously always taken her duty of discretion provided for in the Treaty seriously as a responsible and reputable person. I am sure that will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is probably one of the most ridiculously evasive answers I have heard in a very long time. Mr Kinnock says that we would have known what the letter contained if we had been able to study it. Marvellous, if we only get to see it after the debate! I applied to Mr Kinnock’s office so as to be able to study the letter before the debate, but I was told that I could possibly get to examine it <span class="italic">after</span> the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">That only goes to show that Mr Kinnock has not understood in the slightest what openness really means. Mr Kinnock appears not to have learned anything from the scandal involving the Commission to which he previously belonged – the Santer Commission, which fell because it did not understand the link between transparency, on the one hand, and corruption and fraud, on the other. If Mr Kinnock had learned anything from the Commission to which he then belonged, he would have understood. I refer to the type of threatening letter which he obviously wrote and which Mrs Gradin understood as such, to judge from the statements she made to the Swedish press.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gradin must surely have read the letter before she made her statement. In the same way, Mr Asp must surely have read the letter before he made his statement. They no doubt knew, in any case, what the letter contained, and they obviously perceived it as a threat. It does in fact dishonour Parliament and is an insult to this House to turn tail and evade responsibility, as Mr Kinnock is now doing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My second question concerns the fact that, if the Commission wrote a letter to former Commissioner Gradin, it must have believed that she had in some way attacked an individual. I myself saw the TV programme and I am able to say that she did not do so. She was completely loyal to the decisions taken in the Commission. How could you believe that former Commissioner Gradin had directed criticism against individuals?

Mr Kinnock refers to the letter to Mrs Gradin and Mr Asp. We have not of course read it directly, but a copy of the letter to Mr Asp – which I assume has been correctly reproduced – has now been published in the Swedish media which, after referring to the television programme, state that Mr Kinnock wrote in the following terms to Mr Asp: “As you perhaps know, this statement has, fairly or unfairly, been interpreted as criticism of the Commission as an institution. Because you were formerly employed at the Commission, your statement raises the question of what kind of obligations you have because, as an employee, you have to comply with various terms of employment and Staff Regulations”.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, this can hardly be interpreted as anything other than an insinuation that Mr Asp did something he ought not to have done and that he might perhaps even deserve a reprimand. My question, therefore, is as follows: what legal basis is there for this letter? What kind of legal regulations are there to say that former chefs de cabinet or Commissioners do not have the right to criticise the Commission as an institution, and on what legal basis are such people even to be reminded of Staff Regulations and their various terms of employment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Andersson may have his own view about the case that was referred to in the TV documentary. That is not what this question is about and it is not what my letter to Mrs Gradin was about, but he is a democrat and he will understand. In Sweden, as in any other Member State, or democratic society, caution must be exercised in making a declaration about anyone who has been acquitted of a particular charge that could imply defamation of that person. That is a general rule that is understood and upheld by democrats everywhere, but in the case of the Commission as an employing institution, as I pointed out earlier, there is an additional implication that if a Commission official is attacked and if it is a Commission official in a specific case who has been acquitted under due process of a charge, than that official can make claims upon the Commission and therefore on taxpayers' money under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations in order to fight that case of alleged defamation.</p>
<p class="contents">The point that I made to Mrs Gradin, which I am sure she completely understands – especially since I explained in full in my most recent letter, simply relates to that legal reality and the proper discharge of the functions of the Commission as a legally constituted organisation with obligations set down in law in the form of the Staff Regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Andersson may have his own views about the particular cases referred to in the TV documentary. He is entitled to those views whether they are right, wrong, substantiated or otherwise, but he will understand, I am certain, that all the actions taken in relation to people named in that television documentary, and one in particular, relate to the legal questions – as I emphasised in my letter to Mrs Gradin and in my earlier reply – and not to wider judgments which may be a matter entirely for Mr Andersson's view and his own conscience. I will not say or do anything at any point which could result in unfair and unjustified charges on the Commission, the European Union and on the taxpayers' money, when there are other means of ensuring that the law is upheld so far as individuals are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Mr Gahrton that the problem is not one of transparency in this case, it is of the deficiencies either of his hearing or his understanding. What I said was not ridiculous. I will send him a copy of my reply and when I have the agreement of Mrs Gradin for the release of the letters that we exchanged, including my personal letter to her of 25 January, written in an official capacity, he can see it. But I am sure that he will understand, as someone who observes the courtesies and recognises the basis on which a personal letter is written, that it is not for me to release a letter which I wrote to Mrs Gradin. If Mrs Gradin wants to release it or gives me permission to release it, that is absolutely fine with me and, as I said, she has indicated by an indirect route that she would be agreeable to that. I am not surprised at that – I know Anita Gradin very well – but until I have formal confirmation I cannot release the letter. It is not in any way a secret.</p>
<p class="contents">I simply hope that Mr Gahrton's powers of comprehension will advance greatly by the time that he reads the letter because he did not show much evidence in the course of his contribution of having any more than the most rudimentary understanding. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is for that reason that, since 1995, annual targets are set for the appointment of women to these and to other management posts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's overall target, as announced at the beginning of our term of office in 1999, is to double the number of women in these two grades during its term in office, thereby raising the number of women in A1 and A2 posts to 44 or about 20% by 2005. To achieve this, the annual targets are set on the basis of anticipated turnover in the grades each year. In 2000 the target for the appointment of women to A1 was two appointments and the target for A2 was five appointments. These targets were exceeded with three new appointments being made to the A1 grade and seven new appointments to the A2 grade. As a result, the current number of women at A1 level is four out of 54 and the number of women at A2 level is 21 out of 178.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to continue its practice of setting annual targets because it has evidently assisted improvement in the gender balance, although patently not enough. The Commission will adopt the annual target for 2001 next month. In addition to the policy of target setting, the members of selection boards are reminded of the principles of equal opportunities to be taken into consideration in the selection of candidates. The Commission seeks to appoint the most suitable candidate for a post and, where there are equal merits relating to the relevant post, to give priority to the female candidate. The outcome must arise from objective assessment by the appropriate authority of each individual situation and is not therefore automatic for persons of either gender.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case referred to by the honourable Member, the advisory committee on appointments shortlisted a female candidate with good qualifications. The Commission considered that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly related to the tasks of the post in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, we women come up against a glass ceiling within the EU’s institutions, too. I am grateful for, and pleased with, the action plan with practical objectives you have taken as your starting point, but a timetable also needs to be established. It is extremely gratifying that you should want to work to end discrimination but, since the Commission has now once again appointed a man to the post of Director-General – this time as the Development Directorate-General – I wonder if the Commission’s objectives were just so much rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">The eight men on the selection board had to choose between a woman with wide political and administrative experience at a high level and solid experience abroad, and a man with no political background, less administrative experience and no experience abroad. I can only draw the conclusion that the male candidate was appointed on a quota basis.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden, successful appeals are made to the Labour Market Court in cases involving considerably less flagrant discrimination than this one. Is the Commission prepared to tear up its decision and give this post to the most competent candidate, or must an appeal be made to the European Court of Justice in this case? Is the Commission prepared in future to have at least 50 per cent women on its selection boards and not 100 per cent men? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can do nothing more in the circumstances than continue to strive to meet the best standards which we heartily recommend to others throughout the European Union. These are standards which I, and my colleagues in the current Commission, sincerely want to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could respond to the specific issues raised by the honourable Member: there is not enough representation of women at any level, including the managerial ranks, in any of the European Union institutions. We are, as the honourable Member was good enough to acknowledge, making a serious effort to improve upon that in the European Commission. But in the European Parliament, for instance, I think I am right in saying that out of the ten directors only one is a woman. The position in the Council, if anything, is not even as good as that. So in each of the institutions, including the others like the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors, there is patently need for very substantial improvement and I am very happy to have the opportunity at this Question Time in Parliament to underline that very forcibly yet again.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we will reach the targets by 2005. They are not over-ambitious targets. Indeed, several of us would argue in the current Commission that they are over-modest. They are however realistic given our starting point. What we hope will be the case is that by securing that at least 20% of senior management jobs are in the hands of women by the end of this Commission, it will provide the incoming Commission with a much firmer and higher base from which to work towards genuine gender balance across the Commission, particularly in managerial roles.</p>
<p class="contents">I take the point that the honourable Member made about the single-sex nature of the selection board. It is not in fact a selection board. It is an advisory committee on appointments. The final selection of candidates is made by the portfolio Commissioner, by myself as the Commissioner for Personnel Administration, and the President. The basis on which the selection was made, as I said earlier, involved no criticism of, or disrespect for, the high qualifications of the woman candidate who came before us; it related, as I said, to the fact that the candidate chosen had a profile more particularly suited to the tasks of the post in question. No preference on gender grounds was shown towards a man. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So far as progress is concerned, on 28 February 2001 the Commission will give consideration to a series of eight detailed draft proposals which will then be submitted for consultation to all the staff, and for formal negotiations to the staff representatives, as well as to two orientation papers, one of which relates to pay and pensions and the other to the more linear career system. We are therefore at the point – on the linear career system, on systematic appraisal and on a host of complementary activities – of making formal proposals, and of beginning detailed consultations on them. This is with a view, by the summer break, to compiling finalised proposals either for Commission decisions – which have the force of law – or proposals to this House and the Council where amendments to the Staff Regulations are required.</p>
<p class="contents">The support and interest of this House is invaluable in all of these reform activities, both those relating to improvement in the gender balance and, much more widely, those seeking to ensure improvements in the efficiency of Commission staff and in professional support for them. I hope that this support and understanding will continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The information was provided in response to a questionnaire sent to Member States on 5 January 2001. This questionnaire has enabled the Commission to obtain a reasonably complete picture of the way in which the measures are being implemented, and this seems broadly satisfactory. A working document which summarises the responses of the Member States to this questionnaire was also circulated for discussion at the Agriculture Council on 29 January.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are responsible for the implementation of these measures. In the case of the feed ban, implementation includes regular microscopic examination of feedstuffs and inspection of feedstuff plants. This in turn is audited by the personnel of the Food and Veterinary Office who have already visited a number of the Member States to this end since December 2000, and intend to visit the rest early in 2001. The reports on these inspection visits will be made available to Parliament and published on the Internet in the usual manner.</p>

Portugal, France and Germany have requested the recognition of the fully operational character of their national databases and the Commission is in the process of studying these requests.

Only a very short time has, of course, elapsed. In view of the health situation, a particularly long period ought not to be allowed to elapse, out of consideration for both consumers and farmers. This is also because, right now, there is distortion of competition between farmers in the individual Member States, because the compensation offered is very different from one country to another. I hope it will not be the slowest, but the fastest, countries which set the pace, for I am completely convinced that it is in that way that we shall achieve a result in which all the current 15 EU countries have implemented these BSE decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has also made use of the new legal provision of the Treaty of Amsterdam to propose regulations under the codecision procedure on the prevention and control of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and on the processing of animal by-products. These regulations will bring together in a single substantive legal text a wide range of measures which are currently based on safeguard provisions of Community veterinary legislation. If the negotiations run their course as expected, the regulation on TSEs should be adopted next month.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed regulation on animal by-products is expected to be voted on by Parliament shortly. In the meantime, the Commission continues to monitor the situation on the spot, requesting scientific advice and taking legal measures whenever needed. The evidence resulting from the very regular visits of the Food and Veterinary Office and the scientific opinions of the Scientific Steering Committee has become the basis for the consumer protection policy of the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to ask a supplementary question, as a result of the perplexity expressed by my constituents at the horrendous errors and contradictions of the Spanish authorities. Specifically, a regional Agricultural Minister has ordered that dead cows be deposited in an open mine. There have been statements from one minister saying one thing while another minister says the opposite. At least in Germany ministers have resigned. My question is: apart from legislative measures, does the Commission intend to take executive measures in relation to the Member States? Will the Commission exercise a greater presence in our States in order to offer the citizens guarantees? Has the Commission at any point considered employing infringement proceedings, by means of a letter of infringement, so that the Community citizens may realise that the Commission it truly fighting for their safety and health? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is little point in passing legislation at Community level if it is not fully and rigorously implemented by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of responses available to the Commission in the event that there is a persistent failure by any Member State to properly implement these safety laws. These are, for instance, the initiation of infringement proceedings against that Member State or, alternatively, by taking Community measures which can be understood to mean the putting in place of safety provisions which would prevent the Member State in question from exporting its product. In this instance I assume that when you are talking about these issues you are talking about beef.</p>
<p class="contents">These are obviously very powerful measures. They are required to be brought into effect in circumstances where there is a failure by Member States to implement the safety provisions. It is appropriate to bring these measures into place, however, only in circumstances where the breach has been persistent. There has to be a pattern of behaviour by a Member State of ignoring the law. One or two incidents would not trigger the infringement proceedings nor require the taking of Community measures.</p>

If the Member States are required, and I am in agreement with this, Commissioner, to comply with the rules that are dictated from here, those rules need to be clear and the same for everybody.</p>
<p class="contents">What level of compliance can be demanded when we are talking about applying tests? A period of 30 months is imposed on the Member States and they agree to it, but there are, however, some Member States that already apply a period of 24 months. What guarantees are being offered to consumers? Do you not think that this issue causes considerable alarm and insecurity among consumers?</p>
<p class="contents">The same could be said about the issue of removing the vertebral column, on the subject of risk materials. There is only talk of removing the vertebral column for two Member States and for animals of more than 30 months. There are exceptions for some Member States, but what are they? And what is the reason for them? Why, on 7 February of this year, did the Standing Veterinary Committee carry out the evaluation for removing the vertebral column from animals of more than 12 months? Where is the harmonisation?</p>

I understand that the honourable Member is asking me about the measure that was introduced last week at the SVC for the removal of the vertebral column as distinct from the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="contents">The spinal cord has been designated as a specified risk material (SRM) for a long time and has been removed in many Member States as such for a long time; it has been removed now as a matter of law in the European Union by all Member States since 1 October 2000. If you are referring to the vertebral column, I will deal with that aspect of your question by saying that the proposal that I put before SVC for their decision last week was firmly based on the advice of the Scientific Steering Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is that something over 95% of the infectivity is located in the SRM in an infected animal. The removal of the vertebral column is regarded by the scientists to account for an additional couple of percentage points so that, in the context of the whole question of the removal of specific risk material, this is an ultra-precautionary measure. In advising whether this should be done, the Scientific Steering Committee examined the available evidence from Member States and came to the conclusion that it was appropriate to remove the vertebral column in circumstances where Member States did not have a substantially BSE-free regime or did not have control measures in place which would be equivalent to very low BSE-incidence. Bearing in mind that advice, a conclusion was reached that it was appropriate to grant waivers to the five Member States that you are referring to, two of them because they had very rigorous control measures in place, and the other three because they were in category 2 of the geographical risk assessment that was published last July, thereby identifying those Member States as being at very low risk. Accordingly, the waivers were granted in those circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a Community-wide measure. It applies to all Member States. However, in circumstances where it is appropriate, in the individual circumstances of an individual Member State, and strictly on the advice of scientists who advise me, it was considered appropriate to allow for derogations. Not only did the Scientific Steering Committee give advice on which that decision was based, but the Standing Veterinary Committee came to the same conclusion, as did the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a justifiable response. There are many Member States which take the view that I went too far. There are Member States that take the view that I did not go far enough. Proportionate responses in these circumstances are what we tried to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 24 months, I assume that you are referring to the fact that there is a requirement to test animals above the age of 30 months. There is one Member State that has reduced that on its own territory to 24 months, but that has absolutely no trade implications between that State and other Member States; that Member State has presumably concluded that it would be worthwhile reducing it to 24 months having regard to the age profile of a couple of positives that they have found.</p>
<p class="contents">I substantially agree with the basis of your question, which is that it is better to have Community measures right across the board rather than have individual measures, but sometimes individual Member States or a particular measure that is somewhat different from the Community measure can be justified in circumstances where a particularly unique situation is obtained in a Member State. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not acceptable that cheap meat should be less safe than dearer meat.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is very carefully following all issues relating to material which could present risks as regards transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In this context, it gave a prominent mandate to the Scientific Steering Committee to review the current list of so-called specified risk material if new scientific evidence becomes available in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 2000 the Commission adopted Decision 2000/418/EC which requires the removal of a series of bovine, ovine and caprine tissues from food and feed chains. In particular it provides that bones of the skull from cattle over 12 months of age have to be banned in all Member States. In addition, it extends the list of specified risk material to the vertebral column of bovine animals over 30 months of age in the United Kingdom and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">Following further opinions of the Scientific Steering Committee, the Commission presented a proposal at the Standing Veterinary Committee meeting of 7 February, which designated the vertebral column as a specified risk material to be removed and destroyed for cattle over the age of 12 months. This proposal was accepted by the Standing Veterinary Committee and, when it is formally adopted, Member States will be required to ensure removal of the vertebral column. This may take place at the point of sale, that is in the butchers' shops, from 31 March 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal included provisions for derogations from the obligation to remove the vertebral column, on the basis of scientific committee opinions, for five Member States – Austria, Finland, Portugal, Sweden and the United Kingdom. This derogation is conditional on continued and improved surveillance for the presence of BSE in those Member States, with increased testing of certain categories of animals required. The derogations will be reviewed if necessary in the light of the results of these tests and further scientific advice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Spanish Government became aware of the first case of BSE in October, although it kept it a secret until December. The lack of transparency and the improvisation with which my country’s government is acting with regard to the crisis are, in my opinion, the reason for the massive drop in consumption in Spain, for which the cattle farming sector is paying.

It is a matter for the Member State to decide. Some Member States do that. Other Member States choose to kill all cohorts which is obviously a different defence or protection measure and there are those who take the view that it is at least as good and may even be better. As I stated, it is a matter for each Member State to decide how to respond in these circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to draw your attention to the fact that the TSE regulation is now passing through the legislative process, as I mentioned in answer to an earlier question. That regulation provides for the culling of the herd and the killing of cohorts and it also provides for other measures that a Member State notifies to the Commission which the Commission, through its scientific advisers, is satisfied provides at least the same degree of protection for consumer health. That other measure can be allowed in those circumstances.
