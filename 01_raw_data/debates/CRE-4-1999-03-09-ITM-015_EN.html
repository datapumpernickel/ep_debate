<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Piecyk </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, perhaps I will not need my whole seven minutes of speaking time. After all, one can keep it a bit shorter. We transport politicians always try to be precise, without letting things get out of hand.</p>
<p class="contents">When we began working on the TENs in 1994, it was clear from the outset that the TENs will not be some unique event that suddenly erupts like a volcano, something that is decided just like that; what was clear is that there will be a process that will continue for a number of years and will also have to be reviewed constantly. That is why the 1996 decision taken by the Council and Parliament is sensibly entitled ‘Guidelines for the development of the trans‐European transport network". During the conciliation procedure the Council and Parliament could not agree on what Parliament called for at the time, namely the need to include ports in the TENs. I think that anyone with any brains and common sense will realise that a transport network without interconnection points is an incomplete system, but then nobody has ever pretended that every member of the Council shines with common sense. I would never go so far as to say that.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conciliation procedure the Commission – indeed you, Commissioner – declared that a proposal on seaports would be on the table immediately. Immediately took rather longer than we would normally understand by the word. But in the end we did get what I would regard as a very sensible proposal, namely to bring seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals together in one proposal. It makes sense because all three are after all transport connection points and as such they are indeed the condition for linking the various transport modes together. Moreover, seaports and inland connection points interact with one another and are a significant factor in the development of intermodal transport.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is crucial to the development of seaports. We do not deny that either and so when we lay down European criteria for seaports this must not lead to any distortions of competition. But regarding the volume criterion, I believe that a traffic volume of 1.5 million tonnes of freight a year is quite certainly more appropriate for a European network than the 1 million proposed by the Commission. What is totally incomprehensible, however, is the Commission"s specifications for seaports. Quite rightly, there is a great deal of detail about port infrastructure, but in the end the Commission proposal says that infrastructure projects are not eligible for aid! We, and indeed I, regard that as totally wrong. We stick to our original approach: we want to recognise port infrastructure as eligible for aid on principle, but certainly not superstructure, which is a different matter.</p>
<p class="contents">To make it quite clear what infrastructure means, my report proposes a basic definition of the term. After all, we have all sorts of fancies in our mind about all the things that could be supported. But if these are to be kept in check, we must also have a basic definition of what infrastructure means in the future networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation regarding inland ports is somewhat different. Of course, as the Commission proposes, they should be equipped with transhipment installations for intermodal transport; that would be one criterion. But those inland ports that only tranship bulk freight should have an annual traffic volume of at least 500 000 tonnes of freight. The Transport Committee is adding that criterion to the report.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other points I would like to address. The Commission also wants to include rail freight freeways in the TENs. Parliament has always supported the Commission and you personally, Commissioner, on the matter of freeways. We think this is necessary in order to move more freight from the roads to the railways. And we continue to support you. However, by virtue of their construction, the freeways are a service installation and not an infrastructure. That is why both I and the committee believe that in terms of the system – not of the principle, where we entirely agree – they do not belong in the TENs, simply because they are not an infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the famous project No 8 of the 14 very important projects endorsed by the Essen summit. For God"s sake, these projects have been examined a thousand times as to whether they can go ahead! The Christophersen Group went to great trouble, and now everything is to be changed again! This is certainly not a glorious chapter in the annals of the Council. But I believe Parliament and the Commission should both forgive and forget here and say yes, while specifying one thing, namely that to be precise project No 8 is a project consisting of several individual projects. And that is the basis on which we should decide tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains is for me to thank my colleagues in the committee for their cooperation, to also thank the Commission departments with whom we also cooperated, and finally to call on the Council to finally get round to producing a common position before the end of the legislative term, so that we can get on with this in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on principle the Commission is considering possibly presenting a white paper on the basis of its review of the networks. We think that is wrong. Article 21 of the decision provides that the review shall be followed by Commission proposals, which means we should not rethink the whole matter again in the form of a white paper. That is why we expect the review, when it finally appears, to put forward new, revised proposals, but not, so to speak, to start from scratch again. We have worked on the networks too long for this to happen. That is why it is useful to have the completed proposal on the table now. I can only wish the Commissioner luck in his work and hope that we will manage to achieve a common position during this electoral term.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Sindal </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Piecyk for a good report and a resolution which is a leftover from our resolution on trans‐European networks. We did not get as far as how ports should be included in the master plan. Since then, we have shown that a lack of efficiency and higher costs both in ports used for inland shipping and seaports have contributed to restricting shipping. The report on short‐sea shipping demonstrated that. We have discussed the green paper on ports, and we have in fact progressed a long way in our debate on ports.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a need for development all over Europe. We are now jointly picking out some priorities and some ports. It is important for us to consider not only the functional aspect, but also the need for uniform conditions as far as bureaucracy is concerned. That is what I want to talk about today. There is one thing that is very inconvenient for ships when they arrive at ports, and that is the inconsistency in the way they are received and the way the ports operate. I would therefore urge the ports in the Member States which, through the ‘fellowship' of the trans‐European network, are now expected to provide a more sustainable transport system, to fulfil the obligation which goes with being part of the transport chain and all its bureaucracy. Another point is that the selection of ports should be based on strategic considerations, and not just on regional and local factors. A port may have great local significance, but it may not live up to the idea of a trans‐European network. Local desires for expansion should therefore be held in check when we talk about the development of trans‐European networks.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Jarzembowski </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, Tuesday evening is the time for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, so let us get to work again.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, very warmly for his report. He has managed most successfully to incorporate the points we made at the time of the discussion on the green paper on seaports. In terms of the white paper and amendment of the TEN proposal, he has included Parliament"s views in his report and reconciled them. That is a most important task and ensures that we do not have two different legal acts and follow different courses. I believe it also demonstrates how right we were to be stubborn in 1996 and not to adopt the seaports proposal at the time. For with the Piecyk report we now have a far more precise and clear definition of the tasks relating to supporting or not supporting seaports and inland ports. I admit that, Commissioner, and also thank the Commission for improving its proposal compared to the original text. In that respect, we have come closer to one another.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe it is important for us to have a proper map of European seaports, for the public did not understand why we had a map showing airports, railway lines and roads, without any indication of seaports. I agree with Mr Piecyk that including seaports in the maps does not mean that no other ports have a chance of achieving prominence in Europe; those ports simply have to manage that themselves. I think that is the crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I think it is very good that we have a clear delineation between port infrastructure and port superstructure in the Piecyk report. One of our central tasks continues to be to avoid distortions of competition between seaports through national aid or even aid from the Cohesion Fund or the Structural Funds. That means we need clear definitions of port infrastructure and port superstructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the Commission, Mr Kinnock, will agree with our more precise definition of project No 8. The Council keeps talking about the Essen and Dublin projects, but we have always taken that to mean that this is a matter of codecision and not of a Council decision: it is after all a list of priority projects and not a list of generally applicable priority tasks. Unfortunately No 8 was a generally applicable commitment. We have defined it more precisely on the basis of the Commission"s practical proposals, and we are prepared at the next stage perhaps to find a common, stronger, more precise definition. But it is important that we are clear in our minds what the priorities are and do not restrict ourselves to generally non‐applicable tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree with Mr Piecyk that we do not want a white paper on the TENs, for that always means two years of discussions and everyone in this House and everyone in the Council knows what we are talking about here. We need a brief report summarising the experience gained and a clear review. That is our task and I believe the Commissioner should do us that favour.</p>

Perhaps, Commissioner Kinnock, if you keep this portfolio and we exercise our powers of codecision, we can make an effort to move this a little closer to the centre of the political stage and have it acknowledged as rather more important.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I must begin by complimenting Mr Piecyk. We have worked together on this remarkably well, and if his predecessor Günther Topmann could see the harmonious atmosphere in which this report was produced, I think he would find it heartwarming.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the views that have been expressed, but there is one aspect which I should like to develop a little further. Ports are of course the most important points of intersection in our trans‐European networks. After all, all our Union imports and exports pass through them. The importance of ports is determined not only by history, but also by the ease of their links to the hinterland. Why, for example, is the port of Oporto rather less busy than that of Rotterdam? Because, despite the fact that it means two or three days" less sailing time, transport from the coast to the interior is more difficult because the infrastructure which the port requires is not yet well enough developed. That is one of the reasons why we established the TENs and why it is most important to have multimodal transport services from the ports to the hinterland.</p>
<p class="contents">So I am also grateful to the rapporteur for mentioning waterways which are at least as important, the Elbe‐Lübeck canal and the Twente‐Mittelland canal which was added in committee as the result of an amendment. We should be very glad to see the Commission stressing the importance of these waterways as well.</p>

Please bear with me if, in the short amount of time at my disposal, I concentrate on priority project No 8, dealing with links between Portugal and Europe via Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The project now submitted could be regarded as a genuine revolution in the world of transport as far as Portugal is concerned. It fully incorporates the new philosophy which we in the European Union, and particularly in the European Parliament, have always supported. The fact that Portugal's current Public Works Minister used to be a member of the European Parliament may have something to do with the far‐reaching transformation that has occurred in proposals for Community projects affecting Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The previously planned project consisted of a motorway between Lisbon and Valladolid, and this is also part of the new project, but what has changed in my opinion is, above all, the philosophy behind it. Account has been taken of ports and intermodal transport, with rail and road links guaranteeing merchandise improved access to ports outside and inside Europe. As Mr Wijsenbeek said earlier, there really is a world of a difference between the port of Oporto and the port of Rotterdam in terms of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">What is being proposed in this project – in my view nothing short of a revolution in the world of transport in my country, which is why I ask both the European Parliament and the Commission to support it – will enable Portugal to overhaul its transport system and create a logical and complementary network that will link up the different means of transport and modernise every form of access to the Portuguese ports. That means that we will be on a new cutting edge of development. We therefore think that this project must be approved. It is of overriding importance for Europe and Portugal alike.</p>

<p class="contents">We gladly welcome the Commission"s proposal as it is important and urgent that we complete the conciliation procedure between the European Parliament and the Council. This procedure began in 1996, as no agreement could be reached on the way in which ports were to be incorporated in the TENs. However, the Commission"s proposal, as the rapporteur has already highlighted, was delayed and the procedure for the current proposal will overlap with the preparations for the Commission report on the fundamental revision of the guidelines. In fact, the Commission"s explanatory statement in its proposal for amendment constantly refers to the forthcoming review that will take place in accordance with Article 21 of Decision 1692/96/EC.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, I do not believe that the proposal for a continuous process of updating and reviewing the guidelines should be made through a White Paper. And as regards Amendment No 13, concerning point 8, and more specifically on the corridors in the Commission"s proposal, ‘Multimodal link Portugal/Spain with the rest of Europe", the following corridors are included: Galicia (La Coruña)/Portugal (Lisbon), the southwest corridor (Lisbon/Seville) and a third corridor Irún/Portugal (Lisbon). The Spanish side of this last corridor is not properly defined. I believe this is a transcription error, as it should read Irún‐Valladolid/Portugal (Lisbon). As a result, I ask that this be corrected in order to avoid any misunderstanding and I would ask the rapporteur to clarify this when it comes to the vote.</p>

<p class="contents">Unlike some colleagues, I am convinced that the new TENs project requires in‐depth discussion, harking back to the original spirit of the White Paper by Jacques Delors and stimulating innovation, above all by linking these networks to the development of urban and industrial areas. I am therefore in favour of a Commission communication which generates a wide‐ranging debate with Parliament and with European society, and is not merely a list of projects mediated by national governments.</p>
<p class="contents">I am broadly in agreement with this proposal, and I think that a compromise should be possible on one point. In my opinion, the classification of seaports on the basis of freight volume should not be related exclusively to an annual volume of 1.5 million tonnes, but should be considered over a longer period of at least three years.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as competition is concerned, although careful attention must be paid to distortions, I believe that support from the Structural and Cohesion Funds is crucial to port structure and superstructure activities. The Commission's survey of ports is most useful here, considering that public funding also benefits many non‐Mediterranean ports, albeit indirectly. A very clear and accurate analysis of both Mediterranean and non‐Mediterranean ports is required.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the important concepts here are nodes, intermodality, technological innovation and the rational development of interconnected networks, including links with railway nodes. Intermodality is a key factor.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Mendes Bota </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, of the fourteen priority projects for the trans‐European transport networks established at the Essen Council in December 1994, three are at the finishing stages and six are due to be completed by the year 2005, while for the other five there is a great deal of vagueness about their timetable, costs and funding. That is the case with the multimodal link between Portugal and Spain and the rest of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1996 when the new Socialist government came to power in Portugal, policies changed, Madrid moved into line and, at the Dublin Council, the European Union approved the new emphasis on multimodal transport with which we happen to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Two and a half years later we still do not know what actual projects for multimodal links with Portugal and Spain and what economic or environmental impact studies have been presented in Brussels or what their cost and sources of funding will be. It is curious that as we are changing the designation of project No 8, which relates to three Iberian multimodal corridors, the Portuguese Government has just presented its national social and economic development plan for the period 2000‐2006 and refers to four main Iberian corridors as part of the current set of trans‐European network projects, namely the Galician‐Portuguese corridor from Vigo to Lisbon; the Irun‐Portugal corridor; the Extremadura corridor from Lisbon to Madrid; and the Mediterranean corridor from Lisbon to Seville via Faro and Huelva.</p>
<p class="contents">So where does that leave us? Are there three or four corridors? Which text accurately reflects the current political will of the Portuguese Government? Which of them can we rely on in the future? We must avoid getting bogged down in vagueness, toing and froing, putting off the vital day when Union funding must be forthcoming. In particular, regions such as the Algarve and Andalucia cannot be satisfied with simply being ‘on the map" while in practice being indefinitely left out of the transport corridors linking those regions to Europe. The rail network in southern Portugal is the worst in Europe as there are no links with Seville or with Faro airport. In the short term the Lisbon‐Algarve motorway, the second stage of the Via do Infante and the Ayamonte‐Seville link must be joined up to form part of the European road network. We have now had enough inertia and vacillation.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I begin by offering my regrets that I will not be as precise and brief as Mr Piecyk, partly because there is a complexity about this report. I want to make a candid and as full as possible response to what has been said because these are important issues. So I hope the House will bear with me if I stray a little over the five minutes. I also think that Mr Wijsenbeek, as ever, has made an excellent suggestion that in these late night sessions we actually gather closer together so that we can save electricity by not having to project our voices so far and maybe, at the end of the evening, we can join in some community singing. That would be very good.</p>
<p class="contents">Sometimes I feel rather lonely, although, as Mr Wijsenbeek says, this is a packed House by comparison with what we are sometimes used to. That is a testimony to the very great interest that is expressed in this important subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that Parliament has taken up the proposal we have put forward and there is general support in the House for its objective, which is the completion of the trans‐European networks transport guidelines with the inclusion of seaports, inland ports and intermodal terminals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Piecyk, the rapporteur, must have a particular sense of accomplishment in producing this report since, after our joint experiences in 1995 and 1996, I always think of him as the parliamentary midwife of the transport TEN guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">It will be clear to honourable Members that the development of a multimodal trans‐European transport network would be incomplete if the principal interconnection points were not included. That is the reason, as several Members of the House will know, why the Commission, following the request of this House, declared in the conciliation procedure on the guidelines that we would submit a proposal for seaport projects in 1997. Indeed, it is consistent with the entire thrust of our TENs policy which, because of the mission of developing real networks, must focus increasingly on connection points and access to main arteries rather than simply on traditional stretches of infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the committee has supported the main principles and the main objectives of the Commission. A number of amendments adopted by the committee can be accepted either in their entirety or, at least, in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Before dealing with the substantive amendments, I should like to comment on Amendment No 1 – an issue that has arisen repeatedly in the course of this debate – which inserts a recital stating that the European Parliament expects a legislative proposal on the revision of the guidelines, rather than the White Paper that the Commission has announced. I understand that view very well. However, it must be said that under Article 21 of the guidelines decision the Commission is requested to present a report and not a proposal for an amendment of the law. We are therefore fulfilling that requirement. I hope that the House will agree that there is good sense in producing a report as a White Paper, deliberately in order to provide this Parliament and others with a real opportunity for a broader debate on the trans‐European networks policy in general before a new proposal is finally decided upon. Parliament and the wider community have everything to gain and absolutely nothing to lose by this approach, especially in terms of real participation in policy development in what is a crucial strategy for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So rather than in any sense being evasive in not immediately coming forward with a legislative proposal, we are, frankly, trying to do the opposite and being more transparent and more inclusive in the approach that we are making to consideration of the TENs guidelines after the experience and after the evolution of the policy over four years in which a great many developments have taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall address the other amendments in three main groups: those relating to ‘Trans‐European Rail Freight Freeways"; secondly, those on the criteria for deciding which ports are included; and, thirdly, those relating to the types of infrastructure, superstructure and rolling stock investment support that are eligible.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2 and 7 refer to the ‘Trans‐European Rail Freight Freeways" which, as Mr Piecyk said, have been supported by this Parliament as a means of making early progress in reviving rail freight across the Union. This revision of the guidelines provides us with a further means of encouraging the development of rail freight freeways by making clear that infrastructure investment in the freeways routes will be given priority. That makes sense because the viability of infrastructure investments obviously depends on competitive revenue‐raising services and competitive services clearly need quality infrastructure. So investment in infrastructure will certainly help to deliver better services. But I thought that was the whole purpose of infrastructure investment in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed it is in line with the amendments that Parliament itself put, and we accepted, on the project action for combined transport programmes. So I cannot support Amendments Nos 2 and 7 which have the effect of dropping all references to trans‐European rail freight freeways. I would, however, be happy to consider a reformulation of the provision that does not directly refer to the rail freight freeways but rather to cross‐border trans‐European rail freight corridors open to all operators. If that was accepted, I hope that all parts of this House could then give support to the reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to criteria for identifying ports, the Commission accepts that part of Amendment No 4 gives special treatment to ports in the outermost regions. However, the increase in the minimum traffic volume stipulated in the proposal from 1 million to 1.5 million tonnes of freight would exclude about 27 ports, mainly in remote areas of the Union. We, therefore, cannot support this specific point because of the breadth of our commitment and indeed the Treaty requirements relating to the function of the trans‐European network strategy in connecting up the peripheral regions of the Union to the centre. Meanwhile the stipulation that ports must be connected to the TENs routes that is set out in the amendment would have the effect of excluding a number of ports that are not currently linked to the trans‐European network. Similarly, the inclusion of a minimum volume threshold for bulk freight in inland ports envisaged in Amendment No 3 would alter the present approach which is essentially based on intermodal freight. Those proposed amendments cannot, therefore, be accepted entirely. I hope the House will recognise that there are practical reasons for the Commission taking this view as well as reasons that are also connected to a desire to provide a breadth of effective coverage in the trans‐European network strategy as we are further developing it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 makes more radical changes to the guideline maps, adding new links and creating new categories of ports. As I am sure the House recognises, these are, in reality, issues for consideration in the forthcoming general revision process. Consequently, I cannot accept that amendment for that reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 mainly tightens up definitions and can be readily accepted. I am grateful to Mr Piecyk for putting that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to types of eligible investments, I can easily concur with the argument that all projects of common interest, including those related to ports, should, in principle, be potentially eligible for TENs funding. That means dropping a restrictive paragraph in our proposal on the non‐availability of funding for infrastructure in the port area. Of course financing of those infrastructures – as Mr Jarzembowski pointed out – must not distort competition. What would, however, create real problems is the introduction of a new concept of superstructures in ports as the distinction between superstructure and infrastructure is far from clear. We would open the door to uncertainty about eligibility, in particular in the area of combined transport. If the Union in its wisdom would appoint Mr Jarzembowski to be the inspector of TENs superstructures in all the ports of the European Union, that would mean he was gainfully employed, dedicated to the service of the Community. All I would regret was his prolonged absence from this House. But if that power was not vested in Mr Jarzembowski I am not sure that I could accept any definition that clearly delineated between superstructure and infrastructure. I will illustrate the point by taking the argument further.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of giving a detailed definition of port infrastructure in Amendments Nos 8 and 9, although I recognise the good intentions of putting it forward in that way, has been very thoroughly examined by the Commission. We have had to conclude, however, that the provision of a detailed definition would definitely carry the risk that relevant features could be missed out. In the case, for example, of this specific amendment, the proposed definition, although it is carefully crafted, still misses landing places, quay walls and locks – matters of critical interest in both sea and inland ports.</p>
<p class="contents">On balance, therefore, and for practical reasons, I prefer not to have a more precise and exhaustive definition of the term ‘port infrastructure" in the legal text. I emphasise strongly to the House that it is only for practical reasons that are directly connected with the desire of the Commission to get effective commitment to the development of ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission accepts in essence Amendment No 13 which seeks to describe more precisely the specific project No. 8 in Annex III which has been the subject of several references in the course of the debate, though the accuracy needs cross‐checking with the two Member States concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Summing up, the Commission cannot support Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, part of 4, 6, 7, most of 8 and 9, and 11. But we can accept Amendments Nos 5, 10, 12, the first part of Amendment No 8, and 9, and we can certainly subscribe to the principles of Amendment No 13 and part of 4.</p>
<p class="contents">I warmly thank the House for having taken this proposal forward and also by expressing my particular gratitude to the Committee on Transport and Tourism and specifically to the rapporteur, Mr Piecyk, for the excellent work that once again has been done by himself and his colleagues.</p>
