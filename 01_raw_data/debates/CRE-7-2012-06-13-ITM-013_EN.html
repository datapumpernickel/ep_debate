<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Olli Rehn, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, let me first thank you on behalf of the Commission and my colleagues László Andor and Algirdas Šemeta for this opportunity to discuss the first real European Semester after the entry into force of the ‘six-pack’ legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission adopted two weeks ago its most important package of economic policy proposals of the year. We put forward country-specific recommendations for the reforms that are needed to deliver stability, growth and jobs in the 27 Member States and for their citizens. The Member States have taken last year’s recommendations seriously. Efforts have been made to implement them, but progress is still very uneven between Member States and more needs to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">To supplement national action, the European level must play its part. The Commission has put on the table concrete proposals to enhance sustainable growth; some of them have been on the table already for several months. They are about creating competitive services and energy markets, a digital single market, investing in infrastructure, promoting research and innovation, and getting better access to fast-growing markets around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Such growth-enhancing structural policies must be supported by enhanced investment, public and private. We need more cross-border and Community investment in renewable energy and green growth, in transport and communication infrastructure, as well as in research and innovation. To this end, we have proposed an increase in the EIB’s lending capacity. We also welcome the recent agreement on our project bond proposal to unlock up to EUR 4.6 billion in a pilot phase. To support growth, we also need a European budget that has the magnitude and the means to invest in the future. In the talks on the next multiannual financial framework, I count on the full support of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, with last week’s proposal on bank resolution, the EU is the first body in the world that has fully delivered on its G20 commitments to strengthen the regulation and supervision of the banking sector. This is a very important signal ahead of the G20 summit in Los Cabos, where one may expect some other leaders to be tempted to put the blame for the crisis only on Europe’s shoulders. And, as we said two weeks ago in our policy statement, we are preparing further steps towards a full economic union to complete our monetary union, including through a financial union. The main building blocks towards a financial union should include such common elements as a single rule book, integrated financial supervision, a common resolution authority and a single deposit insurance scheme. All these common and integrated elements should be part of the same overall framework, the overall construct, intended for the 27 Member States, while allowing stronger requirements and deeper integration for the euro area as necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principle is clear: the sharing of risk in the guarantee scheme calls for an integrated, strong supervision of the banking sector. There can be no further mutualisation of economic risk without deeper integration of decision making. In other words, to move further in mutualisation, it is necessary to strengthen our stability culture. This basic principle should guide the future construction of both financial and fiscal union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports a strong involvement of the European Parliament in the strengthened European Semester. In this context, I would like to thank Parliament, especially the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for organising the opportunity to have an economic dialogue on the European Semester on Monday this week. I found it very substantive and constructive and I hope that this sentiment is shared. The Commission stands ready also, in future, to actively participate in any discussion on the outcome of this year’s European Semester. I trust that Parliament will fully engage in the multilateral surveillance of economic policies in the European Union and will be able to ensure that country-specific guidance will be both relevant and ambitious. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You can count on our full support. It is really good that we are now half way through the first year of the European Semester and that it has become a very powerful instrument for better aligning our economic and budgetary policies. We have got rid of its non-committal elements and, thanks to this Parliament, the semester also forms part of the ‘six-pack’. Plus, the Commission’s powers have been significantly strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to see transparent debates on the Commission’s recommendations and we would like the Council to really take them seriously, because that was something that was missing in the past. Therefore, it is important that, every time the Council fails to follow the Commission, the Council should come here and explain why it is not doing so and why it has taken a different position. In many previous cases, we have witnessed reverse voting take place.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to praise Commissioner Rehn for the thorough analysis he has tabled concerning the national reform programmes and stability programmes, as well as for his recommendations. It is now time that Member States seriously addressed them.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, it is a real pity that the Council is not attending today’s debate, because it is important that we conduct that debate among the three of us: Parliament, Commission and Council. What I can already see coming is that some countries will try to make deals in order to smooth over their rough edges, and I can also see that taking place in my own country, the Netherlands. We know that we need clear recommendations for all countries, but we tend to think those will not be needed when it comes to our own respective countries! However, if we continue with that train of thought, we will never haul ourselves out of this crisis and that is why we need to take this seriously. I hope that you will persevere in these efforts and ask for a public debate if the Council deviates from your recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This morning, President Barroso proposed an interinstitutional agreement on a growth initiative to properly involve the European Parliament in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point is about democracy. I welcome President Barroso’s proposal, but I would also like to recall that two years ago, this Parliament voted for something much more important: an interinstitutional agreement on the European Semester. We must make the European Semester process truly democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Rehn, you reminded our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on Monday that the new economic dialogue provision in the ‘six-pack’ expects the Council, as a general rule, to follow the recommendations and proposals of the Commission. Those recommendations cover essential elements of national policy: labour market regulation, pension systems, collective bargaining practices and so on. It is simply not acceptable that such recommendations are meant to be followed by Member States without the proper democratic involvement of both national and European Parliaments. That democratic deficit needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the economic situation. Today, we have voted on the so-called ‘two-pack’, but we have still not made any progress in recognising the importance of public investment as a key part of national budgetary policies. Public investment is now to be increasingly addressed, as you have said, through European instruments, for example, through an increased role for the EIB and the pilot project on project bonds.</p>
<p class="contents">But these instruments will not be enough to solve the growing public investment deficit across the Member States. Public investment is at least 1% of GDP too low now, and that will not be made up via these instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to provide solid estimates of public investment needs between now and 2020, taking account of existing policy objectives. It then needs to indicate as precisely as possible how those needs are to be met. Only then will we be able to assess whether the proposed instrument will address the public investment deficit or whether, as we believe, we need to go further. We believe that we need to address that deficit systematically within the rules on economic governance through a new growth regulation. Only in that way will we find a sensible balance between austerity and growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The new legislation in force on economic governance, reinforced today with the voting of the ‘two-pack’ in Parliament, has given new tools to the Commission to ensure that Member States choose the right part of a growth-friendly fiscal consolidation, but also stick to their country-specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Liberal, I truly believe that reforms of our economy and social system, such as labour market reforms and pension reforms, should be at the heart of regaining competitiveness in the eurozone. But unfortunately, in the past months, we have seen that some Member States have overly contradicted the country-specific recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us take the example of France. It has stated that it will undo the pension reforms and lower the retirement age. This is completely against the spirit of the recommendations given to France to ensure that all workers stay in employment longer.</p>
<p class="contents">Also in my own country, Belgium, wage setting hampers regaining competitiveness, but socialist members of governments have openly said that they will not address this problem. This is a perfect example of how countries choose not to show solidarity with other countries within the eurozone. As long as Member States keep looking to other Member States to enlarge the competitiveness of the Union and are not able or willing to implement or reform in their own country, the fundamental economic crisis in Europe will not end.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure that Member States finally take ownership of the European Semester and implement the structural reforms needed. We must ensure that, instead of blaming the European Union for everything that goes wrong, Member States are made responsible and more accountable for their policies. The Commission will have to ensure that Member States put into practice what they preach, but how will it make sure that Member States within the Council show the necessary solidarity with each other and commit to the fiscal consolidation and structural reforms as requested through the European Semester or enable the European Union to be the frontrunner in attracting private investment to regain competitiveness and growth? True solidarity implies responsibility from all Member States. Member States should stop hiding behind Europe, but instead use the full potential that Europe has to get out of this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unless we succeed in aligning our economic policy guidelines more closely, the euro will come to a sticky end. That is why it is so interesting to see what the reality test looks like now, one year on.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the reality test looks very varied. There are countries like Bulgaria, a true model pupil when it comes to implementing the recommendation, which scarcely anyone would likely have expected. And there are other countries like Slovenia, Slovakia, Malta and Spain, which have so far implemented almost nothing. Overall, the results are rather mixed. Turning to my own country, Germany, which is currently regarded as the model pupil, I can only say, as regards the recommendations of the Commission: Hats off, you have really put your finger on some of the sore points of German economic policy! You say that the low paid should be taxed less and be less burdened with social contributions. You say that we should levy ecological taxes more and burden the low paid less. And you also say we should dismantle some excessive professional regulation. I can only say that you are right. And you also say that the education system in Germany offers too few chances to those who do not come from strong parental homes. You are absolutely right. If I look at implementation in Germany, I would have to say that, in fact, nothing at all has happened in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that, as regards the assessment of the European Semester by the Commission, one has to look long and hard for it, makes me a little suspicious. One can find the assessment in working papers, where, under the relevant points, the phrase ‘partially implemented’ is written. However, the ‘partially’ really represents a very small part. One has the feeling that you are really looking for something to justify the ‘partially’.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need two things. First, as regards the test, are the proposals that are not implemented submitted again? The only answer I can give is that, in the case of Germany, that is what you did. Fine, you demonstrated courage. You are also confronting Germany with it. When checking whether implementation took place or not, you hid rather too much behind the small print. I would like to see you have more courage to say clearly who did what and to say it like it is. This enables us citizens, policy makers and the media to really look into the matter and to bring the European Semester project to a successful conclusion.</p>

<p class="contents">My question is this: is this the fault of the population, or is it the fault of the states with their immeasurable corruption, as seen, for example, in connection with the embezzlement of European Union subsidies? What do you suggest to ensure that it is not the people who are subjected to austerity and that it is not the people who have to pay the costs but the governments? Some kind of anti-corruption plan maybe, which could ensure that European Union funds reach their actual targets and do not end up in the pockets of private individuals?

<p class="contents">That there are job openings in Germany is correct. However, most of them are in the low pay sector. We now have 25% of jobs in the low pay sector.

<p class="contents">So, we want to combat speculation. This morning, President Barroso extolled to us the virtues of his solution of creating a European banking union. This, however, actually amounts to a way for the European Union to get its hands on our savings. Banking union will not protect European savers. National governments will lose any powers that they have or want to have over their respective national banking systems, whose contents will be poured into an undifferentiated melting pot of debt.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, banking union is an attempt, and quite a blatant one at that, to ward off insolvency in the Spanish banking system today by using the savings of the other euro area Member States, even poor Italy, harshly enough. It seems, then, to be a preventive strike against the growing support for the real reform that could solve the problem of this bankrupt system: in other words, banking separation or the Glass-Steagall Act. Essentially, this means separating savings banks from investment banks, which is the only way to prevent savings from being used to plug gaps or being lost when the speculators fail.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing the umpteenth attempt to contain a crisis by isolating it, as if the crisis were not affecting the entire euro area. This attempt must be stopped before it is too late. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the summit, they ‘invented’ the European Semester, so to speak. It is perfectly right that members of the Economic and Monetary Union should not simply consider how their policies affect businesses, workers and consumers in their own country. A European perspective is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">An internal market without a coordinated economic, wage and social policy may tempt Member States to create short-term growth and jobs at the expense of neighbouring countries. Such imbalances can cause monetary union to fragment, both economically and politically. That is precisely the situation currently facing the EU. The German economy has cut the ground from under its neighbours’ feet for years. There has been no stimulus from investment and wage growth. Instead, Berlin has brought the euro area to the brink of collapse with a decade of aggressive export policy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore gratifying that the Commission is now slowly wising up to this core problem of the euro crisis in its country-specific recommendations. It is therefore right and proper that the Federal Republic is called upon to invest more in education, research and child care and that the Commission demands that it put a stop to the abuse of so-called ‘mini jobs’ and adapt wage growth to productivity growth. This is a belated but important insight.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Commissioner Rehn, that you will put this demand vehemently to the German Government, even though there is no formal procedure for surplus countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Semester is a very thorough and extensive analysis of the entire European economy. On 30 May, the Commission adopted the global package of its analysis with the country-specific recommendations. It came as no real surprise to us that economic imbalances exist in Spain and Cyprus. However, we can see quite clearly where other Member States still have to do their homework.</p>
<p class="contents">My first conclusion is that the European Semester has survived its baptism of fire. Together with the ‘six-pack’ and the ‘two-pack’, which are on the table, in my opinion, strengthening the coordination of European economic and fiscal policies is well under way. However, this is not praise; rather it has to be taken as a warning. In view of the persistent national debt crises in Europe, there is an urgent need for thought and action that go beyond these measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that the Commission will also take just as firm a line on the way in which Member States are going to implement the recommendations, because what we call the European Semester is basically a continuous process which runs for a year and will be repeated every year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to use my speech also to stress an extremely important point concerning national parliaments: the role of national parliaments in the European Semester. I would like to tell you that this spring, at the initiative of the Danish Presidency, a meeting of national parliaments took place, which also included a debate on their role within the European Semester. I observed then the desire of these national parliaments to be involved in this process. National parliaments now have the opportunity to get involved directly in seeing how governments adopt the measures needed to implement the recommendations made as part of the European Semester. I, too, believe that it is important for us to continue this exchange of experience between national parliaments, at the European Parliament’s initiative, so that they really feel that they are playing a direct, responsible part in this process represented by the European Semester. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to make several comments. The first is that, in these country-specific recommendations that you have just made, we basically believe that the fundamental question that should be settled, were all these recommendations to be implemented, is that of macro-economic imbalances within the Union. When you examine this jigsaw of recommendations, you wonder whether we really do have all the tools we need to correct these macro-economic imbalances, whether, in particular, we can make the management of the euro area as a whole as effective as we would like it to be.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, when I look at the specific recommendations that you have made for France, a country with which I am well acquainted, I am struck by the fact that at no time did you say that these recommendations had been made on the basis of a document submitted to you by a government since defeated in the elections. In this document, you are acting on the results of five years of Presidency by Nicolas Sarkozy. You say that, over five years, France lost 19.4% of its external competitiveness. The French people’s response to that is to say that they would like VAT to be revised, the pension reform to be revised and the minimum wage boosted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you say precisely the opposite in the recommendations that you make to this country. That raises an issue of democracy. Mr Hughes has already said this in the name of my group, but I shall say it again in this particular instance. We shall not succeed collectively if, in the Member States, we feel that there is a diktat drawn up in Brussels which ignores the political realities of our countries. You must answer this question.</p>
<p class="contents">In this Parliament, as you know, we are all in favour of integration, of greater strength together at a European level, because we know that only together shall we be able to recover. However, if you do this against the people, against their political choices, we shall go to the wall. You must answer this question, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an excellent idea to rap the Netherlands on the knuckles for its failure to help women, the disabled, immigrants and the elderly into work, but that message is not loud enough because the semester does not have an audience. It seldom involves NGOs, social partners, or even national parliaments. Therefore, it does not get talked about so much in the press and voters do not take much notice of what the Commission has said when they go to the polls.</p>
<p class="contents">I challenge the Commissioners to carry out a survey among national parliamentarians and to ask them how many of the five 2020 targets they can name. I am prepared to stake a big box of Belgian chocolates that 90% would not be able to name even one. We need to raise the democratic standard of the semester so that Member States define their policies much more in line with the semester, and I am not just talking about goals <span class="italic">and</span> sanctions, but about all the other targets too.</p>

I also believe that this year’s outcome demonstrates visibly how much the adoption of the ‘six-pack’ has contributed to the semester progress, especially through giving more power to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">But I also believe that this is a learning process for all of us and, on the basis of the experience of the two cycles, let me point to one or two challenges, as I see them, that this process is facing.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, one of the issues is certainly the timing factor. I was thinking that maybe further adjustments with regard to the timing factor could be considered by the Commission, for example, better alignment of the timing of the release of the Annual Growth Survey, which targets the entire EU27 family, and the Alert Mechanism Report, which is introduced by the ‘six-pack’ and which targets specific Member States. Perhaps better alignment and sense of timing could increase the efficiency of the process.</p>
<p class="contents">Another area which is also important is linked to the fact that forecasts are never perfect. As the Annual Growth Survey is based on the forecast prepared by the Commission and then there are those budgetary adjustment recommendations, I was wondering whether the Commission has already seen any risks, in terms of the changing reality, that do not fully match the forecasts?</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be interesting, following on from what colleagues have already mentioned, to hear how the Commission sees the proportions between the EU recommendations respected by the Member States and those decisions which are made nationally, irrespective of the recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">My very last comment is that what we have seen this year is a visibly enhanced European Parliament role, where again I think the ‘six-pack’ and the economic dialogue have made the difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the interests of strengthening market forces, lasting fiscal consolidation is now more urgent than it was a year ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I agree with most of the Commission’s analysis, I cannot support it, mainly for two reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what I find to be missing is an analysis of the implications of the austerity measures on people’s welfare. Nor is there any pressure for reform of the labour market with a focus on young people and youth unemployment. This is not only lacking in Slovenia’s assessment, but also in most other assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to include as soon as possible the issue of youth unemployment, as one of the sub-objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, in the European Semester.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as a member of this Parliament, I have virtually no impact on the European Semester process, which is currently used to put pressure on Member States and impose long-term policy prescriptions that clearly violate the subsidiarity principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to open up a political debate on the Commission’s prescriptions; we need to improve the democratic legitimacy of the European Semester and we need to narrow the gap between the European Parliament’s voice and that of the Commission or the Council with an interinstitutional agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I consider it an extraordinarily positive development that we are moving rapidly from the general macro-level towards country-specific recommendations and also towards criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, Commissioner Rehn, I believe that we also need to be careful. The debate we have just had, which Mr Obermayr considered rather country-specific, was, in fact, always in danger of meddling in things that had nothing to do with the European Semester. That is why I believe that we must be careful not to engage at this point in general criticism of specific countries or specific establishments in countries but to quite specifically address issues of economic, budgetary and financial policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that a second point needs to be made. The implementation of what we have achieved in the European internal market <span class="italic">acquis</span> is absolutely crucial and relevant for development in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Rehn, we are going to hold the next debate on this issue straight away. Would it not be helpful, in the context of this assessment of the individual countries through the country-specific recommendations, to raise the issue of the implementation of internal market legislation? Without wishing to give the wrong impression – many other countries are involved, including Germany – I would like to say that Bulgaria, which has just been mentioned, though judged a model pupil on economic issues through the European Semester, needs to catch up, for example, in the implementation of the internal market <span class="italic">acquis</span>. However, Europe can only succeed if we take issues of budgetary policy, financial policy, economic policy and internal market legislation together. I would therefore strongly suggest that we investigate the inclusion of issues relating to the implementation of internal market legislation in the assessment of countries in the context of the country-specific recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dealing with the European Semester involves including all three of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">On the growth issue, I think it is important to stress now that the Commission recommendations cannot just apply to countries with deficits: they must also apply to countries with surpluses too and, if some countries have to squeeze their domestic demand, the others have to free it up.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that, in growth terms, it is essential that the Commission monitor the recommendations of the so-called troika because, when a country enters recession, it cannot carry on squeezing its public investment, its public spending, as if nothing had happened. The troika must revise and adjust its measures in line with results. I want to tell you, Commissioner, that we in Parliament have today agreed on the need to launch immediately an instrument for growth and for anti-cyclical activity to the value of 1% of the European Union’s GDP over 10 years. The second key issue is what is now being called banking union. We in Parliament called for this to be done two years ago in a June 2010 report, but it has yet to be realised. The third issue is that of sovereign debt, which is a precondition for stability in Europe. I also want to say that we have adopted the ‘two-pack’ here today but that we incorporated into it, in addition to austerity, something of the other aspect that has been missing, and that is the immediate setting up of a redemption fund – to use a German term – so that sovereign debt exceeding 60% can be jointly managed. This is a legislative text and we are awaiting the Commission’s support for this initiative by Parliament, so that we can bring under control this horribly threatening spiral that is currently destroying the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential that we carry out better budgetary surveillance. We need better economic governance based on greater responsibility for the rules and procedures that we have agreed together. It is equally important to tighten the control of national economic policies at EU level. The current stage of the crisis requires resolute and courageous responses. Member States must, at long last, consider their economic and fiscal policies to be a matter of our common, European interest. All our experience to date clearly shows that we urgently need to coordinate the introduction and implementation of fiscal measures better and, in particular – I want to stress this, Commissioner – to fight tax fraud and evasion more effectively.

It also advocated cutting unemployment benefit, in a country where unemployment has hit historic levels because of the policies imposed by the European Union and the IMF; in a country where long-term unemployment has increased. Those were the Commission’s recommendations. That is the purpose of this coordination: coordinating the assault on social rights and coordinating the levelling down of Europe’s living and working conditions.

We do not need a Soviet-style planned economy, where we still punish countries that run surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not welcome – and I do not entirely understand the reason for – the Commission’s criticism of tax splitting. The Commission describes tax splitting as inhibiting access to the labour market. In my opinion, however, family tax splitting is an important measure to support families.

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, there is insufficient time to reply to all the questions and comments that are so well justified in themselves, and which you have asked or made in connection with this debate. This is especially the case since, after me, there will be an opportunity for Commissioners Andor and Šemeta to speak on matters that concern them directly. However, this is also a reflection of the fact that we have every reason to continue this dialogue on economic policy, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, for example. On the other hand, I am, of course, ready at any time to return to this House or to this plenary Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Two central questions that were mentioned in this debate were, firstly, that ownership in the Member States is a key issue for the success of this new coordination of economic policy, as, for example, Ms Wortmann-Kool and Mr Hughes pointed out, and, from this point of view, it is worth remembering that the new approach to economic governance and policy coordination has been unanimously adopted by the 27 Member States and the European Parliament. This is a very democratic way of proceeding, as all the Member States and Parliament have together decided and agreed on how the Union’s economic governance should be strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s role in this new system will be to make recommendations on the basis of an economic analysis, and to consider how the Member States need to develop their own economic and financial policies, from the perspective of sustainable growth, competitiveness and employment. This is the approach that we have taken, and it is worth remembering that, within the context of this new system of economic governance, there is an important act, which emphasises the importance of the economic policy dialogue: as a general rule, the Council will be expected to follow and comply with the Commission’s recommendations. If not, the Council will have to explain why it is deviating from the Commission’s recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">This also means the end of the usual political dithering or political trade-offs in the Council, which once led to the erosion of the Stability and Growth Pact, thanks to horse-trading by Germany and France, which Italy, as the country holding the Presidency, supported. That time has now passed and now, by virtue of the reverse qualified majority procedure established with your support, we are in a much better position to ensure that Member States either follow recommendations or have to explain why not, or be otherwise liable for the consequences. In other words, this provides a much stronger European perspective for issues where we need the European point of view because there is so much interdependence among the Member States and the consequences of economic policy, especially bad economic policy, are felt everywhere else in the European Union, particularly within the euro area.</p>
<p class="contents">The other central issue has been to examine the imbalances in the overall economy from the point of view of growth, a subject on which Mr De Backer and Mr Giegold emphatically focused attention. In this connection, I would like to point out that, in our recommendations, we have looked at the European Union as a whole and considered how we can best strengthen the basis for growth through measures taken in countries with either a deficit or a surplus, and, indeed, Europe is now witnessing a very difficult but much needed attempt to balance the books. In countries with a deficit, there is a need to achieve a surplus in the economy, so that they can bring their indebtedness under control and on a downward path. This will inevitably mean that competitiveness will have to strengthen and that levels of employment will have to improve. On the other hand, those countries showing a surplus will also need to make their contribution to the general effort, and, in this respect, it is important that they introduce structural reforms to strengthen domestic demand, thereby providing support for a boost to the European economy generally.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, honourable Members, I wish to thank you for a very professional and serious debate. I want to continue it with you, but now I give the floor to Mr Šemeta and Mr Andor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, we believe that on quite a few issues in employment and social affairs, Germany offers very good models and very good practices. Let me just highlight the importance of dual training and the resulting low level of youth unemployment, and the intensity and quality of the social dialogue, which should also be seen as a model for others. It is true that on some other issues which we highlighted in the document, like rising in-work poverty and the so-called ‘mini jobs’ which threaten the segmentation of the labour market, while this is obviously not yet such a serious issue as in some southern countries, it is an emerging problem with implications for others as well. That is why we believe it is very important to reverse this and act against it. There is also a need to act more forcefully on the gender dimension for creating equal opportunities in the labour market for women.</p>
<p class="contents">Another small nutshell, on pensions. There was a reference to developments in France after the elections. I believe that in some Member States, including France and Italy, very important pension reforms have been designed and implemented, and it is very important to consolidate these reforms. However, we do not judge these developments from the headlines of either the tabloids or the political press, and I need to find out the real implications of the proposed new developments that came out of France. It is about fine-tuning in order to consolidate a reform.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I will have an opportunity to discuss this with the Ministers as early as next week in the EPSCO Council and to see what the real magnitude and implication is of the otherwise very impressive slogans that emerged and probably played a role in recent weeks in the political discussion in France.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to make is that the country-specific recommendations, together with the entire semester, cover a wide range of issues, but they do not cover everything, and many issues including, for example, youth unemployment, cannot be fully covered. We put great emphasis on youth unemployment in the semester and in the country-specific recommendations where this is relevant, but we are taking many actions which are not covered here. They take place outside, and include the very significant reallocation of the ESF or Structural Fund resources. This is, of course, something to which one should pay attention and not just assume that because it is not highlighted again and again in every single document, it will not make an impact.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, about public investment and other forms of investment in physical, but also in human capital: there are certainly references in this document, but I believe it would be very relevant to link the comments we have heard to the discussion on the next MFF, because these need to be long-term commitments and are part of the long-term structural development of the financial architecture of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is fully justified at a time when the road towards a stronger fiscal union would mean, as President Barroso explained this morning, more coordination on taxation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when the consolidation efforts of our Member States go well beyond expenditure, it is important to remember that some ways of increasing revenues are less distortive than others and more pro-growth. Our recommendations in the field of taxation, which go out to all Member States except Finland and Slovenia, are focused largely on five areas which are fundamental to quality tax systems.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we recommend? First, we recommend tax shifts from labour taxation towards more growth-friendly taxation. This recommendation was given to eleven Member States. We also consider that some Member States could put more emphasis on green taxation and make their taxation systems greener. Green taxation is much less harmful to growth than taxes on labour.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recommend to some Member States that they broaden their tax bases and also reduce their debt barriers in corporate and housing taxation. It is very important to take this into account because in some Member States, these taxation barriers actually caused high corporate and household indebtedness, which was one of the causes of the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we recommend our Member States to improve their tax governance, particularly by intensifying their fight against tax fraud and tax evasion. We are currently preparing the proposals which will be submitted to the European Council at the end of this month regarding how we could better address the issue of tax fraud and tax evasion.</p>
<p class="contents">A few more urgent actions are needed at EU level to contribute to the growth and jobs agenda. The first of these is an agreement on the savings directive and a mandate to negotiate with the Swiss. I hope that the European Council at the end of this month will give finance ministers strong guidelines and ambitious timing targets towards an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Then we have to push for progress on FTT and on ETD, which are both on the agenda of next week’s Council meeting. A lot of technical work has been done and it is now up to the Member States, after this Parliament expressed its support, to accept their responsibility and prove that tax coordination can progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
