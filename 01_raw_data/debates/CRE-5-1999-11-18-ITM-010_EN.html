<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution is a clear signal to the international community that, in spite of the fact that news about Timor has disappeared from the major European newspapers and that it is no longer the leading item on the most important European television news broadcasts, the international community and the European Union must continue to be attentive to this problem. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, because abuses of the human dignity and of the human rights of the Timorese who are refugees in other parts of Timor, particularly in West Timor, and who want to return to East Timor are still taking place. The Indonesian authorities must, as a matter of urgency, make humanitarian action possible, particularly on the part of non-governmental organisations. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there must be greater vigilance by the peacekeeping forces at the border so that those Timorese who do have the right to return to West Timor can do so safely. On the other hand, those responsible for the massacres and for the attacks on human life must be punished, not just to ensure that justice is done in Timor, but, indeed, to set an example for other parts of the world where, sadly, attacks on dignity and, above all, on life, which we feel is an inalienable right, still exist and continue to take place. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, our intention is for the Commission and the Council to match the condemnations and political speeches with an appropriate expression of financial and technical support for the process of independence and the reconstruction of East Timor. This is why the Socialist Group supports this resolution and this was what I wanted to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the situation in East Timor we really need to put as much pressure as possible on the Indonesian authorities, because they seem to be turning a blind eye to a lot of what is happening there. The Indonesians must try and halt the militia and their activities in the area. There is also the UNHCR fear that the situation is actually going to worsen. It is not just in East Timor, but also in West Timor where there are still a huge number of refugees – an estimated 250 000 refugees. As regards the international agencies, we have to ensure that the UNHCR's repatriation programme is allowed to continue without any kind of disruption, because there have been a number of incidents in recent times which point to a deliberate attempt to try and disrupt the UNHCR's repatriation programme. It is essential that this programme is allowed to continue. Indonesia itself must facilitate the work of relief agencies and the international forces so as to ensure that peace and stability return to the area.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union, along with the United Nations, all encouraged the East Timorese to exercise their right to vote in the referendum. What happened after that was completely and totally unacceptable, though predictable. In fact it was predicted long before it happened, and action should have been taken much earlier to prevent the atrocities and the murder of innocent people. Unfortunately, a huge number of people lost their lives because of the irresponsible attitude of the international community. Since then, some countries have woken up to the fact that they can no longer stand by idly and watch Indonesia with the support of the militia organisations in that area murdering and chasing the East Timorese out of their country. It is about time that they had the right to independence – it is what they voted for. Member States of the European Union have to support them – not just with words but also financial assistance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In spite of the positive measures that were taken following Parliament’s resolution on September 16 last, specifically the entry of the international peace and security force under the auspices of the UN and INTERFET, the humanitarian safety situation remains serious both in East Timor itself, which it is essential to provide with resources to support reconstruction, and for approximately 250 thousand people forcibly displaced to Indonesia and, particularly, to West Timor. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, it is crucial that the European Union, the Member States and the whole international community maintain firm pressure on the Indonesian authorities so that they disarm and control the so-called “militias” with the utmost urgency and they create the necessary conditions of safety for the refugees to return to East Timor, whose territorial integrity should be respected in its entirety. </p>
<p class="contents">It is equally vital for words to be replaced with action and humanitarian and financial aid to East Timor to actually be provided. The delay in the arrival of the aid promised by the European Union, despite the promises made by the Council and the Commission, is unacceptable. And as approval of the budgetary line for the next few years has been positive, it is vital that the necessary sums be provided for economic and financial support for the reconstruction of East Timor and for its transition to independence. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important to reiterate the fact that the decisions on the East Timor independence process are a matter for its people. This means respecting its sovereignty, so decisions on its present and its future must be taken in close collaboration with the National Council for Timorese Resistance, as it is not for international organisations to replace the people of East Timor but to give them all the necessary support. </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore this is an appeal for all Member States, the institutions of the European Union and the whole international community to keep support for the people of East Timor on the agenda and to take the first steps towards the international recognition of the State of East Timor Lorosae and the respective establishment of diplomatic relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They do not have an easy task. The situation of delay, made worse by the vindictive destruction perpetrated by the Indonesian armed forces, the small size of the territory together with the fact that there is another half to the island, the coexistence with neighbours and powerful interests and the lack of an administration are all factors that contribute to the complexity of the task and show the need for the involvement of the Timorese and the importance of international solidarity. </p>
<p class="contents">The next two years must be won. We must build basic infrastructures, establish bases for production, install an administration where none currently exists and do so taking into account the will and the involvement of the Timorese people. They know what they want and have the right to participate from the outset in their country’s construction. </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to international solidarity, it is clear that the joint assessment mission, coordinated by the World Bank and in which elements of the Commission participated, has finished its work in the area. An estimate of the costs of reconstruction has been made – EUR 250 million over three years – and a conference of donors will be held on 17 December. </p>
<p class="contents">The data that has been made available is very useful for Parliament too. I must point out that after the referendum on August 30 we were already expressing our desire for the European Union to become actively involved in the tasks of reconstruction. In line with this desire, when, at first reading, we took a stand on Budget 2000, we established a specific point of a multiannual nature with EUR 30 million allocated to the reconstruction of East Timor, an amount that should be increased in view of the information provided by the joint assessment mission. </p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to highlight the tragic situation of the 250 thousand refugees outside East Timor: the whereabouts of several dozen thousands of people is not known and many of those we do know about are women and children. The refugee camps are dominated by those militias who, having terrorised East Timor, are continuing to do the same in Indonesian territory. In the meantime, Indonesia is keeping its land borders closed. The situation is intolerable and is affecting a third of East Timor’s population, which has the right to a free and informed choice as to whether they stay in Indonesia or return to East Timor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt at all that there are still many problems, both in the area of humanitarian aid and in that of support for reconstruction, and also because we are still seeing serious violations of human rights, particularly in West Timor, with the activity of the militias which have prevented the refugees from East Timor regrouping and returning to their homes and to their land. </p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons that lead me to agree wholeheartedly with this resolution, and also even to highlight again the need for there to be a specific investigation into who is responsible for the massacres that have taken place and for the appropriate judicial authorities to punish those responsible. I would also like to highlight the proposal that has been made to send a new delegation from the European Parliament to East Timor precisely to verify <span class="italic">in loco</span> how this process of reconstruction is taking place and being handled, and in order to have all the necessary facts to enable us to continue maintaining East Timor as an issue that deserves the unanimous attention of all European Members of Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This may not apply to the political situation – indeed, East Timor’s independence is now being respected – but it very much applies to the humanitarian and judicial situation, for which a solution has not been found in any shape or form. </p>
<p class="contents">Although the UNHCR are making every effort to bring the people back, there is a great deal of opposition. UNAMET are trying their utmost to protect the people but the militia groups are still active. What is really required is a swift international inquiry into the past events, an international tribunal to administer justice and, in particular, to punish the killers. </p>
<p class="contents">What is also required, is aid for the reconstruction. This is needed quickly as the rainy season is on its way. Exactly how much money has the Commission earmarked for this situation? Mr President, as we are on the subject of Indonesia and dramatic events there, could I also receive feedback on what was laid down by resolution in early October, namely that the situation on the Moluccas is also becoming untenable. This area too is having to deal with 70,000 refugees, 500 killed and a judicial system invariably staffed by militia groups. We have asked for help and we have not really had any reaction to this. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Indonesian government appears to be sensitive to international criticism. I therefore welcome the fact that both the Commission and this Parliament are taking action in respect of Indonesia. It would be a good idea for the Commission to pay a visit there to have a look and talk to everyone. I also agree with what has just been said, namely that a delegation of the European Parliament should also go and visit East Timor once again, and maybe the Moluccas too, to gain an insight into the events in these areas. At any rate, this item should not be taken off the agenda for a long while, because the people over there are still going through a very tough time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Within the framework of the United Nations, we must all contribute towards finding an overall solution to this problem, including issues relating to human rights and the establishment of a new state. In this context, I am pleased to see that Mr Sergio Vieira de Mello, the new United Nations coordinator, arrived in East Timor last Tuesday. I feel we can wish him nothing but success in this difficult assignment on behalf of the Commission, for my part, and on behalf of the Parliament and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">You know that the Commission is fully committed to shouldering its responsibilities as regards humanitarian and redevelopment operations. In response to Mrs Maij-Weggen’s question on humanitarian aid, ECHO has to date committed EUR 5 million and there is a further decision concerning EUR 10 million “in the pipeline”, as it were, in order to complete the work we are currently undertaking on the spot. We have responded to international appeals and have currently made commitments up to the equivalent of approximately EUR 8.5 million in food aid. This is not a negligible amount, and we are attempting to measure out this aid to suit the local capacity to absorb it.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority that we give to aid for East Timor will be clearly expressed, and I believe that this complies with your suggestion, Mrs Maij-Weggen, by the visit which Commissioner Nielson is going to be making at the end of the month to both East and West Timor. The Commission will be represented on the spot, at the end of the month, by the Commissioner responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">According to our information, the United Nations is managing the large-scale operations in East Timor efficiently. The repatriation of displaced persons is in progress. As of the day before yesterday, approximately 65,000 of all the persons displaced had returned, and the Indonesian Government gave us assurances that the process of voluntary repatriation would be completed within 100 days.</p>
<p class="contents">Subsequently, it shall, of course, be of the utmost important for the East Timorese themselves to participate in all aspects of the process of redevelopment and development. As you have pointed out, in addition to establishing the foundations of the economy, the emergence of a political power that is up to the task and the development of the necessary institutions will be key elements. After independence, the government will have to determine its foreign policy stance, particularly as regards membership, if appropriate, of the Lomé Convention.</p>
