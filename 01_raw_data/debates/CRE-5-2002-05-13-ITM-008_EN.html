<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ojeda Sanz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to thank the staff for their excellent work and assistance in drawing up this report, and also those responsible in the Commission for their willingness to help on this matter and, above all, I would like to show my appreciation for the impressive desire for dialogue shown by my fellow members in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, which has enabled us to draw up this report with several important proposals that have been reached by consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tempus programme – or, in this specific case, the extension of the scope of the Tempus programme proposed by the Council – should be seen as part of a strategy seeking to bolster dialogue and understanding between the peoples and cultures of the European Union and the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have been asking why we need to extend an existing programme when we could set up a new one. This is a good question, which is easy to answer. If we extend a tried and tested programme, and we manage to avoid the usual problems inherent in getting a new programme off the ground, we can draw on the experience and know-how of Tempus, incorporating the improvements that have been made to it over time and which will no doubt encourage rapid diversification in the range of university studies available as well as cooperation between Euro-Mediterranean partners.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are all aware, the Tempus programme takes its inspiration from the chain of events that have taken place since the fall of the Berlin wall in 1989. This programme was set up in 1990 to meet the need to reform higher education in the Central and Eastern European countries while also encouraging Europe-wide mobility in university studies. The programme was financed by the PHARE budgetary framework. In 1993 it was extended to include the New Independent States such as Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, the Republic of Moldova and the Russian Federation, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">The second phase of this trans-European cooperation scheme for higher education affected a total of thirteen partner countries for a four-year period and since 1997 the Central and Eastern European countries preparing for accession have gradually been abandoning the Tempus programme to take part in Socrates, the Community’s general education programme. However, the Council decision was amended to extend the life of Tempus II for a further two years. This decision laid down that the Commission should undertake an assessment to consider the programming of Tempus.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now proposing to open up Tempus III to the Mediterranean partners in order to meet the needs in that region for cooperation in the sphere of higher education. The Tempus programme will thus encompass the following partners: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Syria, and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of cooperation in the sphere of education is to strengthen the organisational machinery that will enable universities to continue their cooperation beyond the life and scope of the assistance granted under cooperation programmes. In this way we shall place the EC institutions and institutions in partner countries and territories in a better position to develop and consolidate partnerships that could in turn generate a multiplier effect beyond the participating institutions and have a lasting impact on education systems, which is basically what we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, and this is important, by widening the range of participants beyond the traditional academic community to secure the involvement of political leaders and civil society in general, we shall be encouraging a kind of cooperation in higher education that could play a key role in changing attitudes by affording an opportunity for the young generations to compare their respective values and national cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">The intention is to combine purely academic matters with moves to strengthen the working of civil society in Mediterranean partner countries and to help promote better understanding of the different cultures and respect for human rights and minorities in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Various assessments have shown that the Tempus programme is perceived as an invaluable means of fostering mutual understanding. That is the goal on which participants must focus when they plan their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the main amendments to the Tempus programme for Mediterranean partners that we fully support in this report. There are no significant amendments to the rest of the programme. Therefore, I would emphasise the main objectives of the Tempus programme as follows: to pave the way for the development of higher education, to respond more effectively to the socio-economic and cultural needs of the eligible countries, and to promote cross-cultural understanding, <span class="italic">rapprochement</span>, and the development of flourishing, free civil societies.</p>
<p class="contents">These aims are to be achieved by means of Joint European Projects (JEPs), which constitute the most important inter-university cooperation arrangements under the Tempus programme. As well as JEPs, the programme provides grants to teachers and researchers, amongst others, for a variety of complementary activities designed to further the overall objectives of the programme.</p>
<p class="contents">In this report our intention was to highlight the need for the Tempus programme to be extended much further than the university community, so that this, which will of course continue to be its central pivot, will contribute to the transformation of civil society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Great challenges and great opportunities are united here; I believe that the programme needs to have its funding increased in order to meet them.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also particular considerations to be borne in mind when extending Tempus III to the partner countries around the Mediterranean, specifically in matters concerning policies on women and the opportunities open to them. In the countries south of the Mediterranean, there are still very few women who have received higher or university education, especially in rural areas. The reform and development of higher education structures associated with Tempus III is primarily, or among other things, to be seen as an opportunity for women. In Jordan, which along with Malta and Cyprus, sets an example in the Mediterranean region, the proportion of women in higher education is already over 50%, but that on the teaching staff of universities and colleges, and in decision-making positions in them is still very small, making the picture there similar to that in the European Union as far as the presence of women in leading positions in universities and colleges is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">One very ambitious objective is to highlight common cultural values through cooperation in higher education. Respect for other cultural values is of course very much worth striving for. It is further enriched by the fact that political decision-makers – and let me say, with reference to the error in the German translation, that ‘political decision-makers’ is the expression to use rather than ‘political representatives’ – are being included here as a second grouping with academic and civil society. I really would like to underline that, as it is very often said that it is political decision-makers that should have co-decision in these matters, and that is why the translation error needs to be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">It would also be encouraging if a ‘think tank’ could be created, consisting of members of NGOs, educators, administrators, and academics together with citizens from the participating countries. The involvement of the widest possible range of<span class="italic"> </span>fora is intended to create a local dimension in addition to the supranational and national ones, in order to make it possible to consider citizens' needs at an earlier stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the most important thing is that we can get many problems out of the way through our ability to regain, over and over again, the sympathy of our fellow-citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is evidence of Parliament’s firm support for the Commission’s proposal to extend the Tempus programme to the MEDA partners and is in line with the policy of supporting closer cooperation with this region that was adopted in the conclusions of the Euro-Mediterranean ministerial conference held in Barcelona and the recent conference in Valencia. The extension of the Tempus programme to the MEDA partners also forms part of our ongoing cooperation in the field of higher education, between the Community and other regions of the world. This cooperation, which I undertook to strengthen, is all the more necessary since we are facing an increase in various forms of radicalism and intolerance, which points to a lack of dialogue and understanding between cultures. And as Mrs Prets stated so well, equal treatment for men and women is obviously part of such a dialogue. Article 5 of the decision on Tempus III also provides for equal opportunities. We have further strengthened this approach in the new text. The current proposal therefore aims to extend the programme to the following Mediterranean partners: Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Authority, Syria and Lebanon.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur quite rightly said, the Commission has only amended the decision on Tempus where this was essential for technical reasons. The only amendments of substance that have been added are: a specific objective alluding to developing democratic civil societies, the possibility of including researchers in order to build bridges with research and the duration of the Tempus III programme has been extended to 31 December 2006, in order to bring it into line with that of programmes such as Socrates and Leonardo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares the desire of Parliament and the Council to adopt the decision in the shortest possible timeframe. This is why the Commission, although it supports the spirit of Parliament’s amendments, is unable to accept them: such a modification, Mr President, would delay the proposal’s adoption. I would, however, like to reassure the rapporteur that I will take into account Parliament’s wishes and amendments when the programme is implemented. I think that this is what is most important.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme will be implemented within the framework of existing actions according to the specific needs of each partner. We will therefore launch a dialogue with the appropriate authorities as soon as the decision is adopted. I know that the authorities of the MEDA partners are eagerly awaiting the Commission’s next steps. Do not make them wait any longer than is necessary and let us put into practice this policy that everyone wants. I would like to thank you for your support and I would ask Parliament, when it sends a parliamentary delegation to one of these new Tempus countries, to stress our new university cooperation policy. I am sure that the positive effects of this will be felt in both the short- and long-term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
