Unlike the previous dossier, this is a first reading, but we provisionally have informal agreement in trialogue, which will mean that there is first-reading agreement, assuming colleagues support it in the vote tomorrow. Colleagues may differ as to whether the trialogue text is an improvement on the original report, but at least there is a trialogue agreement and history will be the best judge of that.

They invigorate the social dialogue between management and workers in more than 820 companies. They make it possible for almost 15 million workers to be informed and consulted not only at a local level but also at a European and even a global level. They make it possible to link up the economic and social aspects of companies operating at a pan-European level. We can be proud of what has been achieved since the directive was passed fifteen years ago. The old directive, however, is no longer up to the job and we now have justifiably higher demands.</p>
<p class="contents">In July, therefore, the Commission proposed a thorough overhaul of the legal framework for European works councils. The aim is to increase their numbers and their effectiveness, to reinforce legal certainty and to improve coordination of consultations at domestic and European levels, especially in the area of restructuring. The Commission has therefore proposed clearer definitions of the concepts of ‘workers’ information’ and ‘workers’ consultation’ and a clarification of how these activities correlate at various levels. It has also proposed recognition of the role of the social partners in setting up new European works councils and in making it possible for existing works councils to adapt and survive. It has proposed a clearer definition of the opportunities for coordination and consultation between councils that have been set up as a matter of course. Last but not least, it has proposed a clearer definition of the roles of members of European works councils, especially in the area of passing on information to workers and training opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">This summer, at the instigation of the French Presidency, the European social partners, employers and trade union organisations agreed on a joint position in which they accepted the Commission’s proposal as the basis for discussions. They put forward a number of amendments to the proposal, the aim of which is mainly to clarify the definitions of ‘inform’ and ‘consult’ and to establish a two-year period during which it will be possible to set up new European works councils or to renew existing ones without having to apply new rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always supported dialogue between the social partners and it has therefore welcomed this initiative. The Commission welcomes the constructive approach of Parliament and the Council, thanks to which they have come to a reliable and equitable solution based on a set of measures created through the proposal from the Commission and the joint position of the social partners. In seeking a solution the Commission has cooperated actively with both organisations. The compromise reached by Parliament and the Council defines more clearly the supra-national powers of the European works councils and the sanctions, while not introducing a minimum number of participating workers. This compromise retains the essence of the Commission’s proposal. The Commission can therefore support the compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The stakes are therefore high, and we should all approach this debate fully appreciating what our responsibilities are. As you know, the proposal for a directive that we are debating this evening recasts the 1994 Directive on European Works Councils.</p>
<p class="contents">The text being submitted to the European Parliament is the result of a collective effort, which involved all the stakeholders across Europe. I am of course thinking of the Commission, which submitted a proposal for a recast on 2 July 2008; I am also thinking of the European social partners, who, in summer 2008, submitted eight joint proposals within the framework of a joint opinion; and I am obviously thinking of the European Parliament and the rapporteur it appointed to draft this text, Mr Bushill-Matthews, whom I thank for the quality of his work. They all worked with the Council Presidency to arrive without delay at a text that is acceptable to everyone. The result of these collective efforts is that we are in a position, this evening, to adopt at first reading the proposal recasting this 1994 Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am aware, it has been a long time since a situation such as this occurred in the social sphere. This is encouraging for the future; this encourages us to continue to work together in a collective spirit. The text being submitted to you this evening is a balanced compromise that will enable the social dialogue within European businesses to be enhanced and new guarantees to be given to the workers of the 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">With this text we are enhancing the prerogatives of the European Works Councils by adopting, in particular, a long-awaited new definition of consultation and information.</p>
<p class="contents">With this text we are encouraging the setting-up of new European Works Councils since, just as in 1994, we are opening a two-year window during which the agreements concluded will be able to derogate from the new provisions of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with this text we are increasing the legal certainty of workers and businesses by removing any uncertainties that may have had serious consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also with this objective of legal certainty in mind that the text being submitted to you safeguards the agreements concluded during the previous window, which was opened between 1994 and 1996, after the entry into force of the current directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Today the compromise on which all the actors concerned have worked is being put to the vote within the European Parliament, and it is important that it be a vote in favour. This is important, because the current crisis conditions expose businesses to an increased risk of restructuring and, under these circumstances, European workers expect us to provide them with additional guarantees, guarantees that will reassure them with regard to their future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important that it be a vote in favour because the people of Europe need powerful messages that show that social Europe is getting off the ground again in 2008 and that it is not about talk, that it is capable of concrete action that will improve their everyday lives.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is important that it be a vote in favour because social dialogue must be encouraged in Europe, and this hinges on the implementation of new works councils and the development of joint actions undertaken by the European social partners as a whole, as has been the case in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At first sight, this could be said with regard to the outcome of all the negotiations on the recasting of the European Works Council Directive. Based on the Menrad report, adopted in this House six years ago, on the jurisprudence and on the experiences of management and labour in the last 12 years, the PSE Group has always asked for an ambitious revision of the Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many workers’ representatives are still deprived of the basic information and consultation rights as their employer refuses to grant them these rights. In our view, however, these rights are an integral part of the modelling of all industrial relations. The position of the worker as the stable stakeholder who stays in the company – compared to the job-hopping of management and the uncommitted attitude of the new type of financial investor – has to be reflected in the corporate governance of our companies. With the advice of the social partners incorporated in the directive and the additional modifications reached during our negotiations, the PSE hopes to deliver some building blocks for a new dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">The formal political procedure is almost finalised. It is now up to management and labour to act. Compliance with the directive, currently some 40%, is still much too low. The PSE is of the opinion that this is not the end of the story; it is a new beginning. The European social partners have the enormous challenge of convincing those companies that still refuse to comply with the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We urge the European Commission to contribute to this task. A new campaign is needed. Recent research has demonstrated that companies with adequate information, consultation and participation of workers function better, especially in hard times. The economic crisis and the restructurings that we have to face in the near future make workers’ involvement in the decision-making process of our companies more topical than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank my opponent, Mr Bushill-Matthews, for the professional chairing of the negotiations, my colleagues from the other groups for their political assistance and the French presidency for their sophisticated approach. Let us go to work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also proves that, in this emerging social Europe, social dialogue has found its bearings.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, everyone knows that this text is the result, first and foremost, of productive work between the trade unions and the employers’ organisations. The current directive had obviously reached its limits since, 14 years after its adoption, councils had been set up in only one third of the businesses concerned, and legal uncertainty meant that the Court of Justice had to intervene on several occasions. However it is not for judges to set the rules, but for politicians to assume their responsibilities. Moreover, the current circumstances are a harsh reminder of the ever-more crucial need to consult works councils, and to do so as far upstream as possible in the case of restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we have to move forward and endorse the agreement at first reading, after having thanked the rapporteur for the quality of his work and his listening skills. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In order to prevent such a situation from recurring, it is a matter of urgency – and I would stress this urgency – for the amended European Works Council Directive, with its new definition of transnational undertakings, to be brought into force. It is very sad that the Commission has taken so many years to do this and has boycotted this compromise until now.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows yet again that social Europe is at the bottom of the Commission’s agenda. If the amendments had been in place earlier, a case like that of Nokia would not have happened.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments are urgently needed to make up for the previous failure to act and they are actually overdue if we consider the new structures of undertakings which traverse national boundaries and the actions of these undertakings. My joy over the compromise is contained. Nevertheless, as part of Parliament’s negotiating committee I stand in favour of this compromise, as we need this directive now.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal once more to all of you who are now trying to unravel this compromise again. You are playing with fire. It would mean that we would be forever at the negotiating table and that a case like Nokia would happen again. It is therefore necessary to actually bring into force this minimal claim to democracy that we now have in the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">From a political point of view, the revision of the directive still remains on the agenda. Once again I would say to the Commission that what we have here is an adjustment. The revision is still to be done, and we are of the opinion that we need a proper revision, which as such will then give the Works Council what it actually needs for its long-term work. What we have now is merely an adjustment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has resulted in a recast procedure – too little for a rapidly changing industrial landscape. It naturally requires an improvement in information and consultation as tools for creating a conflict-reducing business culture. This is essential. Transnational decisions belong in the advisory committee of the European Works Council. The implementation of this inherently toothless directive must be legally strengthened and this should be linked to sanctions in order to ensure that it is possible to implement the directive. This must happen so that the judgments of the ECJ will no longer simply be ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite a small amount of progress being made, a revision will be necessary in no more than three years. We could, and should, have done this now, in order to some degree to match the industrial political reality and this rapid state of change.

Though the amendments voted through committee were not what he wanted – in fact he wanted no amendments – he nevertheless defended the committee position in the negotiations which led to this first-reading agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks also to Mr Cremers, our shadow rapporteur, who was the real architect of the content of the agreement. The three additions to the points agreed by the social partners in their advice note – on sanctions, on transnationality and the removal of the threshold for the special negotiating body – are important in themselves, but many of us, as has been said, still feel cheated by this recasting.</p>
<p class="contents">We were promised a full revision of the directive almost 10 years ago. Other serious deficiencies need to be addressed, and we insist that the Commission should bring forward that full revision during the next mandate.</p>
<p class="contents">Another serious concern about the handling of this recasting was the crossover between the social dialogue and legislative tracks. The social partners were consulted in accordance with Article 139 and eventually signalled their inability or unwillingness to negotiate a framework agreement. But just as we began our legislative work, they did signal that they would like to open negotiations. They then agreed an advice note, which has no standing at all in the Treaties, but that gave our rapporteur, Mr Bushill-Matthews, the opportunity to pretend to be conciliatory by accepting the content of the note, but nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than acting as a spur to our work, that advice note almost became a straitjacket. The Article 139 and 138 procedures need to be kept clearly separated. It is wrong if either undermines or constrains the other, and it is the job of the Commission to ensure that separation. Even as we speak, a similar crossover is being allowed to derail a legislative amendment we have been calling for to address the problem of needle-stick injuries.</p>
<p class="contents">I repeat, this is dangerous and can only lead to resentment and distrust between the social partners and Parliament. Nevertheless, this is a step forward in terms of information and consultation rights for workers, and I welcome it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also enabled productivity to be increased whilst retaining social harmony.</p>
<p class="contents">Following several decades of experience, the social partners have now identified ways in which the Directive could be recast and made more specific. The role of Members of Works Councils in the process of informing and consulting with the workforce ought to be laid down more clearly. An understanding between the social partners, and negotiations based on good faith and reliable information are highly desirable, especially at times of crisis. The value of social dialogue, of reaching solutions through discussion and negotiation, and of an awareness of the good and interests of the other party all point to the need to respect the results of this dialogue. Acceptance of agreements reached between employers’ organisations and trade unions at European level is therefore called for.</p>

<p class="contents">My view is that we would have achieved a first-reading agreement even if we had not gone through this particular process. Since Stephen Hughes has chosen to give a rather distorted version of how this was achieved, I would just like to set the record straight so that posterity will show how we got to where we have. The social partners most certainly asked all of us not to table any amendments, and the trade unions certainly confirmed to me that, as far as they were concerned, the other groups would absolutely respect that. What I did not expect, and what I did not know, was that, whilst they were urging our group not to table any amendments, they were actually urging the Socialists to table amendments. We therefore had a very distorted balance in committee. Had we come to Parliament first, and had all colleagues had the chance to debate the matter, I still think we would have had agreement, but it would have been slightly different.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, let me put colleagues’ minds at rest: I do not propose to unpick the agreement that we have. It is important that there is an agreement and I am confident that it will be adopted tomorrow. However, it is a supreme irony that, on an issue concerning mutual trust between employee and employer, and harmony and cooperation between both sides of industry, one of the social partners should approach the matter in a very different way.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this will be an isolated episode, because social dialogue needs to proceed with trust on both sides. However, on this occasion there has been a backward step in that regard, and one which I hope will never ever happen again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
