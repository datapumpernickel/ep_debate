The Association Agreement with Turkey provides for institutions allowing the Commission to monitor very closely whether Turkey is adopting and implementing Community measures on organised crime and drugs and how it is doing so. Negotiations are also currently taking place for observer status for Turkey in the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. I think Turkey will be given that observer status next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Work will begin on 1 January 2004 under a partnership arrangement to set up a national contact point for the European Information Network on Drugs and Drug Addiction and to encourage the development and implementation of a national strategy on drugs. The Commission also believes that a small Dublin Group should be set up in Ankara as quickly as possible. I am pleased to be able to tell you that Turkey has made and is making great efforts to prevent drug trafficking. Turkey is actively involved in international measures to prevent the channelling of heroin from Afghanistan into the European Union. By the very nature of things, honourable Member, I cannot tell you anything about the nature of those measures here, because some of them involve operations by the secret services. I can only say that the information available to the Commission shows that Turkey is cooperating fully and that the undertone in your question is unjustified.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2002, the Turkish authorities seized 2 124 kg of heroin. That was less than in previous years. The reason for this is that the international drug traffickers have changed their routes as a result of the strict controls in Turkey. In 2003, the Turkish customs introduced the latest systems at three border crossings, allowing vehicles passing through those crossings to be checked by scanners. This has resulted in the discovery of large quantities of smuggled drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to international cooperation, the Turkish customs authorities hold monthly meetings with drugs liaison officers who are sent to Turkey. It goes without saying that in its cooperation with Turkey the Commission presses for full compliance with all agreements and provisions relating to the fight against drugs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In cooperation with third countries who do not belong to this Dublin Group, this group deploys ‘mini Dublin Groups’ with a regional coverage, so a mini Dublin Group in Ankara would mean that the members of the Dublin Group and Turkey cooperate in these matters in Turkey itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission believes that the established practice of action on a case by case basis, which now goes back several years, provides sound guidance as to when and to what extent the competition rules apply. The international sporting bodies that are primarily responsible for regulating sport are generally aware of these rules in any case.</p>
<p class="contents">The competition rules of the EC Treaty apply only for economic activities in connection with sport; they do not of course apply for genuine sporting activities. There are borderline cases and there may also be borderline cases where it is hard to make the distinction between economic and non-economic activities. But those problems are best dealt with on a case by case basis because account can then be taken of the particular nature of the sport in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission can in fact well imagine special attention being paid to sport in the proposed constitution. However, if I rightly understand the discussion that has taken place about it in the Convention and in public, the issue is not so much the question of the application of competition rules but rather whether the European institutions can also be given a ‘soft’ competence in the realm of sport.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming back to the issue of competition policy, the Commission does not for the future rule out a definition that would then be embodied in a communication. But for the present I can only repeat our position that we believe it is better for all concerned that doubtful cases should be decided as they arise in the light of decisions already taken. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I can inform you that the question of human rights and thus of respect for and protection of minorities have been key elements for the opening of accession negotiations since the introduction of the accession process by the Copenhagen European Council over 10 years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say again expressly here that fulfilment of the Copenhagen political criteria is a prerequisite for the commencement and conclusion of negotiations with applicant countries, and we define this as meaning that applicants must be fully developed democracies, that the rule of law must be fully developed, that human rights must be fully respected and minorities must be protected in accordance with the European standard for minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has always followed developments affecting minorities in all applicant countries closely for the pre-accession strategies and the Europe agreements. The regular reports on progress in the applicant countries have dealt with this question in detail every year, and they have not only reported on improvements and advances, but have also, as you know, always been very clear about shortcomings. All this has been possible because we have been and are in permanent contact with the parties involved in the process, including the representatives of ethnic groups and minorities. Apart from the Commission services’ regular contacts through EU delegations visiting a country or administrative centre, the Commission has sponsored or taken part in many committees and seminars on various questions affecting minorities. These contacts will continue to be cultivated in the months ahead even after accession. I would like to assure you that the Commission has always cultivated close contacts with minorities and their representatives or the relevant non-governmental organisations in Europe and will naturally continue to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite by chance, I met with the representatives of the German minority in Poland in Wroclaw only a few days ago. So if there should be any concerns I am ready to do so. After 1 May – after accession – the commissioners will be responsible for the areas of <span class="italic">acquis</span> falling within their portfolios. So in the matter of the protection of minorities I think my colleague Mr Vittorino will be taking over after 1 May 2004 and if I know him he will certainly be very committed to seeing that the rights of minorities are safeguarded everywhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Social workers and organisations monitoring the Czech Republic have raised the alarm over the large-scale sex trade in the border region between the Czech Republic and Germany.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Honourable Member, this is a particularly serious and painful topic and, as you know, the Commission has been intensively concerned with it for years. I would like to make one preliminary remark. My personal strategy in this connection has always been that one must be very careful about dramatic insinuations or dramatic accusations. And I have to note to my horror – I have to say I really am horrified – that the publications of some non-governmental organisations, which are made with the best of intentions and draw attention to serious problems, have resulted in dramatic and sensational reporting in the media, especially in those countries bordering on the Czech Republic, with dire consequences. They have resulted in a flood of sex tourists, who now go to these border areas because they have seen on television that children are reportedly offered for prostitution there, and they are now asking for children. And I am very concerned that this sensational reporting is creating a demand for which, ultimately, a supply will be forthcoming even if there was no supply at all before. We must therefore be extremely cautious and extremely sensitive when dealing with this question. I am sure you agree with me.</p>
<p class="contents">This problem is not simply a question that lies within the sole competence of the Czech authorities and has nothing to do with us; it is a problem that belongs in the realm of police and judicial cooperation and, I am firmly convinced, also in the area of respect for human rights. The Commission has repeatedly urged the Czech authorities to take the necessary action in the light of this.</p>
<p class="contents">In the 2002 progress report, the Commission notes that the Czech Government has taken important steps to combat the trade in human beings. These included in particular improving the legal framework with an amendment to the penal code in 2002. That change in the law widened the definition of trade and also extended it to children. An accelerated amendment to the code of criminal procedure has also ensured that proceedings in child abuse cases are simplified and speeded up. Back in the year 2000, the Czech Government adopted a national plan to combat the commercial sexual abuse of children and in 2003 a wide-ranging national plan to combat the trade in human beings for purposes of sexual exploitation. The implementation of these plans is kept under constant review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has come to the conclusion that the situation in the Czech Republic, especially along the borders between the Czech Republic and Germany and between the Czech Republic and Austria, continues to give cause for concern. In the light of the most recent reports from non-governmental organisations, the Commission is encouraging the Czech authorities to take further steps. The Czech authorities are responsible for taking all necessary measures to prevent the trade in human beings and child prostitution.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the most important thing at the moment is to use effective surveillance to gain an overview of the actual situation. That would also make it easier to track down and prosecute offenders. This will require quite close cooperation between the competent police forces, both internally and across the borders. I must particularly emphasise this cross-border aspect because, as I am sure you know, honourable Member, the clients do not come from the Czech Republic. The clients come from neighbouring countries that have been members of the European Union for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in close contact with both the Czech and the German and Austrian authorities in order to obtain precise information about the situation on the spot and to be able to respond to new developments. Regrettably, the financing rules under which we have to operate do not allow direct assistance to be given to the victims of human trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation. But the Commission does make substantial amounts of money available for fighting organised crime and the trade in human beings through the PHARE programme. The Czech Republic has received EUR 5.5 million for this purpose in the last four years. Further assistance will be granted for this purpose after accession from the financial assistance instrument known as the ‘transitional facility’. In addition, since the year 2000 Czech non-governmental organisations have taken part in five projects under the Community’s Daphne programme with the aim of preventing violence against children, young persons and women, including violence in the form of sexual exploitation. Non-governmental organisations from the Czech Republic will also be able to apply for similar funding from the Daphne programme for the years 2004 – 2008. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the voluntary organisations say, there is every cause for feeling very concerned about the trade in women and children in the border region between Germany and the Czech Republic, but also in other parts of Europe. This is a major and common problem which also exists in the regions bordering on the other countries that share a frontier with the present and the enlarged EU but that are not members of the EU. I live in northern Sweden, and we have this problem in the region of the Barents Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Unlike the Commissioner, I do not believe that the media reports cause the trade to increase. I believe, rather, that it is a question of poverty and of the subordination of women. This promotes the trade in women and children. We must work on an extremely broad front. I also believe that legal prostitution promotes the trade in women and children. I therefore want to see those who buy sex criminalised. I think that this would be a sound way of proceeding.</p>
<p class="contents">I hear that the Commission and the Commissioner are taking this issue very seriously, and I think this is important. I also wish to draw attention to the Daphne programme. Does the Commissioner believe that the police in the EU countries and the candidate countries are cooperating sufficiently well in order to get to grips with this large problem? Is there progress when it comes to police cooperation? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think we should not misunderstand one another. I did not say that the media are exaggerating things. I did say that in the specific case of information about the situation in the Czech border areas sensational reporting has resulted in demand for child prostitution becoming really visible. I meant that as an appeal to the media to show a measure of restraint in their reporting. I fully agree with you that it is essentially a problem of the poverty that is a consequence of the transition and that this problem is by no means confined to the Czech Republic but that there are still far worse situations in Europe. I was in Moldova a few days ago, and there the problem is much more shocking in extent and is quite clearly a consequence of the bitter poverty in which the people there live, so the strategy of increasing the chances for economic prosperity for the countries in transition within Europe is quite certainly a right one. The other is better cooperation in the field of police and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Now so far as the specific problem in the Czech Republic is concerned, I can tell you from my contacts with the German and Austrian Governments and also from direct contacts on the spot, with police stations in Bavaria, for example, that our assessment is that cooperation with the Czech police and the Czech judiciary now satisfies the requirements. There were times when this cooperation was not sufficiently developed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the UK, the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children has produced compelling evidence that shows that paedophiles are moving from one Member State of the European Union to another to take advantage of differences in the law. For example, in the UK there is a register for child-sex offenders. We find that people who would not be able to work with children in the UK move to other Member States of the Union in order to take advantage of the lack of such a register.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Caged beds</span></p>
<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware of the continued use of caged beds in four accession countries, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia? This practice involves the locking into caged beds, sometimes for weeks and months at a time, of elderly people with dementia and others of all ages with a mental health or behavioural problem. It is widely seen, both internationally and within the countries concerned, as a human rights abuse and an archaic method of containment and restraint. It is not used in any EU Member States or in any other accession country.</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Commission welcome moves in the four countries to review and reduce the use of caged beds and work with them to agree a timetabled phasing out of all such beds? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sometimes slightly surprised that the Commission is asked questions that give the impression that we are responsible for all possible circumstances in the future Member States, as though we had powers in areas where there is definitely no Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing here with a question where we do not even know what the situation is in the Member States. All the same, we have been able to do something, because the Copenhagen criteria do apply for the future Member States and the Copenhagen criteria help us to take action in such matters. But then we must always treat them as human rights matters. I had to say that first.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the problem of caged beds is concerned, which you raise in your question, the <span class="italic">Mental Disability Advocacy Center, </span>an international organisation for the promotion and protection of the rights of people with mental disabilities, presented a report to the European Parliament on 17 June. You know that, of course. That report points out that caged beds are still used to restrain people with mental disabilities in four accession countries, namely the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia. On the strength of that report’s findings, the Commission immediately contacted the countries concerned in order to investigate the present situation precisely and called on the authorities of the countries concerned to inform the Commission of the existing circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission then received the information requested and it appears that the situation has already improved by comparison with the report simply as a result of the Commission’s enquiry. The Slovenian authorities informed us that caged beds are no longer used in Slovenia. In Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Hungary they are still used in a very few exceptional cases and strict guidelines must be followed. The countries concerned have however conceded that efforts to introduce more modern methods of psychiatric care may for the present be hampered by insufficient staff resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has information that the Slovak Government has taken relevant measures and is at present working on a plan to phase out caged beds. The Czech Government has assured the Commission that it is investigating the matter in detail in order to provide us with more precise information about the occasional use of caged beds. In Hungary the number of caged beds has already fallen steadily. The very few establishments where such beds are used are regularly monitored and ways are being sought that will allow these terrible beds to be abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may make a brief assessment, I think we are faced here with a phenomenon that gives us a glimpse into the sometimes horrifying past of psychiatry and that we really must be shocked at what we see. I am sure we all agree that such methods have no place in modern psychiatry. The Commission will therefore be using every means at its disposal to pursue this matter further and we shall not cease until the last caged bed has vanished from each of these countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no place for caged beds or anything like them in a modern psychiatric service.</p>
<p class="contents">I was astonished by his opening political statement. If he does not know, I can tell him that there are no caged beds in any existing Member State. There are no caged beds in any other accession country apart from these four. They are a legacy of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and so the only other country that could have had them in the past was Austria, and that is no longer the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently spoke at a conference in the senate in Prague when this issue was being debated. One of the speakers was a young man called Michael, a 29-year-old who had been put in one of these caged beds for a week, unable to get out. Not surprisingly his health suffered. They are caged in the sense of there being iron bars or nets. There are safety consequences, because people have died in these beds. As the Commissioner said, it is a human rights issue. That is why it is an accession issue. That is why, when we looked at Slovenia, we incorporated a question about their new mental health legislation in our report of two years ago. That is why I very much welcome the pressure that the Commissioner is putting on these countries. Hungary has already responded; Slovenia is now responding; the Czech Republic not yet; and for Slovakia we wait to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is one that I am happy to answer. I agree with you, Mrs McKenna. I agree with you except on one point: the European Union has never implemented sanctions against Austria. This must be made very clear. It was the Member States, acting as sovereign states, who introduced restrictions on bilateral relations. The EU as such never imposed any sanctions on Austria. Like you, I believe that we cannot allow double standards on human rights in the European Union. This means that if we deal with a matter as a human rights issue, it will be treated as such across the board. Consequently, if we identify human rights abuses relating to psychiatric treatment, we have to address the issue in all Member States, both new and old. Obviously, this can still be done after accession, since the relevant Treaty provisions will remain in force – the provisions that refer to the need to obey and respect the fundamental values on which the European Union is built. There is no doubt that these values include respect for human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elections held last Sunday therefore have to be seen as a political move which will have repercussions that could certainly be significant for us. The Commission’s initial response is that, three days after the elections, there is still potential for achieving a fair, lasting and viable solution to the conflict in Cyprus by 1 May 2004. The Commission continues to urge all parties to use the Annan Plan as a basis for seeking a comprehensive solution to the Cyprus problem.</p>
<p class="contents">As to how this relates to Turkey’s application for membership, the Commission made it clear in the strategy paper published in early November that it does see a political correlation. The Commission also noted that failure to find a solution could seriously impede Turkey’s efforts to join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Last weekend the European Council responded positively to the Commission’s suggestion that the two be linked politically. However, unlike the Commission, the Council did not choose the form of a warning, but rather a reward, indicating that a solution to the Cyprus question would appreciably assist Turkey’s efforts to join the European Union. Of course, the underlying message still remains the same and shows the Turkish Government that not only the Commission but also all 15 Member States together with the 10 incoming States consider the two subjects politically related, without wishing to create a new condition or a new requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead to the next steps, the Commission is willing to contribute anything that will help reach a settlement rapidly and to prepare the measures needed for the speedy adoption of Community law in the northern part of the island.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that, in the event of a solution being found, the Commission has offered to organise an international donor conference in order to find international funds to help correct the economic and social imbalances in the northern part of the island.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to emphasise that the European Union is willing to accommodate the terms of a solution in Community law and the Union has already earmarked EUR 206 million in aid for northern Cyprus to be made available when a settlement has been agreed.</p>
<p class="contents">To close, let me say that I fervently hope that the Turkish Government in Ankara will understand that it is in their own interest and to their advantage to support the current move to resume the discussions on Cyprus and to use the window of opportunity while it is still open. That window of opportunity is limited, but it is still available. However one looks at it, it would be better if Cyprus’ accession on 1 May were agreed on the basis of a political solution to the conflict. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I had a long talk with him. He did not tell me what might be contained in the compromise his government is currently seeking with the Turkish Cypriots. Having spoken to him, however, I had the impression – and he went on to state this publicly, as did Prime Minister Erdogan – that, following the elections in Northern Cyprus, the time may be ripe for relaunching discussions on the basis of the Annan Plan. I hope they will continue to think along these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard Prime Minister Erdogan’s statement, which you also quoted, as a positive signal. I can endorse this statement and say that this election clearly and unequivocally demonstrates the will of genuine Turkish Cypriots, namely those who actually live in Cyprus. It shows that they want both a solution to the conflict based on the UN plan and also to accede to the European Union. It would be wise and appropriate to respect the clear will of the majority of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, on the subject of the election observers and their findings, I can tell you that even before the elections I received regular updates from them regarding what they saw. On several occasions before the elections I publicly highlighted the manipulation of the electoral registers and also asked the Turkish Government to ensure that this was rectified. I have no doubt that the number of voters in this election was in fact artificially inflated, with the intention of manipulating the results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the full session report, you will remember, I asked whether he was saying yes or no, and his answer was no. This ‘no’ does not appear in the full session report, although I recorded it on tape myself. What is more, the full session report repeats the second part of his written reply, distorting the overall sense of the question time.

<p class="contents">Firstly, the situation with regard to acoustic pollution is not the same in all European airports. Some have to confront the negative impact of noise emissions – being located in residential areas and given the density of traffic – circumstances which do not arise in other airports, or to a lesser extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind that the introduction of the prohibition of night flights has repercussions for the economy and employment, we must carefully consider the balance between the various elements, which obliges us to carry out a case-by-case cost-benefit study for each airport, before imposing such a prohibition.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, unilateral measures may isolate Europe from the international aviation network; the night-time closure of all European Union airports may constitute a serious obstacle to the normal functioning of that international network. In many cases, it is inevitable that flights take place at night, particularly inter-continental flights, in view of the existence of different international time zones and types of cargo.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is monitoring noise problems, however, and their impact on citizens living close to airports. The Commission therefore has insisted systematically, within the international context of the ICAO, that decisions should be adopted allowing us to provide solutions to deal with the specific needs of the Union in relation to noise at airports.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of the decision adopted at the thirty-third assembly of the ICAO in 2001, which establishes the framework for introducing restrictions, including those of night flights, the Commission presented a proposed Directive, which was adopted in March 2002. By means of a preliminary analysis and consultation procedure, this Directive allows for the imposition of prohibitions of night flights in Community airports in which it is justified in accordance with objective criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I imagine that you stay in a place where night flights are few and far between, for otherwise your response would be different. Do you realise that if there is no general European ban on night flights, this will result in competition between airports and in competition with a downward effect, where the acceptance of noise will be exchanged for jobs? Do you realise that in that way, you contribute towards an economy where the volume and pace of work increases constantly, to the detriment of the quality of life? The standards of the World Health Organisation are crystal clear: night noise leads to more irritability and to depression. Could I ask you, Commissioner, to review your intervention, and may I invite you to spend an evening, or a night, with me in the northern part of Brussels, so that you can see for yourself what those people have to put up with day and night? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So I would like to ask you, are we going to prohibit trains from passing because they make noise and wake me up? In my case, since you are interested, I must say that I occasionally hear a train and on occasions they have woken me up, because I do not always sleep sufficiently deeply. Mr Staes, I must also tell you that when I bought the house the railway track was already there.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as I have said, we are aware of the problem of noise and international rules have been agreed within the International Civil Aviation Organisation to produce analyses and studies, to consider what solutions are available in order to reduce the acoustic impact in inhabited areas close to airports and to resolve them. It is true that one of the possibilities is to suspend nocturnal flights. That possibility exists and there are several airports in Europe which are doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what you are asking, Mr Staes, is that, as well as suspending flights and in order to continue enjoying that tranquillity, airports should close. But there are airports which do not have these problems, because nobody is living nearby, because they are more isolated, because they have different routes. You are asking, for example, that they should close in the north of Finland in order not to create problems for workers in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Staes, I am not going to propose that. Amongst other things because, if I did, it would be a comparative advantage. And competition in Europe is based on a series of values and one of them is this. And that is not unfair competition. They are quite simply different situations. And if Brussels has problems, it must adapt to these situations and, possibly, suspend night flights, but what you cannot ask is for the suspension of night flights in Athens because there are problems in Brussels. Perhaps UPS flies to Athens. If this is the case, what can I do about it?</p>
<p class="contents">I could give you several examples of comparative advantage of other types. And that is how competition works. I am sorry, Mr Staes, but it will not be me who presents that proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is another story, however. It is a question of seeking routes which reduce impact and, where necessary, to impose obligations on air companies in order to reduce the impact. If necessary, this must go as far as prohibiting flights; I am not saying that flights must not be prohibited. And I do not know whether it will be necessary to prohibit nocturnal flights in Athens as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Population, possible solutions, sound levels, and other issues indicate whether or not nocturnal flights have to be prohibited, but not the fact that they have to be prohibited in Brussels. In other words, we cannot prohibit them in Athens because they have to be prohibited in Brussels. That is what the Commission is not prepared to support.</p>
<p class="contents">What you have said is absolutely right, however. Routes and flight paths are extremely important, as well as ways of taking off and, as you say quite rightly, it is true that sometimes, when trying to save fuel, much more noise is produced than is necessary in normal conditions. This management is the responsibility of the airports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I want to speak, though, as a member of the delegation for relations between the European Union and Switzerland, and we have a problem with night flight restrictions and Zürich airport. What is your view on the way in which flights between southern Germany and Zürich have developed, and how will the legal situation evolve in years to come? The fact is there are numerous complaints, meaning on the one hand that aeroplanes are not supposed to approach over Zürich, while the Germans do not want them either. As a result, at the moment there is a ban on approach routes over southern Germany, which in turn has led to an increased number of flight approaches over the city of Zürich. I would therefore be interested to hear how the European Union, and in particular the Commission, expects this problem to develop in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Opencast coal-mining in the north of León (Valle de Laciana district, Spain)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of the Coal Plan in 1998 has seen the Minero Siderúgica de Ponferrada SA (MSP) company receive millions of euros in subsidies, supposedly to create jobs and establish alternative industries. Five years on, unemployment has soared (over 1500 jobs lost) and no industries have been established to compensate by creating new jobs. The subsidies are supposed to allow MSP to achieve market competitiveness by 2005, and diversify the district’s economy. However, what has actually happened is that the subsidies have been diverted to companies which contribute nothing to the local economy. Virtually all underground mining operations have been closed down, so that a major part of coal production now comes from the opencast Fonfria and Feixolin mines. These two mines, those finished and those which it is intended to open, mean the destruction of the Laciana Valley (an acknowledged World Biosphere Reserve, Special Bird Protection Area and Site of Community Interest). If what is at stake is maintaining a ‘strategic coal reserve’ for emergencies, does the Commission not believe that it would be reasonable to leave easily accessible and exploitable coal seams untouched, the very seams being used for this opencast mining – and maintain the prerequisite underground coal mining for present needs, which is capable of generating employment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Coal companies which receive state aid have always been obliged to pursue economic viability. Furthermore, an important innovation in the new Council Regulation is that the contribution of autochthonous coal to the objective of energy security must be carried out within the framework of sustainable development.

<p class="contents">The growth initiative has also considered that the cross-border Vigo-Oporto line fulfilled the conditions for being included on the so-called ‘quick start list’ for which, as the honourable Members are aware, as well as being part of the trans-European networks, it must have a cross-border component and work on it must begin immediately, that is to say, in the next three years (2004-2006).</p>
<p class="contents">During the period 2000-2006 the Cohesion Fund is financing the Miño line, to the north of Oporto. The decisions relating to the granting of total aid of EUR 87 million for the Nine-Braga-Lousada-Nine lines will be adopted in the coming days. Since 1987, studies on the Galician Atlantic Ferrol-Portuguese border railway line have received Community aid, which in 2003 amounted to a total of almost EUR 6 million. For the period 2004-2006 it is intended to allocate another EUR 5 million to fund studies on this rail axis, in response to a new request from the Spanish authorities. With regard to the Spanish railway line between Ferrol and the Portuguese border, several technical studies have been completed and many are still in the process of being produced.</p>
<p class="contents">Work has already begun to the north of Vigo. According to the information received from the national authorities – Portuguese and Spanish – the Vigo-La Coruña line is expected to enter into service in 2007 and the Vigo-Oporto link in 2009, and the La Coruña-Ferrol line, which would complete the section of the line in Spanish territory, would be ready and operational from 2010. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Implementation of Regulation (EEC) 3577/92</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its appeal concerning the implementation by Greece of Regulation (EEC) 3577/92<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and in particular Article 3, paragraph 2, the Commission states that the right of the host state to regulate the manning of vessels carrying out cabotage is restricted to the deck and engine-room crew.

<p class="contents">Will the Commission say why and by what procedure it changed its position and no longer considers cabin crew and catering personnel as part of the crew covered by Article 3, paragraph 2, of the Regulation? Is it unaware of the safety problems which will be caused by the existence of mixed crews on passenger ships and car ferries, particularly in view of the tragic accidents that have occurred in the European Union, and does it assume responsibility for this? Does it intend to support the principle of the 'host state' particularly with regard to cruise ships? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the request relating to this issue the Commission made no distinction between the rules applicable to deck crew and those applicable to engine-room crew. The rules on crews are applicable to the crew of the ship as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">What the Commission reproaches the Greek state for in relation to this issue is the application of the rules of the host state for cruise ships for which Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 lays down the application of the rules of the flag State.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of the rules on the crew of the host state for island cabotage is intended solely for regular services. Furthermore, in this case as well, the applicable national rules may not contravene the principle of free provision of services. Therefore, any requirement imposed by national legislation with regard to the crew may not introduce restrictions which are not justified by urgent reasons of general interest and the restrictions must be proportionate to the intended objective. Within this context, the Commission would point out that the SOLAS and STCW Conventions – ratified by all the States of the Union – contain rules with regard to crews of ships, the objective of which is precisely safety at sea.</p>
<p class="contents">As it pointed out in its recent communication on the interpretation of Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92, the Commission believes that, with regard to the rules in the field of safety and training, any condition which goes further than the rules contained in those Conventions would constitute a disproportionate restriction of the free provision of services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
