After the French ceased their occupation of the much larger colony formerly known as Indochina, mainly as a result of the war of independence in what is now Vietnam, the Americans, the Russians and the Chinese were ready to bring the smaller new states of Cambodia and Laos into their respective spheres of influence. Each of those superpowers tried to arm their own satellite movements in those states and bring them to power with military support in order thereafter to permanently eliminate all other forces. In a sharp reaction to an irresponsible American intervention, power fell into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, a movement that laboured under the illusion that the destruction of the cities and the intellectuals would mean major progress for the poor farming population. I would remind you that it was this murderous terror regime that the United Nations recognised, rather than the insurgents backed by Vietnam, who wanted to bring it to an end. The then liberators still have a large following among the people, although they still feel distrusted by the outside world.</p>
<p class="contents">On account of its toxic past, Cambodia still finds it virtually impossible to sustain normal coalition governments and a normally functioning parliamentary democracy. The political parties deny each other’s right of existence and would ideally like to annihilate one another for good. This explains how members of the parliamentary opposition can be treated as public enemies and locked up. Since the rich Western nations have in the past made a considerable contribution to this venomous climate, we have the moral duty to help the Cambodians to break free of it. Criticism and condemnation are desperately needed, but also the lesson that things could have been done better than the outside world have demonstrated to the Cambodians in the past. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three of our fellow parliamentarians, Sam Rainsy, Cheam Channy and Chea Poch were subjected to loss of immunity in a particularly brutal way, by means of a show of hands, in a parliamentary session – if it can be called that – held behind closed doors, hidden from the public gaze and without any formal record of the proceedings. Furthermore, one of these parliamentarians was arrested shortly afterwards. These events struck at the heart of democracy itself, at the very nature of parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the targets of this action, Mr Sam Rainsy, the leader of his party in fact, had two days earlier written an article in the Cambodia Daily clearly describing the gravity of the situation in his country. I would like to draw your attention to that situation, ladies and gentlemen. We need to act resolutely in this case. It is not the first time that we have had to highlight the serious nature of the situation in Cambodia, and we should call on the Commission, the Council and on the Member States to be particularly clear about this at the forthcoming meeting on 10 and 11 March.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue will, however, also be dealt with at the next meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Committee which will be taking place in Geneva at the end of this month and continuing into April. A delegation from Parliament will be present at that meeting. It will be incumbent on us to follow all the debates very carefully, because the report of the UN special envoy, Mr Peter Leuprecht, also denounces the very grave situation in that country in the clearest terms. If I may quote the English expression he used, he called the situation in Cambodia ‘a chunky façade of democracy’. That is the extent of the deterioration we are witnessing.</p>
<p class="contents">Cambodia, instead of offering us signs of hope and confidence in the future, is doing just the opposite. The attitude of the regime is hardening and human rights violations are on the increase. I accordingly suggest, ladies and gentlemen, that we should revisit this subject before the summer recess, once the conclusions of the Geneva meetings are available, and if there has been no significant progress in Cambodia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would kindly ask you to forgive me.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sam Rainsy – Sam being, as you know, his surname and Rainsy his first name – and his wife are very good friends of mine, and so I have first-hand experience of the difficulty of the battle that is being fought. To give you an example, Mr Sam Rainsy’s party is entitled ‘Sam Rainsy’ because that is the only name that Hun Sen’s party did not reject. All other names he had tried first had been rejected. This is to give you an idea of that country’s power mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">What is particularly unfortunate, even more unfortunate than the fate of our three colleagues from the Cambodian Parliament, is the fact that, to date, Cambodia has been one of the poorest countries of South-East Asia, with a society characterised by an unusually high level of crime on a daily basis – violence that is politically inspired, criminally inspired, and in respect of which very little is being done.</p>
<p class="contents">What we should not forget either is that despite all fine promises, the Cambodian Government – Mr Hun Sen having, as you know, again become Prime Minister – has not actually made a serious start on bringing to justice those who are most responsible for the mass destruction, the genocide that was committed by the Khmer Rouge, and nor does it seem likely that they will do so in the short term. It therefore goes without saying that we are concerned about the fate of our colleagues, which other members of the opposition could also suffer. I would, however, urge you not to lose sight of the fact that the European Union is Cambodia’s largest donor and that fact alone means that we definitely have levers at our disposal to persuade this awful regime to make changes for the better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In supporting this joint resolution on Cambodia by six groups within this Parliament, I should like to emphasise two points, albeit at the risk of going over ground covered by some of the earlier speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point which I would like to stress today concerns the withdrawal of parliamentary immunity from three members of the Sam Rainsy party. The first of these is Cheam Channy, who has also been imprisoned and is set to be tried by a military tribunal, despite the fact that a Cambodian civilian may not be subjected to military justice. Next there are Chea Po and Sam Rainsy himself, who have both fled Cambodia in order to be able to speak out more effectively on the situation in that country. It is vital that they should be given back their immunity and thus be able to resume their role as elected representatives, a role conferred on them by the electors of Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">We would point out that we received Sam Rainsy here a fortnight ago during the February plenary session, on the occasion of the visit of the ASEAN delegation. At that time, he expressed a desire for some gesture from us. It was therefore incumbent upon us to make that gesture today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like there to be more effective monitoring of the various types of aid provided to Cambodia, as has just been mentioned. It is inconceivable that, according to the United Nations development programmes, over the last ten years the country should have seen deterioration in three of the key development benchmarks, namely the number of persons living below the poverty line, the adult illiteracy rate and the rate of infant mortality. There are fears that aid is not necessarily reaching those for whom it was originally intended and that it does not meet the population’s real needs. Effective monitoring and control of aid is necessary in that country in order to put a stop to this unfortunate tendency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cambodian Government should indicate its good intentions in terms of the effectiveness of measures taken and implemented in the country’s interests and should explain, in particular, the purpose to which European aid has been directed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must bear in mind, as our colleague has just pointed out – and it is important that people are aware of this – that, despite the five billion dollars in international aid received during the last ten years, Cambodia is nonetheless the only country in the world where illiteracy, infant mortality and the number of people living below the poverty line are still on the increase. As the UN and World Bank have emphasised, those exercising political power are misappropriating international aid, the country’s resources, leaving the Cambodian people in a state of abject poverty. The donor countries – including ourselves – share the blame for this situation because there is no control of the true recipients of the aid, and a regime, known for its corruption and authoritarian excesses, is not being called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what can we say about the peasants expropriated for the benefit of a Chinese company which, like other companies, is unscrupulously laying waste to entire hectares of forest? Since 1993, 50% of the Cambodian forest has been destroyed with the complicity of a corrupt government. It is time that the European Union began supporting those really engaged in the fight against corruption and striving to establish the rule of law and compliance with democratic principles, by, for example, making aid conditional upon respect for democracy, human rights and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us force the Cambodian Government to do what is the duty of every democratically elected government, namely to respect and support democrats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He was a frequent visitor here in Strasbourg and an impressive partner to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore all the more terrible that the attempt is now being made to silence the Cambodian Parliament and its great democratic tradition, using intimidation and terror initiated by the Prime Minister. Let me say that Sam Rainsy’s visit a fortnight ago was entirely in the tradition of the visits made by the campaigner for freedom Son San, and that Sam Rainsy deserves our wholehearted support, for without a functioning parliament, all the efforts undertaken in Cambodia by the UN and the international community will have been in vain.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the great deal of money and the efforts by the international community that have been invested in Cambodia, we face the prospect of yet more general wreckage if we do not succeed in putting a stop to its government’s authoritarian tendencies and strengthening the democratic forces and parliamentary life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have always assumed that Cambodia would make gradual progress on the road to democracy, but patience is now, of course, wearing thin. In the past year, the situation in Cambodia has taken a dramatic turn for the worse, the latest low point being the witch hunt against three members of the opposition, including the brave Sam Rainsy who was here two weeks ago. Good though it was to see him here, it would have been better if he had not been here and had simply been able to fulfil his opposition role in Phnom Penh. You need not take my word for it, because in the next few days, the UN envoy to Cambodia, Mr Peter Leuprecht, will be presenting his findings to the United Nations. His conclusion is simply depressing. In his four years as envoy, hardly any progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the Commission and the Member States have now spent a total of EUR 1 billion on the office in Phnom Penh, observation missions during elections, financial support for mine-clearing operations, and suchlike. Should we not conclude that the EU policy has simply failed? We should be able to say so.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the time for compromise is over. If the Cambodian Government does not soon respect the basic principles of democratic rule of law, such as transparency and accountability, we must suspend our support. What is, in any event, called for is a drastic reorientation of our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several years have elapsed since the end of the conflict in Cambodia, but the situation within that country continues to give rise to concern. The House was recently moved to debate violations of human rights in Cambodia along with the unacceptable treatment of women and children that constituted an affront to their human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">The group in power was elected in so-called free elections. It has no concept of a state, and is either unable to engage in dialogue with the opposition or does not wish to do so. Twenty people died during the first local elections alone, and those in power did not allow the opposition access to the media. Many activists are now under arrest. Those who were arrested in the past remain in prison, and no sentence has been passed on them. Obtaining statements by force or through bribery is an everyday event. Corruption is widespread. These are all features of political life in Cambodia and of how the system of justice operates there. The attitude of the Cambodian Ministry for cults and religion is significant. It recently issued an edict banning the missionary activities of Christian churches, which led to anti-Christian protests. Religious discrimination, restrictions on the right of assembly and freedom of speech, threats and intimidation by political leaders all amount to serious infringements of the nation’s and the individual’s right to freedom. We therefore appeal for respect for human rights, an end to persecution and to the intimidation of human rights defenders. We also support the European Parliament’s resolution. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, those in the country who have fought endlessly for justice and reform are once again under severe government-led persecution.

The Commission believes these events could further weaken the opposition and risk jeopardising the continuation of the democratic process in the country. Commission representatives in Brussels have also recently met Mr Rainsy, who briefed them on the recent developments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission strongly supported the issuing of an EU declaration on the subject and I can inform you that the EU declaration was brought to the personal attention of the Prime Minister by the local representative of the EU presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is raising its concern over these issues in its political dialogue with Cambodian authorities, for instance at the EC-Cambodia Joint Committee meeting to be held later this year.

<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to call upon the political leaders in Cambodia to work constructively together to find an appropriate solution to this problem, so as to enable Cambodia to continue its progress on the road to a fully functioning democracy.
