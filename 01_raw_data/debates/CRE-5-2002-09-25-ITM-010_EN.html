Despite that, I would like to answer the question, if only for the record and because other Members present might be interested in the Commission's answer.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin by thanking Members of this Parliament for the interest they have shown in this important issue, namely the exhaustion of trade mark rights, whether internationally or just in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members may know from our previous discussion on this issue which took place almost exactly one year ago – on 2 October 2001 – the Commission undertook to prepare a report to Parliament on this subject by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">As I stated in our previous discussion, I do not intend to reopen the investigation of issues that the Commission has already studied. Moreover, I explained at that meeting last year that the Commission would only reconsider its decision not to propose a change to the current EU exhaustion regime if new developments justified that. To date, there have been no such developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, and as this relates more specifically to the questions raised by the Members of Parliament who drafted the question, I said last year that the Commission would limit itself to investigating cases of possible abuse of trade mark rights, and especially, but not only, competition aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make it clear to Members of this Parliament that the Commission has acted fully in accordance with the commitments I made on 2 October last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add that in July this year, my services sent out questionnaires to over sixty companies and organisations representing many small and medium-sized enterprises, including both parallel traders and trademark holders, who might be at most risk from abusive restrictions on the sale in the Community of trademarked goods.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of this investigation, combined with our ongoing consultations with other Commission services – in particular our colleagues in the Directorate-General for Competition – should allow us to build a clear picture of whether trademark rights are indeed being abused by right holders to stifle legitimate trade. That report, as promised at our previous meeting, will be transmitted to Parliament by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my answer to the question. I shall be most interested to hear what Members have to say about it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The car that was supposed to collect me came half an hour later than arranged. That is why I unfortunately only heard part of your speech. However, I grasped the main points. Commissioner, the committee and indeed Parliament has not raised this matter lightly or for fun, but because we do not believe that the NERA study, on which you are relying, actually provides a solid enough basis on which to make decisions of this kind. In other words, our main premise is that it has been proved, without the need for a NERA study, that these goods – which are everyday items, which every woman and every man buys, in particular those from the poorer sections of the population – for example jeans, shirts, polo shirts, trainers and suchlike, are being offered for sale outside the EU by the same brand manufacturers at the same quality standards for half the price or even less. That is one of the reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is that in our view the purpose of trademark law is not to seal off markets, allowing there to be different price systems inside and outside the EU, especially more expensive prices inside the EU and more reasonable ones outside; rather we are of the opinion that this is a matter for competition and not trademark law. The function of trademark law is to name, describe and unambiguously classify the manufacturer, the brand and the product and to confer certain rights on the trademark holder. These rights are justified and we will do all we can to defend them.</p>
<p class="contents">A completely different, separate issue is, however, that of exhaustion. In Germany, for around 100 years from the advent of trademarks we had international exhaustion. With this system of international exhaustion in place we in Germany achieved the economic miracle, significant growth and much more besides. In the last five years, since European trademark law has come in, we have observed a system of dual pricing, and we have observed that trademark law has become a preferred option for companies because it is far easier to assert your rights under trademark law than it is under other rights procedures, which are actually product-related, such as rights relating to design, patent and copyright; it is more difficult to present your case here. That alone is the reason and trademark law cannot after all be stronger than competition law. That is why we asked these questions. That is why we have asked you in the Commission not to rely on a NERA study but to conduct your own investigations into these specific matters and to answer on that basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally there is another question that has arisen since our past discussions on trademark law: what about trade on the Internet? There is of course nothing wrong with the Internet. We promote it. If someone outside the EU makes a purchase and the dealer dispatches the goods in the EU then this contradicts current trademark law. This cannot be the intention of trademark law either. Once again then we would urgently request the Commission to conduct further investigations into these few points and to inform Parliament of the result, and not to refer to a NERA study which in our view does not address these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is more, I am convinced that the transition from a Community-wide exhaustion of trademarks to an international exhaustion might have negative effects from both an economic and legal perspective. Neither the NERA study nor that carried out by the Economist Intelligence Unit proved that the international exhaustion of rights system has a significant long-term effect on prices for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumer would not benefit from such a change and I have here an article published recently in the <span class="italic">Evening Standard</span> on 4 September, pointing out that Tesco, which is well-known for its support of the international exhaustion of rights system, has not passed on considerable savings made through parallel imports to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, if we wish to adopt international exhaustion, we must amend not only the 1988 Directive, but also the 1993 Regulation establishing the Community trade mark and laying down the rule of Community exhaustion. It would be inconceivable for the international exhaustion to apply to the national trade mark and the Community trade mark to be exempt. A solution of this kind would certainly spell the end of national trade marks which are highly valued by Member States and which are needed by businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, in the frequent cases when a protection throughout EU territory is, in their view, worthless and costly.</p>
<p class="contents">More than ever in a context of heightened globalisation, we must affirm the economic importance of the European Union by integrating the single market and attaching more value to our creativity. Neither the United States nor Japan has adopted international exhaustion of trade marks. If the European Union unilaterally decided to transfer to this legal system, it would introduce distorted competition between the European Union and third countries. Trademark protection is crucial for the European economy and for consumer safety. A trade mark is the guarantee of a product’s authenticity and quality. Furthermore, the current system allows us to better protect ourselves from counterfeiting; since parallel imports pose a major risk as they use the same channels as pirated products and counterfeits.</p>
<p class="contents">A question was raised by Mr Mayer, but I, on the other hand, am thinking about another question which I believe to be crucial: why has the European Union not yet signed the Madrid Protocol, which would enable us to provide an integrated, efficient, global and transparent trademark protection system? I am therefore hoping and praying that the European Union will sign this protocol. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also thank the Commissioner for his reply.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, although the time limit stated in last year’s European Parliament resolution has not come to an end, to monitor it and stay informed, to continue the debate, is our obligation as Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate on the Mayer Report last year, we had the opportunity to witness – as is also happening today, through the previous speakers – the difficulties involved in achieving a broad majority view on this sensitive issue, both in this house and in society.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the problem is not so much with the trade marks directive but with the interpretation contained in the Silhouette judgment on Article 7 of the trade marks directive. Before that judgment, there were countries where, either through legislation – as in Sweden – or through case-law – as in Spain – the principle of the international exhaustion of trade marks was permitted, but following that judgment it was clearly prohibited.</p>
<p class="contents">While it is true that there are many conflicting interests, it is also the case that we must attend to the interests of the consumer and it is unthinkable that European consumers, as a result of an excessive interpretation of trade mark law, which goes beyond the principle that the trade mark is restricted to designating the origin of a product, should not be able to acquire products at lower prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue cannot be resolved, as some reports say, exclusively by applying the Treaty’s competition rules, for the simple reason that the abuse of a dominant position is only applied to those who have a dominant position in a certain significant market, and we all know that, with these types of products protected by a trade mark, it is very unlikely that a trade mark would warrant being classified as dominant.</p>
<p class="contents">So far the Commission – we await these reports which it has requested – has mentioned the Nera Report, which guaranteed that the recognition of international exhaustion would not affect prices beyond 2%. I do not agree with this conclusion and, while personal experience is of little worth, I can give endless examples of how products which in other countries or in my own country, when international exhaustion was allowed, could be sold at significantly lower prices, since the Silhouette judgment can only be found on official distribution networks and at considerably higher prices.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Nera Report, the Commission is undoubtedly aware of the work done by the Swedish competition authority, which reaches radically different conclusions to those of the Nera Report and those maintained today by Mrs Fourtou.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the time has come to invite the Commission to present the report, as the European Parliament previously requested. When it does, I believe we will once again have the opportunity to insist on this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He may remember that I complimented him because he had written an article in a journal complimenting Parliament on rescuing the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is slightly disappointing therefore to find him back here at the following part-session adopting such a cautious approach on such a fundamental single market issue. In this case we are not talking about the single European market. We are talking about global markets and about the freedom of consumers to be able to benefit from lower prices for identical goods that are placed on the market, quite legitimately, outside the European Union, and which are then imported.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to remind him – and he cautiously skirted around this in his answer – that we are discussing an archaic piece of legislation. The Trademarks Directive in its original form was certainly introduced to protect trademarks and to secure consumer confidence that they would know what they were buying. But subsequently, in cases before the Court of Justice, it is now being further elaborated into a means whereby trademark owners can actually protect their brand, or supposedly protect their brand and their authorised distribution systems, by essentially keeping prices higher artificially.</p>
<p class="contents">He asked us quite rightly to say what has changed. I shall tell him what has changed. The first thing is that consumers are getting increasingly irritable about what they see as the failure to act on what ought to be a fundamental right. That consumer pressure was quite rightly cited by his colleague, Mr Monti, when we had a complete and total reform of the legislation relating to the selling and servicing of motor cars. What has that done? It has opened up the distribution system across the European Union. Essentially, cars will be available across borders much more freely than they were before and prices which differ from one market to another will clearly converge.</p>
<p class="contents">So why should this be any different? I have to disagree with my colleague Mrs Fourtou. It is not a question of counterfeiting or other spurious issues. Surely the reason we have so many of these counterfeit brands is because the genuine brands are prevented from being sold at the price that consumers want to buy. It is a circular argument. I hope that in the July report he has commissioned he will have the facts available and that he will be able to meet the deadline of the end of December that we asked him to meet. This needs to happen so that we can come up with a sensible balanced view, not looking to the past, looking at all the evidence, to the benefit of consumers. We need to continue together with the Commissioner the task of creating a true single market for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope he will give us an assurance this evening that he is prepared to move from his overly cautious approach and join with us in the crusade to give consumers across Europe a better deal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – I should like to thank the Members who have spoken on this subject very much for their views.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with Mr Harbour, who has in his usual eloquent manner impressed the Commission with the need to change over to international recognition. In his closing remarks he said that he wants the Commission, and this Commissioner in particular, to see that consumers get the benefits to which he says they are entitled so that there can be a true single market. I should like to tell Mr Harbour that we already have a single market. That market is confined to the European Union. It is not something that appertains to the whole world.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that consumers benefit from lower prices. That is obvious. The Commission is very much in favour of seeing to it that consumers benefit from prices which are as low as possible. However, they are not the only ones involved. It is not just consumers who are interested in this matter. Producers are also involved and, in particular, trademark holders. Just as consumers are entitled to the lowest prices that are economically feasible, so the producers of trademarked goods want and are entitled to get protection for their trademarks – but not unlimited protection. That is the reason behind exhaustion in the European Union. There should certainly be a balance between, on the one hand, the interests of the consumer and, on the other hand, the interests of the producer, and the Commission continues to believe that European exhaustion provides for that balance. The Commission has not changed its mind since we last spoke about this issue 12 months ago.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept Mr Mayer's apologies. He said the studies are of insufficient quality. I do not accept that. I do not understand why the NERA study should be of insufficient quality. The NERA study, as is well known because it is available, states that the changeover from European to international exhaustion would have a negligible effect on prices. Mr Mayer may know that in his country, Germany, there was once a system of international exhaustion. Because of the policy accepted in Germany on account of the European Union, the changeover was made from international exhaustion to European exhaustion. It was then claimed that certain luxury goods producers had to raise their prices, but we then heard from those luxury goods producers that they had in fact lowered their prices. So, in that specific case, international exhaustion did not produce prices any lower than European exhaustion – quite the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mayer may have in mind the studies carried out by the UK and Swedish Governments two years ago. Those studies – interesting as they are – showed that there is a great disparity in prices between the different countries belonging to the European Union. What stuck most in my mind was the 40% difference between electronic goods sold in Sweden and those sold in Germany, which are almost neighbours, apart from the stretch of water between them. A 40% difference in price means that the internal market is not working as it should, because, if it did, prices should be related to objective costs – costs of transport, distribution, etc. But 40% means that other factors come into play. 40% is far and away bigger than any differences in prices that come into play and are discussed in comparisons between international exhaustion and European exhaustion. So I am afraid that the studies of which the Commission is aware – the NERA study was commissioned by the Commission itself – do not support the view that international exhaustion would lead to lower prices, quite apart from the fact that, as I have said before, the rightholders of trademarks are entitled to proper protection, not unlimited protection, but substantial nevertheless.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mrs Fourtou very much for supporting the NERA study. She has cited the United States and Japan. The Commission agrees with her view. As to her question on the Madrid Protocol, I must tell her that this is in the hands of the Council, and the Commission can only wait for the Council to take a positive decision in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, the report will deal with matters of abuse of trademarks. As I have said, the Commission has sent out 60 letters to companies and legal bodies asking for evidence of abuses of trademark rights. The answers should be in by the end of September. We do not have all the answers yet. We shall wait for them to come in. We shall analyse them. They will be included in the report due at the end of December. I should like to confirm that Parliament will indeed receive that report at the end of December.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by stressing that the Commission has an open mind on this issue. Only those who have no ideas never change them. The Commission is full of ideas and has an open mind. It is always willing to reconsider. As I said a year ago, the problem is more a lack of definitive evidence showing that there is an advantage in opting for international exhaustion over European exhaustion. I do not believe that the Commission should change its policy without clear evidence of there being an advantage in doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">With these remarks, I should like to end my response in winding up this debate. Once again, there will be a report at the end of December. I look forward to a further exchange of views with Parliament once that report has been brought to the attention of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
