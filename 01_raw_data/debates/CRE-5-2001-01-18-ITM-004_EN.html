Yet, as far as the major powers which are responsible for the exploitation and oppression of the greater part of the world, and their political representatives, are concerned, references to human rights are, generally speaking, nothing more than hypocritical declarations contradicted by their diplomatic and military action and by those ‘reasons of state’ generally used as a front to conceal the sordid interests of major financial groups that do not care one bit about human beings or their rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report points out that during the 1990s the number of road deaths fell in the European Union by 26%. In Ireland, however, the fall has only been by 13%. We have the third highest accident rate in the European Union and we have the highest fatality rate in the European Union.</p>

It estimated that of the 62 000 young people who sat the leaving certificate examination in June 2000 within eight years 1000 would be dead in unnecessary car accidents. This seems to me to be a grotesque situation and quite simply should not be tolerated by the European Union.

Road safety is indeed a serious area in which we cannot afford to indulge in hypocrisy and hyperbole, which the rapporteur avoids absolutely.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some Members in this House who will take advantage of this issue to demand that the principle of subsidiarity be strengthened, leaving Member States to manage road safety decisions as they wish. I, however, share the rapporteur’s opinion as, while acknowledging the key position of the states in this area, she nonetheless recognises that this is an area where responsibility is shared between Community, national, regional and local authorities. The great disparities between Member States, particularly with regard to speed limits and ‘authorised’ blood alcohol levels, do nothing to reduce the number of accidents on the roads of Europe. Within the European Union, road accidents are the number one cause of death in children and adults under 45.</p>
<p class="contents">I, therefore, like the rapporteur, consider it essential that the Commission does not confine itself to a recommendation on alcohol levels, but sets a clear limit at 0.5 mg/l. Similarly, additional support must be given to the European assessment programme for new car models (Euro-NCAP). This could be achieved, specifically, in the form of a proposal for a directive. In the same way, we must consider intensifying the existing link between the environment and road safety (leading us, for example, to reassess road signs and marking to make them safer).</p>
<p class="contents">We must all accept our responsibilities, and that is what the rapporteur sets out to do in this initiative which does her great credit. I shall therefore vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The statistics are quite staggering: 42,000 deaths on the EU’s roads every year, an estimated 1.7 million people injured to one degree or another.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this issue requires the concerted efforts of all concerned: EU, national and local authorities, as well as the many voluntary organisations and initiatives which aim to tackle the problem of traffic accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of fatal accidents varies greatly from one Member State to another ranging from 60 to 243 per million with an EU average of 116. In my own country, Ireland, there are 129 persons per million inhabitants killed on the roads each year. I find particularly disturbing the fact that road accidents are the most common cause of death amongst children and people under 45 years of age in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an intolerable situation. The figures show clearly that the number of fatal accidents can be reduced drastically throughout the EU. It is crucial that our commitment to saving lives on the roads, in particular those of our young people, is not just a lip-service. There must be adequate resources injected into proactive policies at Union level so as to help individual Member States improve their traffic safety records.</p>
<p class="contents">At present the Commission’s road safety budget is EUR 8 million per year. I believe that the Commission needs to send out a strong signal of its determination to reduce road casualties. I would call on the Commission to increase significantly the road safety budget and indeed to encourage Member States to follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents">Money spent on reducing road accidents is money well spent. Inadequate road safety costs society and the Member States a great deal of money. The human tragedy is immeasurable, but attempts have been made to quantify the damage, and these show that the enormous economic cost of traffic accidents in the form of medical and emergency treatment, damage to property and loss of income amounts to about EUR 100 billion per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">Things are certainly moving in the right direction. During the 1990s, the number of road deaths in the EU fell by 26%. This trend must now be maintained and strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has consistently held that one of the major political goals of transport policy is to give priority to measures to improve safety for all modes of transport, as well as providing the necessary financial resources for this purpose. The number of fatalities and injuries on Europe’s roads is not something which is predetermined. We must make improving road safety a political priority and provide the financial means to match. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cocktail, which has already been applied in varying degrees in a number of countries, has proved ineffective.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, reconciling practical measures with specific national characteristics would seem to be an avenue worth exploring if we want to achieve positive practical results.</p>
<p class="contents">The means of transport that the car represents, with all it entails, is more a matter of training, behaviour and culture. So how is it therefore possible to find solutions standardised for the whole of Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Ms Hedkvist Petersen’s report represents the very antithesis of the subsidiarity we strive to preserve, not out of dogmatism but in order to be as efficient as possible while respecting everyone’s diversity, all in the interests of our various peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">What stage are we at with the implementation of real solutions, the type of solutions that require significant investment? Reforms in training (for example, driving lessons for school age children, or emergency braking in driving schools), systematisation of the active and passive safety components right from the bottom of the range by means of tax incentives to car manufacturers, or even the modification of the infrastructure by completely eliminating the ‘black spots’, are the real issues of any intelligent road safety policy. Though, of course, this is undoubtedly more difficult than adopting a purely punitive approach, which involves, for example, installing a radar monitor in an unmarked police car, at the end of a completely deserted sliproad to a three-lane motorway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Sweden, ‘Vision Zero’ has been approved unanimously by Parliament as an overall objective of the work on road safety. However, in order for these road safety objectives to be achieved, reliable tools are needed for meeting the targets. Effective traffic surveillance, including vehicle inspections, speed monitoring using modern camera techniques, breathalyser tests, seat belt checks and pupillometer measurement in cases where drug-use may be suspected, is what is needed in the short term to bring down the number of fatalities on the roads. In order for the target of zero road fatalities to be realistic, more use must be made of public transport so as to reduce the number of vehicles on the road.</p>
<p class="contents">We will support the report in the final vote, but we take the view that the efforts towards harmonisation are excessive. The report is a parliamentary initiative, the main thrust of which is to demand proposals for the harmonisation of road safety at EU level. We consider this desire to increase road safety to be all well and good, but this is not an issue in which the EU should be investing resources. Rather, it is an issue which is best dealt with at Member State level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur is pleased with the substantial agreement on the fundamental principles contained in the report, namely that the Community is competent to establish a common methodology for calculating transport costs; that external costs should be included in such evaluations; that revenue should be directed to reducing environmental damage and encouraging modal shift to less polluting transport alternatives; that implementation should be governed by subsidiarity; that the users and polluters pay in proportion to use; and that exemptions should be made for the less mobile members of society and those living in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, whilst I am sympathetic to many of the amendments tabled by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance for concrete measures, I cannot support them here, since they would jeopardise the consensus on the above principles and can be examined later in the course of the implementation of a charging framework. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In this case, the matter is charging for transport infrastructure. You have to read between the lines, though, to see exactly what it is talking about and if you do so, you come across two of the pet themes of this institution: the creation of an environment tax and the war waged on road transport and the car. The one main purpose hinted at in the report is to impose yet more taxes on the road users, who are already treated like Europe’s cash cows, and perhaps even to install toll gates and charge for the use of the main roads or minor roads. What planet do we think we are on?</p>
<p class="contents">When the price of fuel is prohibitive, at five to six times the refinery sale price because more than 80% of the price is made up of taxes, you might well think that the road user is already paying more than enough for the right to use the public road network in proportion to the use he makes of his car. That is without mentioning all the other types of road tax; it is too long a list and the litany of amounts involved is too depressing.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, after reading this report, one wonders just what the taxes we pay are actually used for. Nothing, apparently, since in France, for example, the administration’s skimming off half the national wealth does not enable it to ensure the safety of the people, to achieve general welfare, to preserve their quality of life or to provide a consistent and effective transport policy.</p>

Obviously, infrastructure needs to be meticulously maintained and modernised.</p>
<p class="contents">But what funding must be sought? The report stresses that nothing must hinder the development of the market in Member States, i.e. that business profits must not be made use of. The social dumping practised by the road industry or the scandal involving motorway concessions, for example, are not challenged in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Not wishing to increase taxation also entails preventing state intervention so as not to obstruct the sacrosanct rule of competition. On the contrary, the rapporteur advocates pursuing “the aim of phasing out distortions of competition between Member States”. Nowhere does the report make any reference to a state response to social needs, yet, on the other hand, the only response to the “all market” solution is to appeal to private companies, for both the construction and the management of infrastructure.</p>

This applies also to the field of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals would, according to the calculations of the Dutch Government, increase the price of petrol by a further 15 per cent and the price of diesel by 21 per cent, as well as increasing the price of tickets for medium and long-distance train journeys by almost 50 per cent.</p>
<p class="contents">The consequences of this for sparsely-populated Swedish counties which have already been hit, such as Dalarna with its high levels of outward migration and considerable decrease in population, are obvious and totally devastating.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur wishes to introduce new Government taxes and EU taxes, and also levies on roads, railways and airports, car insurance, lorries and buses, petrol and diesel. Part of the funds obtained would go to the Governments of the Member States and then be earmarked for investments in infrastructure, and part would go to the Commission to use as it sees fit.</p>
<p class="contents">Should the resolution be approved by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, the EU would be given its own direct power of taxation, as in an actual nation state. That is a development to which the Swedish Christian Democrats do not wish to contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">I take a very serious view of further increasing the costs of transport for people and goods. It is patently obvious that this will be a merciless blow which will fall hardest on the sparsely-populated counties.

This signal could be misinterpreted or even turned against us to score political points. We are not, of course, opposed to equal opportunities policy and we are certainly not against women's participation. We agree with the principles enumerated by Commissioner Diamantopoulou at the end of this morning's debate. We are in favour of mainstreaming measures in business, in public institutions, in education, training and culture. We are in favour of building up political networks and we need European indicators such as benchmarking. We are also in favour of concrete actions and measures being implemented in the EU Member States. We have demonstrated this in countries where Christian Democrats and Conservatives are in power. Women are demonstrably holding leading positions in our parties. For example, in Germany, my own party, the CDU, has a woman leader and in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats a considerable number of the national delegations are led by women. So there is no doubt that we support the objective of equal opportunities, and this was also apparent from the speeches that my female colleagues and I made this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the rapporteur, Mrs Karamanou, and her Socialist Group were not prepared to support our amendments rejecting the establishment of quotas throughout Europe. There are various different systems in the EU Member States for ensuring that women are properly represented numerically speaking. And, contrary to what appears in the report, these are not laid down by governments, but by the parties, when they are drawing up their lists. That is the way it should stay – that is what the principle of subsidiarity is all about. So any attempt to make out that my group, because a majority of its Members voted against the Karamanou report, is in some way opposed to balanced participation of men and women in the decision-making process, any such attempt is certainly doomed to failure.

The Communist Party of Greece sees the problem of the lack of participation by women in the decision-making process not simply as a problem of democracy; it is a sign of social inequality and exploitation of the classes, which is why it mainly affects working class women.</p>
<p class="contents">The apparent interest in democracy in the family expressed in the motion for a resolution is in fact an interest in reversing full employment (the motion frankly admits as much), and reducing and privatising welfare services. Moreover, so-called equal opportunities policies and various EU programmes have proven to be nothing more than the means to promote capitalist restructuring. They aim to divide the burden equally and to reduce social services to the family, thereby striking at the working classes and exacerbating the situation of women in practice and, as a result, they are responsible for excluding women from the mainstream.</p>
<p class="contents">Women will only gain their rightful place both in the family and in political and economic life by joining the mass grass-roots movement fighting to reverse the policies responsible for their under-representation. Real participation by women cannot be achieved with quotas for their participation in institutions which fight against their interests and promote part-time work, the privatisation of health, welfare and education, longer working hours and a later retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">We disagree with the imposition of quotas on political parties because they are organisations which people join voluntarily and they alone have the right to decide on their structure and how they operate. To impose quotas on political parties is to interfere in their internal affairs and trample on the collective will of a political organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall not oppose administrative measures to improve the participation of women in the decision-making process, provided that they are accompanied by the corresponding grass-roots policy and can therefore effectively remove barriers to the participation of women.

<p class="contents">However, two aspects which I think essential are missing. The first is the economic situation: as long as women are the primary victims of an economic system which forces them into part-time work, secondary income and insecure jobs, to expect them to get involved in political life will remain a pious hope.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the political situation: the report could at least put forward rules for elected representatives which require new people to be elected in each legislative term thereby enabling a turnover in members which would favour the election of more women.

<p class="contents">For one, the Commission and rapporteur largely limit sustainability in the forestry sector to replacement planting alongside cutting. That, however, is not justified. First of all, in this way, Mr Seppänen does not pay sufficient attention to biodiversity, whilst production forest can easily lead to monoculture. It is therefore essential to plant a diverse range of species. The original producer plays an important role in this, but is often bowing to the pressures of free market forces. It is therefore necessary to circumscribe market forces. It is regrettable that the report does not take this sufficiently into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report insufficiently highlights the need to minimise emissions. Wood burning is not a sustainable source of energy, because CO2 and other polluting substances are released in the process. More sustainable alternatives include gassing and composting.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is questionable whether forests could be used as carbon sink in order to achieve the Kyoto emission targets. After all, wood burning must also be included as a source of carbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, the rapporteur does not do justice to the principle of subsidiarity when he asks for Community action in the field of education, technology and resources for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Both within and outside the EU, sustainability is a factor in competitiveness which is gaining in importance. It therefore deserves more of a boost than proposed by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agreed, as rapporteur on the subject of long-stay visas, to having my report discussed at 5.30 p.m. this afternoon. Since then, however, I have received apologies from a great number of members who intended to take part in this debate. The Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, Mr Watson, apologised as he will be unable to attend. I also received apologies from Mr Pirker, Coordinator for the PPE Group, Mrs Terrón i Cusi, Coordinator for the Socialist Group, and from Mr Hernández Mollar, who were scheduled to speak this afternoon. There are other Members, too, in exactly the same position.</p>

It shows the debate as running from 5.30 p.m. to 6.30 p.m., and his report was at the end of the list with the Deprez report. In other words, it was clear from the outset that the Deprez and Ferri reports would be considered and voted on this evening, and I have made my own arrangements accordingly, and I wish to insist on this. The President also said this afternoon that the vote would take place at 6 p.m. instead of at 6.30 p.m., and the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance would end at 5.30 p.m. That means that we have half an hour to consider this topic.

However, the basic problem here is something quite different. Mr Posselt has in fact said everything that needs to be said. What we are witnessing here – and we have already debated this once this afternoon, as we also did on Monday and Tuesday – is, and I shall make no bones about it, an attempt to systematically undermine Strasbourg as the seat of Parliament. Tactics like this are capable of achieving just that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Posselt, even if it would make a valuable contribution if you were to speak for 20 minutes – and I too could also speak for 20 minutes, as no one else is left from my group either – in reality it would mean that the work Mr Deprez has so carefully done would not be debated in the way it deserves here. To that extent I can understand Mr Deprez's desire that his report, which is based on the approach developed in the committee and which should be reflected here in this Chamber, should be given a reasonable hearing in the plenary. So I really am in favour of deferring a report as important as this one, and for my part I would recommend acceding to Mr Deprez's request. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
