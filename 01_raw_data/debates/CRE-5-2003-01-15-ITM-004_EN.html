<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, you are right to say that today sees the third reading of the report on cosmetics, a topic to which – as will be known to most of us – Parliament has now been repeatedly returning over the space of ten years. By far and away most of the proposals, both in this parliamentary session and in the last one, concern themselves with a ban on experiments on animals and on the sale of products tested on animals.</p>
<p class="contents">These areas have been the subject of the most controversy, and, indeed, still are. Both within the European Union and outside it, the most controversial issue was about whether experiments on animals would continue to be permitted in the future in connection with toothpaste and shampoos. Controversy continued to rage around the issue of whether a product that had been tested on animals could still be sold. It was said over and over again in this House that the only way to prevent tests being exported was to couple a ban on testing with a ban on the marketing – and hence the sale – of the products.</p>
<p class="contents">Both in the first and second readings of this seventh amendment to the cosmetics directive, that was the crucial issue, but, both in the competent committee and here in this House, we made the point that cosmetics and cosmetic products are of immediate relevance to the protection of consumers. We pointed out that, for example, the information on a product's useful life was of importance to consumers, who were to be told for how long they could use a cosmetic product once it had been opened. That was one of the points on which this House made proposals at first and second reading. This House's final demand – one that I was happy to endorse as rapporteur – was that hazardous products, those known to be carcinogenic, to affect the reproductive system or to be mutagenic, should not be permitted to be used in cosmetics.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals were what, in essence, our second reading was about. All of them gave rise to controversy. Although they passed through second reading by a very large majority, the Commission did not exactly welcome us with open arms. Today, though, at third reading, we can permit ourselves some self-congratulation, because the conciliation procedure was, I have to say, difficult. Over the years, I have had direct or indirect experience of many conciliation procedures. In this one, I started out uncertain as to whether we would achieve a compromise. We did. The outcome is that a ban on testing cosmetics on animals will be in place – six years after the legislation is adopted. There will be a sales ban on most of the products still containing ingredients tested on animals – six years after the legislation is adopted. We have also said that there will be a derogation for three tests, the development of alternatives to which is not yet in sight.</p>
<p class="contents">The cosmetics industry is not entirely blameless in this. That so little has been done to develop these tests is partly due to the cosmetics industry having been, in the past, what we might call dozy. But we are now giving them an incentive, and a certain amount of time, to come up with alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it clear that what we have achieved is a compromise, a compromise which, like all others, is not ideal. I am aware that the cosmetics industry finds it less than ideal, and also that the animal welfare organisations are convinced that more could have been achieved. I have had to keep on telling our friends in the animal welfare organisations that if they can find someone who can achieve more, they should get them down here and let them get on with it.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow-Members and I have tried to get a workable solution accepted, and so let me conclude by saying that I am grateful to the outgoing Danish Presidency, whose cooperation with us has been excellent, and also to the Commission, which had become cooperative by the end. Mr Liikanen, I wish it had done so a bit sooner, but at least it was never too late. I will also express my thanks to our colleagues in the Conciliation Committee, and to all those with whom we dealt during the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This all adds up to one of the reasons why I love this Parliament so much, and why I would not wish to be a member of any other. The cooperation between Members of every nation and political group was open, decorous, frank and supportive to such an extent that I am convinced that you will not find the like of it in any legislature in the world. It was a joy to work through the night with you until twenty past four in the morning. It was a joy to achieve this outcome and to have been allowed to be your rapporteur. So I again want to thank most especially the colleagues who have always, and repeatedly, assured me of their support, even when conditions were rather less favourable on every side.</p>

Also to members of the European Parliament delegation in the Conciliation Committee. I am happy to hear that Mrs Roth-Behrendt is not only committed to the issue but she even likes conciliations at night; there are very few who take this kind of pleasure in the institutional work.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the conciliation is about be concluded successfully, the Commission welcomes this agreement which provides a clear framework for tests on animals in the cosmetic sector. The solution found offers a genuine benefit to animal welfare whilst safeguarding consumer health protection and our international commitments. The solution of making mandatory the use of all alternative methods at the earliest opportunity, and as soon as scientifically validated, is a good improvement for animal welfare and sends a clear political signal.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission, one of the key elements is the incentive to be given to the development of alternative methods, and the improvement of the validation process. On that subject, the European Union has to play a leading role in promoting the development of animal testing at international level. This will be done with due regard to the development of validation within the OECD.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me point out, however, that many other important aspects are included. Firstly, the provisions aiming to improve health and consumer protection, in particular through more relevant information to consumers. Secondly, the improvement of safety requirements for products for children and for intimate hygiene. Thirdly, the introduction of the labelling requirement for an after-opening date as well as the labelling of allergenic fragrance ingredients. All those aspects are clearly of benefit to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have to note that a lot of work has been done to achieve a satisfactory result for everyone and I hope that this important directive can now be finalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">During this legislature, I have had the opportunity to debate many issues, some of them genuinely difficult and complicated, but perhaps in none of them have I seen so much desire to reach consensus through cooperation amongst all the agents involved as in the case of the rapporteur on this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that this has been a debate based on the positions of the different political groups, in confrontation; it has essentially been a debate between stagnation and progress in an area on which the European Parliament has for years maintained a united and coherent position, with a view of the issues which differs from that of the cosmetics industry and, on several fundamental points, also from that of the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament had a clear view of what it wanted: to set time limits for the end of experimentation on animals, and of the marketing of products experimented on them and, furthermore, to improve the general framework of the legislation regulating these products in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the industry initially maintained the same position of rejecting these requests which Parliament had been defending for years, which made the application of the sixth amendment of the directive unviable.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has already mentioned the long process of debate and joint work between the parliamentary groups with the industry, the Commission and also with the competent administrations of the Member States and finally a compromise was achieved last November following an extremely long conciliation which, if I remember correctly, lasted twelve hours.</p>
<p class="contents">I genuinely believe that there are no losers in relation to this issue. I am convinced that the industry is also a winner with the new commitments on prohibition, experimentation and marketing of six years from the entry into force of the directive. And this is essentially because they will be better able to serve the interests of the citizens in the field of animal protection, without in any way also undermining the safety or diversity, of course, of the products on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, one of the most difficult parts of the work on this directive has been managing to establish the field of exceptions through the definition of tests which, for a period of ten years in specific and essential cases where no alternative methods have been found, will still be able to be carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">Another element which increases the safety of products is the prohibition of dangerous substances such as those which are carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction which must be excluded from cosmetics.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this seventh amendment offers the industry a new range of opportunities for research and development of new products, which, while guaranteeing their effectiveness and above all their safety, will need to be tested on animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is a great challenge for the industry, which I would encourage to seek new sources of competitive advantage through this research and to initiate, with interest and good will, close cooperation with this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Parliament not only can and must communicate that this seventh amendment is a success, but also it would be a mistake for the industry not to take this opportunity to draw up a new communication strategy based on the agreements reached and on its position in favour of the concerns of the consumers, not only with regard to animal experimentation, but also, as we have seen, with regard to other points of the directive which imply greater control of the marketing of these products.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like once again to highlight the issue of cooperation between the parties involved, in particular the eventual, it is true, but positive, flexibility of the Member States and the industry which has led to this final agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt, who has achieved so much over this long process. Perhaps if she had known at the outset the scale of the obstructions and difficulties, she would not have achieved so much. It helps sometimes to be a little ignorant of the difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal puts animal welfare above human vanity, but never above human health. It sets time limits, graduated in accordance with the difficulties involved, and it sets new standards of reference which should and will be respected. I also want to thank the Commission for carrying out its intermediary role, mindful of law and precedent, but also of the strong views of this Parliament which have been echoed here under three different Commissions, for more than ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">To come to this final conclusion is an enormous satisfaction for all of us. My colleagues on the Conciliation Committee expressed the long frustrations of this process in that last marathon session. It was literally at the eleventh hour that we achieved the result that all desired. A new model strip cartoon has just been distributed to Members showing how exciting the work of the European Parliament is, with glamorous young male and female characters. If there is another edition of this series, it should deal with the long night with Mrs Roth-Behrendt at the end of these proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank the Danish presidency. One often sees a presidency looking at a problem firmly in the eye, and then running away. The Danes knew that they could get a deal and they got it – through great skill in my opinion. This was a deal – I want to say this before going on to a word of warning – that meets Parliament's principal concerns. It sticks. It is a signal for action, and not an argument for delay. The animal welfare organisations which campaigned tirelessly for this outcome should not complain about the compromise that we achieved. The spotlight is now on compliance, with a provision to find alternative tests, especially in the most difficult areas of toxicity.</p>
<p class="contents">None of us should make any apologies for how we came to be in this place today. I am personally proud of the fact that the rapporteur got us through this procedure and it enhances the reputation of Parliament, not merely for its procedures but also for their effectiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a moral issue; human health will be protected, because after the deadlines for the end of animal testing, new cosmetic products simply cannot be put on the market until alternative testing methods are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the seventh amendment to the original directive; each time the deadline drew near an extension of time was granted to the industry, so incentives to invest in the development of alternatives were removed. We are today drawing a line that must not again be shifted. Animal welfare groups are unhappy with the outcome of the negotiations between Parliament and the Council, but I hope they recognise that real progress has been made. The Commission's proposal has been transformed, there will be a complete ban on animal testing within the EU and a ban on the sale of cosmetics tested on animals outside the EU, six years after entry into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Month after month, ministers told us that such a marketing ban would be contrary to WTO rules, but these objections were at last overcome during our middle-of-the-night negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I pay tribute to our rapporteur Dagmar Roth-Berendt, and I thank our chief lobbyists Marlou Heinen of the RSPCA, Emily McIvor of BUAV, and Charles Laroche of Unilever who presented the acceptable face of an industry many have grown to mistrust.</p>
<p class="contents">There are practical steps now to be taken. In particular the authorisation procedures for new testing methods must be accelerated. Pressure to develop alternatives must now be put on the chemicals and pharmaceuticals industries, which use the same tests.</p>
<p class="contents">The cosmetics industry should recognise the strength of feeling in this Parliament. The directive permits no postponement of the deadlines, and the Commission must understand that if it comes back in a few years' time with proposals for new legislation to extend the time limits yet again it will meet with a very hostile response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The agreement we reached has encountered criticism from many quarters. Animal protection organisations, in particular, have criticised it on the grounds that it will take too long to implement the ban. I agree with that criticism. I think we could have made faster progress. It is, however, important to criticise those who deserve criticism. If it had been the European Parliament that had decided the issue, matters would in fact have proceeded more quickly, and the ban might already have been in place by now.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the body that should be criticised in this case is the EU Council of Ministers. Certain Member States, in particular, did everything to delay the ban. It is the European Parliament that should have the credit for the ban’s being introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The person who definitely deserves most praise in this context is our rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt. I have rarely seen more energetic, competent and vigorous leadership of a parliamentary delegation in a conciliation, and it felt very good being able to collaborate with Mrs Roth-Behrendt. I should like to thank her for her brilliant efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We Greens have campaigned hard for this. While this was a cause close to our heart, we also know that this position could never have gained majority support without great commitment on the part of the rapporteur, who made our demands her own. So a great deal of gratitude is owed to Mrs Roth-Behrendt, particularly for this position, one that was of enormous importance to us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my belief that the Council at first attempted to wait for a risk assessment, in order thereby to leave carcinogenic substances on the market. That was utterly unacceptable, and we are therefore glad that the Council has abandoned its ‘wait and see’ approach, for there is no room in cosmetics for carcinogenic substances. Not only is it obvious and a matter of common sense that nobody wants carcinogenic substances in face creams, but that is also the view of the Scientific Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also very glad that, in future, hazardous ingredients will have to be listed, and their quantity stated, on cosmetic products, and we will certainly have to be very vigilant in monitoring the implementation of Parliament's demand for information on substances hazardous to health to be made accessible to the public, whether that be in a public register or by some other means. Although it is a bitter pill for us to swallow that the current marketing ban is to be extended by another five years as regards eleven tests and deferred for ten years in respect of three others, this is still a great forward advance in view of the Member States' unwillingness to implement it and of the subsequent attempt at even completely abolishing the marketing ban, which we were successful in resisting. There are now clear and realistic criteria for the development and marketing of alternative tests, so that Parliament can count this as one of its great triumphs, not only for animal welfare, but also for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animal rights advocates think the text does not go far enough, manufacturers do not think they can keep to the time limits and consumers do not understand what has been decided, especially about animal experimentation, which is at the heart of the directive. By banning experimentation and the marketing of products tested on animals six years after it comes into force, with no possibility of extension, the directive puts the cosmetics industry’s back against the wall and undermines its ability to innovate. Nevertheless, from the start of negotiations it has been our common desire to put healthy, hypoallergenic cosmetics on the market, to prevent needless suffering to animals and to preserve the jobs, competitiveness and know-how of our high value-added exporting firms.</p>
<p class="contents">The cut-off date adopted in the directive will, however, in our opinion mean that the safety of the products placed on the market can no longer be guaranteed – they will not in fact have undergone a full range of tests affording the same guarantees as the tests carried out on animals – European products will be penalised on the markets of those third countries that continue to perform animal experiments, which are the only completely reliable ones today, and there will be a risk of WTO sanctions, since it may regard the ban as a barrier to the marketing of cosmetics manufactured outside the European Union. It is generally accepted that few alternative methods will be found within 10 years but that the total replacement of animal experiments might be possible within about 15 years. In my opinion it would have been more realistic to agree on a ban in ten years’ time, with an exemption for three types of test, those relating to reproductive toxicity, toxicokinetics and toxicity in the case of repeated applications. Nevertheless, there are a few positive points, such as showing on the packaging how long the products may be used after opening and the possible presence of allergenic ingredients; these specific measures will improve consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I note that some directives are being revised for the seventh time, while others, like the 1979 ‘‘Birds’’ directive and the ‘‘Habitats’’ directive, which is ten years old now, have still not been revised at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No doubt it is my fault that I have been unaware of your existence in recent years. At any rate, you have had nothing to say for the whole of the debate on cosmetics, and, if you are going to go away today and say that everything went wrong, I cannot recall you having made any serious or creditable contribution to this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">My dear Dagmar, a veritable fanfare of compliments has been sounded in your honour today. It is one in which I am happy to join. Having done well, you have earned it, and it was our great good fortune to be allowed to spend whole nights in your company – and how many can boast of that? Every directive has, of course, its pros and cons. We have not yet slammed the door shut, but I believe that we have made a great advance by saying that the cut-off point will be at the end of a period of time – in 2009 as far as I am concerned. I know perfectly well from my study of the market economy, Mr Barnier, that industry needs facts and data in order to be able to plan ahead – and there is nothing you can teach us on that score. Today, industry will go away and take on young people – researchers, doctors, engineers – whose job will be to look for alternatives. That is precisely what management needs, and that is why this is the right way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liikanen, you know that, much as I respect you, your office sometimes puts forward wearisome proposals. Now, though, you are on the right track, and I would like to give you strong encouragement to stand firm when it comes to the question of whether or not all this is acceptable to the WTO. And stand firm you certainly will, for you know that the whole serried ranks of this House are behind you. That means, I believe, that another solid success will be ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I have no need of three minutes. Europe and her people's representatives have grasped that animals are to be valued in a different way. I cannot but go along with that, and we will do everything to ensure a respectable and credible reduction in the number of experiments on animals. That there has to be, yet again, one small category in which such tests must still be carried out, is something that we accept, and that I believe to be necessary, but the great number of them must be brought down, never to increase again. The victory is yours, Mrs Roth-Behrendt – congratulations!</p>

I certainly also enjoyed working into the night with Dagmar. It looked very difficult at the beginning. There were a number of Member States and also parts of industry that did everything to block decent rules concerning animal experiments. Thanks to Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s and others’ stubbornness, however, acceptable results were in actual fact achieved in two areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these was in relation to animal experiments. We are now to have bans imposed on animal experiments and on the marketing of new products developed by means of animal experiments. Where most experiments are concerned, the ban will apply in six years’ time; but, unfortunately, the bans on three areas, or methods, of experimentation will only apply in ten years’ time, and then with a risk of the deadline’s also being extended. It might of course be said that both deadlines are too far in the future. That is also what we have said here in Parliament but, as we know from the negotiations, there were some Member States that simply blocked the experiments concerned being halted more quickly. It is now crucial that the Commission be consistent in following up the issue. I am able fully to endorse Mr Davies’s observation. Compliance with the current directives has not been sufficiently well monitored, and this has inflicted quite unnecessary suffering upon millions of animals used in experiments. There has most definitely been an acceptance of laxity in developing alternative methods, and that laxity must cease with this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major result concerned ourselves as consumers. First and foremost, we are obtaining a ban on the use of a range of carcinogenic substances and on the use of substances that impair our reproductive ability. We are to have special safety requirements in relation to children; allergy-producing ingredients are to be labelled; and details are to be provided of the shelf-life of individual products. I believe that, overall, there has been a breakthrough in relation to unnecessary animal experiments and that there has also been a breakthrough in terms of public health and consumer protection in the cosmetics area.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, this is a constructive outcome, and I would once again call upon the Commission to be consistent in following up this matter. I also believe that it is necessary for ourselves in Parliament to monitor such follow-up from the sidelines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think you are an excellent and outstanding example, not only of an accomplished parliamentarian but also of what we are so much in need of, namely energetic women in politics. Thank you for your work, your efforts and the character you show. You are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">It only remains to observe that a compromise is a compromise. I can fully understand the animal protection organisations’ concern about the fact that it will take such a long time for the ban to be introduced and about the fact that so very many thousands of animals will be destroyed for the sake of our vanity. In spite of that, I am pleased that we nonetheless arrived at some sort of milestone, or something to grasp and hold on to. I am also very pleased that consumer protection has been taken seriously, that we are to obtain indications of contents and that there are to be bans on certain substances that are clearly unsuitable, above all perhaps when they form part of preparations we use on children and young people who are more vulnerable than ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of animal protection, I should like to look ahead and broaden the debate a little. We keep seeing these appalling films of animal transportation and slaughter, revealing how we in Europe treat our animals. Imagine if Parliament had influence and the right of codecision on issues relating to agricultural policy. Imagine the situation, given the attitude and views on animal protection of an incredibly large majority in Parliament. Just think how much progress we might have made, even though we know that the democratic form of decision-making is compromise – a democratic compromise whose only promise to us is that we shall never get exactly what we want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The third point concerns allergens. Some cosmetics still contain allergens. Originally the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance wanted a complete ban on these substances, but we are quite happy with the labelling that has now been decided upon, because we think that it will mean the same thing in practice. There are already signs that quite a few big companies will be removing these allergens from their cosmetics. So we have also won on that point. There is one thing I would like to get off my chest, though: I really cannot understand the criticism from the animal protectionists. We have achieved the most we could achieve, and we commend the rapporteur and the whole negotiation delegation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is essential to impose bans on experiments and marketing. Animals should not suffer through its being possible to develop new vanity products. I should therefore like to congratulate Mrs Roth-Behrendt on the outcome of what will soon have been a long fight. Even if the conciliation text turned out not to be as restrictive as Parliament had wished, it contains the right principles. It is still a puzzle to me that the Council does not consider that dangerous substances that are carcinogenic, mutagenic or reproductively toxic should, in accordance with the precautionary principle, be completely excluded from being used in cosmetics. All substances, including those in category 3, must be covered. Children too use products, such as shampoo and shower soap, containing these substances, and no type of risk should be taken. The conciliation text is along the right lines, however, so I would once again congratulate you on your worthwhile struggle, Dagmar. The June Movement will of course vote in favour of the conciliation text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I remember the lively debates we have had in our Assembly, debates often full of emotion, whenever the question of animal welfare and public health has arisen. </p>

That is where we need the wisdom to be able to strike a balance between the need to find alternatives to tests on animals and the need to give priority to public health.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to put the cosmetics industry in difficulties either, however, since it is an important part of our economy. The industry has been in the picture for a long time and has been able to plan the necessary investments for developing alternative methods. Our rapporteur has clearly explained that we have been discussing all this for at least 10 years. We should also stress the many efforts that have already been made and the encouraging results that have been obtained. But we cannot exactly take for granted the advances that science will make. Scientific results do not come to order, neither can they be programmed for a precise date, but they can be encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in this spirit that I see the need to set cut-off dates with possible extensions for methods that today are still at the initial planning stage. We must have faith in our manufacturers, but sometimes our role is to encourage them to do more, to think about the future differently, to develop an awareness of our society’s expectations. Cosmetics have proved their safety. What is needed is for the information for the consumer to be made more accurate and relevant. Labelling must therefore be perfect and not have the opposite of the intended effect. For example, to take the example of various allergens, the information that has to be communicated must not frighten the consumer. It must be simple and enable them, if they are particularly sensitive to a product, to make the best choice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will end by saying that this third reading is a good example of the quality of the parliamentary work that has been done under the responsibility of our rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The industrial lobby has once again triumphed over the interests of animals who suffer unnecessarily. Europeans will only allow animal testing if it is absolutely necessary. This necessity does not apply to beauty products, so this directive should have implemented an unconditional ban on the sale and testing of these cosmetics. There is no such ban, however. The standpoint taken by our Parliament was already a compromise, but the outcome that has now been achieved makes things even worse. A partial prohibition will not enter into force until 2009, and three tests will be allowed to continue until as late as 2013 and perhaps even after that. It is not the Parliamentary delegation in the conciliation committee who is to blame for this flawed compromise but the Commission and the Council who have unilaterally bowed to pressure from the cosmetics industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Better information for the consumer will hopefully result in consumers not wanting to become more beautiful by buying ‘ugly’ cosmetics. It is of the greatest importance that governments, science and industry invest in alternative methods. There is nothing at all wrong with a constant stream of new cosmetics coming on to the market; it must just not be at the expense of animals suffering unnecessarily. There are already very many products on the market which contain very many safe ingredients that have been tested on animals, and as far as I am concerned, that is enough now. This directive makes Europe look ugly, so I will not be supporting it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This third reading stage it is not the end of the journey, but it is a very significant point on that road towards the protection of human health and the enhancement of animal welfare. That is why the rapporteur has rightly received the plaudits today because she has taken us along that road.</p>
<p class="contents">When we hear the phrase 'long gestation periods' we have tended hitherto to think of elephants. In future we will think of European legislation. It has been a long gestation period. We then had a long period in labour from 4 p.m. in the afternoon until 4 a.m. in the morning, and at the end we gave birth to a programme which will stand the test, which is why we welcome this point on the debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission originally came forward with a proposal to end tests. However, that would have done no more than the proposal which went through in the United Kingdom, which ended testing on animals, but which simply resulted in the tests on animals being exported. We were in danger of doing just that and putting the testing into countries where the welfare of animals was a much lower priority than it is within the Member States. It was right that we moved the debate on to the end of the marketing of products tested on animals within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We reminded ourselves, and we do so again, that on 1 July the sixth amendment came into force. Technically that would have brought any research using animals to a standstill. There would have been no further progress on the production of new items, not just in the makeup field, but in areas such as medicated shampoos and dental hygiene.</p>
<p class="contents">We looked beyond that and we see the seventh amendment as the last chance. It sets the target dates to end that marketing. We decided that a blanket target date was not sustainable and so we looked for a timetable, and as a validated alternative becomes available for each test, that test on animals will be banned. All such tests will be banned within the six years with the exception of the three to which the rapporteur has drawn attention, for which there will be a ten-year permitted timetable and a possibility of an extension of two years if, and only if, this Parliament endorses that extension through codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">Now the challenge is not only to the Commission, other colleagues have said that, but it is to the industry. It is up to the industry to accelerate that search for validated alternatives. The cooperation that exists already between Parliament and industry has been impressive. It has helped to convince firstly the Commission, and then even the minority on the Council which was reluctant to go along with this. This minority too came into line and that is why we are at the point we are today, in optimistic mode.</p>

Congratulations are in order for that. I am wholly in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also extremely pleased about the transitional period of six years to allow alternatives to be found, as there are only three categories of tests that are particularly difficult to replace and the industry has until 2013 to develop alternative methods for these. After all, ladies and gentlemen, let us be honest, which of you would volunteer to be tested with new substances? The widespread criticism about this transitional period, which argues that permitting animal testing to continue is a loophole in the law, is therefore unjustified. As long as people do not volunteer for testing themselves, other ways of testing certain bulk products must be permitted. After all, these bulk products are also used in the pharmaceutical industry, and the standards we apply to medicines are naturally different from those we apply to lipstick. I therefore wholeheartedly endorse this compromise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that products will come on to the market that will make beautiful young girls even more beautiful, but these are also very important to older women, who of course want to be attractive grandmothers to their grandchildren – and you try and find a grandmother who would dare tell her grandchildren that the cream she has just used, or that she uses on the children, has caused suffering to an immense number of animals. Such a grandmother would be done for!</p>
<p class="contents">You see, celebrated and truly beautiful women have for a long time used products made without experimentation on animals. Julia Roberts is one such; she loves natural cosmetics, preferring to use a rose cream from a German firm – and, ladies and gentlemen, as she is a celebrated American actress, perhaps that is sending an important message to the American cosmetics industry. Do American actresses really have to resort to European products simply because they are not tested on animals here? That attests to the inadequacy of the American cosmetics industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I love cosmetics. I owe my hair colour to l'Oréal, my perfume is by Dior, and my face cream comes from Great Britain – Englishwomen have such wonderful complexions. In future, though, I will use far more cosmetics, and will be proposing Mrs Roth-Behrendt for honorary membership of all animal welfare organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, though, I really would like to thank Europe's cosmetics industry most warmly for its cooperation, and I wish you a turnover of staggering dimensions. May these new products earn you masses and masses of money.</p>

I admit to enjoying it, for politicians do not often come in for praise, at any rate not with such frequency and regularity. It has made me feel good, but I have already tried to pass this praise back.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for the debate, which I hope will turn out to be the last on this topic in this House; you have heard, Mr Liikanen, that it will be your future task to monitor how progress is made. It will be your task to see to it, along with your fellow Commissioner Mr Busquin, that the European Community's Joint Research Centre has sufficient resources to evaluate the alternatives that will then come into existence. Your mission is to drive industry onward, support it and, in tandem with it, to ensure that alternatives are developed quickly and equally quickly accepted. This is something we must do together. Commissioner, you have heard today a message that will surely get through to the cosmetics industry and the Member States too: we will be very vigilant as regards how the timetable is kept to, and that this time there really will be the cut-off point of which Mr Florenz and others spoke earlier. I would rather not hear anything further said on this subject in this House. My wish is that there should now be a timetable, one that might even now be complied with even more promptly, and that that should draw a line under the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Please let me conclude by again saying ‘thank you’ – that is why I wanted to say a final word. Not to you, though, ladies and gentlemen, for I have thanked you already. I would like to thank those without whom I could not have carried on this work – first and foremost my assistant Mrs Annika Nowak, who is probably sitting listening to this in my office, and who knows this dossier better than I do, but also especially the Secretariat of the Conciliation Committee. Parliament has good staff; some of them are more than just good, and the Conciliation Committee Secretariat, sitting over there today, has certainly had the most work to do, far more than I have had myself.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now – yes, this really is the end! – say ‘thank you’ to Mrs Kerry Postlewhite, one of my group's staff, who, throughout the last few years has advised me and been of use to me in my capacity as group leader and rapporteur, and without whom I would not have been able to keep my feet on the ground. Today is probably the last time she will sit here in the plenary, as she is soon to take up other duties, and, whilst I am saddened by this, I know she will be doing something new that she will like and that will be a joy to her. I have no idea how the members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and I are supposed to work without her. Anyway, we will give it a try. She is here working on one of her briefs for the last time, and so my final and especial thanks must go to Mrs Kerry Postlewhite.</p>
