<p class="contents">According to the latest UN data received from the World Health Organisation, Kosovo has the highest rate of infant mortality in Europe; almost 50% of babies born prematurely die, while the war has produced a steep rise in miscarriages and children who manage to go to term are smaller than the norm. In the context of the humanitarian aid provided by the Union and the efforts of its envoy Bernard Kouchner, will the Commission say what measures have been taken to safeguard the women of Kosovo's right to motherhood and the health of pregnant women, women in childbirth and babies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This results both from the recent conflict and from the years of neglect and lack of maintenance that preceded it.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics quoted on child mortality speak for themselves and are wholly unacceptable. However, the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population. The Commission’s response has been as follows: firstly, the health sector has been a significant beneficiary of ECHO funding. ECHO is currently focusing on the provision of medical supplies and emergency health care, on support to institutions as well as vaccination. However, efforts are increasingly oriented towards the establishment of a self-sufficient healthcare system in the province. UNMIK has already taken a significant role in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, under the reconstruction programme, urgent intervention at the hospital in Mitrovica has already been initiated with a EUR 1 million rehabilitation programme. Progress is slow due to the tense relations between the ethnic groups of this divided city. However, the Commission is maintaining its efforts with the support of UNMIK for this project. We hope that one day it may become a symbol promoting the benefits of ethnic reconciliation. Under the European Community’s damage assessment, estimated costs of the reconstruction of healthcare facilities and provision of equipment to dispensaries and health houses amount to EUR 4 million. The Commission is now turning to the programming of 2000 funds. We expect to dedicate a considerable sum to improving the healthcare system. The emphasis will be on long-term reforms covering health financing as well as training and procurement. Work is already under way with UNMIK to determine an appropriate contribution from the Commission to this enterprise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure the honourable Member did not mean that.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, she is entirely correct in saying that the Union’s credibility is on the line with what happens, not just in Kosovo but in the Balkans as a whole. I am very concerned that the assistance we provide should arrive expeditiously and in a way which can maximise our assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just make two points about the situation in Kosovo which we are addressing as enthusiastically as we can along WHO lines. First of all, I am sure that the honourable Member recognises that over the period of the 1990s the government in Belgrade underfunded the health service in Kosovo, and many Albanians found that they were not really receiving any health care at all. As a result of that, a parallel health care system was put in place through the Mother Teresa Society. So what we are dealing with is not just the consequences of conflict but the consequences of years of neglect and chronic under-investment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and I am sure that the honourable Member recognises this as well, some of the tragic stories to come out of Kosovo in recent weeks have not been about child mortalities during carriage of a baby, but child mortality after a healthy baby has been born. Those were cases in which women who during the hostilities, or before the hostilities, tragically killed their own children. We are dealing with a horrific story in Kosovo. We have to work as well as we can in the health care field and in others to restore something approaching civilised standards and civilised behaviour, but it is not going to be easy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In some cases, there have been incidents of food containing insects and such like. Are you aware of this? Are you prepared to act upon it? This is my first additional question. </p>
<p class="contents">My second question pertains to the reconstruction of the hospital in Mitrovica. You are perhaps aware that this hospital is located in the Northern part of the city and that, given the tense situation, Albanian Kosovars do not have any access to this section at all.

I have not heard that suggestion before, but it is an important point and I will certainly investigate it when I am there.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I do understand exactly what the honourable Member is saying about Mitrovica. I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago, I saw the situation there for myself. I had discussions with municipal leaders from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side who had himself in the past been a doctor and was generally recognised for the medical work he had done during the hostilities and subsequently. So I know the very serious problems that exist in that hospital and I can assure the honourable Member that we will be doing all that we can to see that adequate health facilities are available for everybody in Kosovo, whatever ethnic group they come from. The particular difficulties in Mitrovica – for example, it is not just a question of Albanian patients having difficulty getting to hospital, Albanian staff have had difficulty working there – are particularly acute problems. We will try to address them, but it is not easy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter’s content. According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council. Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources. As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes. However, given the mandate and the final objective of the text to be submitted to the Heads of State and Government, this power must be exercised with caution and on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The rights conferred by this Charter will have at least two types of beneficiary. Some rights will apply to anyone present in the EU territory while others will benefit only citizens of the European Union. It may also be envisaged that some economic and social rights could be guaranteed only for citizens of the European Union and third-country nationals meeting certain conditions. It is not possible at this initial stage of the process of drawing up the Charter to prejudge its content in more detail. However, I can confirm that the principle of equal opportunity and equal treatment between men and women will certainly be included among the rights guaranteed by the future European Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is because this principle already figures among the rights guaranteed by the EC Treaty and by secondary legislation and because it undoubtedly constitutes a common constitutional tradition in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have also said before to this House, the Commission is favourable to inserting the Charter in the EU Treaty. However, we are fully aware that the final decision on this matter will fall to the Heads of State and Government. The difficult part, which will fall to the Convention, is therefore to draw up an ambitious and politically significant text which can be integrated as such into the Treaties. In its opinion on the holding of an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties, the Commission noted that the European Council must decide during the year 2000 on the inclusion of certain items on the IGC agenda, in particular the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

This is because it shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of citizens at the top of the political concerns for the future of our common project.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated. The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand your concern about the rights of children. Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children. This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully. Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the EU’s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi’s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider’s Freedom Party. I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate. The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency’s statement of 1 February 2000. These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them. There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider’s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European. The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated. The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law. This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made. The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one. In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a “serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.” I repeat, a “serious and persistent breach” is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State. I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria. As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State. I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7. I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary. The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises.</p>
<p class="contents">Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say. In Austria’s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least. On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party. On the other hand, the new Austrian Government’s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights. We will soon have our first opportunity, and an excellent opportunity it will be, to see which one of these two faces of the Freedom Party is the real one. I am referring to the position the Austrian Government will adopt at the Council with regard to the Commission’s proposals for the establishment of an action programme to combat discrimination and for two directives. One applies to the principle of treating people equally, without differentiating on the grounds of race or ethnic origin. The other proposal will provide protection at work against discrimination on the grounds of ethnic or racial origin, religion, handicap or sexual persuasion. These are significant texts, adopted in accordance with Article 13 of the Treaty, which gave the Community jurisdiction to fight discrimination on the grounds of race, ethnic origin, sex etc. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to assure you, Mr Ford, that the Commission will remain vigilant and will not fail to act in accordance with its responsibilities, should it prove necessary.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But is Commissioner Vitorino aware, not only of Mr Haider's and the Freedom Party's words, but also of their deeds? Mr Haider has actually been in government in the southern province of Carinthia where he has led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovene-speaking minority in that region who are Austrian citizens, where he has attempted to abolish dual language education and where there has been clear discrimination against the Roma and immigrant communities.</p>
<p class="contents">Could the Commissioner answer two questions. Firstly he talked about verification. Can he tell us how that verification will take place and who will do it?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, does he not agree that were the current government, at a national level, to pursue the kind of policies that Mr Haider and the Freedom Party have pursued at regional level, then there clearly would be a breach of Article 6(1) of the Treaty with regard to fundamental freedom and human rights and it would be incumbent upon the Commission to take the necessary action?

Therefore I am fully confident that the Commission will be able to follow very closely the evolution of the situation in Austria, as in any other Member State. If any concrete case of persistent violation of human rights perpetrated by the government of one Member State occurs, we will be entirely capable to react and to act accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">I also rely not only on the cooperation of the Members of the European Parliament, but also on the cooperation of non-governmental organisations, which have always made an important contribution to the anti-discrimination policy of the Commission.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Surplus electrical and electronic equipment</span></p>
<p class="contents">Each year the European Union has to deal with a growing volume of surplus electrical and electronic equipment (6 million tonnes' worth in 1998), mainly on account of the speed with which such equipment becomes obsolescent. The environmental problems stemming from the incineration and the dumping of such waste are mainly attributable to the presence of hazardous substances (lead, cadmium, mercury, hexavalent chrome, PVC and halogenated flame retarders). A preliminary draft directive intended to regulate the management of such waste has been through three successive versions, the most recent of which dates from July 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Commission account for the lengthy gestation of this draft, which should in theory have emerged in its final form in 1998? Is it true that the US Government is disputing most of the provisions of the current draft and is even threatening to appeal to the World Trade Organisation (for infringement of Article XI of the GATT and Article 2(2) of the Agreement on technical obstacles to trade) if it is adopted?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the Commission decided to prepare a proposal on the subject and, since 1997, has been involved in discussions with the parties concerned. The outcome of the discussions, as well as of the in-depth investigations which are being carried out in this area, are now being examined by the Commission. Some parts of the proposal have been criticised, among them the phasing out of some heavy metals and brominated flame retardants, as well as the application of the principle of making manufacturers responsible for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States' delegation to the European Union is concerned about certain points in the last consultation paper, inter alia the phasing out of the materials already mentioned, as well as certain questions arising from the principle of manufacturers' responsibility for the disposal of electrical and electronic waste. The main argument put forward by the United States in this context is that the present provisions are, they say, incompatible with international trade law. The Commission is currently carefully reviewing the United States' arguments. I should just like to add that my intention is that the Commission should be able to present a proposal on the dumping of electrical and electronic waste before Easter.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have in fact been three preliminary draft texts with the last one, to my knowledge, dating from July 1999. Is this the text which you will be submitting, or an amendment to the original version? Version 3 is already much weaker than Version 2 following the comments of US industry as relayed by the US Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I note in particular that when you talk about the international law with which the text would not be compatible, you are referring in fact to the rules of the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments of the US Government concern the fact that a future ban on the presence of dangerous substances in electrical and electronic waste would be contrary to the WTO rules. This worries me because this means that, when adopting texts, we are going to be continually threatened by attack from the World Trade Organisation.

It is important for me to have a chance to answer it. It is clear that in a process such as this, where we are discussing the disposal of a considerable stream of both electrical and electronic waste in Europe, there is an on-going dialogue between the different parties concerned. The dialogue has been fruitful and has led to our preparing a proposal. Parts of it have been strengthened, but other parts may well contain too many compromises. We are still in the process of preparing a text, and the dialogue with the relevant parties will continue up until the last moment. </p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that the intervention of the United States should push us in a direction that would lead to our taking insufficient account of environmental considerations. I strongly oppose using the WTO and trade rules as a pretext for preventing the EU from introducing radical environmental standards. I start from the assumption that we should in fact introduce these. However, I do want to listen to all the points of view. For example, I recently met representatives of the electronics industry who put forward suggestions – including practical ones – for improving our own proposal. However, I totally reject any suggestion that I would allow the United States to determine the shape of our directive. In fact, I believe that we should be showing the way, an intention that will also characterise the final proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Through the current programme, which covers the period 1997 to 2000, we are endeavouring to encourage a workplace culture in which the value of both men and women is integrated and where gender-specific needs are taken into consideration. One of the programme's aims is to develop and supervise methods, strategies and measures for promoting gender equality in the decision-making process and in positions of responsibility. Within the framework of the action plan, each individual directorate general is to prepare its own programme of measures. One of the goals of those programmes is to increase the number of women in managerial positions. The new Commission's own objective is to double the number of women managers before the end of its term of office. The same line is being pursued with particular vigour in the Directorate-General for the Environment, where nearly 60 per cent of directors and 20 per cent of unit heads are women.</p>
<p class="contents">Our policy is to encourage the recruitment of women to administrative posts in order to create a reserve of suitable candidates for future promotion to managerial positions. Currently, women hold 24.5 per cent of our A-grade posts, and we hope the number will increase steadily. Moreover, we are trying hard to attract qualified women to participate in our consultation groups. As regards our external partners, all we can do is set them a good example and encourage their efforts to democratise their decision-making processes.</p>
<p class="contents">With respect to the general principle of incorporating a perspective of equality, as you know, this principle is included in the Treaty of Amsterdam. Article 3 of the Treaty states that, in all the activities referred to in this Article, the Community shall aim to eliminate inequalities, and to promote equality, between women and men. The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field. I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament’s Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thank you for your reply. I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields. I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes. Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. This is a crucial goal. In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up.

<p class="contents">The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence. What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area?

The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan. </p>
<p class="contents">The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive. That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community’s Habitats Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed.</p>
<p class="contents">After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 – during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds – the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour. An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out. The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded. Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved.</p>
<p class="contents">However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute. Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements. They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts. However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint. In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended. However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means. The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge – that is what I referred to also in my first answer – based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary. There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval. The Commission’s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging. In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass.

As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives. The message contained in the joint text is still valid. We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy. The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities. In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites. Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures. In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results.</p>

<p class="contents">Has the Greek Government introduced any changes so as to extend the scope of partnership arrangements to the local authorities and other representative bodies?

This was a joint letter between our two predecessors and I consider, as the successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, that this letter is still valid. I will actively endeavour with Mrs Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the Structural Funds with the EU environmental directives and policies. I am also saying this as a former environment minister.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the question posed by Mr Alavanos, who I hope will pardon me for this brief diversion onto another subject, the Commission has been monitoring and will continue to monitor, during the preparation of the new programming period, the application of the partnership principle. The involvement of regional and local authorities in the Community’s action is, as you know, one of the essential elements of the new post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific application of this partnership principle within the next Community support framework for Greece, the Commission has noted that the public authorities were largely involved during the preparation of the Greek regional development plan for the 2000-2006 period. Mr Alavanos knows that I have been to Greece twice under the quite tragic circumstances of the earthquake disaster. During these visits, I held discussions with the Greek Government and raised this concern about the correct implementation of the partnership objective and requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">As for subsequent phases, in other words the preparation of national and regional programmes, it is not enough for this objective to be taken into account at national and theoretical level. It must also be specifically included in the programmes establishing the CSF at national, regional and local level. As for the monitoring and management of these programmes, I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek Government pursuant to Article 8 of the new Regulation. In the current negotiations on this third Community support framework, I have asked for the provisions on the partnership principle to be fully respected, with regard to both regional and local authorities and to non-governmental organisations and associations. Within the third CSF, this principle must specifically lead to the participation of all these partners in the monitoring committee.</p>

<p class="contents">The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion. This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission. However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States’ management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these.</p>
<p class="contents">On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission’s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds. These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy. The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation. This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional. The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure. Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules. Please excuse this very legal answer. However, after verification it is precisely in this legal manner and specifically according to the post-Berlin Structural Funds Regulation that we must define and read the additionality principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States. Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule. Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice. When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union.

As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation. Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This question is very important and I would like to know – since this is a kind of ‘baby fraud’ – whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have given you my answer. I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed. We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive. I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation. It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible. I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today. As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December. I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again. I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks.</p>

Commissioner, you were not present at the extraordinarily named ‘official opening’ of the headquarters of the OHIM on 9 June, in the middle of an election campaign in Spain leading up to both the European elections and the local and regional elections.</p>
<p class="contents">If you had been there, I am sure you would have been ashamed. The President of the Commission and some secretaries were present. In the middle of an election campaign, a series of authorities, all of them run by the party in government, made clearly electioneering speeches which, furthermore, were broadcast live on television. It was bizarre to see the President of the Region of Valencia praising the work of the Spanish Government, as well as his own work, although it was irrelevant to that event.</p>
<p class="contents">The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous. I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event.</p>

When Sweden joined the European Union, it was allowed to retain quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages which travellers can bring into the country from other Member States. This derogation from the principle of the free movement of goods lapses on 30 June of this year. Sweden now wants to extend this measure by another five years, as this would be necessary to protect public health. My position on this is clear. Sweden has now had sufficient time – since its accession to the Union – to adapt its policies to a situation where such import restrictions do not exist. I cannot see a reason, therefore, why a further extension for this measure should be proposed. European citizens have the right to buy goods for their own use, including taxes, in any Member Sate and to take them to another Member Sate without having to subject these goods to controls and without possibly having to pay another set of taxes on them. That is a basic principle governing the internal market and derogations from this principle must be exceptions and must be limited in time. </p>
<p class="contents">We want to guarantee that Swedish citizens too can enjoy the benefits of the internal market, just like other citizens of the European Union. This certainly does not mean that I do not share the concern in Sweden surrounding the possible health problems which can be caused by alcohol abuse. A recent study, carried out by Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund, however, has shown that abolishing the restrictions would not lead to a higher alcohol consumption in Sweden. </p>
<p class="contents">I have already had a chance to discuss my position with Mr Ringholm, the Swedish Finance Minister on two occasions. I also discussed this matter with the Swedish parliamentary Finance committee last week. It is now up to the Swedish government to take the necessary measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should just like to apologise for the error in my question to the Commission. Instead of 2004, it should, of course, be 1 July 2000.</p>
<p class="contents">I have some sympathy with the Commission's standpoint that derogations should only be granted occasionally. Such a rule is only normal. Nevertheless, I should like to ask two questions: Are you thinking of embarking upon continued discussions with the Swedish Government about extending the derogations, for example for as long as Denmark and Finland have derogations? </p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the whole policy on alcohol. This may, of course, be seen as an issue concerning the internal market, but also as a public health matter for the whole EU. What are the respective roles of alcohol policy and public health considerations in the Commission's work? A Europe-wide policy on alcohol is not just an issue concerning the internal market. It also has important implications for public health. If we had considered these aspects in their overall context, then it might have been easier to carry on a dialogue with Sweden.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, Finland and Denmark are subject to exemptions to the basic rule of the free movement of goods until 2003. These countries are in the process of taking measures in preparation of free access of alcoholic products in the year 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in the case of Sweden, the situation is different. In 1995, a five-year derogation period was decided upon, which is now lapsing. I have as yet not heard any arguments on the basis of which the Commission would need to extend this period. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Swedish Government is being consulted all the way. I can inform Mr Andersson that I will leave for Stockholm on Monday, 6 March, in order to talk to Minister Ringholm, to members of the Swedish parliament, and, if necessary, also to the Prime Minister or other ministers, in order to continue discussions on this matter. I am fully aware that emotions are running high in the political arena in Sweden regarding this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I understand very well that the health aspect of this matter is naturally important. I would repeat at this juncture what Professor Lindgren of Lund University has stated, namely that whatever happens in terms of import restrictions, the consumption of alcohol will remain the same. The question is then, of course, where does the volume of alcohol originate from which is not imported by travellers? The answer is that this is smuggled into the country or made by the Swedes themselves, and as Mr Andersson knows, this is an extremely dangerous and unhealthy activity. </p>
<p class="contents">Well now, Mr Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol. But in that case, not only Sweden, but all EU countries, should then be subject to a total ban on alcohol. We can cast our minds back to a similar situation in the United States. Mr Andersson will be familiar with what was termed then ‘prohibition’. He will also be aware of the effects the ban had on Mafia activity within the United States, where, eventually, prohibition was withdrawn. All this means that we need to protect health, of course, but not by banning alcohol, because that does not work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also happen to know that the high tax on alcohol products in Sweden goes back to the year 1638 and that since then, the sale of alcohol products has accounted for a significant portion of the state’s tax revenue. As is known, this has led to a state monopoly in Sweden which, in itself, is at odds with Union legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the healing effect of alcohol – to which, I believe, Mr Posselt also made reference – I could not agree more with him: I think that a good bottle of wine can be extremely good for your health and is also socially extremely pleasant, and perhaps Mr Posselt, Mr Andersson and myself could meet in the bar of this Parliament one of these days to share an aquavit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products.</p>
<p class="contents">Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States. It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States. For example – I believe the honourable Member referred to this – no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom. That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax. The Commission has no means of influence here.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol. Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union – and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products – it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol. There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand.

<p class="contents">Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle. For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands – a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it – a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
