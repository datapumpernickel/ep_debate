We have indeed been convinced since l999 that such an objective can only be achieved if three conditions are fulfilled: more legitimacy, greater effectiveness and more credibility for our political action.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, more legitimacy. What this signifies for Parliament is more respect for the democratic principle according to which the European Parliament must definitely be more seriously involved in preparing European legislation and negotiating international agreements. In The Hague, the European Council decided to make the transition to codecision where illegal immigration was concerned, but – rather bizarrely – it rejected codecision when it came to legal immigration, which is the form of immigration of interest to most Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament also continues simply to be consulted on criminal matters, which is the most sensitive area of relations between European citizens and institutions. The Council has still not grasped that, if this relationship is not based on very high standards and on a courageous policy for promoting fundamental rights, any initiative launched by the EU is in danger of being contested by those same Member States that put the brakes on the EU’s development. This discrepancy between public declarations and practical decisions already sees us face to face before the Court of Justice, disputing regulations in the areas of family reunification, data protection and, perhaps tomorrow, asylum procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater effectiveness comes next, since most of the responses given by the institutions to requests in connection with the free movement of persons or with tackling organised crime or terrorism remain very vague when they are not merely theoretical declarations. That this is the case is still proved to us by the fact that we continue to proceed by trial and error when it comes not only to border control and to the development of Schengen cooperation but also to conflict prevention or the promotion of integration. The absence of clear objectives and priorities leads us to dissipate our energies as much as the lack of any obvious link with other Community policies which do, however, complement the policies associated with the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another crucial factor to be defined is that of the relationship between the European and the national institutions. It will be difficult for us to obtain more mutual trust if we are not in a position to define the tasks of each decision-making level, the expected responses and the measures to be taken in case of a failure to act. We must not forget that, in speaking of people’s freedoms or security, the chain is only as strong as its weakest link.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we need more credibility. Last year, the European Council confronted an impressively high number of instances in which the action plan to combat terrorism was not put into effect. All it was able to do was appoint a representative of the Secretary-General, thereby adding, if need be, a new piece to a sort of institutional Meccano which is already failing to impress in terms of its transparency and, certainly, its efficiency. To date, agencies such as Europol or CEPOL still have to prove their worth and have difficulty integrating themselves into the national security systems. On many occasions, the European Parliament has invited the Council to create credible bodies, better integrated into the institutional framework of the EU, but it has never received genuinely credible responses. In certain cases, like that of the development of information bodies, the replies have even been so vague as to make one wonder if they really have been devised in a way that is equal to the questions raised.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall in any case listen very carefully, or rather – since obligations in connection with the French election campaign will require me to leave the Chamber in a few minutes’ time – I shall, no later than tomorrow morning, read the replies given to us in the course of this debate. I am able right now to commit myself to presenting the competent parliamentary committee with proposals designed to reopen a dialogue between our institutions that is commensurate with our expectations – those of our people, as well as those generated by the tasks that have been entrusted to us under the Treaties and that call for a clear political perspective rather than technocratic responses that cause delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Particularly as we are discussing the area of freedom, security and justice, I would like to focus on the planned proposal on data retention. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – and I, as its rapporteur – had doubts about the legal basis for this proposal, and in this the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Commission and the Council’s Legal Service agreed with us. I would now just like to know whether we can assume that the Council will do likewise and involve Parliament in the decision on this matter, or whether we can take it as read that the Member States will stick with their proposal in the full knowledge that they are setting themselves against three institutions. I would be very interested to learn that as a matter of extreme urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is surely totally unacceptable and is a typical example of legislation that serves above all else to help politicians feel better about themselves and to demonstrate that they can, at times, take decisive action, although it remains to be seen whether or not it is effective. Would it not be preferable to channel the many millions involved into specific investigations? Before I even consider giving my approval, I would like the Council to give me good reasons why this huge increase is necessary, proportionate and effective. I defy the Council to give me the bare facts and leave out the empty rhetoric.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is also – as Mr Alvaro said a moment ago – deeply worried about the procedure. The Council knows that Parliament feels very strongly about civil rights and effective measures to combat crime, more so than do the governments. That is why the governments are resolutely determined to legislate without any parliament being involved. The Commission and the legal services tell us that this subject falls within the scope of the first pillar where Parliament has a say. The Commission has already said it will table a proposal of its own, but the Council, as if on automatic pilot, continues to hold meetings on the proposal of those four Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to know how this can be reconciled with the governments’ position on the Constitution, which stipulates, after all, that Parliament will become colegislator in the third pillar too. The governments claim they very much want this democratic control, but they stand to lose every shred of credibility if they now try to avoid it by quickly forcing something through which will have huge implications for the public and for hundreds of Internet and telecoms businesses. Will the Council simply decide to wait for the Commission’s proposal, or should this House again go to the Court of Justice to enforce democracy on the Member States by means of a legal ruling? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The example – that of the framework directive on data retention – is an important one in terms of determining two quite different issues, the first being that of how the institutions relate to each other. There is no point in coming out with fine principles concerning issues of the law, freedom and the safeguarding of rights, but not doing anything about them in a real-life situation involving relations between the institutions. The question that Mr Alvaro highlighted has not yet been answered, and the Council was meant to do so today.</p>
<p class="contents">If this House and the Commission have justifiable misgivings about whether Parliament should be involved and, if it is to be involved, to what extent, then – if we are to get anywhere – the Council must give us its final decision on the matter today. For months, we have had the feeling that this is an issue on which Parliament is being strung along. We can debate as much as we like, but no kind of concrete and final decision is possible. Parliament is not being involved, and no final decision is being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that no answer has as yet been given to the question Mrs Buitenweg raised just now about whether doing this sort of thing with data is actually necessary – about whether it is productive, whether it is helpful, whether it really will succeed in helping keep people in the European Union safe, or whether it adds up to nothing more than shooting from the hip at a time when the European Union was also in a situation of grave crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, what role will Parliament play, and, secondly, at which stage of the process can we expect to play it? To both these questions we expect precise answers. The third question that needs to be answered has to do with what the actual point of this measure is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot but be very pleased that the Council has heard our requests, and we wish to continue in this spirit of dialogue between equal partners in order to ensure the continuity of the progress to be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, developments in European immigration policy have mainly been in terms of repressive measures and the fight against illegal immigration. I am therefore delighted that the Commission has presented a Green Paper on economic immigration. I want this Green Paper, however, to permit a wider debate on opening up means of legal immigration and not to be confined to the needs of the European labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, if a discussion on economic immigration is absolutely necessary to European immigration policy, we are not prepared to shop around in third countries. We must make efforts to come up with lasting solutions for migrants, and ones that respect their fundamental rights. I thus call upon the Member States to permit the switch to codecision where legal immigration is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">2004 also saw the proposal presented for a directive on the procedures concerning the granting and withdrawal of refugee status. I really wish to draw the Council’s and the Commission’s attention to our great concern about this proposal. By allowing too large a number of dispensations, this proposal amounts, indeed, to no more than a levelling down of asylum policy. In the worst case, it is in danger of jeopardising the more protective asylum policies of certain Member States. I am sorry that the Council has not permitted the switch to codecision where this matter is concerned, and I would call upon it to take the anxieties of the European Parliament into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to ask the Council how matters now stand regarding its proposal concerning data retention, since Commissioner Frattini announced to us that the Commission wished to present its own proposal. Are you going to allow a tool for protecting personal data in the third pillar? The question has been put, and we hope for a reply.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask the Council to decide, during this week’s JHA Council, again to consult the European Parliament on the framework directive concerning racism and xenophobia, and I look forward to your replies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frieden,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council.</span> <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, allow me firstly to thank you for the opportunity given to the Council to take stock of the progress made in 2004 in developing the area of freedom, security and justice. I should like, in particular, to thank Mr Cavada, Mr Alvaro, Mrs Buitenweg, Mr Reul and Mrs Roure for the questions that have been put and which have bearing on the future and operation of this area of freedom, security and justice on which - as you emphasised – considerable progress was made in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">2004 was the year of the Constitutional Treaty, with significant progress made in building a more secure and therefore freer Europe. It was the year in which the Hague programme – a practical list of measures to be implemented - was adopted in relation to the area of freedom, security and justice. It was also the year in which more than one hundred documents were adopted in connection with the area of freedom. What progress for one of the greatest projects for deepening Europe following its enlargement, which also took place in 2004!</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, 2004 was the year of the Constitutional Treaty, which opens up new horizons for people and for the European Parliament, as shown by the questions put by Mr Cavada.</p>
<p class="contents">By reinforcing judicial and police cooperation, by extending codecision and qualified majority voting – an absolute necessity in a democratic Europe of 25 Member States – and by laying the foundations of a genuinely common asylum and immigration policy, Europe will contribute genuine added value to our citizens where security, justice and freedom are concerned. Faced with the challenges of immigration, organised crime and international terrorism, no Member State is in a position to face up to things alone. We need more in the way of Europe. A vote in favour of the European Constitution will be a vote in favour of a more secure and therefore freer Europe. A vote against the European Constitution will mean our maintaining the national barriers faced by our police and magistrates while criminals take advantage of the absence of borders. That is a state of affairs that we must not accept.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cavada is right to emphasise the way in which the Constitutional Treaty opens up many new prospects of cooperation and codecision involving our institutions. If I understand correctly, a lot of the questions put are designed to anticipate applying the provisions of the Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">In a community governed by law, such as the European Union, the Council will carry out its work while respecting the rules laid down by the sole Treaties currently in force. The Council will not anticipate the Constitutional Treaty out of respect for the important decisions to be taken over the next few months by our national parliaments and our people.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, this does not prevent close cooperation, and an excellent understanding, between Parliament and the Council. Nor, where the Treaties permit, does it prevent our two institutions listening to each other or doing more to exchange information. As early as 2004, the Council’s activities in the field of justice and home affairs were characterised by great progress, thanks, in particular, to the excellent work of the Dutch and Irish Presidencies. As proof of this, I cite the fact that the Council adopted an important bill in the institutional field – and one to which you referred – insofar as it made the codecision procedure applicable in fields concerned with external border controls and the fight against illegal immigration. It is a first step and an important one. I also cite as proof the continued efforts to bring about an area of freedom, security and justice extended to include 25 Member States. The Council has, in particular, adopted nine regulations, seven directives and more than thirty decisions or framework decisions. That is a lot!</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Council has adopted the excellent and particularly pragmatic Hague programme with a view to strengthening the three pillars constituted by freedom, security and justice. The Council has invited the Commission to present an action plan in 2005 that will give practical expression to the objectives and priorities of the Hague programme, objectives that you are rightly demanding be pursued. We shall discuss the matter again this week at the Justice and Home Affairs Council, as well as at the June Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of asylum, the Council has adopted a directive concerning the minimum standards relating to the conditions that third-country nationals or stateless persons have to fulfil in order to claim the status of refugees or of persons needing international protection. In order to ensure greater solidarity between the Member States, we have established a European Fund for Refugees, which will make it possible to support the efforts made by the Member States in this field. Other measures need still to be adopted in this area, notably the proposal for a directive concerning the procedure for granting and withdrawing refugee status.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also given special attention to the immigration aspects by defining measures in the areas relating to admission. These have included, in particular, the successful integration of immigrants, which is an important aspect of the management of legal immigration, and the tackling of illegal immigration. Regarding admission, I should like in particular to emphasise that the Council has adopted the directive relating to residence permits issued to third-country nationals who are victims of human trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Council has created the European Border Management Agency. This agency will be operational as from 1 May 2005. The Luxembourg Presidency is making efforts to find a definitive headquarters for it, but I have to tell you that, with five candidates in contention, it cannot be assumed that there will be unanimous support for a solution, especially if none of the five countries gives up its candidacy, as none has done so far.</p>
<p class="contents">Where expulsion is concerned, several measures, of which you are aware, have been adopted, such as the joint organisation of shared flights for expelling third-country nationals. Two readmission agreements with Hong Kong and Macao have now entered into force. Those with Albania and Sri Lanka have been finalised. As the Presidency of the Council sees matters, these negotiations will have to be speeded up with a view to arriving at a broad network of European readmission agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Where visa policy is concerned, the Council has decided to add to the European Union’s budget the appropriations necessary for developing the VIS, the system whereby the Member States will be able to exchange data concerning visas and which will enable the national authorities to capture and update data relating to visas, as well as to consult such data electronically.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also adopted a regulation concerning the standards governing security elements and biometric elements that are part and parcel of passports and travel documents issued by the Member States. By doing this, we have created a basis for harmonisation whereby passports and travel documents must contain digitalised photographs of their holders’ faces, as well as recorded fingerprints. In accordance with this decision, the Member States will have until August 2006 to introduce biometric elements into passports. As we know, this deadline falls later than that established by our American partners for enabling people to enter their country without visas. I call upon all the EU institutions to convey a message of understanding to the US Government and, above all, Congress so that a situation that we should regret on both sides of the Atlantic does not occur in October 2005. The Presidency of the Council is working on this every day, as is the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of police cooperation, you know that, since the appalling attacks on New York and Madrid, the fight against international terrorism has become a priority. The European Union has resolved to act jointly in order to combat terrorism and assure its people of the best possible protection. The European Union’s strategy is global in character and provides for a whole series of measures. Mr Gijs de Vries was appointed as coordinator of the fight against terrorism in March of last year. His main tasks consist firstly of coordinating the Council’s work on combating terrorism, secondly of ensuring that an overall view is obtained of all the tools available to the EU and, thirdly, of carefully following the implementation of the action plan to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">This coordinating function within the Council – I emphasise this in response to the question put – is important if the various structures within the Council are to have a coherent approach in an area affecting development, the police, justice, defence, external policy and other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I should like to remind you that the Council takes steps to evaluate the implementation of the action plan every six months. This review took place in December 2004, and another will be carried out in June of this year. As President-in-Office of the Council, I attach particular importance to continuing to make these joint efforts to combat terrorism and to ensure – and this is important – that the decisions taken are duly implemented by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament also asked whether the Council would envisage converting the shared values and professional standards of the police into legislative measures. For the moment, there is no Council decision along these lines, and it has to be asked what now would basically change if this were the direction taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the integration of Europol into European Union law, I should like to remind you that the Hague programme specifies that the Council must adopt European legislation on Europol as soon as possible after the Constitutional Treaty has come into force and no later than in January 2008, taking account of all the tasks entrusted to Europol. In the meantime, Europol will continue with its efforts to improve its operations by making full use of the cooperation agreement concluded with Eurojust. Europol and Eurojust should, moreover, submit a report to the Council each year on their shared experiences and the precise results obtained. What is more, Europol and Eurojust should encourage recourse to the Member States’ joint investigation teams and facilitate their own participation in these.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also adopted complementary measures aimed at enabling the European Police College to develop progressively. In particular, we have conferred legal personality upon it and established its headquarters. Moreover, the Council has adopted several measures aimed at reinforcing police cooperation in certain specific areas. The Council has adopted the decision on combating vehicle crime. The number of vehicles stolen each year in the Member States of the European Union is currently estimated at 1.2 million. That is a huge cost, amounting to at least EUR 15 billion per year. This decision introduces better cooperation, designed to prevent this type of cross-border crime.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has taken several decisions aimed at combating violence connected in particular with football, the public disorder it entails and its consequences for those who respect the laws. In this context, we have taken several cooperation measures enabling us to put security measures in place, for example for the European Football Championship which took place in Portugal last year.</p>
<p class="contents">Where tackling drugs is concerned, the Council signalled its agreement in December 2004 to an anti-drugs strategy for the period 2005 to 2012.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to judicial cooperation in criminal matters, and taking account, on this issue too, of the question put just now by Mr Cavada concerning the quality of justice, I would inform you that the Council has noted with interest the recommendation of the European Parliament concerning the quality of criminal justice and the harmonisation of criminal legislation in the Member States. I would take the liberty of reminding you in this connection that the Tampere European Council has already defined the initial parameters for action in this field, and the 2004 Hague programme defines the actions it would be appropriate to implement in the future. A deciding factor in this context is mutual confidence in the Member States’ legal and judicial systems. Mutual confidence cannot be brought about by decree. It demands a set of measures, including a minimum number of common rules, the exchange of information and a more European-style training of police officers and magistrates.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004, the Council continued to implement the mutual recognition of judgments programme, which has to be anchored in the mutual confidence of which I have just spoken. In the area of mutual recognition, we have arrived at an agreement in principle on the draft framework decision relating to the mutual recognition of fines, as well as on the draft framework decision relating to the mutual recognition of confiscation orders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also examined the proposal aimed at devising a system for exchanging information extracted from police records with a view to promoting a better knowledge of convictions. I do hope that, in the course of this week’s Council and of the Councils to follow, we shall be able to make progress on this matter, which is important to the lives of people in our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also made progress in relation to substantive criminal law, particularly by adopting the framework decisions in the field of drug trafficking and several reports on the implementation of framework decisions on the subjects, especially, of combating money laundering and terrorism. In the Council, we have begun examining the proposal for a framework decision in relation to a number of procedural rights accorded within the framework of criminal procedures in the European Union, essential factors for creating the confidence of which I spoke just now. I shall shortly listen with interest to the report on this subject which is to be presented in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the retention of telecommunications data, which is the subject of the questions also put this evening, I would emphasise that the Council attaches great importance to this document in the fight against crime. It is not a question of telephone tapping but of storing data, for example telephone numbers, for a certain period. Yes, we are convinced that this document is useful, given the experience we have acquired as ministers for justice or home affairs. As a lawyer, I am well aware that the legal basis is important. Please, though! Let us not, either in the Council or in discussions between our institutions, waste too much time on the legal basis if, as I hope we do, we share the objective of fighting crime effectively while ensuring respect for the protection of private life – a concern of the Council too - and while bearing in mind the financial costs of these new measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall take a positive attitude to examining the proposals forwarded by the Commission to the Council just a few days ago, especially the opinion of the Legal Service in this regard. If I understand correctly, the Commission will submit a new proposal in the course of the next few weeks. It will be examined in the light of the Legal Service’s opinion. I would emphasise again, however, that, for the Council, the main thing is the content. Obviously, it will be possible to discuss all the other aspects mentioned this evening in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also made effective progress in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters which, moreover, constitutes an important dimension of Europeans’ lives. We perhaps speak too often, in the area of security and justice, of the criminal dimension. The Council has laid down rules when it comes to the mutual recognition of decisions relating to family law, commercial law or other areas of civil law. We have, for example, adopted the regulation concerning the order for uncontested claims. We have adopted a directive relating to the compensation of victims in cross-border situations. We have carried on with the work concerning the proposal for a regulation on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations, namely Rome II. It is, moreover, a proposal of particular importance since it is aimed at defining the law applicable, for example, in situations of liability due to defective products.</p>
<p class="contents">We have begun examining the proposal for a regulation to introduce a European payment order procedure. I hope that we shall soon be able to make progress, both in the European Parliament and in the Council, on the issues relating to the legal basis. What is more, we shall, while awaiting Parliament’s opinion, hold an orientation debate in this connection within the JHA Council in order to make progress with you on this important document. We have also begun examining the proposal for a directive on certain aspects of mediation so that it will be possible for the decisions taken in accordance with the directive to be recognised and implemented in all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The list is long, and I could go on; but you are aware of a lot of these documents. You can see that, in 2004, huge progress was made in constructing a more secure, more just and therefore freer Europe. My only regret is that there is still such a lot to be done and that progress is sometimes slow, given the need for unanimity in the Council and different legal traditions. In this European judicial area, the Council and the European Parliament share the same ambitions, I think. The Constitutional Treaty opens up new prospects for us. I am able to tell you, on behalf of the Council, that I am committed to constructive cooperation with Parliament and to working tirelessly to ensure that our people can live in security and freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Frattini,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, honourable Members, the Commission is obviously deeply committed to furthering a real, effective European area of justice, security and freedom. We intend to pursue this commitment in close and loyal collaboration with this Parliament and with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few strategic guidelines for our actions, which I shall very quickly explain to this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The first principle is seeking a balance – not a legal balance, but primarily a political and institutional one – between the two main demands made by Europe’s citizens: more security on the one hand, and more freedom on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot imagine a European area in which citizens are guaranteed more security but at the expense of their freedom, with a reduction in their area of freedom and safeguards. As Minister Frieden quite rightly pointed out, the added value that Europe can provide is to be found in this balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The second major guideline is solidarity, which we see as a principle that will enable us again to develop a European area in the vast field of immigration policy. We shall seek an appropriate balance between a firm stance against trafficking in human beings and illegal immigration on the one hand, and on the other a genuine European area for addressing legal immigration, which I think is an opportunity and not a danger, provided it is accompanied by suitable integration measures, for instance.</p>
<p class="contents">These are all lines of action on which the Commission will be working from this year, 2005, onwards, again with the idea that Europe can make a difference, in comparison with action by individual Member States. Consider, for instance, cooperation with non-EU countries – countries of origin and countries of transit – which need to be supported in their policies so that together we can manage the question of immigration and not just look on it as if the issue ought not to affect us directly, in the future or perhaps even now.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a third strategic guideline: strengthening the European area of justice – I mean civil as well as criminal justice. I see Europe’s commitment in this field to lie in promoting and not just protecting fundamental rights, starting with the establishment of an Agency for Fundamental Rights, the purpose of which will be precisely to promote full respect for these rights and not just to enforce them.</p>
<p class="contents">In all of this we shall need to work in conjunction with Parliament and the Council, creating those synergies that will be essential for performing all the activities that fall within our remit. First of all, the action plan – mentioned by Minister Frieden and Mr Cavada and others – will be submitted in time to be approved under the Luxembourg Presidency in June; it will of course be submitted before that, but it will take account of the debate which even today is bringing out some important points.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have pledged and as the Council has requested, the action plan will contain detailed measures, a timetable for adopting the provisions and an indication of the specific measures that the Member States must adopt, in order of priority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is certainly also considering a number of items that have not yet been directly addressed because the Constitutional Treaty has not entered into force; but there are certain aspects which, in the Commission’s view, deserve some preparatory work right now even though they will not be operational straight away. We are thinking of doing the preparatory work by the beginning of 2006, even before the Constitutional Treaty enters into force, an event that we fervently – very fervently – hope will happen.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall give just one example: democratic control of Europol and Eurojust is one of the really important aspects marking a step forward for the European area. Obviously, it depends on the European Constitution entering into force, but there is nothing to prevent the Commission from making an early start with a study and a report, so that we can be ready as soon as the Constitutional Treaty enters into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The action plan will then include a mechanism that not only Mr Cavada in his question but also, I think, many Member States would like to see: a mechanism for evaluating and monitoring the implementation of the action plan measures. As the President-in-Office of the Council has already pointed out, I believe such monitoring should be constant: it will take place every six months according to a system that has been a success in a completely different area, though it is the principle that counts: the internal market scoreboard ranking system. We are thinking of a model that works out the scores every six months, not with the intention of making threats or of naming and shaming, of course, but with the intention of helping the Member States to keep to the timetable for adopting the necessary initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, ladies and gentlemen, if we set a timetable and this timetable then remains just on paper, the Commission’s work becomes rather pointless. Instead, therefore, we believe we should help, encourage and spur on the Member States through a joint effort between the Commission and the Council, which in this respect is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall not dwell on what the main priorities are, as they have already been mentioned: terrorism requires a broad, non-emergency, prevention and reaction strategy, which must certainly respect people’s fundamental rights; personal data protection initiatives will be formally submitted very soon, and in the second half of the year there will also be a comprehensive data protection initiative under the third pillar, as I promised this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Organised crime is certainly a priority, with special attention for the victims of crime and of trafficking, particularly trafficking in human beings and particularly children, a group that I consider extraordinarily important: they are the most vulnerable victims of all and in my view deserve the strongest protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, fundamental rights. I have already mentioned the impact assessment that we are going to carry out: before being adopted, every Commission initiative will be evaluated against the system of fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution; no initiative that is out of line can be adopted by a Commission decision and offered to the outside world – a kind of prior conformity and impact assessment for EU-initiated legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a couple of final thoughts on Europe’s external actions in the field of security, freedom and justice. At the beginning of July we shall be putting forward a comprehensive communication on the international dimension of security and justice – of the European area of freedom, security and justice – reaffirming the role that Europe can and must play in the world as the defender and promoter of fundamental rights and of great principles and great values.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said on the subject of justice: confidence and mutual trust, and harmonisation are the two key concepts. Regarding immigration, I have already mentioned that trafficking in human beings must be hit hard, but we must have a healthy, balanced integration policy for those who enter legitimately. The Commission is of course looking forward with great interest to the results on the unresolved issues that the Green Paper on immigration has brought to the notice of everybody here, without prescribing solutions, as you know, but stating the issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This, then, is the spirit in which we want to work with Parliament. We shall work with the national parliaments to reinforce the principle, which we have written into the Constitution, of monitoring subsidiarity, and we shall also of course work with this Parliament, which will be, as it already is, an essential point of reference for us to carry out the initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We cannot give the new Commission credit for the progress that has been made, nor hold it responsible for the delays that have occurred.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, 2004 was the year in which the Prodi Commission left office and the Barroso Commission took up its duties; in other words, Frattini took over from Vitorino. It was, however, an historic year for three main reasons. Firstly, the EU was enlarged and now has a population of over 450 million inhabitants, giving it greater political, geographical and economic weight. Secondly, in addition to the economy and the internal market, we took on shared responsibility to address threats to stability and security, which are not restricted by borders, as in the case of terrorism; we must not forget the tragic events of 11 March in Madrid. Thirdly, as mentioned by Mr Cavada and Mrs Roure, major changes have taken place in the area of justice and home affairs, with a new institutional framework entering into force as regards visas, asylum and immigration, whereby codecision with Parliament and qualified majority voting in the Council now apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, the questions that we ask here, both to the Commission and the Council, are indicative of the concerns that we would like to see addressed. We want to know what initiatives are being taken and Parliament wants to monitor those initiatives. We do not wish merely to play a supporting role; we want our opinions to be taken on board, so that all EU citizens can live freely in a secure world, in which all kinds of disaster are combated and our freedoms are guaranteed. From this perspective, Commissioner Frattini, congratulations on the guarantees you have given us that greater security must not undermine freedom, and on your initiative in the Council as regards the European Day against the Death Penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, three aspects that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats considers fundamental: firstly, the entry into force of the Constitutional Treaty, with the consequent abolition of the pillar structure; secondly, that the codecision process should extend to areas such as legal immigration and integration, so that full democratic accountability can be guaranteed in the decisions taken in these areas; and thirdly and lastly, that judicial control should be improved by extending the Court of Justice’s powers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this EU of 25 Member States, the terms ‘outside’ and ‘inside’ have a different meaning, and this new world not only needs new regulations; it also needs new institutions, ones that do not just function in formal terms, but that really know those 25 Member States, including the domestic problems and fault lines of the ten new ones. This is why we are keen to ensure that the new institutions, the European Border Control Agency and the European Human Rights Agency, are really able to work substantively and effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is in fact caught in the middle of conflicting interests and expectations on the part of citizens: as Commissioner Frattini rightly points out, the citizens of Europe want more security and more freedom. However, we all know that we need more solidarity too, even though the EU is sometimes more tight-fisted about making gestures of solidarity than about keeping a firm grip on security.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that since September 11 and Madrid, we can expect to find ourselves compelled to take action against terrorism. We also understand that there may sometimes be a temptation to override the values of freedom or solidarity, but we must not allow ourselves to do so. For the sake of those who are looking to the EU as their new homeland, we must not let this happen. We welcome the increased differentiation in immigration policy, and we are pleased about the questions raised in the Green Paper. But please, when answering these questions, let us review the situation of the EU labour market with a critical eye, including the existing labour market supply in the new Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it hardly engaged the well-known dissatisfaction of this Parliament with both the quality and the manner of EU Justice and Home Affairs developments at all. A complete culture change is required in the Council, such that this Parliament is treated as a true partner.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the Minister said that we should not spend too much time worrying about the legal basis of the data-retention proposal is absolutely symptomatic of the fact that the Council just does not get it! It potentially makes a big difference, both to the degree of privacy infringement and to the degree of openness and democracy in decision-making, whether that proposal is based in EU law or is simply intergovernmental. The cavalier way that privacy concerns are treated in the Council is deeply worrying. More and more proposals infringe data protection norms. It is a slippery slope.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate goal will become – or is already – the linking-up of the whole series of EU and national databases on personal habits, biometric information and probably, eventually, DNA. This needs a serious public debate, mediated through this Parliament, on the basis of thorough privacy impact assessments accompanying each proposal. However, what we are getting is a process of salami slicing, where each new proposal removes a little more protection against invasions of privacy. This sly and shadowy method is not a clever strategy because if the European public one day finds it does not like the system of surveillance constructed, it will react strongly.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Minister to persuade interior ministries and home offices to change the habits of a lifetime and be open, candid and accountable in their dealings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first was that the Council would make no attempt to anticipate the provisions of the future Constitution. The second was that, if we are doing something for security, we should not argue about its basis in law. The former reflects a trend that has been apparent in debates over recent months, whether on counter-terrorism or data collection; one cannot help thinking that the Council has for some time been wandering around the outermost limits of the existing Treaties, and has – ever more glaringly and with ever-increasing frequency – been going against the guarantees of fundamental rights. I am thinking here of air passengers’ data and the debate on the collection of telecommunications data.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very evidently high time something was made clear, namely that the Constitution’s improvements in terms of what can be done for internal security, and the improved instruments it contains, are inseparable from the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights and from Parliament’s involvement across the board. The two cannot be put asunder. For that reason, as regards adherence to fundamental rights and to the foundations underpinning our laws, we will fight it out with you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The reference to freedom and justice is an insult to the peoples, when you are trying, on the pretext of terrorism, to terrorise people so that you can cover up the barbaric policy against the workers and the suppressive measures which are being taken and which you will try to use against those who react, when the Tampere programme has already resulted in the growth of an industry, a real factory turning out reactionary laws and mechanisms which strike at democratic rights and freedoms, and when you are setting up an unbelievable system to record social action and personal data in every country, with networks of cameras and other monitoring equipment. Everyone is monitoring everything: telephones, airlines, cameras on the roads, cameras in public places, zeppelins in the sky. Social struggles are being criminalised, while radical action is seen as the number one danger and is being indirectly but clearly included in terrorist threats.</p>
<p class="contents">2004 can therefore be evaluated as the year in which the push to the right in the European Union was speeded up, with the main target and enemy being the people. The response of the labour and grass-roots movement must be to step up the fight against non-compliance with and disobedience to reactionary laws and the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thinking back, for example, to the prevailing mood and spirit when we voted through the action plan to combat organised crime, it is noticeable that there is, in any case, a different rhetoric present today than there was in the nation states at that time. There is a serious imbalance, however. The Member States are neglecting fundamental human rights. The spirit of the new Treaty, which speaks of new forms of democracy and of respect for fundamental rights, emphatically cannot in actual fact be neglected. The European Parliament’s views cannot just be sidelined, leaving us to work on implementing the Treaty precisely as it stands. It is a question of making room for dialogue on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the issue of data storage is debated, it is time to discuss whether such measures make any sense at all. Mr Frattini has an extremely important responsibility, and I support what he said in his contribution. Even if the Luxembourg Presidency has the best intentions, many in this Parliament wonder in what direction the objectives and priorities of the Council as a whole are actually pointing. Data storage and monitoring are serious encroachments on people’s freedom. In this Parliament, we absolutely cannot agree to these matters being pushed through without there being cooperation with Parliament on the issue. We look forward with hope to Mr Frattini’s forthcoming efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that all the political parties in this House – or most of them – have sounded the alarm on the matter of personal data, of how we collate it and of how we protect it and yet it appears, despite all this, that over and beyond the words, which sometimes sound fine, the Council and the Commission have not understood what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously it helps, when you are fighting terrorism, to collate data; the question is how you do so, with what objective and if it is effective and, ultimately, what you are trying to oppress, as far as the personal rights of our citizens are concerned, in order to succeed because – if you will pardon the far-fetched example – torture chambers are also a very effective way of catching terrorists. We have decided, as Europeans, that we consider them illegal. We cannot say that whatever helps a police force is necessarily a good thing. Our policy on these issues needs to be a little wiser, a little more moderate and, in all events, better explained.</p>
<p class="contents">I absolutely agree with what Mrs Ludford said about salami slicing; it is a problem and it must stop. Let us hold a serious discussion, let us put all our cards on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">One example, not just of this, but also of the inability, at the same time, of the Member States to work together where they say they want to work together is an important part of civil protection and of the protection of the infrastructures in our countries from terrorist risks. The Council hands out money for that – and that is a good thing – but under no circumstances has the Council managed to instruct the Commission to work out a clear programme. The Member States are going to get money without cooperation. This does not work in practice; it sounds good to the citizens but it does not resolve problems.

Last year, an agreement was adopted, against the will of the European Parliament, giving the United States access to passenger name records. Just last Saturday, a KLM flight from Amsterdam to Mexico flying over the United States was denied access to US airspace and sent back to the Netherlands. Why? Because the US had found that there were two passengers on board who were on a US list of potential terrorists. How did the United States get that data? How did they get those names? The agreement on passenger name records applies only to flights from and to the United States, not flights crossing US airspace. The United States was therefore clearly breaking the rules and I would like to hear what action the Commission is going to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I very much welcome the words of Mr Frattini, who said that we should promote and not just protect fundamental rights, and I would like to add that we should promote values and not just make legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like Mr Frattini to inform us of the state of play regarding the creation of the working group on fundamental rights promised to us by Mr Barroso. I have not heard anything about it. I hope that this working group will look in particular at proposals to end discrimination against gay and lesbian people. For example, how about the recognition of married same-sex couples? How about tackling homophobia, which is on the rise? How about encouraging those Member States that have so far failed to recognise or compensate gay victims of the Nazi regime?</p>

These are new and highly significant factors as regards strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, many people voiced fears that this opening up of the EU could result in the threat of organised crime or uncontrolled migration being ‘exported’. Today, however, it is apparent that enlargement has had no negative impact on the European Union’s internal security. In fact the opposite is true, as the accession of a new group of Member States has meant that we can cooperate more effectively in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mutual trust is crucial in order to establish effective cooperation, and this is true for all aspects of the area of freedom, security and justice. This includes judicial cooperation in civil and penal matters, which is of enormous significance for the legal security of citizens. I would note that a lack of trust in the new Member States has been revealed in a number of instances, for example the unprecedented imposition of special transitional periods that apply before these Member States can become full members of the Schengen area. We are already seeing the first indications that the achievements made thus far by the new Member States have been recognised, for example in the Hague Programme adopted in November 2004. According to this Programme, Schengen assessments are due to start in the first half of 2006, and the deadline for entry into the Schengen area is 2007. The success of this process is dependent upon all the necessary requirements being met, however. This applies above all to the European Commission, which is responsible for setting up and coordinating the new second-generation Schengen Information System. The latter is to be handed over in March 2007, and I believe it is crucial that we make every effort to ensure that this date is met.</p>
<p class="contents">On top of this, it will be impossible to establish cooperation on internal security, viewed in the wider context of enlargement, if decisions continue to be taken in small and opaque intergovernmental structures, such as the G5 group, comprising the UK, France, Spain, Italy and Germany. This will particularly hold true if the reason given for not allowing the new Member States to join these groups is that so-called different operational cultures prevail in these countries, and that they cannot therefore participate in such bodies. An approach of this kind will do nothing to foster trust and good cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point relating to enlargement I should like to highlight is an important one, namely that action plans and strategies must be drawn up concerning the EU’s relations with the third countries along its lengthening eastern external border, because this is new territory as regards justice and home affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This thought is just as relevant for the European Community today as it was then. Of all the challenges facing Europe today, the two most important areas are the Lisbon Programme and the programme aimed at establishing an area of freedom, security and justice. I am convinced that these two fields are closely interconnected and mutually reinforce each other, and at the same time, that their success is interdependent. </p>
<p class="contents">While on this subject, one cannot escape the importance of taking action against illegal migration. Many people believe that one of the most important ways of doing this – in tandem with strengthening cooperation between border authorities and home affairs authorities – is to steer illegal migration in the direction of legal migration. This would alleviate Europe’s demographic problems, but at the same time it could also help boost economic growth by providing a much-needed new labour supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Migration of course impinges on human rights and values, and also on issues of discrimination and bias. Here I would like to draw attention briefly to the fact that 8 April has been declared International Roma Day, and that Europe’s largest minority routinely faces discrimination and displays of extreme intolerance. The position of the Member States on this issue varies, but this should not stand in the way of Parliament being able to bring about real change together with the Commission and the Council. Creating security and freedom at the same time in Europe will provide a better future for all its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to underline the importance for this Parliament of calling on the Council of the European Union to make the European Code of Police Ethics binding. This code was adopted by the Council of Europe Committee of Ministers on 19 September 2001 and ought to be considered the starting point for developing professional standards for the police in the European Union. Making the code law in the countries of Europe would represent an important contribution to the development of a European body of law more in keeping with international human rights and those national legislations that are more advanced concerning police matters.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the Union’s internal policy, turning the code into a binding legal act would, owing to the provisions it contains regarding training in ethics for police officers, have an important preventive and safeguarding function, so that – Mr Frattini knows what I am talking about – serious violations of human rights such as those committed by the Italian police in Genoa during the G8 Summit in 2001 will not happen again.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of external relations, adoption of the code would give the European Union greater international credibility. Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law in third countries is an essential factor for the EU in developing external relations and concluding international treaties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In one case, a person’s body was washed ashore by the sea. In the second case, which occurred yesterday, another corpse was found a few miles out, away from the Maltese coast and was brought to land by the armed forces. There is little doubt that both corpses belonged to persons who were victims of human traffickers – that severe and ruthless crime which is making the tragedy of illegal immigration in the Mediterranean much more difficult. And so it is most appropriate that we hold a debate like this one, today, to discuss what we are doing in Europe in a concrete way to resolve this problem. The Hague programme which should extend until 2010 is an ambitious programme which now truly leads us to a common policy on political asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore wish to congratulate the European Commission on its proposal which is related in a particular way to the problem which is referred to as 'burden sharing’. The Commission’s proposal, particularly that of setting up a special fund <span class="italic">ad hoc,</span> is a concrete step in the right direction so that the obligation is institutionalised, whereby the burden of the problem of immigration is shared by all and not only by those who are directly exposed to this phenomenon. It is a pity that the European Agency for external borders has not yet started its task when there is such an urgent demand that we start seeing a collective effort in this sector. I also agree with the Commission for the importance it is giving to this policy in terms of budget allowances especially in view of the new financial perspectives. On the other hand, I have my reservations on how much we should go on discussing the extension of competences, even regarding decisions taken through codecision in the field of legal immigration when there is still so much to do in the field of illegal immigration, especially in countries directly facing the problems and burdens of illegal immigration. We must show that Europe is capable of effectively meeting this challenge which is looming before her. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the EU’s system of powers – of the Member States and the European institutions – is not morally neutral.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge to public policy posed by issues of essential human dignity can be seen most clearly in the area of freedom, security and justice. The issues of asylum, immigration, the criminal justice system and the balance between freedom and security require consensus on justice, and, more often than not, the harmonisation of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, there are pressing issues to which I should like to draw the attention of the Council and the Commission. How do we address the question of illegal immigration, for example? Does this House accept the urgent need for a common policy, or do we leave it to each Member State to have its own policy, including criminal justice policy? How do the Council and the Commission propose to address the issue of prison reform? Do they feel that this, too, is an issue for each individual Member State, or does this area urgently require a common policy covering the entire criminal justice system, in other words, encompassing the stage of serving prison sentences and indeed sentence adjustments?</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that Europe is incomplete if it is simply an obsessive area of security. Europe will only be complete if, alongside concerns about the area of security, it effectively becomes an area of justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let me assure you that, in all the decisions we take, we try to maintain a balance between the three aims of this policy <span class="bold"></span> freedom, security and justice. We have said many times that we seek the parallel development of these three components. This is particularly important to us, and I therefore refute the allegation that Parliament needs to curb our ambition to create more security because it would be achieved at the expense of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">That is quite simply false, and I shall give you a few examples to illustrate my point. The day a murderer or rapist can be brought to trial because genetic fingerprints stored in DNA databases will enable us to secure his conviction, the public will be delighted, and so will you. Today, the culprit can move to another Member State of the European Union to avoid punishment, because there are no links between DNA databases, and when that happens Parliament will ask the Council why we did nothing to change the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to the linking of police records. If a person who has sexually abused children moves to another Member State, where the authorities are not made aware of that person’s past, people have every reason to ask why we continue to allow such things. We are currently examining how we can improve the interconnection of the data held in the various police records.</p>
<p class="contents">After 11 September 2001, we were asked – and rightly so – why we had not made any progress on the European arrest warrant when a legislative proposal had been before the Council for some time. We then took action, but, in the absence of any dramatic event, we are somewhat inclined to forget – as you are too, it occasionally seems – that active prevention of crime and terrorism means taking a number of measures while maintaining the right balance, of course, between freedom, security and justice. This is a concern we have in common, so for goodness’ sake let us forget this fallacy that Parliament houses the defenders of liberty while the Council is out to curtail our fundamental freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns data retention. What I have just said about the underlying principles also applies to the retention of data. I am nevertheless extremely surprised, and indeed shocked, by some of the assertions that have been made here, in which data retention has been put on a par with the use of torture chambers.</p>
<p class="contents">Has the European Parliament forgotten that – all of three years ago, I believe – we adopted a directive on data processing which allows Member States, under their national legislation, to preserve telecommunications data for a limited period of time for certain specific purposes. That directive was adopted by codecision.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to do today, in other words, is not to store the results of phone-tapping, the content of telephone conversations. We are simply trying to fight crime more effectively by establishing in a legal instrument, which we are currently discussing and which may be amended, the principle that what can be done nationally can also be done on a European scale, subject to the same conditions. My request is that we should all be more ‘European-minded’ when it comes to fighting crime.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that clear conditions and objectives are required regarding the data that may be retained, the retention period and the consultation of the data. This is no more and no less than what we already require in many of our Member States. Retained data have shed light on many drug crimes and terrorist crimes in our Member States. Let us therefore be realistic about the options that data retention opens to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, if the legal basis – which we shall be examining, as I said before – is such that we find ourselves partly within the first pillar, in such an eventuality the Council will have no problem in discussing the matter with Parliament, and I shall gladly come before the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs once again to discuss it in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, and I remain convinced, that this is a useful weapon in the fight against crime, and I hope we shall find the right mechanism. This is why, as I said, we obviously have to discuss the legal basis, and I have no problem at all with that. Those who asserted the opposite a short time ago are mistaken. Yes, I want to discuss the legal basis, but I also said that we should not waste our time with interminable discussions, because criminals could not care less about the legal basis and simply want to benefit from the absence of links between national systems and from the lack of a raft of clearly regulated mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council will therefore analyse the Commission’s legal opinion and the new Commission proposal, if there is one. In fact, the four Member States that tabled the proposal we are at present discussing in the Council want nothing more than to take their national instruments and request a European solution, which the Presidency of the Council finds perfectly normal.</p>
<p class="contents">My third remark concerns the external dimension. It is true that I did not mention the external dimension of immigration, but I thought I had already said more than enough on that subject; more to the point, my aim was to report to you on last year’s progress towards an area of justice. I could have spoken at great length on our approach and our work during the current year. I believe that the external dimension of the common justice and home affairs policy is extremely important in the context of both the immigration component and the anti-crime component. I consider it essential that, in the Mediterranean situation, in the Balkan situation, we take account of the external dimension of the justice and home affairs policy, because it has a direct effect on our Member States’ home affairs policies, and so I plead once more for a truly common policy on asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said to you before, with regret, regarding the progress made in 2004, these are only minimal rules, but it is good that they actually exist. We need the Constitutional Treaty in order to develop a genuine common policy on asylum and immigration, and the external dimension will certainly have to be given pride of place. I have often said that there is no longer a boundary between external and internal security, because all their component elements interact; this is the case in respect of both crime and immigration. These are two separate policy areas which are dealt with by the same configuration of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, turning to the question of transparency and consultation of Parliament, I am astonished to hear some of you plead for the premature entry into force of the new treaty. I believe that the Council listens to Parliament on the matters on which the Treaty prescribes that it must listen to Parliament. It decides jointly with Parliament where the present Treaty so ordains. If a new treaty enters into force tomorrow, we shall apply its rules. I am in favour of these new rules; I think I have made that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, Parliament is fully informed of the Council’s activities. Contrary to what some of you believe, we do not engage in salami-slicing tactics in relation to Parliament. We inform Parliament of all the decisions we take, and we update you on developments in all areas of the political agenda. We have done this, incidentally, with regard to our conclusions on biometric information in visas and residence permits and on the visa information system (VIS), and we shall continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we engage in salami-slicing of our objectives, because they are clearly established. They will be even more clearly established as soon as we have the action plan that makes it possible to transpose the Hague programme. That is why we want the programme. We asked the Commission to work quickly, because I should like us to adopt the action plan that emerges from the Hague programme under the Luxembourg Presidency in June. We shall then know exactly what goals to pursue, even though we might have to adapt the action plan once the Constitutional Treaty is in force.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark refers to a point I forgot to mention before, namely racism. I believe it was Mrs Roure who asked the relevant question. The Luxembourg Presidency truly attaches great importance to this directive. I have made every effort to bring it forward and put it back on the Council’s agenda, but, as with the other matters I have addressed today, there is a need to strike a balance between interests that sometimes conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">When I say that we should have common values in Europe and that racism must be categorically condemned, some people react by accusing us of stifling freedom of expression. This is a different type of argument from those in the other areas I spoke about before, but there is still a balance to be struck.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not put this draft on the agenda for this week’s meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council, because a number of Member States, especially the new Member States, said that they would like to be able to examine in detail the draft that the older members had already examined prior to enlargement. I can, however, assure Parliament that it is my firm intention to present this draft to the Council in June, because it is my wish – and we can all have our hopes and wishes – to see it adopted under the Luxembourg Presidency. Twenty-five Member States, of course, will have to agree on the wording; if that is substantially amended, it goes without saying that the European Parliament will be consulted again, but I do hope we make progress on this instrument, which is of particular importance to me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first is that many Members have raised a fundamental issue, which I had already touched on in my earlier speech. There is no doubt that the three essential elements that make up Europe’s action, in the three great areas of freedom – which means the promotion and not just the protection of freedom – justice and security, must all develop together.</p>
<p class="contents">To be even more explicit, in order to have adequate security we do not just need safeguards for people’s fundamental rights, but also actual development of the European area of justice. Clearly, on one side there are calls to harmonise or to try to bring some unity to certain basic principles – we shall be dealing with the subject of procedural rights in criminal proceedings in a few minutes – and I am highly in favour of this attempt at harmonisation, but then, of course, others say there is a need to consider the great difference in traditions, history and culture in our legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, then, that the Commission must take account of that as well. We shall certainly always work hard for these three great areas to develop in parallel in a balanced way.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding fundamental rights in particular, it has been asked what the group of Commissioners that President Barroso announced to Parliament is doing. The working group was, of course, set up last December. It has met many times; President Barroso presides directly and I act as Vice-President of the group, coordinating the necessary initiatives together with other colleagues. We have set out a road map – a series of actions and principles that we shall be addressing; we are already addressing some of them. Earlier I mentioned the subject of child protection; this is one of the subjects on which we have focused over the first few weeks and will continue to focus in future.</p>
<p class="contents">We have many other topics and, of course, when Parliament would like to listen to me directly in the Commission speaking about the progress that the group of Commissioners has made in its work, I shall be ready to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">We have mentioned racism and anti-Semitism as subjects that must remain on Europe’s agenda. I add my hopes to those of the President-in-Office of the Council when I say that Europe must not give the impression of being so feeble that it cannot reach an agreement, albeit not an easy one, by June, on a subject that has been before the Council of Ministers of Internal Affairs and Justice for a good three years. In hoping for this I am also, of course, appealing for agreement to be reached on this text at last and for there to be a joint framework that respects subsidiarity. I do not want the citizens of Europe to be told that after three years of debate we have not succeeded in duly affirming the fundamental principle that racism must not be allowed into Europe. This is another point on which the group of Commissioners has been working and will continue to work.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said on personal data protection. Nobody has a mind to create a European big brother that intercepts everything and keeps everything on file; the Commission, of course, has not the slightest intention of doing anything of the sort. We are thinking of a balanced initiative, which will first of all take account of the specific requirements of investigating certain serious cross-border crimes – terrorism, certainly, but also trafficking in human beings and paedophilia – and will be made available to specifically identified authorities for an appropriate time. There will thus be nothing like a permanent database, which none of us considers compatible with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will be putting forward its own proposal, as we have our doubts about the legal basis proposed by the Council. I have said it several times already and I shall say it again: in a few weeks’ time our proposal will be ready to be examined by the Council. We shall take account of Parliament’s assessments on this subject, as we have taken account – we must never forget this – of assessments by personal data protection authorities. These authorities have formed a body of undoubted expertise, including technical expertise, and have given appraisals that are often critical of the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We certainly take their appraisals into account and we shall continue to do so, but if, for instance, their appraisal of that proposal is favourable, we shall have a strong argument on our side, in the sense that the proposal respects the fundamental right to data protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word on asylum and European asylum policy. Here too our approach should be and will continue to be balanced: minimum procedural rights are essential, and they are a first step. Our ambition is in future – soon, I hope – to put in place a European system for recognising or revoking refugee status without any differences in treatment, marked by a high standard of quality and not by levelling down to a common standard, as someone suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not think that European policy can go back to being unbalanced, in the sense of addressing just the rejection of asylum seekers and not their acceptance and integration. Both aspects are relevant: there cannot be a suitable prevention or rejection policy if we are not willing to integrate those who come to Europe legally.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall certainly not be helping those who want to work honestly if we do not show that we take a clear, firm and rigorous stand against those who trade in human beings. These approaches are two sides of the same coin, and they will form the guidelines for Europe’s policy as far as the Commission is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
