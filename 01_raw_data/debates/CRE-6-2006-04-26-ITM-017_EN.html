<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sophia in 't Veld (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, allow me to start by expressing my support for the Commission’s maxim which you back, namely less, but better, state aid. Whilst I have nothing but praise for the Commission, I fear that I have to start with one tiny point of criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, it is deplorable, in my view, that the Commission, one week before we in this House vote on our position and our recommendations, is already presenting proposals, albeit at draft stage. In my opinion, if we consider each other to be allies in the fight for a stronger economy, we must also cooperate and respect each other accordingly. I therefore take it as read that even if we table proposals at this stage, they will simply be taken into consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The central message of the report, which it is to be hoped we will adopt tomorrow, is that state aid should remain an exception. It is an instrument to correct imbalances where the market does not produce the required results. State aid is not a regular policy instrument by means of which the government can create innovation, as it were, and it should certainly not be used to compensate for our failure to implement structural reforms. All studies are united in their conclusion that state aid is not the decisive factor in business decisions, or in competition for that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">It is far more important to create favourable conditions for innovation, experimenting, taking risks and, above all, investing. Indeed, the investors from the market will readily come to us if there is something to be gained and if barriers are removed. That means that we need to work on a sound patent regime, fair competition and free trade in the internal market, and in this connection it is regrettable – I should like to say this once again – that we failed to actually open up the market for services. We must work on immigration policy in a bid to help Europe hold onto the best forces and attract talent from outside. We must work on a good range of financial services, well-qualified work force, and suchlike.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not, after all, a matter of doubt that state aid can distort the market to such an extent that it can, in fact, hinder developments in the area of innovation, and so the proposed balancing test in your document strikes me as a fine tool, and the emphasis on assessing results of past aid is in line with Parliament’s position, which has also been adopted in Mr Hökmark’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am actually quite interested to hear where the Commission stands on the allocation of state aid in cases where there is a clear need for structural reforms, but where Member Sates simply do not succeed in this. I would, at this point, draw a parallel with an initiative which strikes me as rather absurd, namely the globalisation fund. If we fail to make the European Union competitive, we should not resort to makeshift measures. Moreover, an interesting example in this context is the fact that today, the government of one of the big Member States announced a new injection of EUR 600 million for innovation – which is very welcome in itself – but that on this very same day, the OECD issued a rather critical report of the results of the previous aid programme of that selfsame big Member State. The report certainly makes for very interesting reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that in the Commission’s proposals, as in Parliament’s forthcoming recommendations, reference is also made to non-technological innovation, because that is without a doubt a crucial development in our services economy. As far as the practical fleshing out and criteria are concerned, though, the rules seem to be very much based on innovation in the technological sectors, and I would therefore insist on the rules being usable for non-technological innovation too.</p>
<p class="contents">When we met yesterday, I expressed my concern about what is known as the matching clause. I double-checked, and the text really does state that the percentage of permitted aid can be increased if a competitor from a non-EU country receives more subsidy. I do not think that that should be automatically the case, because if there is a matching clause for state aid, then I would also like to see this introduced for all those other areas of policy that I have just mentioned and that are far more important as factors in competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Large enterprises are another potential subject for discussion, and, although I see that there are all kinds of precautionary measures to prevent us from subsidising individual large enterprises, I can still see one small cause for concern. I noticed in the proposals that large enterprises are entitled to a top-up, a bonus of 15% of aid intensity if two or more of them join forces across borders. Could this mean – and this is my final point – that we will be subsidising multinationals? That surely cannot be the intention, but, as I have already used up my time, I will have to leave it there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report follows Parliament’s very interesting and constructive opinion on the state aid action plan. I greatly appreciate the interest and involvement of MEPs in the process of reforming the rules on state aid. As you know, it is essential to have the right rules in order to help Member States use state aid tools in a targeted and prudent way in support of our shared goals of growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">You all know the substance of the Commission’s proposals on innovation. We emphasise – as Mrs in 't Veld rightly mentioned – that state aid is just one instrument among the many policy tools available to promote innovation in our economy. I could not agree more with Mrs in 't Veld on the key importance of structural reforms. State aid can help, but it is certainly not the only instrument – quite the contrary. We focus on concrete measures, not a general definition of innovation. In line with what Mrs in 't Veld said, we propose measures to support risk-taking and experimentation, as well as the business environment for innovation. Priority, by the way, is given to SMEs and technological innovation, but again not exclusively.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased that Parliament and a large majority of stakeholders are broadly supportive of the Commission’s plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs in 't Veld, your report is of high quality and strikes a good balance. I would like to congratulate you and the committee on it. Furthermore, the report comes exactly at the right moment. My services have just sent the Member States a first working document on the new rules. The rapporteur has expressed clear views. However, there is a background to this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of the Austrian Presidency I had an interesting discussion with the Austrian Minister for Economic Affairs. We talked about issues related to my portfolio in the context of the Austrian Presidency. He explained that innovation, research and development, as well as SMEs, were of high importance for the Austrian Presidency. He asked me to confirm that it would be possible to discuss those matters at the informal Council meeting in the spring – that meeting took place in Graz last Friday and Saturday, as you are aware. So I had promised that there would be something that we could discuss in detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be quite clear: the working document that I have sent is a preliminary report to begin consultation. That is of paramount importance. We will take into account the conclusions, the outcome and the atmosphere of this debate, as Parliament’s line in this state aid report is of key importance.</p>
<p class="contents">The working document, which is available on the website, is really a first stage, paving the way for consultation. It will be revised and refined in the light of the comments we receive, including your comments and thoughts.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope to finalise the new framework for research, development and innovation this autumn. I can assure you that in this process I will look with an open mind at Parliament’s constructive comments on issues such as innovation aid for large companies as part of clusters and the very helpful typology and conditions you propose for distinguishing between day-to-day operations and activities relating to innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">You suggest that certain limited forms of non-technological innovation should be eligible for state support for innovation. I am ready to look further at this, and I see your point, for example, as regards process and organisational innovation in services.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give very careful consideration to all your useful comments and ideas. I do not claim to have the magic formula here, and I am glad that Parliament is contributing so actively to the process to ensure that the final results give the highest possible level of added value in terms of European competitiveness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report by Mrs in’t Veldcan can count on the unanimous support of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, and I am indebted to the rapporteur for her sound report and also for her good cooperation. The report clearly formulates the basic principles underpinning the grant of aid for innovation and specifies the groups to which such grants can be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you are known as someone who always takes the opinion of this House very seriously. That is why, despite your statement, along with Mrs in’t Veld, I am disappointed that the Commission presented the preliminary framework as early as last week. This may well have been for the purposes of the informal Council, but it would have been right and proper for you to postpone this consultation so as to take Parliament’s opinion into consideration, which would have amounted to just a few weeks’ delay.</p>
<p class="contents">The report contains a number of points which I would urge you to take note of now and make more prominent in the future. Fortunately, two of those have already been debated today, so we should be able to agree on the substance. Whilst I am particularly concerned about the contribution of large enterprises, as you say, in connection with clusters, of course, we should not underestimate their innovative force, or the support that may be required at cluster level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make a point of mentioning non-technological innovation again, and my third and final point is that there is a need for more clarity about the way in which state aid applies to universities and research institutes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Innovation is one of the key instruments in revitalising the EU’s international competitiveness and in implementing the objectives of growth and employment set out in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">In an imperfect market, however, such as that of innovation, this does not happen naturally and needs to be driven. Despite the importance of this area, however, there is no firm European aid policy either for innovation or for research and development. What is more, the common financial resources are woefully inadequate, as evidenced by the financial perspective on which we are soon to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore dependent on policies laid down in each Member State. This requires conciliation with competition policy and with the functioning of the internal market, which is not always easy. The huge imbalances that still exist between European countries and regions can, moreover, lead to major differences in the quality and amount of aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies and institutions from the outermost regions should not be barred access to the Europe of knowledge and innovation. We are aware of the difficulty of this task, but also of its importance to the future of Europe. We therefore hope that the concerns of Europe’s citizens expressed by their representatives in this Chamber are accorded due attention by the Commission, in spite of the reports that have emerged and that have been mentioned by previous speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">The report before us is the result of conciliation and constructive negotiation at Parliament level. As shadow rapporteur for the Socialist Group in European Parliament, I wish to express my gratitude for the openness shown by the various Members involved, including people from my group and others, and would like to commend Mrs in 't Veld for her report.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the proposals adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I should like to draw the attention of this Chamber and the Commission to a number of issues: The first of these is the need both to simplify, and to improve the transparency and comparability of, the bureaucratic procedures involved in awarding State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Clarity is crucial, not only to allow the Commission to assess the conformity of those procedures, but more importantly in order that the criteria and the impact of State aid can be made clear to businesses, to the citizens and especially to SMEs. Concepts such as ‘market failure’ as opposed to ‘market inefficiency’ are probably not very clear to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">More relevant perhaps is the review of some policy instruments in light of the available experience. Let me quote some of these: Firstly, the role of public capital versus private capital in aid for innovation processes must be clarified. The perception of risk and unbalanced information often alienates private investment in some of the bigger projects and the role of public investment cannot be replaced in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the concept of innovation must go beyond just technological innovation, as has already been mentioned. Innovation will only make sense if it also includes non-technological aspects, both in industry and services. Thirdly, the typology of enterprises eligible for aid must be reviewed. There is no justification for having size and duration of support, for example, as key criteria. In the case of risk capital, there is no point in having too much delimitation in the early stages of start-ups and then none at all in subsequent stages, when it would probably be more necessary and more useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, it is worthwhile adapting cohesion policy to objectives that are more compatible with the Lisbon Strategy, such as the strengthening of immaterial assistance, and the strengthening of the assessment and monitoring thereof.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Parliament should pay particular attention to the competitiveness of European producers on the world stage in relation to State aid awarded by third countries to new competitors in various industrial sectors. This issue ought to be pushed higher up the agenda in the Union’s international trade negotiations. Nevertheless, amounts of aid awarded to competitors from outside Europe should be taken on board in the definition of the European framework for State aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I have referred to just a few of the issues, and I should like to add just two more: The first relates to the clarification of State aid in the case of clusters, and I was delighted to see you refer to this specifically in your speech, Commissioner. I refer to aid to innovation-related clusters and to existing clusters, many of which will only survive if they manage to adopt a dynamic of innovation. Often being horizontal in nature, this process of innovation requires public assistance. This assistance is a crucial factor in fostering, and in removing obstacles from, cooperation between agents.</p>
<p class="contents">The second of these two closing themes concerns the need to combine State aid for innovation with cohesion policy more consistently, in order to ensure that we are not in fact building a two-tier Europe as regards the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">We see State aid as one of the keys to overcoming the innovation deficit in Europe, although it is neither a priority instrument, nor a single instrument. That being said, the success of Europe as a dynamic, competitive and cohesive area depends on the quality of that aid. I am convinced that the spirit of cooperation between Parliament and the Commission will produce positive ways forward in relation to the objectives which we hold dear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I broadly support her position, although I am not sure that I would like to replace the term ‘market failure’ with ‘market inefficiency’. Market failure can and does occur; a case in point is that of peripheral regions where population is sometimes insufficient to support the market. While there may still be some inefficiencies in that market, it certainly does not reflect the whole picture.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I support the rapporteur where she asks that the Commission take into account state aid granted by the EU’s international competitors. I also support Amendment 9, which is in the same vein.</p>
<p class="contents">The state aid action plan says that we need to maintain a level playing field for all companies active in the single market. While this is in line with the Treaty, we do not live in a vacuum: outside influences and policies have an impact on Europe’s internal checks and balances. We must be able to respond to that challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">One concern I have about the Commission’s document is that it focuses strongly on aid for innovation by SMEs. We need to be careful that we do not discriminate against large firms because we could seriously hinder efforts in building networks and linkages of large multinational companies into EU innovation systems. We must be very vigilant that we do not encourage large firms to move their research and development and innovation activities outside the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support the suggestion that the EU should step up its efforts to meet the target of 3% of GDP investment in research and development. Indeed, I wish to express my disappointment that my own country, Ireland, has a much lower target.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I support using state aid to encourage innovative research into renewable energy technologies, in particular supplying equipment to process biomass, biofuels and so on. There is an opportunity and I believe we can be world leaders here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is there not something wrong here? If the research work would not otherwise be undertaken, then this is probably because the expected payoff from the research is too small to justify the expenditure. The EU deceives itself into thinking that it knows how to direct funding towards the right kind of innovation. It is more likely to direct the funding into waste and bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a better plan: tax our businesses less and stop suffocating them with too much regulation and interference. Allow them to reap the profits from their good ideas, and I believe we would see an explosion of innovation.

It might be the late hour, but I very much support what they have said here tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline one thing that I think is important when we are discussing the policy for supporting innovation: there is no better precondition and no better basis for innovation than competition. It is the broad and strong policy of competition that is the best precondition for innovation. It is better to provide opportunities for thousands of entrepreneurs and innovators to work on an equal basis with each other than to support one at the cost of the other. It is very important to remember that, and everyone has pointed that out. The most important thing for the Commission to do is to uphold competition and to be strong in defending small companies and small entrepreneurs. By doing so, we will achieve a climate of an innovative society in our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to underline that the policy of state aid must aim for less, but better, targeted aid. Support for innovations must not be an alibi or an excuse for increased state aid, because we must appreciate that innovations are a normal process of entrepreneurship, and we cannot have state aid designed to support normal entrepreneurship. State aid for innovations should be provided for those innovations and processes that otherwise would not take place in normal marketing or in normal business. It must be temporary, and it must be aimed at the clusters that are open to everyone, not excluding anyone: then we can have a good policy for innovations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenges of globalisation require that we attain new competitive advantages that prevent us from losing competitiveness and close the gap between the European Union and the most advanced economies. Without innovation, it will be impossible to achieve the Lisbon Strategy’s sustainable growth and employment objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovating means moving on from speculation to change, ensuring that knowledge and technology are applied in order to improve businesses and take advantage of business opportunities within a pluralistic society. Although it springs from personal creativity and talent, innovation does not arise spontaneously, but rather it is propelled by many social factors. We therefore need a broad approach to innovation, which goes beyond the purely technological.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing European resources dedicated to innovation, which are currently low compared to the United States and Japan, can be compatible with a stricter use of public aid. The former is a question of resources and priorities and the latter, of focus and justification.</p>
<p class="contents">Public aid for innovation is a legitimate instrument for public action which is needed in order to remove the obstacles caused by market deficiencies, amongst which I include asymmetries of an international nature. It must be drawn up rigorously; its application must be transparent and non-discriminatory; and its effect global, favourable to competitiveness and quantifiable.</p>
<p class="contents">Under these circumstances, rather than the last, aid is the best solution. The opportunities, advantages and benefits of innovation must be extended to everybody and must be inclusive. The SMEs and new companies deserve special attention insofar as they face more difficulties accessing innovation and promoting it. Promoting innovation is necessary in order to achieve the convergence of the least-favoured regions and cross-border cooperation. Regional aid and innovation must be complementary; its incentives must be organised in such a way as to prevent distorting effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur for her report, which has allowed us to move forward on these issues, and I hope that we can still achieve new consensus in plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are a guarantee of innovation, they are flexible and they account for two-thirds of all employment. Every major corporation started out as a small enterprise – Volkswagen, Microsoft or Google, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">This is proof that supporting innovative business ideas with a good commercial strategy brings benefits to the whole of society. A globalising economy, trade liberalisation and uniform trading rules have already brought numerous challenges and opportunities to many businesses. Translating these opportunities into concrete products and services demands conditions that will foster entrepreneurial activity.</p>
<p class="contents">I have pointed out earlier, at the time of Edit Herzog’s report into the effects of globalisation on the internal market, the need to create a sound environment for SMEs by giving them access to finance and to risk capital, particularly in the early stages of their development. I would like to thank the rapporteur in 't Veld for drawing attention to the additional use of risk capital as an external long-term source of funding for companies. Access to risk capital is important for supporting innovation. To achieve this, State aid is required, which as an additional instrument needs to be timely, transparent and targeted. In this way we can improve the competitiveness of our national economies and of the European single market as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is an important signal to the business community that the European Parliament wants to create a stimulating entrepreneurial environment for small and medium-sized start-ups with innovative ideas but without the financial resources to carry out their plans.

I am not going to repeat the arguments that have been expressed here, with which I fully agree.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that we need more innovation in Europe; it is very clear the SMEs are the protagonists; it is even clearer that we are in favour of free competition; it is also very clear that State aid is an exceptional instrument. Nevertheless — and this is what I would like to add — State aid is also effective; it is effective in many cases, in order to create employment, in order to create well-being for great numbers of European citizens. I therefore believe that, when we talk about who the potential beneficiaries of that State aid are, we must look towards the least-favoured regions; we must look towards those who, as a result of an insufficient financial perspective, are going to have less European aid for their development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this field, I would also like to insist to the Commissioner on the need for innovation not to be an excuse for cutting aid to those who, as Europeans, have every right to share in the benefits of economic growth, because that is how we create Europe, by granting aid that genuinely promotes the territorial cohesion of Europe and equal opportunities for all Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are feeling the results of this here in Europe today. In order to close the gap between us and our global competitors, there needs to be an increase in public and private investment facilitation for our companies engaged in research and development, and there needs to be increased dissemination of results.</p>
<p class="contents">The points raised in the report by my colleague justify the very strong link between this lack of innovation and our inability to maintain the targets set in the Lisbon Strategy. One: we need to take the regulation further; two: we need investment in education and training; three: we need adequate infrastructure; four: we should facilitate access to risk capital.</p>
<p class="contents">These four points must be taken into serious consideration, not only as topics to discuss, but ones on which we must act urgently. With the US and Asia now exercising such authority in the innovation sector, we must act now. I would also like to stress the importance of SMEs within our economy and the difficulty that they face in investing in R&amp;D. It is necessary that we provide them with the means to invest, not only by providing funds, but by providing, for example, incubator centres and forums where they can network, thus providing them with a means to stimulate growth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Access to these platforms is nowadays open to anyone with an interest in using them, and so it is a very good thing that we should give some thought to how people can get into the business world, and what support can be given to them. It is in the initial stages that risks are particularly large, and if the state is to have, through taxes, a share in a firm’s profits later on, then it can also take a share of the risks involved in starting out.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet more important, though, is what happens to a business when the older generation hands it on to the younger. It is at times like these that businesses are particularly vulnerable, when what is needed is not taxation, but rather real support and help of the kind that enables the young entrepreneur to be innovative and to modernise and renew the business.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that it is vital that the infrastructure, training and development of skills should, in future, be brought together in clusters, thus enabling the interested parties to be successful, and, at year-end, in the black. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Better targeted state aid for innovation is indeed a core aspect of our state aid reform programme. The Commission will do its utmost to improve framework conditions. We are listening very carefully to stakeholders and your report makes a vital contribution. To put it in Dutch: <span class="italic">Gedane zaken nemen geen keer</span>. That said, next time I will take account of your request in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to respond to a few issues raised in our debate this evening. Mrs in 't Veld asked why we are suggesting a focus on cooperation between companies and between Member States. There are two main reasons: we must encourage this cooperation because it reduces distortions of competition and increases benefits for the Community. The second reason is that we must also encourage improvement of the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">A couple of speakers mentioned the question of large companies’ eligibility for state aid for innovation, particularly in part of the clusters. I have taken careful note of that. Your comments tie in with what we have heard from other stakeholders including ministers at the informal competition Council meeting last Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore reflecting on the conditions in which such aid may be appropriate. In fact the working paper prepared by my services already includes the possibility of providing aid to large companies as part of clusters. However, I would like to be clear that if we go down this route there will need to be proper checks and balances to prevent distortion of competition and to ensure that the overall effect, for example the benefits generated by collaboration, is positive.</p>
<p class="contents">I could not agree more with Mr Hökmark’s statements. At the end of the day it is competition that makes the climate, not state aid. Therefore it is an instrument to foster and to bring into a situation where everyone has an opportunity to make his living in a way in which innovation is involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Globalisation was touched upon as well – by Mr Casa, Mrs Ferreira, and Mrs Harkin. It is true that our state aid control system is unique in the world. So too is our internal market – our greatest European achievement – and the reason we have state aid control in first place.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard all too often the argument that our state aid rules could reduce investment into Europe as third countries may offer subsidies more liberally than Member States. This argument is based on wrong perceptions. As Mrs in 't Veld and Mr Casa said, there are other factors influencing inward investment positions. State aid is far down the list. After general and structural criteria, general political climate, general business environment, red tape, regulation, taxation, closeness to customers, availability of labour, a skilled labour force, availability of resources, availability of the infrastructure: at the end of the list there is sometimes the state aid argument.</p>
<p class="contents">With my responsibilities, I have the opportunity to meet quite a number of managers from the business world and when we touch on this item – what is the main issue for you and your company in taking a decision on location? – the other arguments I have just mentioned are far more important. Of course they also add that if there is state aid we will take it, we would be fools if we did not. But it is not the main reason; it is at the end of the list.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore using state subsidies to safeguard European companies is very costly in economic terms and it is often the poorest parts of society that foot the bill.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very wary of arguments that, in the absence of aid, a company will invest outside the EU. This argument presupposes that, if there is an alternative location outside the EU with similar characteristics, the aid will tip the balance. In the absence of such proof, this argument may amount to no more than a bluff. We want real arguments and not bluff.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I am ready to look further at whether the new framework could include criteria for assessing the effects of aid granted elsewhere. As you are aware, personally I am not a fan of a matching clause. I have to consider it as an option in response to comments I have heard from several stakeholders and I will look at it, but I am personally not in favour of this instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferreira mentioned the regional dimension and the recent regional aid guidelines, which already provide a flexible instrument to address cohesion issues. There could be a reaction and in this context we introduce the possibility of a new category of aid which can be granted to support start-ups in addition to regional investment aid.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very much in favour of backing and boosting the start-ups because, as I sometimes mention, when you do not need money the bank is interested in giving you money, and if you are interested in money the bank is not interested in you. Start-ups in most cases badly need the help of a bank or the guarantee via state aid of obtaining a loan or financial assistance for their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Enterprise aid allows Member States to provide up to EUR 2 million per enterprise in Article 87(3) regions and up to EUR 1 million in Article 87(3)(c) regions. The regional bonus for R&amp;D and innovation would actually undermine our cohesion objective and be counterproductive. If a Member State makes less use of enterprise aid in assisted regions and favours innovation aid, it might put at risk the emergence and reinforcement of a necessary industrial basis, which is a prerequisite for further regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">If a Member State grants more aid than necessary as an incentive for industry to carry out a given innovation project, it crowds out private investment and may generate undue windfall profits.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Harkin raised the types of research and development and innovation activity which state subsidies will target. I would remind you that we have deliberately focused on scope rather than content. Indeed while we can help focus state aid on certain areas of common interest, it is up to Member States themselves to decide a precise project that they would like to support and not for the Commission to dictate this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will provide separate notification of the guidelines on aid to environmental protection next year and, in this context, equal innovation will get my full attention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end of the day it is only through a positive partnership and a complete range of pro-innovation policies that we will be able to deliver growth in jobs in the European Union. Thank you for your support, thank you for your valuable contribution to this process, and thank you to Mrs in ‘t Veld and her shadow rapporteur for their work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The linkage between knowledge, technology and their market opportunities with the support of well targeted state aid is paramount to the relaunch of the growth and employment objectives of the Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Fostering the EU’s innovative potential should not obviously hamper the preservation of fair competition among Member States and within the various sectors concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s innovation level and investments lag dramatically behind those of its trading partners and competitors; the question of state aid should therefore be carefully addressed. The challenge is to establish an appropriate reform of the state aid policy in order to better contribute to innovation, sustainable growth, socio-economic cohesion and environmental protection while avoiding excessive competition distortions. Within the framework of the ‘less and better targeted state aid’ objective, state aid should therefore remain an instrument to correct imbalances with genuine added value where necessary. State aid may be an effective instrument to address market failures but only if allocations are made according to open, transparent and non-discriminatory criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
