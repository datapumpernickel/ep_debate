This decision is without prejudice to the negotiations which are continuing on an amicable settlement to the current dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be very clear. We are very close to a solution, and I remain convinced that an amicable solution is in the best interests of all parties, the UK, France and the Community. Negotiations and contacts are continuing over the few outstanding issues which continue to block an agreement. I am hopeful that with a little goodwill on all sides the ban can be lifted in the very near future. I am aware that there are critics, including in this House, of the discussions that have taken place in this case. However these discussions are the best means to reach an early solution.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of formal procedures to lift the ban within the EU, the situation is even more difficult. The British efforts to lift the ban in third countries, including the US, and in its Commonwealth partners, bear this out. Nonetheless it is necessary for the Commission to formally signal that France has not fulfilled its obligations to lift the ban. I am asking France therefore to submit its position in reply within two weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also informed the Commission of the situation concerning Germany, the only other Member State which continues to impose a ban on the import of UK beef. In this instance, however, the German authorities have not declared that they will not lift the ban. Instead their position is that a number of constitutional steps have to be cleared, in particular the approval of the Bundesrat. In Germany’s case also, however, there is now a need for positive action to lift the ban. I will be reviewing the situation in the next few days with my services in this respect: in particular Germany will be asked for an indication of its timetable for lifting the ban. I will be insisting on equivalent treatment for both countries, and a communication will be sent to Germany in this regard requesting its proposals on a timetable for lifting the ban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Provision is made in that Article for sending a letter of this type prior to the actual institution of the proceedings. But it is part of the infringement proceedings and is regarded as the first step. It sets out in chronological form the present position, how we have reached this stage; it then sets out the legal position and then requests France to respond and set out whatever arguments it wishes to advance in its reply. All this is to be done within a period of two weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the discussions over the last few weeks, a number of issues were discussed, as you are probably aware, and one of the issues that was identified was the question of tests, as you rightly identify in your question. You draw attention to the fact that during my hearings on 3 September before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I mentioned that it was my intention to establish diagnostic testing for BSE on an EU-wide basis. That is still my intention. That fact was also drawn to the attention of the parties who were involved in these discussions over the last couple of weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned on that occasion, one of the purposes of establishing such a testing system is to ensure that there is an equal testing system throughout the European Union so as to identify the levels of infectivity throughout the EU, and in particular to identify what further measures may be necessary. The removal of SRMs would be one particular issue I have in mind in relation to that.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of identification and labelling, one of the important issues that we discussed over the last few weeks was the requirement contained in the legislation for traceability. That is an important issue. It was discussed in Florence. It also forms part of the DBES and is in the forefront of our minds in relation to this and has been incorporated into our discussions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wonder whether the Commissioner can explain why he has not acted more firmly and insisted earlier that a unanimous scientific opinion is not negotiable. This Parliament deals with laws; the people who elected us – certainly in the United Kingdom – are waiting to see the law enforced and have been waiting since October. This is a very bad precedent for the European Commissioner, given that he is about to write a White Paper on a food safety agency. Are all unanimous scientific committee opinions delivered to him in future to be negotiable? We hope not. Secondly, where exactly is France raising problems and can the Commissioner confirm that any problems raised by France must result only in clarification to the French and not in any changes to the British date-based export scheme?</p>

It has not been a negotiable issue nor has it in any way been undermined in the discussions that we have had over the last few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a good day for the rule of law, I believe that it is a good day for the Commission and I would suggest that it is also a good day for all the institutions of the European Union including Parliament. A decision was taken in the Commission today to initiate infringement proceedings rather than not to initiate legal proceedings. In those circumstances, I find it difficult to understand how this could be described as a sad day for Parliament or a sad day for the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">These proceedings, as I say, have been decided upon today and they will be initiated unless the discussions that have been taking place produce results within the next few days. We came close to resolving these issues over the last few days – I had expected them to be resolved if not yesterday, then certainly this morning. I was disappointed in that, but I believe that we may yet finally resolve this issue over the next couple of days.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to remind Members of the House that, as I have said on a number of occasions, problems of this nature are much better resolved in an amicable way. The resort to litigation is necessary in circumstances where the parties to a dispute or a difficulty cannot reach agreement. In the case of this dispute, it seems to me that if these two Member States can resolve this difficulty through discussion, in association with the Commission, that would be by far the best way forward. It would also achieve a much faster result. I would imagine that the people that Mrs Jackson represents in the UK would like to see this matter resolved quickly, rather than in two years time, by a verdict from the Court. That is why I have pursued this particular line and will continue to do so despite the decision today to initiate infringement proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That obviously was an issue of some considerable concern to me. But also because the Commission and myself, and my service in particular, have been looking at the establishment of an appropriate structure for a food safety authority.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the issues that will be of paramount importance in considering such a structure will be its jurisdiction and how, in particular, it will relate to any food safety agencies established at Member State level.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, a controversy between these two agencies such as we have had over the last few weeks cannot be tolerated if we hope to have a unified harmonised market. Confidence in such a food safety authority at Commission level will have to be such that Member States and the authorities and scientists in Member States, have full input into such an agency but also have confidence in it so that its opinions are fully and readily accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the situation in Germany that you asked me about, as I said earlier, my discussions with the minister responsible in Germany lead me to the conclusion that the German Federal Government wishes to move towards lifting the ban and that the discussions arising out of the dispute involving France will ease any lingering concerns that may exist in Germany. I have been in constant communication with the authorities in Germany – they have had an input into the discussions that have taken place over the last couple of weeks at observer status level, and I am confident that they understand what has been discussed over the last couple of weeks. Therefore, I have every hope that the Federal Government of Germany will take the appropriate steps now to lift the ban.</p>

We were told several weeks ago that today was the deadline – and yes, the Commission has initiated proceedings. But for heaven’s sake Commissioner, by indicating today and presumably also at your press conference, that there is another two weeks, you will make everyone read that as meaning that you have simply extended the deadline.

It provides specifically for the sending of a letter of this type and it also specifically calls for a response within a period of two months. I felt that a period of two months was too long; I felt that a period of one month was too long; I felt that a period of two weeks was appropriate. In those circumstances, that is the period of time that I have included in the letter which is the first step in the initiation of proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents"><br />I should say that this does not mean giving anybody a further two weeks. The decision today has been to initiate proceedings. That was a decision I said that I would put before the Commission some weeks ago. That is what I have done. It is the first step. It sets out the chronology of the events and the legal position and requests the Member State in question to respond within a period of two weeks. No further time has been given. This provision is contained in the Treaty of Rome as amended and is something which I cannot change now – other than to shorten the period, which I have done. However, I should say that the fact that the letter stipulates a period of two weeks within which to reply does not preclude further discussions taking place and an agreement being reached within the next couple of days, if that proves possible. It does not in any way undermine that process because we are, as it were, moving on two separate tracks.</p>
<p class="contents">So I have to assure you that the inclusion of fourteen days in the letter does not, in my mind, suggest an intention to stave off negotiations or further discussions for a period of two weeks.

Mr Byrne, you promised when you entered office that you stood for preventive consumer protection and for transparency. I would like to ask you, as my colleague has already asked, how you tie that in with the precautionary principle and credibility. In the hormone dispute we are taking the side of the precautionary principle, but not here. This seems to be a form of force-feeding if consumers do not have the option to be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">How can you promise transparency for the consumer and also postpone the date for labelling? How do consumers have the right to freely decide for or against this meat? What do you think about Article 36 being violated? Article 36 gives Member States the option, when there are health risks, to impose an embargo. Where is there more doubt than here? We know little about the incubation time. You know that the advisers have expressed grave doubts, including doubts over the problem of transferability. So that is my question. I believe that that you are undermining Article 36 and that you are trampling underfoot the precautionary principle and transparency for consumers by taking this decision prematurely instead of actually ensuring that foodstuffs are exactly what they should be, suitable to eat and free from health risks!</p>

I have available to me a unanimous opinion of the Scientific Steering Committee. It is a further opinion expressed by that committee, following an earlier one. I make the decision on the basis of that. In my view it is a fully transparent process. The decision is based, as I say, on the opinion of the SSC. I cannot see that there is any lack of transparency in relation to that.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the question of the precautionary principle. The application of the precautionary principle is sometimes not fully understood. It only applies in circumstances where either there is no scientific evidence or the scientific evidence that is available is so uncertain so as to be unreliable, and in circumstances where the damage that can be caused is of an irretrievable nature and the remedy that is proposed is proportionate, cost-effective and time-limited.</p>
<p class="contents">To compare the situation of BSE and hormones seems to me to be inappropriate. The precautionary principle is not being applied in relation to hormones. The decision in relation to hormones in beef and its importation is based on scientific evidence – that was supplied to the Commission before I came into office by the appropriate scientific committee – to the effect that one of the hormones in particular – 17 beta-estradiol – is a complete carcinogen.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that evidence, it seems to me to be appropriate to impose the ban. It also seems to me to be inappropriate to lift the ban with that opinion in place.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the BSE issue, once again it seems to me that the application of the precautionary principle is inappropriate because we have a firm opinion from the Scientific Steering Committee. Its members are drawn from most Member States of the European Union, scientists at the very pinnacle of their careers and abilities who advise on this issue. Therefore, I follow their advice. Since there is scientific advice on the issue the application of the precautionary principle is not appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the labelling issue, the whole question is currently being examined and is before Parliament. It will be open to Parliament to amend the legal principles if it so wishes.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised the question of Article 36. In my opinion Article 36 would be an inappropriate defence and would not provide a defence in the circumstances of this particular case. It does not provide, as I understand it, for a situation where there is a harmonised market as there is in this instance.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to transmission, there is no evidence of any other form of transmission of BSE other than the two that have been identified, which are feed and maternal transmission. Until such evidence is available it is appropriate to proceed on the basis that these are the only two methods of transmission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that since taking up this job eight weeks ago I have concentrated on the European Union. In relation to deficiencies in stock and so on, my understanding of the operation of the DBES scheme is that it protect public health and ensures food safety in relation to the exportation of UK beef. I would also draw your attention to the statement contained in the communiqué from the Scientific Steering Committee that beef exported under the DBES scheme is as safe as any other beef in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the end of a long consultation process involving the Council and Parliament. Essentially it provides for the following: a lowering of current tar content in cigarettes; the introduction for the first time of a limit on nicotine content in cigarettes; the introduction of limits on carbon monoxide; improved and bigger labels on cigarette packs on the dangers of smoking and on the tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide content of cigarettes; controls on the misleading use of descriptions such as ‘mild’ and ‘low tar’ etc.; and new safeguards on additives to tobacco.</p>
<p class="contents">The case for such a directive is clear. The Community has very important public health obligations, especially since the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty. These include the obligation to ensure a high level of health protection in all Community policies and activities. Smoking kills half a million citizens in the European Union each year and is the single, biggest, preventable cause of death. We must therefore be seen to take strong measures to tackle the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive, when adopted, will provide European smokers with the highest level of protection in the developed world. They will be better informed of what is in their cigarettes and of the dangers of smoking. They will also be afforded protection by the measures to limit tar, nicotine and carbon monoxide levels. However, the directive is also proportionate. We have been careful not to stigmatise smokers. We need to avoid being over-prescriptive and interfering in citizens’ day-to-day lives. The aim instead is to put in place a framework, where there is full information on tobacco and its dangers. This will complement the Community ban on tobacco advertising which will combat industry-led efforts to attract new smokers, especially young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The combination of these measures should ensure that smoking will be a much less contentious issue in the future. I am hopeful that Parliament will support the Commission’s proposal under the codecision procedure in the forthcoming negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
