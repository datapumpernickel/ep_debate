<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jarzembowski (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen – who I see are rather thin on the ground – following tough, but fair, negotiations between the French Council Presidency and representatives of the European Parliament, we, Parliament that is, managed, on the evening of 22 November, to make clear progress in the Conciliation Procedure on the three fundamental directives on railway liberalisation – namely those concerning the further development of the railways, the licensing of railway undertakings and the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity – such progress being towards the further opening-up of the railway sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I will summarise the progress made in three points, and I would like to welcome you Madam Vice-President. We were able to get the Council’s agreement on three points.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it was agreed that all railway undertakings should definitively be granted rights of access to the entire rail networks of all Member States for international freight transport, by 2008 at the latest. In so doing, we ensured that from this point onwards, all Member States will be obliged not just to open the marked-out routes of the so-called new trans-European rail freight network, but also their network in its entirety, to the railway companies from the other EU States.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the exemption clause – originally planned by Austria – which would have enabled Member States to evade the strict European requirements emanating from the respective national regulation authority, has been dropped. As I see it, this means that across the EU, the national railway companies or their associated agencies will be the last ones to be entrusted with the licensing of railway undertakings, the allocation of railway infrastructure capacity, or railway infrastructure charging, rather this will fall to agencies of a truly independent nature. So these are the two crucial components: the opening-up of all networks for cross-border traffic and the establishment of an independent regulatory authority in all Member States, so as to guarantee fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me just to say a few words about Mr Swoboda’s report. The third crucial component to be achieved in my view, is that we managed, by means of a new provision, to make a start on the long-term goal of applying the ‘user pays principle’ when it comes to the cost of railway infrastructure usage. In this way, we have ensured that infrastructure charges can be raised in the long term with a view to cost-effectiveness, so that the construction, maintenance and also development is funded by the user, and not by the tax payer at the end of the day. In other words, as I see it, we will still need, in the long run, to implement the separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management. But in any event, we need the network to be maintained by the users. That is why we must make it our long-term goal to cover costs through charges.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, in taking these three essential steps, we are already breaking down the national, fixed railway structures and creating new possibilities for competition between the railway undertakings. Parliament has fought for this, in conjunction with the Commission. The Commission was not exactly enthusiastic to begin with, but it fought alongside us in the end, in a bid to achieve this liberalisation, and I would therefore like to say a special thank you to the Vice-President for her cooperation in the Conciliation Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that as a result, Parliament, together with the Council and the Commission, has established the framework for an attractive railway sector, which will offer a wider range of customer-orientated, cross-border freight services in the future. After all, what we want is to modernise the railway sector by means of competition, so that, ultimately, more freight is transferred from road to rail. This is because it is absolutely vital, on environmental protection grounds, to get freight off the roads and onto the railways over long distances.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the course taken by the Conciliation Procedure has again borne out the importance of the codecision procedure, and we have only had codecision rights in the transport sector since the Treaty of Amsterdam. Without the codecision procedure we would not have managed to break down the Council’s position. If you recall, the French President-in-Office of the Council had believed that following the first reading of the Council’s common position, all negotiations would come to an end, and we would have to accept the situation. But no, a fair Conciliation Procedure enabled us to make progress and achieve a single market, at least for cross-border freight traffic, with effect from the year 2008 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">Permit me just to look ahead for a moment. It is simply not enough to only ever produce laws, directives and regulations, nor is it enough just to have them transposed into national law. My group calls upon the existing railway undertakings – and I see one is represented up on the platform, for which I am grateful – to take the necessary precautions now, so that they are in a position to make use of the new provisions when the European law that we are now in the process of adopting has to be transposed in the year 2003. Thus, for example, the <span class="italic">Deutsche Bundesbahn</span>, perhaps in conjunction with the Dutch national railways or other railways, should truly exploit the opportunity to make cross-border freight traffic a reality. I believe this is where the traditional railways must really rise to the challenge of pushing through the opening-up of the market that we have created.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, the traditional railways do not exploit the new opportunities presented by liberalisation, then many industrial enterprises will consider doing business directly with small railway companies, using European law. They will be entitled to do so. There are 180 licensed railway companies in Germany, and they are licensed to operate wherever they wish, even if they have only operated on a regional basis hitherto. I therefore believe we should prevail upon all parties concerned, the railway companies and industry, to take the necessary precautionary measures without delay, and make use of the competition, so that more freight can be transferred from road to rail. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swoboda (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, yes, it was a difficult birth, but in the end it was a successful birth. As with any birth, there were people to assist. Sometimes there are also people who get in the way, but in this case I should like to mention only those who assisted, in particular Commissioner de Palacio, who, as transport commissioner, was a very great help to us in finding a good solution. I want to stress this in particular, in recognition of her outstanding work.</p>
<p class="contents">The French transport minister, too, who at first perhaps tried – unsuccessfully – to intimidate us a bit, in the end reached a very good compromise with us. I should also like to thank Vice-President Imbeni in particular, who led the parliamentary delegation very circumspectly and very precisely, and also our committee Chairman, Mr Hatzidakis, who backed us in word and deed and showed confidence in the rapporteurs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also saying it was a difficult birth because it took a long time, longer than it should have. But since it is constantly being said that Parliament is so slow and hesitant and <span class="italic">fast track</span> or other procedures are required, I should like to point out that we had the first reading on 10 March 1999, but did not receive the common position until 13 April, over a year later, and that despite the urgency impressed on the committees by Mr Jarzembowski and myself. But we then quickly dealt with the common position on 5 July and adopted the corresponding amendment that same day. After that, the Council again took a relatively long time to make its comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress that Parliament works quickly when it needs to, and especially when there is close cooperation as between myself and Mr Jarzembowski. It is the Council that always has great difficulty in reaching a common position.</p>
<p class="contents">So what does this railway package contain? I believe there are some very important steps, namely the specific steps it contains, but also the forward-looking stance that goes with them. Firstly, what I would call a bespoke liberalisation, a liberalisation that is not untrammelled, that does not go beyond what sensible and reasonable experts think, but is purposeful. I, too, Mr Jarzembowski and a few others, would have liked to have seen something more. We could have been bolder. Be that as it may, the first steps have been taken and they should be followed through, because I also believe that what we have in the text here can, should and, indeed, ought to be put into effect sooner than we have agreed, which for me is the minimum.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, regarding the cost structure. It is true that, on the one hand, we said, for the short term – and following the Commission’s example – that only marginal costs could be asked for, in other words what an additional train costs on a particular route. But in the long term the aim must be to cover costs completely. Of course, this means covering costs not only on rail, but on the road as well. Proper account must therefore also be taken of environmental costs, which – even if Mr Jarzembowski still does not quite believe it, he is already half convinced – are certainly appreciably higher for road than for rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we have not abolished the derogation for individual Member States. It hurts, but we can live with it, and I think we shall get over it in time. I shall, too, and I also thank you for your support in getting a particular principle introduced, or reintroduced, namely that, to a limited extent and where there is good reason for doing so, public services can have priority, of course not to hinder the most important part of traffic, namely commercial traffic, freight traffic, which is the most important since that is what we particularly want to shift from road to rail. We have also managed to get the duration of the framework agreements for railways to use the infrastructure set such that the investments that railway undertakings make will really pay off and actually be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, I believe it is a well-rounded package with good provisions. You might say we can go home content tomorrow after the votes. We have all played our part. But not so. Two things are most important. Firstly, the Commissioner has helped us in as much as she has quite clearly stated that further steps will be proposed by the Commission. As I said, I also hope that they will be bespoke and purposeful, which is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, which is also quite important, is that, as I have already mentioned, we must gradually arrive at a system for internalising external costs, i.e. they must be considered for road and rail side by side. That will do away with some of the distortion that still persists, namely the unfair treatment of rail as compared to road. Far-reaching changes will not be achieved over night. So there is no need for hauliers to be afraid. But the railways will and must gradually be given justice and with it, indirectly, the support that is in fact merely the creation of a situation that is fair.</p>
<p class="contents">But the question of labour law and working hours is also important. Here, too, the treatment is unfair. Here, too, the Commissioner has promised, and the Council has already decided in principle, to help us to put an end to the unfair undercutting of tariffs and prices in the Member States of the European Union – a particularly common practice by the Willi Betz company – in order to arrive at a fairer system in this particular field with regard to labour law and working hours, another area where the railways are disadvantaged compared to the legal and especially the actual circumstances on the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there must be investment in the railways. It is not enough to say OK we now have a fine system, but nobody invests. This investment is necessary. I say that especially because of the impending enlargement. If enlargement means having a lot more heavy lorries on our roads, there will be opposition. If enlargement means we get a transport system that is a little fairer and also friendlier to the environment, it will meet with greater acceptance. That is how I understand the railway package that we are proposing today – that we get a transport system that is a little kinder to the environment and a little more just. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite the fact that we have known about the problem for years, I think that the compromise now being debated as a result of the conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council is perhaps the first major decisive step towards the creation of a proper new, unified rail transport network and towards much needed liberalisation – much needed in my view, Mr President, because this is how we can support the competitiveness of the European railways, which have been on the decline for years without our being able to do anything substantial about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Surely, everyone involved in this issue will want to give praise where praise is due, i.e. to the European Parliament and, of course, the Commission, for the simple reason that they have been urging the Council for years to take the action which it has, I think, now been forced to take – action which will certainly benefit European citizens, consumers, rail passengers and rail freight customers. I remember that when a compromise was reached between the 15 ministers, the Helsinki Council felt that it had come to the end of the line as far as the liberalisation of the railways and the new institutional framework are concerned. It is significant, I think, that Parliament, with the Commission's help, has managed to change Council's mind, giving us a far better compromise than the Helsinki compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not intend to go into the details, because the two rapporteurs, who know the subject inside out and whom I should like to congratulate on the results of the compromise, have already done so; I should merely like to reiterate how important the clause on further liberalisation of rail transport is and to point out that, generally speaking, there will be no exemptions or derogations for the Member States – unless absolutely necessary because of the nature of the Member States or their position on the map.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to close, Mr President, with a wish: that from now on the Council will operate with greater transparency, that it will talk to the rapporteurs early on, that it will attend European Parliament committees not simply to strengthen the role of the European Parliament but so that faster decisions can be taken, faster than the 16 kilometres an hour which is the present average speed of the railways. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly the two rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda, then the French Presidency and finally the Commission, more particularly the Commissioner, who is present this afternoon. She is to be congratulated amongst other reasons because, thanks to her presence on the Conciliation Committee, a number of significant factors were introduced allowing Parliament to emerge with the feeling of having won a specific victory, namely the document we are debating today, and not with the sense of having lost a battle over international passenger transport and national freight transport. Rather, it felt the decision had been postponed for strategic reasons. I therefore feel we are enjoying a very positive and constructive atmosphere, in which we can tackle tasks such as that before us today. Undoubtedly, the agreement represents a historic step forward in line with other developments we are currently involved in or are about to embark on and are going through Parliament, such as enlargement and the final introduction of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this decision does indeed open up the network, and as soon as it is opened, its management and rationalisation will be within our grasp. We need not concern ourselves about the time-scale of events, because the logic of events will allow us to move forward. That independent authority is important in the agreement. We are of course referring to the railways, attempting to promote them. Mr Jarzembowski said that the objective was for the user to pay the cost. True, that is the strategic objective, but at the moment we need to promote trains and therefore we should not rush things. At the outset, we need to offer incentives for transporting freight by train. To date, trains have not proved a viable way of transporting freight. Our freight trains travel 50% slower than trains in the United States and we have not yet been able to make a competitive offer. We need to improve the freight network, and the companies themselves have to be competitive as regards overcoming the difficulties of rail transport. Companies must be enabled to find a solution to sending their products from the company to the railway and once the destination is reached, from the railway to the company.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless this is achieved, we shall not move forward as we ought. We are all certainly aware that the proposals before us represent a net benefit to the environment. We must therefore express our appreciation to all those who have made this agreement possible and congratulate Parliament on its unanimity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, on behalf of my group, to thank the rapporteurs, Mr Jarzembowski and Mr Swoboda, for their reports on the railway package as well as the Conciliation Committee, for their excellent work, which can be considered to be a breakthrough in this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group is in favour of improved competitiveness in the railways and liberalisation. The legislative consultation between Parliament and the Council resulted in a satisfactory package that meant the job of developing rail transport could be tackled with vigour. The development of rail transport will remain on the agenda in the future, as the Commission is promising a second railway package to include further liberalisation and the aspect of safety. I consider the safety aspects of railways, as with other forms of transport, to be particularly important. The utilisation of the best technology that promotes safety, and its wider application, must become a key point of focus.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of rail transport is vital to solve the problems of traffic congestion. It will ease the problem of both road and, furthermore, air traffic congestion. At the same time, however, we have to ensure that the trans-European transport networks also extend to more sparsely populated and remote regions. As has been stated here, environmental considerations also powerfully advocate the development of the railways. In the future, we will have to carefully observe how this railways package will be implemented in practice, and there must be further liberalisation in the light of the experience we gain from that. Special attention has to be paid to the coordination of different forms of transport as well as the overall functioning of the network. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A great deal of work has been done, and as you know, the Group of the Greens holds the development of rail transport dear. That applies to both public transport and freight. Ultimately, we have had to take measures in order to stimulate the development of rail, railway licences and railway infrastructure by, among other things, opting for liberalisation in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that we have a duty, in view of some forms of liberalisation elsewhere, jointly to keep monitoring safety and the social aspects which are related to liberalisation. We are, to a certain extent, in favour of efficient transport, but we are mainly in favour of environmentally friendly transport. I would like to make one critical comment, and that is that the environmental advantages of rail compared to road transport are dwindling fast. This can be put down to one simple reason. Parliament has taken decisions on the Euro I to V standards and limit values for a truck fleet which is rapidly being rejuvenated, and it is now up to us to quickly improve the emission limit value and the energy efficiency of rail transport. Otherwise, the advantage which we mentioned a moment ago will no longer apply. Research has now provided adequate evidence of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, I believe that it is fair to say – we have asked questions and have received answers in this connection – that a great deal of fine-tuning is still required, and I would now like to see the sector make a political gesture. We have taken the political decision, but we now want to see the sector send us a signal that it is about to launch into further development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, from the point of view of the environment, space occupation, safety and working conditions, we would like to see a great deal of freight, which is currently being transported by road, transferred to rail. This removal can best be achieved by reaching sound agreements among the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we consented to the agreements made by the Council in December 1999 at the end of the Finnish Presidency. These agreements provided for through trans-national corridors and for sufficient exemption and transitional provisions in order to lift possible drawbacks in good time. Unfortunately, the majority of Parliament believed that this arrangement was inadequate and that instead, liberalisation and privatisation should be brought more to the fore.</p>
<p class="contents">This opinion fits in with a fashion trend which has led to a neo-liberal stampede against public services, public companies and organised employees, especially in the sectors of postal services, rail and energy supply. Those were companies that could prove to us that we can organise our economy in a more democratic, environmentally-friendly and less profit-orientated manner, but that are now being forced to attend to the pursuit of profit and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">Advocates of liberalisation consider rail as an awkward state monopoly with irritating and demanding trade unions. But the alternative could lead to chaos and conflict of interests and to new monopolies without any democratic control. Liberalisation could, of course, benefit private companies that can gain more freedom and more opportunities to tap into fresh income, but that does not guarantee a choice in favour of more environmentally-friendly modes of transport. Considerable disadvantages could arise, on the other hand, within existing railway companies, for their staff and for the democratic decision-taking with regard to their future transport policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, in this case my group was more on the side of the Council than the majority of this Parliament. Therefore, if it had been up to my group, this conciliation would not have taken place. Despite this, I took part in it, taking the view that irreconcilable positions would block a positive outcome, and that it is also not a good idea for the Finnish compromise to be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I have voted against the direction previously opted for by Parliament on 22 November, I called on the parliamentary delegation to reach a compromise. When that was achieved, I abstained from voting out of regard for this procedure, just as the majority of my group will do tomorrow at the final vote. The outcome of this conciliation will lead to more liberalisation than we deem useful, but less than threatened to be the case initially. Moreover, I fear that this conciliation package will soon be overtaken by liberalisation plans from the European Commission which go even further, and which my group will be unable to endorse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, beyond this reality, which is certainly used as a pretext, the final proposals in this report go far beyond what we were hoping for. The only major issue here, though, is not the three, five or seven years that it has taken to obtain this result. For we still have one major concern and that is the desire that some people have expressed to liberalise the sector completely. This is unacceptable to us.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be cautious, as this liberalisation of the transport of goods will have an adverse effect on both local planning and social cohesion, particularly if the service provision no longer has any respect for the concept of a comprehensive rail network and the idea of providing a service for the population as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, an important, if not crucial, test for the continuation of the concept of public service will be the opening up of the passenger service market, which some see as part and parcel of the same process. In short, will this total liberalisation of rail transport services have any consideration for the concept of public service, rather like the case of the postal service? I fear not, as the principle of profitability will then automatically come to the fore, a principle directly opposed to that of public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the same applies to the notion of safety. Of course, the infrastructure must be safe and must be a matter for the authorities, but operators cannot achieve a lawless and fiercely competitive market without the risk of bottlenecks or a serious accident which would compromise everything that has been done.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, whilst we recognise the need for Europe-wide investment in order to give the rail industry the boost it needs, we are still extremely concerned about this incipient liberalisation. We hope to see proper assessment made before implementing the next stages, as we are aware there are other options which can and must be explored. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For example ‘the train has departed’ is what we say when we arrive late. Unfortunately the same can be said of our train. The package of three proposals for directives concerning the railway infrastructures, to which we will give our assent tomorrow, is long overdue. The ultimate outcome of the lengthy negotiations within the Conciliation Committee, has in fact come ten years too late. The statistics bear this out, I am sorry to say. There has been a massive decline in the amount of freight transported by rail over the last few years, and there is every reason to believe that it will be very difficult to reverse the trend in the foreseeable future.</p>
<p class="contents">If we call to mind that we accomplished the single market for freight in 1970, and the internal market in 1992/1993, then since this is now the year 2001, we are clearly going to reach our destination late, added to which, our train is travelling on a go-slow stretch. Setting a deadline of 2003 for the opening-up of the trans-European rail freight network certainly sounds reasonably committed, as does a deadline of 2008 for national freight traffic, but this is surely sending out the wrong signals. When you consider that the question of committing eastern freight traffic to the rail has not even been properly addressed then clearly this is yet another area which will set us back.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other, better signals too, a green light as it were. We must not overlook what has been achieved in the way of positive results. Thus, for example, the creation of independent regulatory authorities does at least give the go-ahead for more competition, and we can only hope that the necessary reforms do not get stuck on the sidings. The exemption provisions for certain Member States are, after a great deal of to-ing and fro-ing – and not including the small country of Luxembourg – only really for the benefit of the truly peripheral Member States, and at least the project for improving the railways and freight transport is up and running. Interoperability is the next item on the agenda, and we are currently setting the points for more intermodality. At some stage it will be all systems go for Europe’s rail passengers, and not just on Europe’s roads. We must not lose hope and with that in mind I would like to say a big thank you to both rapporteurs and to the Commissioner, whose combined efforts have already been mentioned today and for which they have rightly been commended. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, it is the citizens of Europe who are the winners. Once we have successfully implemented this conciliation, we shall also have opportunities to create a better environment in Europe, and in that way we are serving all citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I see the environment as one important reason why we must get to grips with the issues relating to railways. We know, of course, that road transport is increasing at the expense of rail transport and that it has been doing so for a long time. We must reverse that trend. It is also important that we should create opportunities for combining forms of transport so that it is possible, over long distances for example, to use both road and rail transport. Another problem, of course, has been the high rail charges which have presented obstacles to more efficient railway traffic. The railways’ organisational structure is also at fault. I think we have achieved a good conciliation we can rightly congratulate ourselves on, even if we might sometimes wish it could have gone further.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the marginal cost charges are concerned, I also think this is a good conciliation. In this way, it will be possible even for long-distance operators to compete. This is important in Europe, where distances are long. The regulator, who is to be appointed under the terms of the conciliation and who is to oversee the system, is also an important factor because it is important to create confidence in the railways and in the solution we have now arrived at.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, then, that we have a good result and I want to thank everyone involved. Finally, I hope that we can all make sure that it is turned into a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It certainly is high time that we developed Europe’s railways properly and, more importantly, allocated resources to this task. At last, we can be confident, we can meet the expectations of all citizens and believe that the shift from road to rail is underway. The conciliation on what is called the ‘railway package’ will have allowed us to lay the foundation stone. At the moment, we have to provide substantial investment for railways to meet our expectations and be recognised as the means of transport that produces the least pollution and helps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall continue to remind you of the worrying predictions made by scientists regarding the climate change that is, to a great extent, caused by road transport. Glaciers are being melted at a faster rate than steel rails are hardening in the mould. Although we welcome the decision made at the France-Italy Summit to build a new railway between Lyons and Turin, the European Union should be far bolder in its infrastructure plans. In some cases, the question still arises as to whether it is better to build a new motorway rather than considering rail. I am thinking specifically about the Moselle valley freight tunnel, the so-called ‘A32’ project. The European Union must lead the way to ensure that rail becomes the preferred means of transport for all citizens as well as the natural and even the only means of transporting goods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our guiding principle must be to create a truly level playing field on the competition front, through harmonisation and by taking comparable cost components into account. But then there is more to competition than a debate about lowest costs and highest profits, it is also about striving for sustainability, social competence, user-friendliness, quality and service. Why should a private-sector supplier be <span class="italic">a priori</span> any better at this than one under public ownership? We have a duty to explain what we understand by general public services, and whether we think they can be provided more effectively by publicly owned operators than private operators, or less so.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that having equal conditions of access for all will not prove profitable in every case. Private companies must make a profit or else face their demise. Publicly owned companies can, in fact, sustain losses in areas where this is necessary for social reasons, on account of their redistribution potential. It will not do for the profits to be absorbed by the private sector and the losses to be borne by society. What we need is for the public and private suppliers of services in a European internal market to adopt an approach that is in the interests of the common good. This will require uniform framework conditions. Experience will show whether the nascent liberalisation of the European railways will mean better services for rail users.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain Member States have already implemented more far-reaching liberalisation measures, with very mixed results. Germany – I am sorry to have to say this gentlemen from the Deutsche Bundesbahn – is a prime example of how not to go about it. Stretches of track have been shut down <span class="italic">en masse</span> at regional level, there have been railway station closures, ever-increasing cycle times, repair workshop closures, and drastic cuts in staffing levels. This has nothing to do with competing for services to the general public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reports by Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski set the right tone. The separation of rail service operations from those of infrastructure management is pre-requisite to the liberalisation of the European railways. I would like to offer my heartfelt thanks to all concerned for the difficult, but ultimately productive, work undertaken within the Conciliation Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">As is apparent from all the other areas that have already undergone liberalisation, competition has a positive effect on the area concerned. In freight transport, the advantages are tangible and plain for all to see. If the European railways can improve their competitive position <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> other modes of transport, especially road transport, this will have a positive impact on the environment and will also help solve the serious problems attending road transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve these goals, and in fact this is logical, competition must not stop at respective national borders. It must be able to flourish on a Community-wide basis. Only in this way will the railways become a real alternative. Parliament has scored a major success in achieving this goal, all be it with transitional periods. The same conditions must apply to passenger transport as apply to freight transport. The problems emanating from the other modes of transport – road transport for example – are not just caused by heavy goods vehicles, but also by passenger transport, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">The railway will only be able to win back shares in the transport market if it becomes a viable alternative, and what that means these days is an international outlook, quality of service and customer orientation. If the railway sets itself this major challenge, it has everything to gain, and all of us with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, those responsible for managing the infrastructure and charged with ensuring good use of the latter must be completely separate from and independent of service operators and users. Secondly, the railways must be integrated with other forms of transport to achieve a genuine door to door service. Thirdly, just as there are toll-free motorways so certain sections of the railway track must be free of charge. The cost of transporting a tonne of goods should not be prohibitive. Furthermore, if we really want to change the present situation, free up our roads and achieve genuine environmental improvements, the cost has to favour the railway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I believe that we cannot be satisfied with the results of the conciliation between the European Parliament and the Council. This compromise perpetuates the race to open up the markets and introduce competition in rail transport services, for goods and passengers alike, in order to satisfy the economic rationale of profitability, instead of meeting the requirements of the users and employees in this sector. The report approves the plan to liberalise rail transport, and, more particularly, the plan to make infrastructure managers independent of the State. If this is adopted, there is a risk that rail safety will be jeopardised. However, there could have been other options. Even if historical and national differences exist, coordination of public rail transport services on a European level is not an insurmountable obstacle. Besides, that is what rail workers are calling for. We must move towards establishing public Europe-wide services within the framework of a common policy…</p>

He observes that little progress has been made by the Member States in implementing the separation of the rail service operations from those of infrastructure management and we do not see in most countries any effective opening-up of the rail market.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United Kingdom considerable credit could well be paid to the former Conservative government for effecting just that, a policy which has been continued by the current Labour government. However, last October the Hatfield train crash took place in Hertfordshire, part of the eastern region which I represent in this Parliament. Four people lost their lives and many were seriously injured. The accident took place on a bend with the train travelling at 115 mph. It appears that the infrastructure authorities were aware of the fracturing of the rail as early as November 1999 and a further report was made in January of last year. No remedial action was taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The British transport minister, Lord McDonald, has announced there will be no be no public inquiry. However, named members of Railtrack, the infrastructure company, and of Balfour Beatty possibly face manslaughter charges as a result of this accident.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the Commissioner, who I am sure is aware of the details of this particular accident, which I would point out is not unique within the European Union, and I would hope that she would be able perhaps to dwell on the consequences of the crash. In the United Kingdom there has been chaos on our railways, there has been plummeting customer confidence in the rail system, remedial work has caused huge financial investment and Railtrack has threatened a delay in work on the Euro Channel Tunnel Phase II programme which is very much part of the integrated European rail system that we all support.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the Commissioner may be able to give some support to the relevant authorities in the United Kingdom. This is not merely a domestic issue. It has European ramifications as far as the Channel Tunnel work is concerned. It may well be that additional support can be given through the TENs programme and I look forward to my discussions with the Commissioner on this extremely serious development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be made abundantly clear that this initiative is aimed at saving the rail network, modernising it and adapting it to the new state of affairs. We are hoping that at the dawn of the twenty-first century rail will once again become what it was at the start of the twentieth: a reliable, efficient, fast and – for those times – safe form of transport, stimulating development, and indeed offering guarantees of wealth and territorial balance.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we took a significant step in that direction on 22 November last year. The decisions we are to adopt today aim to improve the quality of the service. Contrary to the views expressed by some honourable Members, I believe that the problem with rail transport nowadays is not whether it should be public or private, although it is generally public. The problem is that it does not work. Let us be clear about this. There would certainly be scope for discussing some of the measures put forward here if we were dealing with a rail network which worked. The trouble is that given the current situation, where a public service is guaranteed by public undertakings with a monopoly in the area of the Member States of the Union, it does not work. It simply does not work in the present situation of compartmentalised and divided national rail networks. What we are seeking to do is in fact to effect a change – I would go so far as to say a revolutionary change – where the railways are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what we have achieved today through this debate and what I hope we will achieve tomorrow – I have no doubt that you will vote for the agreed text – is not simply opening up the network, but setting up something new and different. We are setting up a European rail network which does not yet exist, to replace 15 national juxtaposed networks. It is a revolutionary change, and we need to be aware of what we are seeking to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have complained that we spent too much time on this, others that we rushed things. I would like to say that we might well all have liked to move forward faster. However, it is fair to say that in the short time – just over a year – since I took over responsibility for this area, determined progress has been made and the whole process has accelerated. Furthermore, the codecision procedure has worked very well. In particular, I would like to thank the whole Parliament for the work undertaken, especially by Mr Imbeni and the rapporteurs, Mr Swoboda and Mr Jarzembowski.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should also like to thank the Finnish Presidency for its contribution at the time, and particular thanks are due to the French Presidency. In that case, the French transport minster was a knowledgeable railway enthusiast. It was suggested that this would make it harder for us to achieve our aim. On the contrary, it helped us to reach the point we find ourselves at today.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerns have been expressed regarding enlargement. Clearly, this will result in the European rail network we are currently setting up being extended beyond the current borders of the Union as they are redrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">The key components are opening up the whole network and separating functions, as Mr Jarzembowski has rightly pointed out. However, there is also the crucial and decisive issue of levies. Many of you, ladies and gentlemen, have raised this issue. The White Paper will cover the matter of non-discriminatory levies for infrastructure. In this regard, the conclusions of the Costa report are to be included in the White Paper, and I am grateful to Parliament for this. I should add that in addition to discussing what has already been achieved and will be completed today and tomorrow, we are going to deal with road transport and the action we need to take for the future. I must reassure Mr Swoboda that the measures he referred to, aimed at achieving fair competition within road transport and between road transport and other types of transport have already been put forward or are about to be.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, this year we intend to present the directive on rail safety some members of Parliament were concerned about. I trust I can rely on your support regarding the adoption of the directive on interoperability. Furthermore, we plan to draw up a communication opening up national freight transport and international passenger transport to the market, as I stated when both of these directives were being processed. The communication should even be ready before the end of the year. However, in addition to this communication we plan to present a new directive, amending 91/440/EEC, to open up access to the national freight network and international passenger transport. Furthermore, there will be an amendment to Directive 96/48/EC concerning the interoperability of the European high-speed railway system.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, we will present a second rail transport package before the end of the year, and I hope it will be processed quickly. Safety is a key factor, as is environmental improvement – both affect the citizens directly. Nonetheless, I should like to share with you some final thoughts on some of the issues that have been raised here.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been talk of privatisation, because liberalisation is to take place. It has been said that public services will not be guaranteed. We must not confuse the issue, ladies and gentlemen. What we are concerned with today is opening up a trans-European network and a trans-European railway to competition, and ensuring that properly licensed European operators may be either public or private.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, nobody is talking about privatisation of any sort. There is no question of privatising the operators and especially not the infrastructure. On the contrary, investment in the infrastructure will be called for. The situation is that in some countries not a single euro has been invested in infrastructure over the last thirty years. Safety provisions will require that conditions be such that safety can be guaranteed. This applies not only to the rolling stock but also to the fixed infrastructure. To reiterate my previous remarks, public service is not, unfortunately, properly assured at present, which is exactly why we are striving to improve it.</p>
<p class="contents">A moment ago Mr Ortuondo Larrea said that two other issues had to be dealt with: intermodal transport and balancing other forms of transport with road transport. This very morning I read a press note from one of the employers in the road haulage sector. It complained about the White Paper, regretting that it was too rail-orientated. This kind of thing is always happening. The situation we have to cope with is abundantly clear: a 40% increase in demand for freight transport in the next ten years. Not all of that 40% should go to the roads. It has to be absorbed by forms of transport other than the roads. We must go on assuring growth, quality of life, employment and the welfare of the citizens of the European Union. This can be achieved through specific measures of this nature. It will, of course, have to be complemented by a joint study of the various forms of transport, of competition amongst them, intermodality, interlinking, and interoperation. The end result will be a more efficient system which will benefit our economy and our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
