In this respect, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has spent the last few months examining a very important document sent to us by the Commission. It is significant that the roadmap work has also been pushed through by Commissioner Špidla, not least because this is one of those subjects that are never finished once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">In examining it once again and analysing all the topics that were put to us, we were able to focus on a number of basic issues in particular. We started from the principle that underlies all our actions, which is that promoting the rights of the individual must be mainstreamed in all our policies and therefore, as a natural consequence of that, there must be zero tolerance across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President cut off the speaker)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In this roadmap, we started by establishing the fact above all that promoting the rights of the individual underlies …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The speaker was cut off again)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I shall start again. Our starting-point was the promotion of the rights of the individual and, as a natural consequence, we arrived at the conclusion that in focusing on the promotion of rights we must also aim at zero tolerance of any failure to respect such rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately we all know that violence is still a major, significant issue in Europe: available data in fact show that one woman in three suffers violence at some time in her life. We also know that women make up 52% of Europe’s population, and that makes you realise that there is an enormous percentage of people in our Europe even today that suffer violence during their lifetime. We are asking the Union to pay particular attention to this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The other point that we took into consideration was the subject of poverty. In this case as well, a great many reports, including previous ones, have shown how the risk of poverty affects women most of all, in view of the fact that 85% of single-parent families are headed by women and, on average, this is considered the situation in which it is easiest to drop down to the poverty line. In that respect as well, we think that one of the main actions that we can carry out at an EU level is to enhance all those policies that can provide women with economic independence, in other words those policies that facilitate access to the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a considerable gender gap in employment levels, although admittedly the situation varies from one country to another. When women have jobs, it has been shown that on average they are paid 15% less than men for the same work. In this context as well, therefore, we are calling for policies and monitoring to prevent this from happening any more.</p>
<p class="contents">The third, and no less consequential issue that was taken into consideration was the need to reconcile family life and work. A number of policies were identified that could make an enormous contribution to reconciling family life and work, not only at European level but also applicable to the Member States. They touch on the subject of the costs of maternity and paternity, which should be borne by society as a whole in this Europe where fewer and fewer babies are being born, and address the age-old but as yet unsolved problem of the need for better, more accessible, more flexible services that are aimed not just at childcare but also at care for the disabled, the seriously ill and the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">To achieve that, we believe it is essential to mainstream gender policy in the EU budget and in Community programmes, such as the Structural Funds, the Seventh Framework Programme and so forth. External policies also need to be taken forward: we believe that all the accession policies as well as the neighbourhood, foreign and development policies need to take account of respect for women’s rights. Lastly, but not because they are any less important, we must address all the immigration-related issues, from enslavement to polygamy and genital mutilation: on these the Union must take a strict stand. As I said at the beginning, we must aim at zero tolerance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The plurality and range of opinions reflects the aims of the roadmap, which cuts across all EU policy, both internal and external. It also illustrates the fact that issues of gender equality affect us all and that it is far from being an issue solely for women.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s report is a manifestation of our shared undertaking to work towards greater equality between women and men, thanks to the instruments that the Treaty has given us. With this roadmap we are again confirming the need to develop a strategic, long-term approach to issues of equality. Moreover, we wish to confirm the need for an approach that in itself addresses special measures and support for gender mainstreaming. The Commission notes that the opinions of the different institutions on various issues are coming closer together and welcomes the fact that your report points this out. I should like to highlight some of these.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality between women and men is primarily an issue of rights and the position of women in society. Equality is first and foremost an obligation and an inalienable right. Regulations are a vital prerequisite if we want to establish the foundations for and conditions of genuine equality. In this developing environment, the Community has a legal framework that is among the most advanced in the world. What is still needed, however, is for these measures to bring about a real change in the situation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">The existence of regulations and laws does not automatically mean that those laws are implemented for the benefit of our citizens. Our efforts must be stepped up to ensure that these rights are put into practice in daily life. The roadmap and Parliament’s report show that the Commission and Parliament will continue to be allies in this regard, and this is something I welcome. The legal framework must also reflect current tasks and needs, and address them and adjust itself to them. The Commission has therefore undertaken to examine some of the amendments that have not been recast with a view to bringing them up to date, where necessary. We have taken an important first step concerning the directive on maternity and family holidays, and in October of last year we launched the first stage of the formal consultation with the social partners. We are currently also assessing the implementation of Directive 86613 on self-employed women and women who support this kind of activity, as well as Directive 797 on equal treatment for men and women in the area of social security, in order to ascertain whether it is necessary to propose any amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with issues of rights, there is also of course the economic issue, because lifelong economic independence for women is of vital importance. The Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Employment established the framework and targets for improving the situation of women in the labour market. Even though we have recently seen very significant increases in the proportion of women in the labour market, women have always suffered discrimination and disadvantages simply because they are women. For example, women are paid 15% less on average for the same work, even with the appropriate regulations in place. The Commission has already begun to address the issue of equal pay for equal work and intends to continue doing so. In the months ahead we will work on a communication on pay inequality, the purpose of which is to start removing the causes behind this inequality, which has continued despite years of legislation, and to propose changes and courses of action. Economic independence can be achieved only if we develop genuine policies for reconciling work life with private and family life, and this is true not only for women but for men too. We are aware that one of the main obstacles blocking women from starting or continuing a career is the difficulty of reconciling family and work life, especially as women have always carried out most of the family and household duties. The Commission has therefore consulted the social partners in order to ascertain whether the regulations on these issues need to be updated. The suggestions made by the social partners will be important in deciding on further developments. We strongly believe that this is a field in which substantial progress can be made.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have quantified objectives in respect of child care services, and these are Barcelona objectives. The year 2010 is approaching and so we must step up our efforts, including for example, taking the opportunity offered by the structural funds to support the Member States in developing childcare structures, which will now fall under the framework of activities eligible for European Social Fund financing. As regards the decision-making process, it is clear that women are still absent from management boards and from positions of high responsibility in politics and economics. I firmly believe in the importance of role models and I am well aware of the significance of informal networks in careers. One of our priorities will be to set up a network for women in the field of economic and political decision-making, and to gather and disseminate information on the role of women via our database.</p>
<p class="contents">The report refers to another, very important issue; that of gender budgeting. We have to be capable of gauging the resources allocated to our priorities and of ensuring that essential financial resources are allocated to support these priorities. Gender budgeting is an excellent instrument, which will enable us to make use of this information. In terms of improving the methodology, we must therefore improve the collection and the accessibility of this information, as well as the exchange of best practice. We are aware of this and we therefore recommend a pragmatic approach in this area. We have launched a study on introducing the perspective of gender equality into the budgetary process.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reassure you, with regard to the Commission’s commitment to supporting the fulfilment of political targets in the area of gender equality, that appropriate financial resources will be made available. Many programmes or support mechanisms are already linked to measures in this area. I could mention, of course, the European social fund, the aim of which is above all to support measures aimed at gender equality, as well as other programmes on a smaller scale aimed at supporting the development of public policies on equality, such as the newly integrated PROGRESS programme. I am sure that the European institute for women and men will in the years ahead play a major role in raising awareness on such issues, by gathering and disseminating information on the situation of women. At this level there needs to be complementarity of all of these financial resources in support of the one aim.</p>
<p class="contents">I share your opinion that the increasing diversity of our society, including ethnic diversity, presents us with new challenges. We must look more closely at the different forms of discrimination suffered by women migrants. The European year of equal opportunities gives us a platform for exchanging opinions on this issue, because one of the problems it is designed to address is multiple discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Combating violence against women and trafficking in women is also among the Union’s priorities. We have drawn up a range of measures mainly as part of the DAPHNE programme on the fight against all forms of violence against women in Europe, including sexual exploitation, female genital mutilation and trafficking in women. It is also very important to include support for equality in development policies and external policy, as the EU is the biggest donor in the world. The values governing our action in the Union must be the values that we uphold when it comes to third countries. We must use our finances better, for example by strengthening the capabilities and effectiveness of bodies fighting for women’s rights around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, this issue is the central theme of the communication on gender equality and development policies that the Commission adopted on 8 March – International Women’s Day. The roadmap for gender equality establishes control mechanisms similar to the annual work programme, with an assessment of the situation halfway through the period and a final assessment at the end. I believe that these mechanisms are very important, as they constitute an important instrument for good reporting. With these instruments. European citizens can monitor whether we are honouring our commitments in the area of equality between women and men. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The roadmap for equality between women and men 2006-2010 places the emphasis back on the discrimination problems that we have been condemning: the fight against violence, against discrimination in the workplace and wage discrimination, the lack of public space in which women can make their voices heard etc.</p>
<p class="contents">We congratulate the Commission on dealing with all of these issues in the new roadmap, although we must insist that it be effectively implemented and to that end make an assessment of previous plans and set up a public discussion on their results, which have not always been as positive as we could have expected.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, this time the external dimension has been considered. We in the European Union are obliged to integrate the gender dimension into all of our policies and programmes in the field of cooperation, development and humanitarian aid, and to do so from the outset, in the programming of funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Women are at the centre of the millennium development objectives, approved in 2000 by all of the member countries of the United Nations. It is therefore essential to promote gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask the Commission to put women's rights on the agenda of its meetings within the context of political dialogue with third countries, particularly our neighbouring countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Women constitute 52% of Europeans and expect equality, together with the right to work full time and on equal wages, to be at the top of the political agenda of the EU as a whole. At present, all women in the EU work free for eight weeks, that is to say they receive 15% lower wages than the average man. Women want both jobs and families. Child care and care of the elderly are therefore required – if we want more children in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">On International Women’s Day, we Swedish Social Democratic women launched an appeal for free abortion. The right to abortion is threatened again. We must halve the number of women and children involved in people trafficking and prostitution within ten years, achieve a situation in which every other MEP is a woman and, by the next European Parliament elections in 2009, every other candidate is a woman and bring about closer cooperation with good and decent men. The road map must be evaluated regularly if it is to be a political force in Parliament, the Council and the Commission. The women of Europe are now taking the next step towards gender equality, and I believe that the outcome will be a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have to say, though – speaking as the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs – that I still do not understand why such a long period of time had to elapse between its being first tabled and discussed in the Committee on Employment and the debate on it in this plenary today.</p>
<p class="contents">Particularly in view of the fact that the EU is the source of a very large number of initiatives aimed at giving equal status to women and men – something that might otherwise not have made so much progress in the Member States – we should take care not to lose so much time in the progress of this through Parliament, which has now been dragging on for almost over nine months. In the committee, there was agreement among us that, despite great progress having been made, women still suffered considerable discrimination, and that women are particularly subject to the effects of globalisation and changes in population.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects of this to which I would like to draw your attention. Over 40% of all employment in the EU is what is described as ‘non-standard’ in form, and it is predominantly women who are affected by this. I am very pleased to hear Commissioner Špidla say that the intention was that there should be a review of the degree to which conditions had changed for self-employed women too.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, furthermore, like to say that the proposals as regards the compatibility of family and working life contained in the report enjoy wholehearted support from us on the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report is the outcome of the joint endeavour of all members of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, notwithstanding their diverse political views. In particular, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mrs Amalie Sartori.</p>
<p class="contents">This year is symbolic in several ways. On the occasion of the European Community’s anniversary we are also celebrating the European Year of Equal Opportunities for All, and we are about to adopt the equality roadmap. The timing is also symbolic. Just a few days ago we marked International Women’s Day. I would like to take this opportunity to draw your attention to a number of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The equality roadmap makes no sense unless we speak about how women and men can complement each other and harmonise their activities. No European or national equality roadmap will succeed unless the poorest and most vulnerable women become our partners. Efforts to improve the financial and social situation of women will fail unless we recognise officially the contribution women are making to the informal economy, and unless we acknowledge the contribution of women towards sustaining intergenerational solidarity networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to highlight the role of non-governmental organisations. Their initiatives are quite important at the national and European level. I urge the European Commission to look for ways specifically to ensure that various budget headings are used to benefit all women’s organisations. In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that the equality agenda is not the exclusive domain of women; men must also be actively involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By a happy coincidence, we find that we are about to approve the roadmap within a few days of 8 March, as Mrs Záborská has said. International Women’s Day on 8 March is celebrated in many countries around the world, though not all. Last year we had news of police baton charges in Turkey; this year we have heard that young women about to celebrate 8 March in Teheran have been arrested.</p>
<p class="contents">Like Labour Day, International Women’s Day arose out of the Socialist Movement and was international from the start. The eighth of March 1908 was bread and roses day. Fifteen thousand women marched through New York demanding bread, symbolising a wage and work, and also roses, meaning the right to vote, free time, children’s rights, dignity and respect. Two years later in Copenhagen, the Socialist International proposed marking a definite international women’s day in the calendar, in memory of New York.</p>
<p class="contents">A hundred years on, if we look closely at the six priority action areas in the roadmap, we find a remarkable similarity between them and the demands of the women who marched under the banner of ‘bread and roses’. They were demanding bread, meaning work and a wage, while we are demanding equal economic independence; they were demanding the right to vote, while we are demanding balanced participation in representative bodies; they were demanding respect for children, while we are demanding childcare services; they were demanding roses, meaning quality of life, while we are demanding the eradication of all forms of violence in order to improve the quality and dignity of life.</p>
<p class="contents">In those days, however, nobody spoke about eliminating sexist stereotypes. Today I think that one of the reasons why we still need to demand ‘bread and roses’ is that sexist stereotypes still exist in everyday life. I believe priority should be given to fighting stereotypes. Achieving this objective will make it easier, or perhaps just less difficult, to promote equality between men and women in every area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to make the European economy more competitive and more innovative. It is therefore not enough that women should enter the labour market in vast numbers: they should also be getting managerial positions in the public and private sectors, where their skills can be used to full advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">Studies show that companies with a lot of women in senior management posts are more profitable than those where there are few female managers. A determined strategy to promote the status of women would give the European economy a new boost and would improve its position in the competition against the United States of America and the Asian countries. This is the sort of determination I require of the EU and hope that it will show.</p>
<p class="contents">Women in Western Europe overtook men in levels of education a long time ago. Academic achievements, however, have not led to a greater number of women in managerial positions in society or the business world. The proportion of women on the Boards of Directors of European companies is still in single figures.</p>
<p class="contents">The barriers to progress in the careers of educated women in Europe are rooted not in true discrimination but in corporate culture, attitudes, prejudice and stereotypes. There are also barriers which can be reduced through political decisions. Examples include the reconciliation of work and family life and a fair share of the costs of parenthood.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, I do have to say that what the EU has done on the road to equality has not been sufficient, nor has it been effective. There is much talk and there are aspirations, but action and the political will have unfortunately been lacking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that respect for women’s rights should in principle be regarded as a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> in assessing whether a candidate country should join the European Union or not. I would say that the Copenhagen criteria ought to refer explicitly to respect for women’s rights. We highlighted it in this House last month, when we were debating the status of women in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">At the dawn of the third millennium, women in Europe still have to fight for the right to literacy, equal pay, access to high-level public positions, participation in politics and physical safety. In that respect, I fully endorse the demand that the Member States should severely punish any doctors who agree to perform painful, humiliating tribal practices, particularly female genital mutilation, just for the sake of financial gain or because of a dangerous and distorted respect for other cultures.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the traffic in women for use in prostitution that is carried on by criminal organisations, I staunchly support the demand that the Member States that have not yet done so should ratify the protocol supplementing the so-called ‘Palermo Protocol’ on combating the trafficking of immigrants. In that respect, I suggested to the Council and Commission back in 2004 that we should set up a centre to monitor Mafia-like organised crime in the European Union precisely so as to enhance our understanding of the extent and causes of criminal networks in Europe and to propose measures to combat them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pointless to hide the fact, Madam President, that trafficking in human beings is among the most profitable of these gangs’ activities. Three years have gone by since then, but on this front Europe has remained at the good intentions stage rather than moving on to take action. I hope that the equality roadmap at least will have better luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Describing it as a ‘timetable for action’ cannot disguise the fact that it is a hotch-potch of truisms that the women of Europe cannot expect will advance their cause. Unequal pay, discrimination against women in the social security and pensions systems and their lack of representation in decision-making positions are pressing issues, and to them the Commission has no answers to give. Where there should be proposals for further legal initiatives, there are only fine-sounding words, but we in this House want more than fine-sounding words and lofty sentiments; we want real proposals for legislation. It is not acceptable that the Commission should take a break from equality policy. We must not simply take lying down the fact that, despite a great deal of European legislation, women in Europe earn on average 15% less than their male counterparts, and, in Germany, the earnings gap is as much as 26%. The European Union must, at last, say how it proposes to get rid of this inequality in earnings and what it is going to do about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Efforts at balancing work and family life also need a tail wind from Europe; one is long overdue. No proposal has been forthcoming from the Commission as to how it proposes to support women and their families; what we could do with is a European framework directive on the subject, for it is not enough to talk about families or women, and action, rather than empty words, is what is called for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission communication on the road map concerns a variety of areas in which gender equality is a priority, for example the promotion of women’s and men’s equal participation in decision-making. The Commission considers these matters to be important, then. I venture to suggest, however, that the Commission’s interest in making its own contribution to promoting women’s participation in decision-making is beneath contempt.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this because, as recently as on 6 March of this year, the Commission President appointed an advisory group on the important issues surrounding energy and the climate. The group consists of 11 people, of whom just one is a woman. So much for priorities. As long as the EU institutions behave like that, they will, unfortunately, lack credibility. All road maps, resolutions, statements etc will, then, be worth no more than the paper they are written on.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s rights and the work done on equality must give rise to practical measures, as many of us women have become weary of hearing fine words about equal rights. We demand action, not words. I have long maintained that we should make some progress towards gender equality if we had a Commissioner responsible only for issues of that nature and if we were to ensure that decisions and resolutions were actually put into effect. I still believe that this would be a practical step forward. <span class="italic">(Applause)</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation will not improve, however, until we apply ourselves to educating every individual in the spirit of respect for ethical principles.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot hope to achieve our aims in terms of an ideal moral, individual or social order unless we ensure respect for moral standards and a sound value system. Women’s just struggle for equality and equal rights must not result in the so-called masculinisation of women. When women set out to resemble men they sacrifice their worth, their dignity and their special beauty. All this goes hand in hand with false and humiliating slogans on sexual and reproductive health, self-fulfilment and equal rights.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a growing tendency to undervalue the family as an institution, along with marriage and procreation. When this is coupled with a contraceptive and abortionist mentality, unrestricted free will, extreme individualism, conflicts between parents and children and a higher retirement age for women it all contributes to women being perceived as mere chattels. Women are being overburdened and this is resulting in the collapse of their physical and mental health and in greater social malaise, which tends to affect women most.</p>
<p class="contents">We recently celebrated International Women’s Day. In that connection, I should like to pay tribute to His Holiness Pope John Paul II, who died two years ago, and say how much I appreciated his encyclical <span class="italic">Mulieris Dignitatem</span>. The encyclical deals with women’s dignity and calling, and contains beautiful passages on the secret female genius. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is right, then that the European Union should not stop highlighting where action is needed to address such problems as violence against women, the lower pay they earn for doing the same work, poverty among women, discrimination against women in the pensions field, and so on. All these issues, I believe, need to be addressed and taken up again and again, and it is for that reason that I welcome the Commission’s gender equality roadmap and would like to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, for her good own-initiative report.</p>
<p class="contents">I would not, however, wish to gloss over the fact that I cannot agree with it in every detail. One criticism made in the report is that the Commission has not submitted any new proposals for legislation, but I have to admit that I am quite happy that it has not done anything about this. It has, admittedly, announced that it will be reviewing, updating and, possibly, revising the existing legislation, but the Commission has done the right thing in taking account of the allocation of powers in this area to the Member States on the one hand and the EU on the other, instead of offering new proposals as part of its timetable straight away. I am very glad to see this, and so I cannot go along with Mrs Breyer’s words of criticism.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also calls for the introduction of quotas, in research, for example, and that I reject as well, believing as I do that, in research, the criterion of excellence must apply, but nothing else, so that is a demand that I cannot endorse. Time does not permit me to discuss in detail the other provisions in which the prerogatives of the Member States come under attack, for example the demand for mandatory paternity leave throughout Europe, which I find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, when we vote on the report tomorrow, this or that amendment will be rejected, so that I will then, at the end of the day, be able to vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report addresses many important areas such as equal wages for equal work, male violence against women, paternity leave etc. – issues in relation to which gender equality really must be given practical expression and be enhanced. In this area, all the Member States have a big responsibility for ensuring that the report is not just stuffed into a desk drawer and forgotten and that, instead, real work is done to bring about a more equal Europe. I should also like, however, to address, in particular, each and every man as, without men’s participation in this important work, we shall never have gender equality in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Last Thursday saw the celebration of International Women’s Day. The Swedish newspapers had page after page about gender equality, as, presumably, did newspapers throughout Europe. What I find annoying is how much worse they are at raising this issue on other days of the year. One only has to look at the gap between women’s and men’s wages, with women’s wages still 15% lower than men’s in Europe, and this in spite of the right to equal wages being stated as far back as in the Treaty of Rome. It is remarkable that we have not made more progress on this issue in 50 years. I have great hopes of the Commission communication on this important issue and of the equality road map for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For Portuguese women, 8 March was a particularly momentous day. The law decriminalising the voluntary termination of pregnancy, if the woman chooses to do so in the first ten weeks of pregnancy, in a legally authorised health establishment, was finally adopted. There remain many inequalities, however, between women and men, in the social field – in terms of access to work, career development and pay – in political life and in family life.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must not restrict itself to a statement of general principles on equality, which will always be undermined when liberal policies are pursued, with the liberalisation and privatisation provided for in the so-called Lisbon Strategy, to which flexicurity – to facilitate groundless dismissals – can now be added. In this context discrimination against women will go on.</p>
<p class="contents">Motherhood and fatherhood, which are key social values, must be afforded state protection. Measures must moreover be taken to eradicate discriminatory practices in companies, which still go on in Portugal. Consequently, as on 2 March in Lisbon, women will continue to fight for more jobs with rights, against the closure of maternity wards and for more crèches and nurseries. Their struggle must be met with a positive response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are involved as mothers, wives, owners of family businesses, professionals and managers of large companies. They make successful politicians, artists and sportswomen. They are agents of progress, making the world a better, more worthwhile place. </p>
<p class="contents">Even though women possess admirable managerial skills and perform remarkably well in the business sector, in Central Europe men are two times more likely to succeed as entrepreneurs than women. To a large extent, this is due to the fact that women in executive positions are forced to face many additional challenges, notably to do with their role in the family. To attain the goals of the Lisbon Strategy, Europe needs to boost the employment of women by ensuring good working conditions. By the same token, in order to stand up to the challenges of a globalising world, Europe must promote demographic recovery through a mix of family policies.</p>
<p class="contents">A stable family in which the woman plays her unique role as the giver of life is a basic precondition for stability and prosperity in Europe. Recently published statistics suggest that the birth rate has plummeted in an unprecedented way during the past few years. This calls for thorough analysis of the situation and requires solutions that will enable us to escape from the current demographic predicament.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments I have mentioned corroborate the importance of this discussion of the own-initiative report by the rapporteur, Mrs Sartori, who I would like to congratulate and thank for her work. The report, however, contains some problematic and sensitive points, such as quota implementation and reproductive health. Unless we manage to muster enough courage and strength to protect human life, to encourage lifestyles based on traditional family values and to protect families with children, in a couple of years we will end up at an impasse.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that women need quotas to elevate them to politics, science or business. What they need is for us to put the conditions in place to enable them to enter the labour market and retain their positions there. It is essential to dismantle all remaining forms of discrimination, such as wage gaps and unequal treatment in the implementation of pension schemes. I am convinced that only a roadmap with this vision of gender equality in its sights will ensure prosperity…</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Моите поздравления към докладчика и към Комисията по правата на жените и равнопоставеността.</p>
<p class="contents">От справката, която си направих, между 50% и 60% от анкетираните групи считат, че в страните на Европейския съюз има равнопоставеност между половете. В моята страна този процент е по-висок от средния. Това, според мен, е формално и се дължи на няколко причини. Равнопоставеността стои на вниманието на обществото и то има волята въпросът да се реши за използване на потенциала на жените и на мъжете. В много области жените са добре представени, но за съжаление с по-ниски заплащания, което някои считат за равнопоставеност.</p>

Трябва да подредим дневния си ред, да решим законодателните пропуски, да намерим инструментариума за прилагане на законите и контрола за изпълнението.

But if there is no other solution, then we need to examine this option as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, as a member of the International Olympic Commission, to draw your attention to the fact that around 40% of the participants in the Olympic Games are women, and yet their participation in the organisation of the Olympic movement was completely negligible. To solve this problem, in the late 1990s the IOC worked out a strict quota system and said that within ten years, the number of women involved in decision-making processes must reach 20%. This is not a large number, but I am nonetheless pleased to report that this effort has already brought fine results.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning specifically to the report, allow me to speak of the question of equal opportunity within the field of physical education and sport in schools. The student bodies in Europe’s schools form quite diverse multicultural communities, in which various ethnic and religious minorities are represented. In the case of Muslim girls, it is quite difficult to find a solution for them to participate in physical education. On the one hand, there is the struggle for gender equality and the equal right of girls and women to physical education, and on the other hand the need to respect cultural diversity, or in other words, the right of ethnic groups to maintain their practices of separating the sexes. I nevertheless maintain that it is very important for Muslim girls to take part in physical education at school, even if important considerations arise which hinder this participation, such as for instance specific dress codes; the widespread existence of coeducational schools; the limits on physical exercise during the month of Ramadan, and cultural expectations regarding dance classes and other extra-curricular activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I recommend that theoretical and practical case studies be carried out and good practices be adopted even if the issue is a sensitive one because it raises questions of human rights, religion and culture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s new Roadmap for equality between women and men does not, however, contain a single new legislative measure. In addition, no financial resources are allocated to the implementation of the very important recommendations contained in this document, such as the swift introduction of national regulations to help women be active on the labour market whilst enjoying equal rights and on the principle of equal pay for equal work. No resources are allocated either to the implementation of specific strategies for the promotion of female entrepreneurship.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the European Commission should give priority to undertaking a review of the Council directive aimed at the alignment of national legislation relating to the implementation of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women. Particular attention should be paid to provisions on workplace inspections and to the appeal procedures available for discrimination against women.</p>
<p class="contents">For the equal rights policy to be successfully implemented, the Member States should designate, at national level, a specific body to deal with gender equality issues. This body would be responsible for assistance in creating and reviewing national plans, and would also monitor their implementation.</p>

The Commission should also become involved in research on violence against women and table a suitable draft directive on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, respect for women’s rights must be an essential condition of the European Union’s neighbourhood, foreign and development policies towards third countries. It is well known that the media exert a strong influence on citizens’ outlook. Accordingly, if positive examples of the achievements of female role models in various areas were disseminated, for instance in the framework of the MEDIA 2007 programme, this might prove an effective way of combating the widespread negative stereotyping that still exists.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vladimír Špidla, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(CS)</span> Honourable Members, thank you for the debate, which clearly demonstrates that the issue of equal opportunities remains one of the most important in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that virtually all of the proposals put forward are in some way contained in the roadmap for equality between men and women. I also note the fully justified comment that despite 30 years of the directive on equal pay, there is still no equal pay. This is a more complex problem than can be solved by a single directive; it is a problem involving prejudice, education and segregation in the labour market. The Commission has therefore decided to make equal pay one of its key issues. This is moreover why we have had studies carried out and have proposed communications that attempt to take effective action in this area in such a way that we can achieve tangible results. Up to now the results have not been particularly good.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that the issue of reconciling family and work life was brought to the fore. I would point out that we have taken the first steps and it is clear that this goes beyond mere technical adjustments to the work environment; it is a broader problem that touches on the fair division of tasks in life between men and women. There remains a great deal to do in this area. I feel, for example, that the Barcelona Strategy has not been implemented as fully as had been planned.</p>
<p class="contents">What was also highlighted was the strengthening of the proportion of women in management positions. This is a fundamental issue. The Commission was strongly criticised for the fact that there are very few women in the climate change and energy group. I should just like to point out that the current Commission has eight female Commissioners and the Commission’s Secretary-General is a woman. The female Commissioners are in charge of very important portfolios, so it is incorrect to say that no progress has been made. The situation of women in Turkey was also mentioned. I should like to highlight the fact that I am firmly committed to equal opportunities, which form part of the Copenhagen criteria, being treated with the utmost seriousness. This means that countries in which there is no equality of opportunities should not be allowed accession to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to debates on cultural difference, sexual mutilations and particular cultural environments, I should like to point out that human rights and equal opportunities, in my view, take precedence over any cultural considerations. It is up to us to ensure that these rights are upheld in a sensitive manner.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards affirmative action, I feel, firstly, that this is permitted under European law, and that secondly, it is inaccurate to think of it as positive discrimination, because rather than giving preferential treatment, joint affirmative action redresses unfair burdens and balances opportunities. Quotas were mentioned a great deal and I am fully aware of the many cases in which women have been barred from a particular position simply on account of being female, having fulfilled all the other conditions. I therefore feel that the question of affirmative action is one on which we should keep a close eye and an open mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I should like once again to thank Mrs Sartori. After all, this own-initiative report is one that contains a wide range of important points, which we will undoubtedly make use of in our joint efforts towards guaranteeing the highest level of equality between men and women. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
