In 1997 in Amsterdam, and again in 1999 in Tampere in Finland, the Heads of State and Government committed themselves to tackling terrorism. Our review of progress early this year showed that they had done nothing about it, which was why we as a Parliament brought forward a report calling on them to take action. The events of 11 September have fortunately brought such action and I look forward to travelling to Washington shortly to talk about common action between the European Union and the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the political groups in this House for their cooperation in drawing up this report, particularly the Members from Spain. In my report, I broadly welcome the Commission proposals for a Council framework decision on combating terrorism and for a European arrest warrant. The amendments which I put forward seek to restrict the list of crimes defined as terrorist crimes and covered by the European arrest warrant to the most serious cross-border criminal offences, and if I may quote Amendment No 16, it specifies those crimes "which aim to destroy the fundamental freedoms, democracy, respect for human rights, civil liberties and the rule of law on which our societies are based". We seek too to insert safeguards for civil liberties by basing action clearly on international human rights documents, by reinforcing the principle of <span class="italic">ne bis in idem</span>, by taking account of time spent in detention awaiting trial and by allowing Member States refusal to extradite when there are manifestly sound reasons for doing so, including in those cases where a person found guilty could face a penalty of death. Moreover, we seek to provide aids to victims of terrorism and their families.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall ask the House to accept one amendment, which was submitted after the deadline and which takes account of the most recent developments in Council. One Member State is threatening to block progress towards a European arrest warrant. There is a method – not one which I recommend – but one which may be needed <span class="italic">in extremis</span>, in order to press ahead, and that is to invoke Article 40 of the Treaty allowing reinforced cooperation between a certain number of Member States. Terrorism is a supranational challenge and calls for a supranational response. We cannot allow the blockage of one Member State to prevent common action in fighting it.</p>
<p class="contents">When we met in this Chamber, on 12 September, we had a debate in which I remember Mr Poettering and many others said that we were all Americans. Since then, we have discovered that we must first be Europeans. We acknowledge that recognition of judicial judgements and judicial standards requires trust in each other's systems, but not blind trust, and for that reason I have put forward an amendment calling for urgent measures to improve judicial systems in our Member States, to encourage benchmarking, to encourage exchange of best practice. The process of creating an area of freedom, security and justice is similar to that of creating the single market, but it is more urgent and, moreover, we are dealing not with the freedom of movement of goods, services or capital, but with the freedom of people.</p>
<p class="contents">The Greens and other political groups are saying, don't go ahead until you are sure that everybody's judicial standards are perfect. Majority opinion, however, on the Committee recognises that the scope of the challenge we face and the historical imperative are such that we must press ahead with these measures with prudence, and with vigilance, but also with determination.</p>
<p class="contents">We must ensure effective action against terrorists and yet we must not deny legitimate political expression of grievances. I was surprised to read in El País this morning an interpretation of one amendment, which I support, that it would outlaw Herri Batasuna. I do not interpret the amendment in this way, nor would such an amendment be necessary to target those involved in supporting terrorist acts. Other provisions in what we are proposing do that. I would say to colleagues, and particularly to our Spanish colleagues, that in our determination to tackle terrorism, we must acknowledge that terrorists sometimes express political grievances, and that these require a political response.</p>
<p class="contents">Council is discussing the proposals put forward by the Commission; Parliament, which desperately needs powers of codecision, may be reconsulted on this matter. We are determined to assist governments in their work and yet maintain the delicate balance between the security needs of our citizens and preservation of their democratic freedoms. In this, cooperation in Justice and Home Affairs has received quite a boost. Whatever it was that we planned at Amsterdam, the paradox is that events are what drives Europe forward: just as Mr Haider's election led us to adopt effective legislation against racism and xenophobia, so it may be that Mr bin Laden has done much for European Union integration.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say, finally, what a pleasure it is to see you as a fellow Liberal Democrat in the Chair in this session. I wish you a successful debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The establishment, at long last, of Eurojust puts this key in our hands, so that we can combat serious crime, such as terrorism, trafficking in human beings and drug-smuggling flexibly and successfully, without regard to the Community's internal borders. When Parliament approved the establishment of Eurojust, as long ago as early 2001, it envisaged 1 January 2002 as its starting date. The Council has made substantial changes to the initiatives underlying Eurojust, which made it necessary to consult Parliament again, but, despite this, I do not see Eurojust's starting date early next year as having been jeopardised. The Council has, since 11 September, demonstrated its capacity for rapid reaction when circumstances require it, as the safety of people in Europe most certainly does.</p>
<p class="contents">The document under consideration today already incorporates significant amendments by the Council at Parliament's suggestion in the first consultation. Eurojust's areas of competence were therefore defined in such a way as to include borderline cases and new forms of serious crime. Eurojust can also, moreover, at the request of a competent national authority, support investigations and prosecutions outside the areas described. This ensures maximum flexibility and efficiency in our shared struggle against crime, which knows no boundaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's proposals for smooth cooperation between Eurojust and the national authorities are also welcomed in the Council's new document, something for which I would like to take this opportunity to express my gratitude. Despite this, we still have to make a few changes in order to make Eurojust the best possible instrument against cross-frontier crime. If I rightly understand the indications from the Member States' governments and from the Council, these will meet with wide-ranging agreement between Parliament and the Council. Last weekend, the German and French governments, at their summit in Nantes, underlined Parliament's view that Eurojust should become the basic unit of a European State Prosecution Service. This would strengthen the European Union's judicial aspect, give effect to conventions that have been drawn up but not yet ratified, and continue existing initiatives in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also consider it important that Eurojust's involvement in investigations and prosecutions should not be hampered by unnecessary bureaucracy. It makes no sense for Eurojust to set up national branch offices. Investigators and prosecutors, in Eurojust and in the Member States, must be able to communicate with each other directly. We know from our experience of organised crime that short routes and procedures alone can offer hope of speedy and sure success in investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude with data protection, a point which is of especial importance to me. The processing of data by Eurojust must include an appropriately high level of protection for the individual citizen. This can only be taken for granted if the storing of personal data is kept to the minimum required and if data is not stored for longer than is absolutely necessary. It goes without saying that special requirements must apply to the handling of data on victims and witnesses. There is also a clear need to safeguard the individual's right to information, which he must be in a position to demand.</p>
<p class="contents">It is most encouraging to receive favourable indications from the Council, including in data protection matters. I hope, though, that they will go much further yet. Only one wish will no doubt not be granted me: Eurojust will not be based in Luxembourg, which would have symbolised so well this institution's independence and its closeness to European Community law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council meeting of 20 September, and then the European Council that met the following day, decided, as you know, on rapid implementation of the Action Plan against terrorism, with a December deadline for each of the three decisions that we are discussing today, which are key elements of this action plan. European citizens would not understand if the European Union did not work as fast as possible to adopt the measures in question. The speed with which the rapporteurs have worked and with which the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has examined the reports, and you are to discuss them today, are exemplary. Respecting the deadlines set for adopting these decisions depended on all of that, and the Presidency is very grateful to you for that support for its work.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, first of all, I will deal with the decision creating Eurojust, then the framework decision on the European arrest warrant, and I will finish with the framework decision on combating terrorism. I will not go back over the objectives of each of the instruments, or not much. You know them well enough. I would like to confine myself to the reason why you invited the Presidency here today, and I will therefore go through the preparatory work for each of the decisions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR) </span>An initial opinion from Parliament was adopted on 17 May this year but, given the many changes that had been made to the text, it became necessary to have a fresh consultation. The Presidency has taken particular care to ensure that the opinions given by Parliament were taken into account throughout the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Eurojust should bring real added value compared with the existing instruments. Bringing together magistrates from the Member States in a single body will surely enable good coordination and close cooperation between the authorities responsible for prosecution. Eurojust will thus provide an effective instrument with a view to creating the area of freedom, security and justice which has been our aim since the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we therefore needed to ensure genuine, effective cooperation between Eurojust and the other bodies created as part of our Union. We therefore needed to be careful to avoid overlaps of responsibility and redundancies. All these issues are covered by provisions in the draft decision. Cooperation between Eurojust and Europol and the relationship that those two bodies will have to maintain will be the subject of a separate agreement. This draft agreement is being drawn up by the members of the pro-Eurojust provisional unit and the representatives of Europol. It was most desirable to include those primarily affected in the discussion and to better integrate the further developments in Europol that are currently under negotiation within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The authorities of Member States which fail to meet Eurojust’s request will need to justify their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">A whole host of provisions in the draft Decree concern the introduction of rules to protect personal data.

<p class="contents">Given the extent of the tasks and the deadlines to be met, the Presidency has speeded up the Council activities considerably. The dossier was immediately dealt with by the Article 36 Committee, thus allowing the most delicate issues to be discussed there straight away. This has necessitated the convening of various extraordinary meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a group of experts has also met several times in order to prepare the groundwork for the most technical aspects. At the Article 36 Committee, the debates to date have mainly focused on the scope of the instrument that addresses the problems involved in the dual criminality requirement and on the modalities of judicial inspection within the implementing Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are agreed that the scope must be determined on the basis of a positive list of infringements. It was impossible to retain the principle of a negative list because it has appeared impossible to reach agreement about the withdrawal of the dual criminality requirement with such a broadly defined scope.</p>
<p class="contents">During the Justice and Internal Affairs Council of 16 November, there was broad consensus about the Presidency’s compromise proposal for a positive list and also a mock agreement to apply dual criminality to the infringements which feature on the list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that decision, we can, of course, draw on the experience already gathered in connection with the two instruments I mentioned a moment ago, but that does not take away from the importance of the decision. First of all, because it is also essential to promote judicial cooperation by harmonising penalisations. It is crucial to develop a common strategy on terrorism and in that way to develop a truly European criminal policy in that area. It is also vital to grant European courts of justice broad judicial powers.</p>
<p class="contents">But the significance of the framework decision also lies in the subtleties thereof, as some of you have rightly pointed out: all actions in connection with terrorism, including taking part in and supporting a terrorist group, must be considered. At the same time, great care must be taken not to go too far, and accordingly, a definition should be introduced which rules out any risk of abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is acutely aware of this, and it is with those elements in mind that the activities are moving forwards.

<p class="contents">Two additional elements have been adopted by the Council in order to confirm the guarantees of respect for fundamental rights. First of all, the preamble will state that the framework decision is without prejudice to the exercising of human rights, in particular, the right of association, expression and demonstration. Also, a political declaration will add to these precautions, specifying that the decision does not cover people who are acting to preserve or restore democratic values, or people who are exercising the right to express their opinions, even if, while exercising that right, they commit offences. Finally, the preamble will exclude from the framework decision’s scope, the activities of the armed forces in a period of armed conflict when they are performing their official duties, as governed by international law.

The ideas that the Commission expressed on this matter in its communication of November 2000 and the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament in May of this year, following the report by Mrs Gebhardt, are, to a large extent, echoed in the text that is now being studied by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall, therefore, limit myself to emphasising two or three aspects in greater detail. Firstly, as Mrs Gebhardt stated, in the version currently under examination, the rules on the protection of personal data have been extended and improved. The draft document adopts a balanced approach that respects both the legitimate interests and fundamental rights of Europe’s citizens and the need for the effective coordination of investigations and prosecutions. There will be an independent joint supervisory body for data protection and, if necessary, legal solutions will be provided for appeals to be lodged in national courts.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the role of the Union’s institutions has been strengthened and the Commission is fully involved in the work of Eurojust in its various areas of responsibility. Parliament will be kept fully informed of the budgetary issues and I hope that it will also be given the task of discharging the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Gebhardt’s excellent report also includes a list of supplementary amendments, most of which meet with the Commission’s approval. I shall only mention the examples of the amendments concerning membership of the joint supervisory body for personal data, cooperation with OLAF, the Commission’s anti-fraud body, and Eurojust, Parliament’s discharge of the budget, the time limits for the storage of data and the law applicable in the event of damage resulting from incorrect data processing. I hope that the Council will also bear these suggestions in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to the other two initiatives under consideration, the events of 11 September 2001 have, I am sad to say, confirmed the validity of the recommendations adopted by the European Parliament on 5 September 2001, following an own-initiative report drawn up by Graham Watson. As Commissioner responsible for Justice and Home Affairs, I wish to congratulate and pay public tribute to Mr Watson, the Chairman of Parliament’s Committee on Citizen’s Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, whose efforts and name will always be associated with this initiative of enormous political scope; the fight against terrorism and against crime in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations in the Watson report, published in September, were, to a large extent, taken into account in the proposals presented by the Commission on 19 September which are now being studied by the Council. I wish firstly to discuss the proposal for a framework decision on combating terrorism. The Council debate on this proposal has focused on the three most important and, at the same time, most problematic issues: defining terrorist crime, clarifying the rules of jurisdiction for the prosecution of terrorist acts and the framework of penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist acts.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to definition, there has been concern to ensure that the framework decision cannot, under any circumstances, apply to legitimate action, for example in the context of the activities of unions or anti-globalisation movements. The Commission has subscribed to this interpretation from the outset and considers that the solution we are working towards respects the basic structure of the Commission’s initial proposal, which is to, “define a terrorist offence on the basis of the identification of an objective factor: the terrorist act, accompanied by the identification of a subjective element: a terrorist motivation under the terms of the proposal”. This is the text currently under consideration by the Council. At the same time, the solution also provides more detail on allowing the requirements that must be met for the offence included in the positive list to be considered a terrorist offence, to be identified in legislation itself. We are, therefore, in favour of improving the definition contained in the text currently being studied by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This aspect, in fact, provides a further guarantee: no common crime, not even acts of violence committed incidentally in the context of certain demonstrations, will be covered by the instrument to eliminate terrorism. The Council is currently considering the possibility of issuing a statement explaining that anyone acting in the interest of preserving or restoring democratic values, instances of which occurred in some Member States during the Second World War, cannot be considered to be a terrorist. This aspect is in line with some of the amendments tabled by Parliament to ensure that the fundamental rights and freedoms on which our countries are founded cannot, under any circumstances, be endangered by the present framework decision.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to jurisdiction, the debate in the Council is close to reaching a solution that is very similar to the one recommended in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament. There is consensus in Council on a balanced formula that combines the Commission’s initial proposal and the more ambitious project suggested by some Member States and by Parliament on national jurisdictions being extended to cover the entire territory of the Union. Consequently, Member States can,<span class="italic"> </span>if they so desire, extend their jurisdiction if the offence has been committed in any part of the Union’s territory.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the third issue, that of penalties and sanctions, I would say that this is still the main problem with the framework decision, given the lack of consensus on a common level of penalties and sanctions for individual terrorist offences. The Commission is not yet satisfied with the approach that is currently applied for individual offences, under which the penalties and sanctions applicable to terrorist offences committed by individuals would not be harmonised. Instead, weightier penalties and sanctions than those provided for under national legislation for the same offences committed without the special intention required for classification as terrorist acts would apply. If we limit our ambitions in this way, we will not be fulfilling the mandate laid down in the Article 31(e) of the Treaty, nor will we be following the recommendation contained in the Watson report. Furthermore, we would be acting inconsistently since, in previous instruments, we have managed to adopt common penalties and sanctions for the counterfeiting of the euro, for assisting illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings, and it would be inexplicable not to be equally ambitious when it comes to punishing terrorist acts. I hope that it is possible to find a solution on the basis of the proposal that the Commission presented on creating a range of penalties and sanctions for the individual offences listed in Articles 1 and 2 of the Commission proposal, with greater flexibility to adapt them to the scale of penalties in force in the national legislation of each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, this framework decision stipulates that the Member States must adopt all possible measures to guarantee appropriate assistance to the families of victims, implementing, where possible, Article 4 of the Framework Decision on the Status of Victims in Connection with Criminal Proceedings. This approach is entirely consistent with Parliament’s point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the second framework decision, on the European arrest warrant, must be based on the principle of the mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council of October 1999, and with the recommendation made to us by the Heads of State and Government at the Ghent European Council of October this year. The text we are now discussing, submitted by the Presidency, includes a positive list of offences for which a double jeopardy verification does not have to be carried out. As you know, the Commission proposal that is being discussed today seeks to make the abolition of the double jeopardy rule universal, with the exception of a negative list identified by the Commission. Since the Ghent European Council, it has become clear that this approach by the Commission would not have majority support in Council. Hence the Presidency has moved ahead with a compromise proposal, which assumes that the execution of an arrest warrant for offences included in the positive list does not require double jeopardy verification. The Commission is prepared to support this compromise proposal by the Presidency provided that the definition of offences included on this positive list is substantial and that it sends a clear, unequivocal message that we are strengthening the mechanisms of judicial cooperation to fight against the various forms of transnational organised crime. In order to ensure that the mechanism of the positive list works and is effective, the definition of the offences on this list must respect the definition of these offences in force in the legislation of the Member States issuing a search and arrest warrant. This is an essential component. Unless this component is complied with, the double jeopardy condition would also be reintroduced for these offences, which is exactly what we are trying to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we are approaching an agreement on the content of the positive list. However, at the moment, this agreement is not yet completely signed and sealed. I hope that, by the Council of 6 and 7 December, it will be possible to conclude a unanimous agreement on a substantial positive list that fulfils the objective of a mechanism for an effective European arrest warrant that can be implemented in a straightforward way.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the last aspect that I wish to focus on, the Commission has included in its proposal a set of rules that are intended to reconcile effectiveness in the fight against crime, on the one hand, and the protection of citizens’ rights and fundamental freedoms on the other. I hope that the Council resists the temptation to remove provisions that offer protection on the grounds that they are not necessary, since the Member States are, in any event, bound to respect legal safeguards. It is true that one of the essential elements for the creation of this mechanism is the principle of mutual trust that has resulted from the Member States signing up to the Council of Europe’s European Convention of Human Rights of 1950 and from having jointly proclaimed the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in December of 2000. I would say, however, that it is, nevertheless, important to emphasise some specific mechanisms that should be included in this framework decision in order to guarantee and safeguard the fundamental rights of our citizens. Other amendments along the same lines consist of bringing the wording of the <span class="italic">Ne bis in idem</span> rule, laid down in Article 29 of the Commission’s proposal, into line with the wording of Article 50 of the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights so as to obviate the requirement for the arrest warrant to be accompanied by proof that the individual has been duly informed of the procedure in time to prepare a defence in the event that he or she is sentenced in absentia. Another good example of these rules is the deduction of the period of deprivation of liberty from the punishment laid down in Article 24 of the Commission proposal, which states that the period of detention in the Member State executing the warrant must be taken into account for the purposes of calculating compensation in the event that the individual surrendered is not convicted. There must be a balance between the need for speed and effective cooperation between judicial authorities and the interests of individuals, who must not be subjected to additional or excessive constraints or have their ability to mount a defence hampered. The Commission feels that it would be desirable, where the identification of the laws and principles that safeguard fundamental rights in a European judicial area is concerned, to extend these rules. The Commission realises, therefore, that it would be desirable to pursue the task of approximating legislation on criminal proceedings in the Member States. We must, simultaneously, guarantee the effectiveness of prosecutions and the safeguarding of the rights of individuals. It may, therefore, prove necessary at Union level to address, in a more concerted way, the right to language assistance, the proper treatment of evidence and the issue of the courts’ bail system. The Commission is considering the possibility of issuing a communication on these aspects that could cover a huge range of factors. These issues require a horizontal approach and, therefore, we propose finalising them at a later date in a specific mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall conclude by referring to Mr Watson’s proposal for an oral amendment that was tabled here today. Now that we are debating the Commission’s position, we must step up negotiations to conclude an agreement supported by all fifteen Member States. Not an agreement at any price, but an agreement that responds to the challenge of the fight against terrorism and organised crime before us. We also welcome the Belgian Presidency’s commitment to obtaining this agreement. I also wish to make it clear, however, that, where the European arrest warrant is concerned, an agreement can certainly be concluded on the list of thirty-four offences to which Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck has just referred. I must also clearly state that the list does not include minor offences because this is a list annexed to the Europol Convention. I would also say that, if these offences are considered to be offences that warrant police cooperation under the terms of Europol, they must also be considered to be unquestionably serious for the purposes of judicial cooperation in criminal matters. Regardless of national legal cultures and regardless of the moral censure that a particular offence might generate at national level, I am convinced that the option we should pursue at the moment is to conclude an agreement with all fifteen Member States, a substantial agreement on the list of offences to which the European arrest warrant should apply. If this agreement cannot be concluded with all fifteen countries, we will then have to consider what to do next. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a democratic State governed by the rule of law, any political demand is acceptable and to be respected and the democratic confrontation of ideas is always to be welcomed; these are our standards, our very essence, our identifying mark, on which the whole idea of European integration is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, however, the democratic State governed by the rule of law rejects those who express their ideas through bloodshed. When faced with those who sow the seeds of terror, death and destruction in our societies, there is only one dialogue possible, the dialogue that arises from the implementation of the law. This is our guiding thought on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that we are constructing, on the bases and principles of our legal systems in democratic States governed by the rule of law, a democratic Europe governed by the rule of law. We had a situation that was completely lacking in balance between progress in the field of security and progress in the field of freedom and justice. The three proposals debated respond, and it was about time, to a request from Europe’s citizens and to the clear political will, at the highest level, of the Heads of State and Government, which, as Mr Watson has clearly pointed out, runs from Vienna to Tampere, and has been strengthened since 11 September at the Extraordinary European Council in Brussels and in Ghent.</p>
<p class="contents">These three methods also respond to the principles upon which Europe has been constructed. Firstly, cooperation and coordination, as seen in Eurojust, where we cooperate and coordinate in order to be more effective in the field of justice. Secondly, the mutual recognition on which the internal market is based, and this, as the Commissioner has said, a corollary of the confidence between States, which is the fundamental element of the European search and arrest warrant. Finally, harmonisation wherever this may be necessary and the need for harmonisation with regard to terrorism is obvious, because only six Member States had any legislation covering this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I trust, no, I am sure, that by voting for these reports with an overwhelming majority tomorrow, Parliament will be giving, as it always has, the political signal that, as responsible representatives of the citizens, we have the obligation to work on the construction of democratic States governed by the rule of law, in those countries in which we are fortunate enough to live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Without a doubt, the attacks in New York have made us realise that nobody can feel entirely safe from terrorism. When a man and a woman are murdered in Beasaín, as happened last week, for example, each and every one of us is affected, and it is not reasonable to ask the elected representatives of a democracy, Mr Watson, to have to debate under the threat of death.</p>
<p class="contents">These events have also reminded us that we were a long way behind in meeting the commitments that the Heads of State and Government had given in Tampere in order to develop the third pillar of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The report that we approved by a large majority in committee contains contributions which, in my opinion, are very valid, to the otherwise excellent Commission proposal. For example, to define street violence as clearly being one form of terrorist expression, or to incorporate a reference to victims and their families and to offer political support and legal protection with the aim of identifying terrorism and bringing terrorists and their supporters to justice through the courts. This is precisely the purpose of the amendment we tabled in plenary and should be interpreted in this way. I hope that these and other contributions will be added to the text that the Council is debating, and, in particular, this latter amendment, which I hope the rapporteur will also vote for and will be taken into consideration when the European list of terrorist organisations that Parliament requested is drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministers for Justice and Home Affairs should fulfil their duty on the 6 and 7 December, and if they do not do so, the Presidency will have to honour its commitment to Parliament to take this issue at Laeken, and if any Member State there is tempted to block a proposal that has the widespread support of our citizens, it seems appropriate to me that closer cooperation should be implemented according to provisions of Article 40 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s requests do not date from 11 September. In September 2000, one year ago, the vast majority of MEPs signed a written declaration requesting the methods that today have been submitted for our consideration. These are the same methods that we are asking the Commission for in the own-initiative report on the role of the European Union in the fight against terrorism that we approved, also by a very large majority, on 5 September. Therefore, it needs to be made very clear that none of these measures makes the slightest reduction in the civil liberties of European citizens. The opposite is the case, we are giving the judicial system instruments to enable it to better protect everyone’s freedom because, faced with the free movement of crime, we must open the doors to the free movement of justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a democracy, political ideas are put to the test in the voting booth, and not put forward by terrorists. I am sure that all my fellow Members are of this opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to clearly point out what will be changed by these two initiatives when they are adopted by the Laeken European Council : firstly, Europe will cease to ‘show solidarity with’ and instead be ‘responsible for’. The solidarity of Europeans with Spanish democrats in their fight against ETA will give way to the responsibility of all European democrats to defeat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and with regard to the European search and arrest warrant, agreements between governments will be replaced with recognition and cooperation between their various judicial systems. An injunction will have to be able to be executed without delay, whether it has been issued by a Spanish judge or a French judge, against an individual who is sought in one or other of the countries. To make my position clear, I feel there should be no more disgraceful spectacles such as the one that took place at Olano.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as thinking about the future, however, I cannot help but think with a certain degree of bitterness that these two provisions have come far too late, for the victims. How different their lives would have been if we had done this earlier! If only this had been done ten years ago, I am sure that ETA would, by now, have been defeated, and that many of my close friends who have been murdered by ETA would still be here with us, still taking their children to school, giving lectures, writing articles for the press, administering justice, representing their voters.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, therefore, ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to reflect upon this tomorrow before you vote. I would like you to consider that the consequences of this will not only be political, but will, more than anything, be of a human nature, and I would ask the Council to rise, in political terms, to this occasion, and not to miss this opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">There are those that think that politics is the art of the possible. My opinion is that the purpose of politics is to make what is necessary possible. I trust that the Fifteen will share this opinion. I assure you that the defeat of terrorism is possible, and, ladies and gentlemen, you do not realise just how necessary this is. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that is dependant on the ability of every single judge in the European Union to understand and apply ECHR provisions. We have no coherent EU programme to ensure they do. Lest I be thought chauvinist in raising the problem of Britons in Greece, let me criticise my own government in the UK. They are trying to put through an anti-terrorism bill with a derogation from the ECHR in order to detain suspects without a proper trial, with no legal representation, no judicial review and without being able to hear the evidence given by the intelligence services. This certainly leaves the UK lacking credibility in a campaign for mutual raising of standards in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Another worrying development in the UK is the intention to let police and security cooperation measures slip through the Westminster Parliament without proper democratic scrutiny. Here we debate, but we have no equality with Ministers in deciding the legislation. Coupled with Council secrecy, this means a very unsatisfactory position in terms of democracy, justice and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, may I make a direct appeal to Commissioner Vitorino to ensure that organisations acting in the field of raising justice standards, such as the admirable Fair Trials Abroad, can be assisted under the Community budget. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, under no circumstances should it serve as a pretext for gagging our fundamental rights and democratic freedoms. How can we justify a European proposal to combat terrorism if no added value can be gained from it? Under the current legislation of the Member States, perpetrators of attacks could not go unpunished. As the public enemy number one is terrorism, why not limit the European arrest warrant to terrorist offences? If the illegal capture of State or government facilities, public modes of transport, infrastructures or public places constitutes a terrorist offence or if the legitimate expression of our freedoms of expression and association, our trade union rights, could, in the future, be criminalised or described as terrorism, if those elements are retained, by voting in favour of these reports we will be renouncing all of our democratic rights. An explicit guarantee of these rights and freedoms must be included in this proposal for a framework directive. Our fears also extend to certain offences that could fall under the warrant, as the criterion used is that of the sentence, while the accused persons may deserve protection, for example if they are migrants or asylum seekers. Even those giving support to those people would, in the future, become guilty of terrorism. A minimum degree of harmonisation of Member States’ criminal procedures is necessary in order to safeguard the principle of equality before the law and guarantee the protection of rights in the principle of collegiality. Furthermore, as minors cannot be the subjects of an arrest warrant, their description for criminal purposes also needs to be harmonised. If we are to establish an area of security, freedom and justice, these three dimensions need to be fully effective. Unfortunately, we observe that the security aspect is dominating the policies of the Union and the Member States. The fight against terrorism needs to be reflected in security for all residents, without exception and in total respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Finally, if a new text has to be adopted by the Council in the future, we hope that this House will be consulted once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many European governments are using the criminal terrorist action of 11 September against the United States as an excuse to issue further legislation curbing freedoms which has nothing to do with combating terrorism. Leaving aside the special military tribunals set up by President Bush, it is enough to reflect upon the recent laws issued or proposed in Italy or in the United Kingdom in order to understand that their objective is to curb and control growing political opposition to a world social and economic order which is unfair and inhuman: the wealth, well-being, growth and development of a fifth of the human race are mirrored by the starvation, lack of resources, ongoing economic decline and underdevelopment of the other four fifths.</p>
<p class="contents">It is strange that we can never manage to find a legal formula to define this major social massacre as an act of terrorism, while we had no hesitation in labelling as terrorist acts all those demonstrations of social opposition which have taken place recently in Seattle, Genoa and so forth.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 3 of the proposal for a framework decision on terrorism sends a clear message to all those who, in the future, attempt to show their opposition to the neo-liberal monopoly on thinking and the resulting social system. Women, men, workers, students, the unemployed, pacifists and ecologists will no longer be opposing the system but will be terrorists because – as Hegel, then an old man, wrongly said – ‘the real is rational and the rational real’, and for our legislators nothing is more real than the present social and economic disorder and nothing is more irrational, and therefore terrorist, than the need to overthrow and eliminate it.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to make it clear that I do support the European arrest warrant and that, as an Italian, I condemn the fact that my country’s government should be the one to oppose a unanimous decision. It is shameful because the intention of the Berlusconi government in adopting this position is to prevent corruption being listed among the offences on the ‘positive’ list. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The legal instruments which will make this fight genuinely effective include the European arrest warrant, which will, at last, replace the complex and excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures which have now become insufficient and inadequate for fighting crime, particularly international crime. That said, we need to move one step at a time. The emotion of the tragic terrorist attacks of recent months must certainly prompt us to strengthen judicial cooperation between the Member States without delay, but in speeding up this process we must take things one step at a time and act responsibly.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, good laws are not compatible with haste or with lack of precision or emotional reactions, particularly when it comes to identifying the offences in respect of which the European arrest warrant is to be applied. We would therefore express our concern at the Belgian Presidency’s proposal to apply the European arrest warrant to a list of around 30 categories of offences immediately. In our opinion, terrorism or the trafficking of human beings, to give just two examples, cannot be placed on the same level as counterfeiting or forgery. It would therefore be more in the general interest to propose and adopt, first of all, with the unanimous consent of all the Member States, an initial, limited list and then, subsequently, to extend this list gradually, thus focusing initially on terrorist crimes, organised crime, the trafficking of drugs, arms and human beings and the exploitation of minors. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They all have major or minor reservations, and many are forthright in their rejection of them because it is a case of the end justifying the means, and the means to be used amount to a violation of what are fundamental ideals in terms of legal rights, something which, for example, Denmark’s General Council of the Bar has come out very strongly against. In my view, this panic reaction has meant that these proposals have been treated with a quite scandalous disregard for any basic demand that they be properly examined. These fundamental legal reforms, which are among the most complicated of legislative matter and require an extensive consultation procedure, are to be implemented without any substantial debate on the issues involved and on the basis of, if I may say so, Commissioner, what is, to put it mildly, inadequate preparation. It is unpleasantly reminiscent of political ‘body-snatching’, and that is a violation of fundamental legal rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Current events show just how necessary this is, irrespective of the many considerations put forward by Members from the left side of the House which have the effect of shifting our attention away from the numerous dangers presented by the way terrorist groups work and are interconnected. In fact, by way of example, the revelations published today in the Italian daily newspaper <span class="italic">La Repubblica</span> on the change of hands of important<span class="bold"> </span>nuclear material which is already part of the stock owned by the Mobutu regime, offer a very serious perspective on this trafficking which has taken place and may still be taking place at this very moment in the States of the European Union.

It extends from money laundering, by way of the freezing of accounts, to the measures we are discussing today. I am glad that, at last, terrorism is defined as an offence in all fifteen Member States and not just in six, as was formerly the case, and can therefore be proceeded against. I am glad that there is the hope of a European arrest warrant. I hope that national animosities do not again lead to the postponement of this European arrest warrant, which we so urgently need. Just go back to Parliament's proposal, when, I believe, the position we took up was a good one. I am glad that we will make Eurojust a reality and that the enlarged powers to combat terrorism take us another step forward in the right direction. I am glad that Europol will have joint investigative teams. All this is very positive in that we are showing the public just what added value the European Union can have.</p>
<p class="contents">I demand, though, that currently unresolved points in certain areas be dealt with. The Member States must finally be required, and with consequences in the event of their non-compliance, to supply Europol with information and to ensure optimum coordination between Eurojust and Europol and appropriate parliamentary management and monitoring. Parliament has made some excellent proposals on this point, and I congratulate the rapporteur and the whole team of shadow rapporteurs. I hope that the excellent work they have done will meet with complete support tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission proposal on the definition and penalty standards for acts of terrorism therefore deserves our support.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission proposal on a European arrest warrant with a general scope, and which abolishes the dual criminality requirement across the board is met with less enthusiasm. This is a bridge too far for a variety of reasons: it pushes countries with a milder climate in terms of criminal law into the defensive and calls into question the fairness of the course of justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed general scope is no longer related to combating terrorism. As such, it constitutes no ground for the enormous political pressure and the break-neck speed of the decision-making process. Such a proposal revolutionises the application of national and European criminal law and therefore deserves a well considered and transparent decision-making process, preceded by a proper public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Parliament is forced to pronounce judgment on the Commission proposal while the Council has, in fact, already turned it on its head: a positive list instead of a negative one, and behind closed doors.</p>
<p class="contents">One can hope and expect that the discussion in the Council will eventually culminate in an acceptable compromise, but we do not know this yet and neither are we voting on this tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why this plenary debate and the vote in this form and at this time are a little absurd and premature, in fact. For that reason, the delegations of the Dutch Labour Party will abstain from tomorrow’s vote on the Commission proposal for a European arrest warrant. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Members of the European Free Alliance will approve the measures to combat terrorism. We want to strengthen the criminal law measures to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we do want to underline that the term terrorism is to be defined as proposed by the European Parliament, for I am a little wary in that respect. A moment ago, we discussed the procedural motions on train and plane spotting in Greece and on the people who are imprisoned in this connection. You may well say that this is a completely unrelated matter, but the sense of justice is very different in the different countries. Similarly, the keenness with which some label anything and everything as terrorism, makes me a little suspicious. But the measures should not be exploited by the authorities and neither should it be possible to exploit them.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of our representatives of the European Free Alliance struggle more with the European arrest warrant. The approval we grant in this connection is clearly conditional. The guarantees we want to give are contained in the EP amendments which will hopefully be adopted and which we really consider to be minimum requirements. If the Council refuses to accept these, we will review our position and convince our colleagues in the national parliaments of the fact that better protection of citizens’ freedoms is necessary for a fair course of justice. In other words, this is about minimum conditions, but further to the speeches of both the acting President-in-Office and Commissioner Vitorino, we are quite optimistic about the right direction which this could be heading.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, clear that we must be able to make further progress in the harmonisation of legislation, and in the European judicial procedures involving a European public prosecutor, etc. A number of people put the federalisation of the Third Pillar first and foremost, and maybe we need to be more pro-active in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not tolerate normal, democratic opposition being muzzled or suppressed, or the actions of trade unions and of movements and associations being thwarted in the name of combating terrorism. But more than anything, we also want progress to be made in the fight against internationally organised crime. I have first-hand experience of hopeless situations in the fight to surrender people of whom it had been clearly proven that they had committed crimes. I therefore want to give you my unqualified support in this matter, but subject to the conditions I have announced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Crowley (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, I too would like to join others in welcoming the opportunity to have this debate. The time is so short that it will not allow us to get fully into all the intricacies and details. However, I can say at the outset that every one of us is in common cause in opposing terrorism and violence of any kind to further political or other aims To that end, we would support coordination and cooperation between the Member States in protecting the rights and interests of each of the Member States and of the European Union as a whole, as well as its 370 million citizens. At the Tampere summit we took the first step towards that process. However, what is before us here today with regard to the European arrest warrant represents a major interference in and alteration of the national criminal justice systems and the civil rights and protections afforded to each individual within each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a mistake to move this far, this quickly, without properly understanding or fully recognising the differences between the criminal systems within the European Union. Therefore, I would urge all Members to support the amendments tabled by myself and my colleagues, in particular, Amendments Nos 92 to 101, which put in place firstly, the requirement for a judicial review or a right to appeal against the warrant at both the executing and issuing stage, secondly, a common list of positive offences, which must be drawn up and not used as a stumbling block, thirdly, no interference with the double jeopardy rule, fourthly, that there must be prima facie evidence presented before the warrant can be enforced, and finally, to ensure that there is a quick trial process where a warrant is issued. I have represented constituents in other Member States in the European Union where they have been held without trial for two years, without getting any opportunity for habeas corpus or any opportunity to present their case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the overall package on combating terrorism, we have to ensure respect for fundamental human rights and freedoms. It is no good for the Commissioner to say that we have the Charter of Fundamental Rights: That is only a non-legally binding political decision. Each Member State has signed up to the European Convention of Human Rights which puts in place specific provisions for each individual. I note that one Member State, just in the last week, has ridden roughshod over the rights and liberties of individuals. We as a European Parliament, representatives of a transnational organisation, should not allow this to continue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When she came to get compensation for her three sons – just young boys – they offered her a paltry few hundred pounds for each son. I could go on and list a sad litany of how terrorist victims have been treated. This Parliament should realise that these people need special treatment. The governments responsible should ensure that treatment is provided to bring some alleviation of the awful hurt and sorrow they bear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, last year, we instituted Eurojust and we have already delivered one major opinion, as has been mentioned, to the effect that Eurojust should harmonise<span class="bold"> </span>judicial cooperation within Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are taking a large step forward. We are taking a quantum leap towards laying the foundations for the institution of a European public prosecutor in the future, and I therefore feel that the area of justice in which all this is taking place is gaining in significance, and it is not an area of repression, Mr Vitorino, but an area of freedom. I am sure you have drawn inspiration from these principles. I believe that this is an issue of primary importance on which we are about to deliver an opinion and which we feel will certainly open up a whole world of cooperation and solidarity in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clearly specific problems and they clearly concern the arrest warrant, which merits close reflection. Only Mr Di Lello could be so superficial and irresponsible as to cast such hasty aspersions on the Italian government. I do not feel this is fair. The legal institutions have their own procedures,<span class="bold"> </span>and we are fine-tuning this European procedural law, this European area, but it is clear that we must proceed with great caution and not draw up a list of offences, for we would never finish adding to it, and any list of offences will clearly never be comprehensive. We must realise that transnational crimes do exist, that the crime of international terrorism does exist, Madam President, and that it is a sensitive, significant and tragic issue in today’s society. All we have to do, and it must be our priority, to combat it is, of course, to coordinate the activities. Italian procedural law, for example, has its own peculiarities, and we hope that there will be reasoned, active unanimity within the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I certainly welcome the fact that, today, we are finally debating these two reports: the Watson report and the Gebhardt report, although it is unfortunate that this should be a consequence of the tragic events of 11 September in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I think that there is an opportunity here. We can make an advance of fundamental importance, a giant step forward in complying with the Tampere agreements and in creating a European area of freedom, security and justice, that everybody wants, respecting the balance between freedom and security, the importance of which no one doubts. And, most importantly, we shall be able to provide our own small contribution to the solution of this difficult, complex and painful problem that weighs heavy upon us and knows no borders, which is terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament carried out its work before 11 September and it continues to do so now: I am referring to the Resolution we approved on 5 September. The Commission has proved its fast reflexes in proposing the framework decisions that we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that the European Council is also able to rise to the occasion and makes the right decisions as along the lines of those made by the Commission and that Parliament is making today, and that, at the Laeken Summit, it responds to the demands of Europe’s citizens to close the net ever tighter on terrorists and terrorism in general, despite the technical difficulties, and to appropriately punish the guilty parties who have spilt the blood of so many innocent people and who have cruelly and pointlessly ended so many lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was a logical objection, although the Schengen Agreement did represent a step forward. Well then, the instruments that the Council is about to adopt now, particularly the European arrest warrant, are the answer to these objections. At last, borders will no longer stop judges and police. I therefore see the European arrest warrant as a huge step forward in European integration too, and that is why I find the position of the Italian government, which is showing concern at the inclusion of offences, particularly financial offences, in this list, frankly incomprehensible. I hope that the government will review its position in the coming days and I call upon the Commission and the Council of Ministers to pursue this path, which I feel is quite appropriate given that investigations of any kind include inquiries of this nature. I would, moreover, point out that, last July, Parliament – including Mr Gargani and the <span class="italic">Forza Italia</span> group too – almost unanimously adopted the other Watson motion, which called precisely upon the Council to adopt a decision providing for a European search and arrest warrant in the area, and I would stress this, of corruption and fraud as well. There is, therefore, already a precedent but, in any case, I feel that this is the right path to take to achieve security and justice in Italy and Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can say, with pride, looking at my colleague Bárbara Dührkop, and at so many victims, and almost with emotion, that in my country, nobody has given into the temptation of implementing or asking for emergency measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Something that has never been understood and which no one has ever been able to tolerate in Spain is that once murderers have crossed a border that, theoretically, no longer exists, they are not pursued with the same vigour with which they are pursued in Spain. There is no technical reason, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that can justify this, and no European citizen will accept the explanation that, for technical reasons, we are unable to make progress on tracking down terror and crime.</p>
<p class="contents">A common definition of the crime of terrorism and common sanctions are needed, as we have heard the Commission say so many times, to prevent there being safe havens in Europe where criminals can escape prosecution. These measures would also send out a clear political message of the European Unions’ commitment to this issue. We can say the same of the proposal for the mutual recognition of final decisions that we have agreed to call the European search and arrest warrant. We support the Commission’s proposals for improvements on extradition between Member States and the elimination of the double jeopardy rule. I also hope that the Council will take Parliament’s wishes into consideration.</p>

I forgot to thank and congratulate the rapporteurs on their excellent work and I therefore do so now.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that today’s debate is a very good illustration of the difficulty of the exercise, if I may use that word, of the task that we have before us, which consists of accepting both what Mrs Terrón i Cusí has just said, namely that terrorists should not have the freedom to repeat the atrocious crimes that they have committed, but, at the same time, we need to ensure that the fundamental freedoms which we all hold dear are also respected. That, in a nutshell, is what is making our task so difficult. I have tried to explain to you the approach that we are taking to this matter and that we have the twofold concern to work quickly but not negligently, to ensure respect for our fundamental freedoms as well, which should be constant, including the right to defence for those who are accused and including victim’s rights, as the victims should also receive all the necessary attention and care. We are trying to combine all of that, and it is clearly not an easy task, especially because, as you well know and has also been pointed out in this debate, what is more, the different Member States do not have the same legal or judicial traditions. All of that needs to be reconciled too.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can tell you, and this is my final point, is that we will continue to keep this twofold concern in mind, and it is with this in mind that we will try, with the support and guidance of the Commission, of course, to complete our task successfully. Finally, just to be on the safe side, I want to confirm once again, as I did during my introductory speech, that we will, of course, ensure that action taken in the context of the exercising of political or trade union rights can under no circumstances be defined as a terrorist act or, therefore, engender the application of the new mechanisms that we are working. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have always listened to experts. It cannot be said that our proposal has not been thought out. I categorically refute this.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to say that there is no need to worry, ladies and gentlemen. As the Minister has just said, the definition of terrorism has been improved during the Council’s work. It is entirely in line with the 1977 Council of Europe Convention. It is entirely consistent with the Indian proposal which is now under discussion at the United Nations in New York, and I can assure you that it is completely clear in the recitals that we do not include anti-globalisation demonstrations or trade union action in the scope of terrorist activities. It is so clear that I would describe it as Cartesian. You will see this from the texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that the Commission’s conscience is quite clear. We understand the political difficulty and, even, the political drama, constituted by this enormous step forwards that we are taking in order to make Europe an area of freedom, security and justice, and we know that, ultimately, what we need to do is to be true to the values, as I am sure we will be, of respect for the rule of law and the fundamental freedoms of the citizens, but, at the same time, we know that with freedom comes the responsibility to resolutely combat crime and terrorism, and we will therefore combat crime and terrorism resolutely.</p>
