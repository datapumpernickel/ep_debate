<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gillig (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission communication has – as you pointed out, Mr President – defined a strategy for promoting core labour standards in the context of globalisation. So, what does this strategy involve?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, let us reiterate that the core standards in question are those set out in the ILO’s Declaration of 1998, identified by the Copenhagen Summit and included in eight of the ILO conventions. They are the freedom of association and the right to collective bargaining, the elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labour, the effective abolition of child labour and the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the International Labour Organisation, the ILO, is indeed the body competent to define and negotiate the core labour standards, the European Council of October 1999 reiterated that the Union should strongly support the protection of core labour rights. The role of the European Union in the WTO has thus been particularly highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, note that the difficulties – indeed the impossibility of applying these rather basic rights at world level – are very real. At the same time, throughout the world, people are condemning a type of economic development that does not go hand in hand with social development and the communication itself notes that ‘market governance has developed more quickly than social governance’. Are we going to leave it at that?</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to welcome the communication as well as the proposals that it makes and point out the benefit and timeliness of launching a debate within our institutions on the relationship between globalisation, labour law and social governance. The communication also notes that, although market mechanisms and trade liberalisation are essential for development, they alone cannot guarantee development for everyone on this planet. With regard to core labour standards, this type of globalisation must involve implementing public regulations that are as effective as those implemented for the markets. The WTO cannot ignore these standards, neither can it be the only body that imposes global regulations. Nor can it be the organisation that dominates all the other institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">With these considerations in mind, we are submitting to you an opinion which is intended to supplement the Commission’s proposals. The opinion is based on some crucial ideas that are developed in the report. I would like to mention three points which, in my view, are fundamental.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point is the importance of defining and clarifying relations between the European Union, the ILO and the WTO. The major problem of applying core labour standards at world level highlights the lack of coherence, on the one hand, between the approaches of the various institutions, and, on the other hand, the weakness of world governance, its architecture, which is unsuited to today’s realities, as well as the lack of common hierarchy of rules between the various world regulatory systems.</p>
<p class="contents">To tackle this problem, the report recommends, amongst other things, that the EU-ILO partnership be reviewed and improved – this process is under way, which is to be welcomed; that the ILO obtain observer status at the WTO; that the ILO decisions, particularly the results of its monitoring procedures, be published and that the Union genuinely take them into account in its relations with third countries. The second guideline action concerns development policies. The European Union must develop an integrated approach for its policies and encourage a coordinated aid for promoting core labour standards. Let us take just one example. What is the use of banning child labour if, at the same time, we are not promoting education policies? What progress have we made on enhancing the right of expression of workers living in a country which is not a democracy or which is not a constitutional state?</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, by using incentive clauses rather than penalty clauses, clauses which do not simply depend on commercial agreements, we call on the European Union to systematically integrate the clause on core labour standards into all agreements with third countries, whatever the area.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have used an expression, highly prized by feminists, who said that things that are not given a name do not exist. I think that if core labour standards are not given a name, we will forget them, and they will cease to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point relates to stepping up European efforts in its regional work and in the new regulatory areas which are being established throughout the world in order to adapt the promotion of core labour standards to local realities. The ILO is working on this and genuine synergy might be developed here. The debate is due to be launched on this issue with representatives of developing countries with the aim of identifying realistic and innovative action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view, Commissioner, this communication is a step forward and should herald a change in the working methods that the European Union must develop with third countries, methods which, in particular, show more respect for these countries’ problems.</p>
<p class="contents">We also hope, Commissioner, that the Council will take up this issue as soon as possible and we call on the Danish Presidency to schedule an examination of the dossier at the next Social Affairs Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, Mr President, by passing on my very sincere thanks to all my fellow Members, especially those who, as part of the four committees which issued opinions, which we tried to integrate as best we could into the report, enabled us, I believe, to produce a better report, and will also, I hope, enable us to achieve a broad consensus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry sets great store by respect for core labour standards and considers that the situation can only be improved by maintaining a fairer international trade policy, restricting speculation and reducing foreign debt. It welcomes any progress made towards recognition of the universal nature of core labour standards but is concerned about the impact of accelerated liberalisation of trade and the financial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Industry welcomes the European Commission's moves to place the issue on the agenda of international bodies, in response to calls by the European Parliament and the trade union and citizens' movements, as expressed in Seattle, Genoa and elsewhere. It notes that no progress was made in Doha and calls on the European Commission to revise its strategy and on the European Union to intensify dialogue with international organisations. It is in favour of imposing sanctions, especially on transnational companies that profit from failure to observe core labour standards and welcomes the use of the generalised system of preferences. Our committee also considers that WTO member countries have a particular responsibility to observe core labour standards and calls on the WTO to clearly state that sanctions imposed by the ILO will not be considered incompatible with the WTO treaties. Finally, we call on the European Commission and the Council to promote compliance with other labour rights, such as social security, the right to stable employment and prevention of accidents at work.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to draw your attention to a number of points in our opinion which I consider are extremely important but which were not adopted by the Committee on Employment. I have taken the initiative of repeating these points in Amendments Nos 9 to 12, which I urge you to support. They contain references to fairer trade relations, the imposition of sanctions on transnational companies that profit from failure to observe core labour standards, the need to respect other labour rights and a specific reference to the movements in Seattle, Genoa and so on. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">European legislation is often poorly perceived by the public and we therefore demand that greater account be taken of people’s interests, particularly to improve social governance and working conditions in the Member States, but also in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe it is rather dangerous to say that the greatest concern is that the recognition of a link between trade and social issues could be abused for protectionist purposes or open the door for increased recourse to trade sanctions. Some people believe that social issues are still abusive. Where are they abusive? When are they abusive? We can reaffirm that people use work in order to improve their living conditions and not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, changes often bring about a deterioration of workers’ living conditions. In the Programme of Action, governments committed themselves to ‘safeguarding and promoting respect for basic workers’ rights, including the prohibition of forced labour and child labour, freedom of association, freedom to organise and bargain collectively’. This is an important point. Slavery is a crime; sexual exploitation is a crime. It is not work. And I wanted us to state this even more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting core labour standards means preventing third countries from being exploited by rich countries. This is, in my view, how we must understand it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Nice European Council, the European Union endorsed a social agenda which promotes the concept of quality – in employment, in industrial relations, and in working conditions – as the driving force for a thriving and inclusive economy, with more and better jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">We are today reaffirming, Mr President, Commissioner, that the universal application of fundamental rights is, obviously, a prerequisite for making progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Her report for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs is parallel in many ways to mine on corporate social responsibility. We have worked together to ensure a consistent and complementary set of proposals is put to Parliament, and I should like to thank her very much for that.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Committee on Development, I want to stress four points in particular. Firstly, whilst we very much welcome the Commission's commitment to the inclusion of core labour standards in the enhanced GSP and in its trade agreements – we have seen evidence of that already in the South Africa trade agreement and the Cotonou Agreement – we stress in paragraph 11 of this resolution that new emphasis must be placed on practical implementation. For too long the human rights and democracy clauses in the EU's international agreements have committed us to the finest ideals, but they have not been subject to monitoring, reporting and systematic dialogue between the parties. Such clauses on core labour standards have to become the means to actual enforcement and that is the test for the Commission in following up this communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as we say in paragraph 12, that implementation has to be part of development cooperation programmes too – not just fine words in country strategy papers but real, quantifiable programmes, assisting developing country governments to establish and operate effective labour inspectorates and giving direct aid to developing country trade unions and other civil society and watchdog groups, to provide an independent voice in tackling abuses such as child and forced labour.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, core labour standards are universal. There must be no exceptions and that means the abuses which are systematically accepted in the massive informal sector in many developing countries, and deliberately encouraged in export-processing zones in many more too, have to come to an end. Europe has to be part of making that happen.</p>

It is positive that this is being done. Many fear that in the era of globalisation, social development will be compromised. These days, the bodies that reach agreements are further removed from the average citizen, and become anonymous for that reason alone. This anonymity leads to discomfort and unrest. Indeed, the citizen who is positively disposed towards this society has no way of gaining an overall picture. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has mapped out the relations between the different players in the global society in a clear and readily understood format. It has listed the mechanisms whereby the European Union, the ILO and the WTO, commit themselves to the promotion of fundamental labour standards and to improving social governance. </p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, I have to tell you that, in our view, the communication does not specifically consider the gender dimension as part of fundamental labour standards and of the acquisition of social sustainability. It is true that gender forms part of the ILO’s core labour standards because the non-discrimination principle and the principle of equal treatment are, after all, enshrined in it. However, we know that the best economic and social development is that in which women are definitely involved 100%. This is, in fact, the reason why the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities proposes to incorporate studies on the gender dimension as an instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to the fact that, where the topic of social partners is discussed, the role of women’s organisations is not considered. This is a failing, because not only within the EU, but also outside it, women are still not being involved enough via the traditional routes to be able to help shape policy.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, I want to make an urgent appeal to the Commission to improve the excellent communication that is before us with the studies on the gender dimension. This will give a better insight into the important role to be played by women in social development, and I want to thank Mrs Gillig warmly, not only for her sterling report but certainly also for the way in which she has joined forces with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given the direction the economy is increasingly taking, is it acceptable to demand social governance? We have to do both at the same time if we want to be able to carry the people with us – consumers, workers, and managers alike. The PPE-DE group, on behalf of which I speak, shares Mrs Gillig's basic thinking. We attach importance to uniform labour standards, non-discriminatory practices in employment and occupation, the abolition of forced labour, the recognition of the right to collective negotiation and to freedom of association. We do, however, prefer voluntary schemes in enterprises, provided that there is consistency in the way they are adhered to and assessed, and that they are unmistakably identifiable by means of a seal of approval. Standards certainly need to be developed for an international system of certification. It is our expectation that private initiatives and effective public quality control will represent an impressive contribution by the EU to giving core labour standards a proper place in the new global architecture.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a two-stage policy if we are to achieve sustainable development. The ILO agreements must be ratified by all the EU Member States and by the candidate countries. I consider the idea of a joint meeting of the ILO and Parliament to be an initiative that is absolutely deserving of support. We will then need consensus on the order in which standards need to be achieved in the areas of social policy, commerce and the environment, and in social governance. Secondly, third countries also need to be prevailed upon to adopt ILO model agreements. This will hardly be achieved by means of an array of penalties, and an incentive system will work much better – for example, more financial aid for development or preferential access to markets if social kitemarks are gained through such things as a commitment not to permit child labour. It is for this reason that my group highlights the special role of employers' associations and trades unions in promoting core labour standards, which are so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Respect for core labour standards in an ever more globalising economy is a matter whose importance has to be continuously reiterated and driven home. It is to be welcomed that this is exactly what the Commission has done. On behalf of my group, I can therefore say that we are completely behind this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the fact that this report has clearly brought the International Labour Organisation (ILO) into the limelight. Within the UN family, the ILO is the only organisation that is not only made up of officials and national authorities, but where employers’ and employees’ organisations equally have a leading role. This role is not only advisory and observing, like many NGOs, which carry out excellent work by the way, but in this tripartite organisation, the social partners co-manage and help develop policy 100%. This commitment by the social partners, who themselves play a key role in the economy and the labour market, is invaluable. I should like to stress this within an EU context, because I have noticed that when we were discussing this report in committee, some fellow MEPs had no, or hardly any, idea about this. Fortunately, the amendment that was submitted by the PPE-DE Group, which threatened to negate this supporting role, has been withdrawn. I am grateful for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Another quality of the ILO is that it combines legislation with very practical, technical support on site. Both these elements ensure that the ILO is not merely a paper tiger, but actively plays a key role in the general debate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my view, we should, in the international debate, prevent social issues from always ending up on the ILO’s shoulders alone. The WTO and other organisations too, should ensure that they take account of social issues in their policies in a pro-active manner, and they must also see to it that they take a more active part in the world committee established by the Director-General of the ILO, Juan Somavía. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result is a well-balanced report, which I support.</p>
<p class="contents">Parts of the report contain some basic attitudes with which I cannot agree. Globalisation and free trade are at times presented as prejudicial to social development in the world, but I basically think it is the opposite way around. For the developing countries in particular, free trade is the way out of poverty and social deprivation. Social development and workers’ rights are most to the fore in countries with open economies, while the worst examples of basic workers’ rights being infringed are to be found in countries which seal themselves off from the world around them. Basically, then, I think that free trade benefits social development but, that being said, we must of course ensure that the ILO Conventions are effectively complied with so that workers are guaranteed proper working conditions, for I agree with Mrs Gillig that free trade and economic growth are not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s report shows that the task of ensuring that the Conventions are complied with is one which the ILO does not have the ability to implement, and that is why it has to be asked what it is we ourselves can do. Given the nature of the case, I shall reject the instrument of trade sanctions, but it is important for the EU to put the issue on the agenda at international forums. Unfortunately, not all countries share our view of workers’ rights. We must therefore put the pressure on.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also only right that workers’ rights should become a natural part of efforts to combat poverty so that, when we provide aid to developing countries, we also factor in workers’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is important for us to make an effort in the education field, incorporating information about workers’ rights into vocational training so that such rights can be implemented, both in our own part of the globe and in the poor countries of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there is, unfortunately, a risk that this type of communication will remain a pious hope in terms of the form of globalisation that exists today and the consequences that it has.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, like all my fellow Members, I wholeheartedly support the report by Mrs Gillig, who deserves credit for highlighting a number of proposals that require clarification. Therefore, and I also stressed this point, Mrs Gillig raised the following question: what is the meaning of the freedom of expression or the freedom of association of workers in a dictatorship, or what does banning child labour mean in Less Developed Countries where there is no free and compulsory education system?</p>
<p class="contents">Although the European Union has specific standards on child labour, trade union rights and equal treatment, it is still necessary to supervise the strict application of these standards and to establish processes ensuring their effectiveness. The report places the emphasis on improving relations between the European Union and the International Labour Organisation, but also on the need to respect the core standards declared by this organisation. It also puts forward some proposals with a view to making further progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the report emphasises the essential and positive role of trade unions working to promote core labour standards within the context of the World Trade Organisation, and also stresses the importance of the role of non-governmental organisations. Although I have taken careful note of these contributions, which I welcome, I would still like to stress the fact that the solution to the problem with which we are faced must not be restricted to alleviating or regulating the harmful effects of a neo-liberal form of globalisation. We see more evidence every day that this globalisation is making poor people even poorer and is widening the gap between north and south. This is not a question of fate or of an abstract situation. The European Union must, as a matter of urgency, state its ambition to give its support in combating this form of globalisation, and it must propose a genuine alternative measures for a new era in international relations.</p>
<p class="contents">My group tabled amendments to this end. We therefore demand that the existence of unequal partners be taken into account, together with a reform of international financial institutions. We also demand that sanctions be principally aimed at transnational companies that fail to observe International Labour Organisation standards and especially if they profit from this violation at the expense of employees themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, and I shall conclude with this point, the European Social Forum, which is part of the global movement for a new form of globalisation, will be meeting in Florence in the near future. This very diverse movement will put together proposals with a view to reform, in particular, world trade rules and international financial institutions, in order to achieve a more supportive form of development. The Forum is calling for new international rights for employees of multinationals, particularly the right of association and collective negotiation. I think that this could be the opportunity for the European Union to listen to and support these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that major conferences, such as Seattle and Doha, have been unsuccessful also implies the failure of the major organisations which are at world level involved in the economic processes, the distribution of labour and wealth, and the social processes on this planet: the United Nations, the WTO, the International Labour Organisation, but also our own European institutions. Rich world states should search their own conscience. </p>
<p class="contents">We hope that Johannesburg is a turning point. They will have to start talking <span class="italic">somewhere</span> about sustainable development in a way that gives this development centre stage. Establishing the reasons why this has been impossible to date will also lead to the answer as to what has gone wrong at our end. Economic processes have an impact worldwide. Political authorities and institutions, including the European Union, have helped remove the barriers to the globalisation that had been made possible by the development of our western technology. However, despite a host of elected politicians and officials of international institutions, we have failed to bring about the necessary legislation on the same scale and with the same efficiency in order to ensure that humanity as a whole, and people in the south, in particular, can live their lives in dignity. Not in a material sense or in a cultural sense. </p>
<p class="contents">In the area of trade, it has been possible to lay down effective legislation with a sanctioning body within the framework of the WTO. However, from our experience in the European Union, we know that promoting trade on its own is dangerous. It almost always leads to social exclusion of the weak. Poverty, destruction of social and cultural structures, of standards and values can be the outcome. And this is what dictators, international Mafia, arms dealers and warmongers prey on.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with the rapporteur, I therefore conclude that the hierarchy of standards at international level is there for a reason. We should not only concern ourselves with corrections, but with sustainable global development. The rights that are regulated by the International Labour Organisation cannot be enforced adequately. And I suggest that we start by looking whether we ourselves strike the right balance within the framework of our own European institutions. We will see when the subsidies in agriculture, for example, will be brought up for discussion for the first time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that we are living in a global world, an information and technology society, and that what we want to achieve is a society with a dynamic, highly developed economy that creates more and better jobs. Hand in hand with this economic buoyancy, however, go sustainable development and social cohesion. In the European Union, we benefit from a social model – the European social model – that has been developing for the past 40 years and which has given rise to what we call our “social acquis”, an important legacy, which includes the free movement of workers, gender equality, health and safety at work, the fight against social exclusion and poverty, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles have also been given form in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the first chapter of which concerns dignity and the fourth concerns solidarity. Globalisation, however, involves further regulation of economic and trade relations and also, at the same time, new risks. These new policies must in no way constitute a barrier to those practices and ideas, but rather, must contribute to social development and to promoting respect for fundamental rights. In the terminology or ideology of the ILO, freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining, the prohibition or abolition of all forms of forced labour, the elimination of child labour and the absence of discrimination with regard to employment, have been described as fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I believe that the application of these rules and their distribution, which should act as an important model for the candidate countries, must constitute a priority for the Commission in its interinstitutional cooperation with the Council and the Member States. I also believe that social dialogue will be a suitable instrument for applying and distributing the principles of our European social model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We need to stress today how important it is for the European Union to exert influence and take initiatives to ensure that ILO conventions are ratified by countries which have not yet done so, core labour standards are observed, social dialogue is consolidated in all the WTO member countries, action is taken against the disgraceful exploitation of child labour and the modern slave trade, a common, integrated immigration and asylum policy is at last introduced and action is taken against the overexploitation of immigrants, which has turned modern society into a society of haves and have-nots. Europe needs to act as a global standard and driving force, using international agreements such as the Cotonou Agreement to actively promote equality of the sexes, not just for reasons of fairness, but as an important factor in limiting poverty and achieving a viable economy, social development, greater democratisation, stability and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, unbridled globalisation without social guarantees has globalised poverty rather than wealth. The International Labour Organisation is talking in terms of one billion unemployed in the world and we unfortunately appear to have turned not just into a market economy but into a market society, which is why we urgently need to promote policies which will transform globalisation into a source of prosperity and greater equality rather than a threat to social development and world peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us take one very simple point of reference: child labour.</p>
<p class="contents">In a recent report by the ILO, it is estimated that 245 million children are involved in economic activity throughout the world, of which 180 million perform the worst forms of labour, in other words, labour that puts their physical and mental health or their morality at risk. This shows how important it is to reflect on core standards. However, at a time when we are advocating a European social model, we must consider our own standards because we must not forget, once again taking the point of reference of child labour, that the number of children working in developed countries is estimated to be 2.5 million and, although all the fifteen Member States have now ratified ILO Conventions 182 and 138 on the worst forms of labour, this situation, Commissioner, is only very recent and, moreover, the conventions have not yet been ratified by all the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In the developing countries, 10 million children work in export-related activities; they work, therefore, albeit indirectly, for multinational companies. The vast majority of children, however, are involved in labour connected to the undeclared economy, which makes it extremely difficult to monitor. This is why our group is calling for the core labour standards to be integrated into the Union’s development policy, in order to provide a clearer definition of targeted measures in the context of development cooperation programmes and to promote coordinated aid. It is from this perspective that we have drafted a number of amendments and we hope that the House will support the proposals by the Group of the European People’s Party in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">From the moment I joined the various bodies and committees of the European Parliament working on social policy issues, I have taken pains to demonstrate that the first and most important move the European Union has to make in order to strengthen the validity of the International Labour Organisation is to make it an equal member of the WTO and develop permanent channels for collaboration between the European Union and the ILO. This is the only way we shall combat the huge social deficit in globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Global society has lost no time breaking down barriers to trade and even less time setting new standards for global trade and, at the same time, not just averting new regulatory standards on social matters but equating development in third countries with unbridled privatisation and market liberalisation. What we have is the total supremacy of the World Bank programmes. However, even these organisations talk in their own reports of how these programmes have failed on the social front. The philosophy of abolishing workers' rights and of forced labour which prevails in third countries must be reversed. Consequently, if we really want to make the ILO a true protagonist on the new world stage, we need an integrated programme. We need ratification of international conventions and, more importantly, acceptance of control mechanisms for social issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The globalisation of the economy, which is inevitable, is only accepted if it improves living and working conditions. Since the European Union, with its strong economy, is one of the key players in this globalisation, Europe is obliged to commit to improving social conditions. For this purpose, Europe can use various levers, and the question is to what extent these levers are actually being used.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commissioner two questions in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question is about Europe itself. People are still being abused in our own countries. Just think of child labour or domestic slavery. These practices contravene fundamental labour standards. I have written an initiative report on this domestic slavery. I have often quizzed the Commission to find out to what extent it is dealing with this issue. I have to be frank with you, Commissioner; I have never had any feedback, even though you have promised to make efforts in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is about the cooperation agreements with third countries, to which clauses were added recently concerning respect for fundamental labour standards. The Committee on Development and Cooperation notes on this subject that nothing is being done to implement these new provisions. </p>
<p class="contents">My question is: how is cooperation being organised on these issues within the European Commission? Between, for example, the Commissioner for Development and Humanitarian Aid and the Commissioner for Employment and Social Affairs. To what extent are you involved in these issues? To what extent is it possible for you, from you office, to monitor and stimulate these issues? In fact, the same question could be asked about the introduction and follow-up of clauses concerning human rights and women’s rights. I shall never forget, Commissioner, how everyone was up in arms about the destruction of the statues by the Taliban while simultaneously, a huge number of women were being murdered. These matters should also be followed up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome the fact that so many colleagues are pouring into the House at this moment, clearly to hear what I have to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to contribute because, as colleagues on the other side of the House know, there are differences between groups on the important issue of corporate social responsibility. Mr Howitt made a very important observation when, at the start of this debate, he said that he had been working in parallel with Mrs Gillig on this report. "Parallel" is a very good choice of word because parallel lines are separate lines and do not meet. It is important that CSR, as a subject, should not be seen as a catch-all for everything that everyone wants businesses to do better. Also it is important that the core labour standards – these ILO standards – are given the dedication and focus needed for their implementation, as indeed the rapporteur so eloquently pointed out. Clearly there is much work, collectively, that we need to do on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for accepting two of my amendments in particular. One was that globalisation can be positive, creating opportunities for real growth and development. I say to Mrs Jensen that this is still very much in the body of the report. The other was that a major driver of social cohesion is full employment. All of us need to be much more positive and proactive in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would observe that the rapporteur has accepted the Commissioner's conclusions. We, across the House, will be supporting the rapporteur's conclusions. There is a real danger of consensus breaking out all over the place. I congratulate the rapporteur on her work in making this possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The previous communication was on local employment planning and, as the interventions by numerous honourable Members have demonstrated, impoverished workers in a third world country can hold workers in a region of Europe hostage. And that is the problem with the development of global economic governance, which liberates trade and capital without any accompanying global social governance. The aim of this communication is to help service the need for a social governance framework. The political approach taken in this communication is that it is not predicated on protectionism. It is a positive approach which makes use of incentives, cooperation and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to comment on a few specific points raised by the honourable Members. The role of the International Labour Organisation. We can confirm the central role of the ILO, we have decided to increase our involvement in ILO programmes and just last year I and Mr Somavía, the Director-General of the ILO, signed a new exchange of letters which include the promotion of core labour standards throughout the world, reducing poverty, promoting decent work, social dialogue, companies' social responsibility and employment. This agreement will also cover the Cotonou and ACP accords. It is important for Parliament to support the financial dimensions of this collaboration between the Commission and the ILO.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that the high-level global committee on the social dimension of globalisation set up in a global agreement under the auspices of the ILO to address and propose innovative ways of improving governance at global level was an important step.</p>
<p class="contents">Another step needed is to promote the greatest possible cooperation between the ILO, the World Trade Organisation, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the two United Nations Conferences on Trade and Development.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Member States and individual bilateral or multilateral agreements are concerned, the Commission proposes that the social dimension and social or core labour standards be taken into account in all the relevant sectors of the European Union (trade, development, foreign relations and social issues). One speaker mentioned Parliament's support for the new approach under the system of generalised preferences which, may I remind you, encourages beneficiary countries to exceed core labour standards using specific incentives granted to these countries by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns the European initiative on democracy and human rights, under which very specific action is being taken to support the fight against child labour, which numerous members referred to, and the reintegration of working children in education. I should like to close my intervention on this communication by responding to two honourable members; first Mrs Smet, who referred to monitoring of the internal job market in Europe: there is, of course, the Dublin institute, but as regards home working, another form of slavery, we are up against the major problem of undeclared work which is very hard to identify, but I shall be submitting a study which, as I said, is being prepared on the question of women engaged in undeclared work at home. Where the question of cooperation between the Commissioners for Development Aid and Social Affairs is concerned, we already have close collaboration, as the result of which, may I remind you, we had a horizontal action plan on the gender dimension in all the individual projects for all development aid last year, complete with timetables and its own budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the new Commission communication on social dialogue and, more importantly, the external dimension, the global dimension of social dialogue and the role which the social partners, employers and employees, can play with respect to investments at global level to observe social labour standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
