In 1996, at the end of the conciliation procedure, we had the Commission communication on improving ports in the trans-European networks. Then a proposal was submitted at a very late stage and in March 1999 we had the first reading, which is when we should really have discussed the review of the TEN. Then the Council took its time. In October 2000, we had the second reading and it was only under the pressure of the conciliation procedure that we held a proper discussion and moved any closer to the Council’s standpoint. It could all have been much quicker and simpler and, in the meantime, it is now 2001. Nonetheless, I think the end is in sight.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a reasonable classification of ports as international – Community – ports and regional ports, with acceptable categories for tonnage and passenger volumes. The same applies to inland ports with a volume of 500 000 tonnes of freight, which I think is a proper order of magnitude. We have mainly included ports and inland ports as nodes in the trans-European networks, i.e. they act as nodal points for the rest of the trans-European connections. We have included intermodal terminals in the text, so that, as a carrier, combined transport supports the railways and inland waterways and underlines their particular importance.</p>
<p class="contents">After lengthy discussion, we also have a perfectly proper and reasonable definition as to what constitutes infrastructure and what can and cannot be aided in ports and inland ports. At the same time, we have amended Project No 8, one of the major projects of the Essen Council’s 14 projects, which was later confirmed in Dublin, in close harmony in the codecision procedure, which was very difficult at the time. I am particularly pleased that the Commission has promised to include the Elbe-Lübeck Canal in its proposal at the next revision. I am also grateful, Commissioner, to your comrades-in-arms at the Commission, who were extremely helpful in the closing stage, coming forward with one new proposal after another, so that, in the end, we did not need to go right through with the conciliation procedure and were able to reach an agreement before then.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may add a comment: in my view, we overestimated the TEN somewhat right from the outset. We said both in Committee and in Parliament: let us set our sights a little lower! These errors should not be repeated during the revision. The Commission tabled some excellent proposals on the trans-European networks in the initial stages of the consultation and we should revert to them. That means not just stringing and stitching together what the Member States provide you with; it also means that the Commission should set its own priorities. As we spend so much time here talking about special dossiers, about rail and water, I hope, Commissioner, that the priority of rail and water in the TEN will be reflected in the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that, on balance – even if it has taken a long time – we have done a good job. I should like to thank everyone who was involved, my fellow members in Parliament, the Commission and the French Presidency of the Council for bringing it all to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has seen this difficult dossier, which involved an extremely difficult fight in the Council, through two institutions and the Conciliation Committee, and that is most important. Rapporteurs simply need to have the courage to stand their ground. He has demonstrated that courage and has been successful as a result. I join him in thanking the French Presidency of the Council, which endeavoured to find a compromise at the eleventh hour. I should like to thank the Vice-President and her officials for helping us to negotiate that compromise. So, in this respect, my warmest thanks to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, shall endeavour to be brief on this lovely evening, hence just three points. First: we had to set ports, inland ports, sea ports and intermodal terminals in the right context within a text on trans-European networks, which is why we said they must be ports and inland ports which are connected to the hinterland, which form part of a network, and not individual ports, which may be very nice but which have no trans-European significance. I think that the classification which we have found together with the Council is a very good one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we had to draw a dividing line between infrastructure and superstructure. To non-specialists that all sounds very complicated, but it is fundamental to the question of equality of competition between ports or to the question of inadmissible distortions of competition. First, it was important to clarify what we mean by infrastructure. So what must the state do and pay, without intervention on the part of the Community, without any notification requirements? A typical question might be: does dredging a harbour mouth have to be notified or not? This gave rise to a whole series of difficulties between the Member States and the Commission. But what was important was to clarify that superstructure is defined by reverting to infrastructure, in order to ensure that there is no competition-distorting aid. I think this was achieved very well.</p>
<p class="contents">And a third point, if I may. Madam Vice-President, please bear in mind that this is the first time that Parliament has been able to codecide on priority projects in the codecision procedure. Because the wise Heads of State or Government said after Essen and Dublin that they would decide what priority projects are! What is Parliament here for? In this case, we have managed, with the rapporteur’s help, to ensure that the Council and Parliament decide jointly on priority projects and we should bear this in mind when it comes to the revision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As MEPs, we should be even more satisfied because the final text incorporates most of the basic amendments made by Parliament at previous readings. Thus, with a view to creating equal conditions – which was the whole point – for all ports in the Union, as regards eligible investments and the application of stricter criteria and requirements for classifying sea ports in the European network and supporting inland ports, the following classification terms have finally been adopted:</p>
<p class="contents">- for international sea ports: 1.5 million tonnes of freight or 2 million passengers a year, provided that they have intermodal terminals with the rest of the network,</p>
<p class="contents">- for Community ports: 500 000 tonnes or 100-200 000 passengers per year and</p>
<p class="contents">- for inland ports: 500 000 tonnes of freight.</p>
<p class="contents">My basic belief – and this has also been catered to – is that ports which do not meet the above criteria but which are in island, outlying or remote areas should also be classified; this was a demand which we insisted on, we felt rightly, because it means that objective dimensions are covered. We also note that the Commission needs to correct the maps attached to the text sent out as certain ports are missing, despite the fact that they meet the requirements which I have mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank and congratulate all my fellow members who were involved in the procedure, the senior officials of the French Presidency and the Commission and, of course – and above all – our fellow member, Mr Piecyk. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If, in addition, these regions are remote, this importance becomes strategic. We are therefore interested to see the Council proposal on the change to this decision, approved in 1996. Since then, common positions have been reached between the initial Council proposal and the European Parliament, with the classification of seaports within the trans-European transport networks according to the criteria of annual freight traffic or passenger numbers transported.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout this revision process, consensus solutions have been reached which, in the case of the outermost regions of the European Union, may paradoxically have strange consequences – as Mr Mastorakis has mentioned – because there is a risk that certain seaports situated in island capitals, at least in the case of the Canaries, will be included in a category other than that of tourist port because of the use of out-of-date freight figures or through considering domestic passenger traffic. Therefore, every possible precaution must be taken to prevent dysfunctions in specifying the types of project that the ports can have access to as a result of this classification, which I regard as provisional until up-to-date data are available, not forgetting, of course, other possible requirements such as connection to trans-European network land routes or the installation of a number of facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I believe the most important thing is that these ports are included in the trans-European transport networks, with the positive consequences that will bring.</p>

At this late hour we are discussing an important matter for the coasts of Europe. It has taken several readings and a conciliation procedure, but all’s well that ends well. First may I thank my honourable fellow member, Willy Piecyk, for his convincing work. He has worked for our ports and for that he deserves our thanks. I said all’s well that ends well. Forgive me if I include in this happy ending the fact that my home port of Cuxhaven has been given a category A classification.</p>
<p class="contents">I must admit that I am not completely happy with the 1.5 million tonnes minimum volume required for category A classification. What still worries me is that this will particularly disadvantage areas at the edge of the Union, which I should like to see granted the same international status as Rotterdam or Hamburg. Mind you, I am not talking here about ports for pedalos, I am talking about ports with an annual volume in excess of 1 million tonnes of freight. I think it is also important to see small ports in an international context. What is the point of talking about globalisation if we then classify our ports according to the principle of “You may play the game at an international level, but you may not”? On the contrary, we should be pleased that we have so many nodes with international connections in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Trans-European networks and the concomitant investments only make sense if we cover Europe with a real network of ports which includes rather than excludes. European ports have modernised considerably over recent years in order to be able to meet the demands of maritime transport and maritime technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe in the future of our European ports in all their diversity and hope that my fellow members will support me here in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very pleased that he has actually ensured that the final piece of the TENs jigsaw has been put in its rightful place. Particularly given the fact that most world trade is by sea, it was always a great omission that the TENs ports were never part of the TENs decision. That is now being put right. It is even more pleasurable because the maritime sector is probably the most environmentally sustainable part of the TENs network.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity it has taken so long. The lesson for Parliament, the Commission and the Council on transport matters is that in future we should be doing less, but doing it better. I hope that is the message we can endorse here tonight. It will be a welcome boost for ports across the European Union. In my region, for example, the port of Dover will be encouraged to switch more goods from roads to railways. Ports such as Newhaven will be given the welcome boost that they so badly need to try and secure a role in the future. We will all benefit from this decision but we must look to the future. Very soon we will be faced with the proposal to revise the TENs network in its entirety.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can ensure that those TENs revisions properly incorporate the ports, ensure that there are fewer studies, more rail projects, more maritime projects and fewer roads.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by again thanking the rapporteur. I hope that we can now ensure that these projects are implemented across the EU and play their part in ensuring the maritime sector reaches its full potential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a situation such as the one before us, we can look ahead or back. I have heard a few people make some very valid comments already.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about networks, water networks, and intermodal networks. The environmental interests are obvious, as are the efficiency interests, but what is still lacking is some kind of driving force. What we are now laying down in fixed numbers, which are better than what the Council is proposing, will need to be tackled differently. If we talk about revising TEN directives, we will need to consider goods flows, shifting goods flows and the way in which, in consultation with the Member States, we can exert pressure on the investments which ought to take place. I am therefore keen to find out what our next step will be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These have been three years of effort to adopt this proposal for the inclusion of nodes in the trans-European networks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is more than satisfied to be able to say that with this modification the trans-European transport network is at last complete, and at last something essential for a genuine trans-European intermodal network has been included: the ports; the inclusion of the idea of the nodes as such means recognising the new concept of transport as a multimodal system.</p>
<p class="contents">At seaports and at inland ports it is decided how to get products to the citizens of Europe: by rail, by road or by inland waterway. The nodes, well equipped with transhipment facilities, which can turn the required development of the trans-European transport network formulated in Community guidelines into a reality, will enable each transport mode to be used according to the advantages it can offer, and thus it will facilitate multimodality in practice and especially the use of alternatives to simply roads.</p>
<p class="contents">The incorporation of the ports into the trans-European networks is an absolutely essential factor in general, and is especially relevant to the outermost regions of the European Union. The fact that in Madeira Porto Santo or Porto Funchal can be included, in the Azores Punta Delgada, in the Canaries Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Cristianos, Santa Cruz de la Palma, San Sebastián de la Gomera, Las Palmas or Arrecife, in Réunion Pointe des Galets, in Guadeloupe Pointe-à-Pitre, or in Martinique Fort de France and Basse-Terre, clearly shows how important it is for these archipelagos that their ports can be incorporated once and for all as essential elements within the trans-European networks, bringing these outermost regions closer to the rest of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition Annex No 3 is modified and the name is changed from Lisbon-Valladolid motorway, which was a totally reductionist definition with a single transport mode, to become the Portugal/Spain multimodal link with the rest of Europe. I believe this formula is much better suited to the need for the Iberian Peninsula to be integrated with the rest of the continent of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Transport Council will decide on this matter tomorrow and I hope it will be finally closed in a satisfactory manner. Furthermore, the Commission will continue working both in the field of revising the trans-European networks and in fostering intermodal and coastal trade programmes. I believe these advances will also be helped by our proposals to introduce more competition into seaports and more safety in the maritime sector (remember all last year’s work on the Erika I and Erika II packages), simplifying administrative procedures, and a series of other future measures aimed at facilitating coastal or maritime transport in general, as well as inland waterway transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Many thanks once again to the rapporteur. Congratulations! And many thanks to all of you for your contributions, which were wholly constructive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
