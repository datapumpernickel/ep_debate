<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">de Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President-in-Office of the Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, it is my duty, as representative of the Presidency of the Council of the Union, to speak briefly about these issues of Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the position of my country as a great proponent of the area of security, justice and freedom is well known. The Spanish Presidency has, from the very beginning, reiterated its commitment to work closely with the European Parliament, as demonstrated by the appearances before this Parliament of the President-in-Office of the Council, the President of the Spanish Government, the first Vice-President of the Government and Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister of Justice before the Committee of Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">My presence here today is underpinned by the will to maintain a fluid relationship between both institutions and to maintain institutional cooperation with this House.</p>
<p class="contents">By approving the first Watson report, which led the way on these issues of terrorism, and the important resolution adopted on 5 September last year, the European Parliament put itself in the vanguard of the international community in the fight against terrorism, and, specifically, it is of great significance that this happened on 5 September, before the 11th, a date on which international society seemed to discover the disease that had pervaded it. I would say that the approval of this report demonstrated the European Parliament’s great willingness to confront the threats of our time.</p>
<p class="contents">The content of the Watson report, to which the Presidency subscribes, created the necessary political atmosphere for the European Commission, which had for a long time been working on the preparations for the framework decisions on the fight against terrorism and the European arrest warrant, to table, as a matter of urgency after 11 September, both legislative drafts, which achieved consensus in the Council of Justice and Home Affairs of 6 and 7 December and which were given political endorsement at the Laeken European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has just issued its report on both decisions, with an extremely high level of technical competence and political sensitivity. I must say that the speed with which the Council has had to debate these issues in order to meet the expectations of our society after the events of 11 September should not allow us to forget the importance today of this debate in the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are obviously aware of the feeling in the European Parliament that it did not have enough time to debate these issues and I should, therefore, like to clarify that the two framework Decisions respond to the European Parliament’s request to the Council in its Resolution of 5 November 2001, to adopt measures to this end. As I have already said, the European Commission spent some time studying the proposals and was able to present them immediately after the attacks of 11 September, thanks to the work that had been carried out beforehand.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the list of terrorist organisations, the Spanish Presidency is aware of the unease caused in this Parliament by the Council’s adoption, on 27 December last year, under the Belgian Presidency, of a list of terrorist organisations, closely linked to Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, without there being any prior consultation of the European Parliament, which had made clear its desire to state its opinion on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we are clearly not going to discuss the legality of the Decision adopted by the Council under Article 15 of the Treaty on European Union, and rather than the legality, we should speak about political approaches, and I can say on behalf of the Council that our institution is perfectly willing to maintain the closest contact with this Parliament under Article 39(1) of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of the lists of terrorist organisations, I must emphasise that the Council has prepared two lists. Firstly, a confidential document drawn up by the ‘Terrorism’ group, which it noted at the meeting on 7 December and which features 34 terrorist organisations. This list was part, until 1 June 2001, of the Presidency’s ‘Threat’ document, which was confidential and never seen by the European Parliament. Furthermore, under the Belgian Presidency, it was agreed that a declassified document on threats would be drawn up, to be passed to the European Parliament and which you will receive as soon as the various language versions are ready.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the Treaty contains no provision that obliges the Council to consult or inform Parliament on this confidential document, which, in any event, would lose its value if it were discussed in public, and is ultimately intended for the antiterrorist services of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The other Council Decision is 2001/927/EC, which contains a public list of individuals and terrorist organisations, linked to Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001 and to Common Positions 01/930 and 01/931.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of these instruments responds to an exceptional situation, in which compliance with the European Council mandate and with Resolution 1373 of the United Nations Security Council take precedence over any other consideration. European public opinion demanded that we act rapidly, visibly and decisively in the fight against terrorism. Despite this urgency, the Council consulted Parliament on Regulation (EC) No 2580/2001, but changes to the legislative format, when the Council reserved for itself powers of execution, in accordance with Article 202 of the Treaty, confirmed by the case-law of the Court of Justice, do not oblige us to consult Parliament<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Despite all this, the Presidency of the Council wishes to reiterate its will to have the European Parliament participate, within the framework of the Treaties and to as large an extent as possible, in issues of Justice and Home Affairs, and will keep this Parliament informed on matters of police and judicial cooperation. The presence of the first Vice-President of the Government and Minister of Home Affairs and of the Minister of Justice of the Presidency in these recent weeks in this Parliament underline the will of the Presidency to work with this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, with regard to the definition of a terrorist act, the text of the Common Position 01/931 takes up the content of the Council framework Decision, on which Parliament was consulted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, my report is a draft response by this Parliament to two legislative acts: a proposed Council framework directive on combating terrorism and a proposed Council framework directive on the European arrest warrant and surrender procedures between Member States. Together with the creation of the European judicial authority, Eurojust, these two measures form the legislative basis of the European Union's response to the menace of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union may allow itself a few moments of satisfaction. These measures represent a major step forward towards the creation of a European judicial space. I would like to thank the President-in-Office for reminding us that this judicial space did not start on 11 September last year, although it would be churlish not to recognise that the attacks on New York and Washington on 11 September gave a political momentum which allowed us to knock heads together and overcome certain objections. Many of us regret that such a stimulus was needed. Nonetheless we welcome the progress it has brought.</p>
<p class="contents">What do these measures do? The European arrest warrant applies to a wider range of offences than previous extradition agreements. It makes surrender a judicial, rather than a political process. It largely abolishes the dual incrimination principle. It sets a time limit of 90 days for extradition, giving us the chance to judge all suspects of an offence at the same time. It consolidates the idea of European Union law. The framework decision on terrorism makes terrorism an offence in every country. Currently it has been an offence in only six. It defines for the first time in international law a terrorist act and the offences which constitute a terrorist act. It seeks to approximate laws with common minimum penalties. I commend these measures to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The terrorist threat is deadly serious. It requires a serious response. These two measures constitute such a serious response. I regret – and we have in previous debates here regretted – the absence of proper democratic oversight and control of the Union's procedures of law-making in this area. This House argued for the invocation of Article 42 of the Treaty, allowing these measures to be brought within the first pillar. Nonetheless, we recognise that the process of debate has brought improvements, that our amendments at the first reading have introduced certain safeguards into these measures. I welcome the words from the President-in-Office of the Council about closer involvement of Parliament in the process of passing such legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Other measures, such as the freezing of assets, have been far less coordinated. Indeed, it is not unfair to say, from reports of Coreper meetings, that the European Union has been all at sea in its approach to freezing of assets and other decisions. The motion for a resolution on the table today reflects that.</p>
<p class="contents">We know since the end of the 1990s that three phenomena – terrorism, internationally organised crime and corruption – are increasingly linked. What academics have called the terrorist criminal nexus is well established. The fight against the terrorist criminal infrastructure must be our top priority. We know, too, that internationally organised crime is by far the biggest factor, economically and probably politically, in this terrorist criminal nexus. Money laundering represents between 2 and 5% of aggregate global GNP. That is between EUR 500 billion and EUR 1.5 trillion. It is not enough just to freeze assets of terrorist groups. We must fight the economic dimension of terrorism if we are to get on top of the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations has started to do this through its financial action task force. The recommendations from the Washington meeting of 30 October to be implemented by June of this year are essential and provide an area where we can work together with the United States of America in combating this threat. But here I would appeal for the European Union to take the initiative: to take the initiative on ways forward, to try to bring the Americans back into the international community in this fight against terrorism, and to do so within a proper legal framework, with proper democratic and parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments have been submitted to my report. Amendments Nos 1 and 5 are identical and they cause me no problem. Amendment No 2 which comes subsequent to our adoption of the report in committee seems to be slightly out of context and I recommend a vote against. Amendment No 4 calls for the establishment of a European <span class="italic">habeas corpus </span>act. My group will support this, as we did in committee, although we consider the reintroduction of the amendment to be rather like adding too much monosodium glutamate to the cooking. But Amendment No 3 is the crux of the debate: the movers say that the European Union should not proceed without the guarantee of adequate standards in procedural law. That means that the Union cannot respond to the terrorist threat. I disagree with them. We must respond. But, in giving our agreement, we do so on the basis of faith that these measures will be rebalanced with procedural guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is very poignant to me personally. Faith is not a comfortable basis on which to proceed in politics. I am aware that my name, and perhaps the name of my party, may be associated with laws that could be used for repressive purposes. I appeal to the Council and Commission, in the spirit of the new relationship that we have between our institutions, to move rapidly to consolidate the necessary move forward in security with measures to promote freedom and justice on which the European Union will be judged.</p>
<p class="contents">In commending these framework directives to the House, in recommending that we trust the other institutions, I say to them: you are on trial. The European Union is on trial before the court of world democratic opinion.</p>

By doing so, we would be turning one of the most illustrious pages in the history of this House. We now hope to see a rapid transposition of these measures so that they are effective, so that decisions are taken that are able to freeze the assets of European terrorist groups and so that efforts are coordinated in the fight against terrorism, not only between Member States, as has happened most notably between Spain and France in recent times, but also between the competent bodies that have been established within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am convinced that with this process, we will not only be responding to a demand expressed very firmly by Europe’s citizens, but we will also be making an invaluable contribution to the cause of freedom. There is no greater risk to the freedom of thought, of expression and to the right to life itself, than violence expressed through terrorism. Every democratic State has an obligation to provide justice with instruments such as those we are discussing today, which will make its work more effective. Under the Rule of Law, democratic dialogue must be based on mutual trust and non-violence, with the aim of defending democracy, precisely as we stated in one of the report’s sections on the Union’s role in the fight against terrorism. To do anything else, ladies and gentlemen, would be to accept that the laws approved by democratically-elected parliaments should change to please the murderers and for them to stop killing; this hope, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, should be rejected because it is antidemocratic and immoral. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between the Member States, and the other on a common definition of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept the outcome of the Laeken Summit and my group feels that it contains everything that Parliament has been calling for in the first Watson report. I congratulate the Belgian Presidency on approving this document, despite the problems that some delegations raised and I should like to reiterate our congratulations to the Council and the Commission and our happiness at the adoption of these texts.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we will be voting in favour of one Watson report, which does not include amendments to the text, which we feel was consolidated at the last Summit. We will be doing so for the reasons that I have explained, but I should now like, ladies and gentlemen, to tell you why we will be voting against the amendments that have been tabled. There is a set of amendments tabled by Members of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance that seek to make approval of the arrest warrant conditional on improvements to certain judicial standards in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the aim of these amendments, but we do not accept the imposition of conditions. We also think that the adoption of an instrument as revolutionary as the European arrest warrant must motivate the States of the European Union to make this improvement to their judicial standards. The order in which we are working could, at least, be practical and produce some positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments, tabled by other Members, seek, from the establishment of a European <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> act to other objectives with which we also agree, but we do not feel that this is the appropriate legal instrument to guide them.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to work, and I commit my group to this here today, to ensure that these objectives are, in future, met and we shall do so in conjunction with the Commission and the Council. Here they will find us, supporting them in their initiatives, on which we might table proposals ourselves, but I do not believe that the time is right for voting in favour of these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I was saying, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that my group is pleased at the approval of these two instruments. Furthermore, we consider these instruments to be our own, because this Parliament – as you reminded us – has put a great deal of work into achieving this. Therefore – as you have said – we find it difficult to accept the way in which on 27 December decisions were taken on the four legislative instruments to establish a list of terrorists in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy with what you have said and I hope that we are able to re-establish constructive dialogue and maintain our relationship of trust. I also join Mr Watson in asking for the instruments of cooperation in criminal matters to be brought within the first pillar. I am sure that between all of us, we will be able to overcome the democratic deficit from which we are obviously suffering<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have no respect for those who seek to take the lives of others in order to achieve their aims. None at all. In my view, no effort to put an end to this is too great. On the other hand, however, I have the greatest respect for our democratic system and rights, and also believe that Parliament has an obligation to defend them with the same enthusiasm. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I predict that the Council's next step will be to institute Europe-wide bans. It would be outrageous to do that in secret and without accountability.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the framework decisions on combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant, my group will support them. For a normally sensible British journalist yesterday to say that Europe blindly, on the nod, is about to indulge in its own sinister overreach, really is over the top.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will not vote to postpone the entry into force of the European arrest warrant until there are common minimum standards of procedural law. Urgent action to catch terrorists and criminals cannot be postponed, but the <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> amendment drafted so deftly by Mr MacCormick is very worthwhile. However, high minimum standards are also urgently needed in parallel. It is a fiction to say that, since we all have excellent justice systems, mutual recognition is enough. I could highlight flaws in the system of my own country – for example we have the highest number in prison of any EU State – as well as flaws in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council, as well as MEPs, must welcome proposals that the Commission is preparing on achieving equivalence in criminal justice standards. If some of the people who now oppose the European arrest warrant – in particular those on the right, not least in my own country – also cry "shock! horror!" at what they might claim is harmonisation of criminal justice systems, they will be guilty of great hypocrisy. We need the European arrest warrant; we also need a programme of equivalence in common minimum high standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I should like to give you a random example of this lack of clarity. The Council has rightly pared down the Commission proposal, as a result of which a Member State can refuse to extradite someone if that person has not done anything wrong according to that country. I agree with this. Accordingly, a Dutch doctor who carries out an abortion on an Irish girl in the Netherlands does not face extradition to Ireland. However, could this doctor ever go on holiday to Ireland, or any other EU country, if Ireland requests extradition on the grounds of manslaughter? This remains unclear, and a lack of clarity in criminal law leads to the sense of justice being eroded.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the issue of parliamentary courage. Mr Watson, ever since the Di Lello report, this Parliament has been of the opinion ‘that the Member States have to agree on common minimum standards for certain aspects of procedural law in order to guarantee a common level of protection of the constitutional right across the EU’. Since the European arrest warrant has demonstrated the need to protect our citizens across the European Union, and we also have the tool to enforce this protection, then we must also have the courage to use it. And you need not be frightened. If the Council is just as dynamic and decisive in guaranteeing citizens’ rights as it is in taking repressive measures, the European arrest warrant will not run into any delays. Certainly not now the Commission has presented a first version of the minimum standards, by means of which it has demonstrated that these are both necessary and possible.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the definition of terrorism, my group adheres to a number of guarantees included in the recitals and the Council Declarations of 6 December, including the guarantee that nothing in this framework decision ‘can be interpreted in such a way that people who exercise their constitutional right to free expression of opinion can be charged on terrorist grounds, even if they break the law in the process.’ But all good intentions to adopt this text have been seriously hampered by the fact that these guarantees are not included in the Council Decisions of 27 December. The essence of the definition in this text is identical, but the guarantees have disappeared. They are not even referred to. Our amendment to the resolution aims to plug this loophole and, since only time will tell whether I am unnecessarily distrustful or justifiably cautious, I would ask the other groups to give my group this assurance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To illustrate this, there are still, because of 11 September, 500 immigrants in the United States who were arrested on suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities, are being secretly detained and have never been charged. Military proceedings have been instigated. And, several dozen prisoners are now being detained in appalling conditions, at the Guantanamo Bay military base, who have no guarantees and no status.</p>
<p class="contents">Here in Parliament, we have been made to endorse a list of terrorists, which was, in fact, drawn up by the CIA on the basis of its own criteria and without justification, whilst England, France and Italy are taking measures to curb freedoms, particularly those of immigrants. Furthermore, we have had a common definition of terrorism thrust upon us, one that is destructive of freedom and which, if applied to the letter by a leader like Mr Berlusconi, could lead to trade union activities, such as strikes within the public services, being classified as crimes. The last point I will add is that we do not fight the terrorism of private individuals by supporting terrorism engaged in by a State, as is the case with Mr Sharon – we do so by eradicating poverty, injustice and corruption from the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have just returned from Porto Alegre, and I understand the concerns of Mr Bush and his allies in the face of this huge movement that is fighting rampant globalisation. I, however, have chosen the camp I support; I reject a campaign that seeks to criminalise any movement that challenges the established order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To get back to the debate, the European Parliament is, at last, going to vote on two fundamental issues: combating terrorism and the European arrest warrant. Of course, this vote is only a sort of belated attempt to comply with bureaucratic procedures in respect of decisions which have actually already been taken. As has already been stressed, this way of going about things is not particularly acceptable, for it represents a genuine political humiliation for the European Parliament, which – and we must not forget it – is the only democratically-elected European institution, the only institution which fully represents the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">We can be satisfied with the endorsement of the European arrest warrant, a tool which will certainly be effective in legal terms in combating terrorism and international organised crime, replacing the complex, excessively bureaucratic extradition procedures. However, we must not forget that the fight against terrorism, particularly the sort of terrorism which we have encountered in recent months, cannot be conducted solely by means of arrest warrants, for this would be a hypocritical and wholly inadequate approach.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Solana stressed yesterday, Europe will only be able to attempt to win genuine international credibility if it is capable of restoring peace and social and political justice to the Mediterranean Basin and the Middle East. Europe’s undertaking in these critical areas must not be dictated solely by emergencies and emotion or, even worse, by the selfish desires of those who see their own peace threatened: it must be part of a European project, a practical, ongoing undertaking seeking to secure a fitting economic, political and social future for these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we are confident that the new constituent phase which will be inaugurated with the installation and work of the Convention will genuinely succeed in making Europe a strong, responsible political actor, capable of achieving a single common foreign and security policy and a common European area of freedom and justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Via the present proposals, the Council is making a commendable effort to contribute to this by making rapid extradition possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do have some concerns. In my view, a restricted, positive list of criminal offences should fall under the European arrest warrant. The criterion is whether there is a European or international definition, as in the case of terrorism, for example. However, the list which is now before the Council contains many criminal offences for which there are no European definitions available. The nature of the listed offences is diverse. They cover fraud, rape and manslaughter. What is the cross-border aspect of these offences? Do the existing extradition treaties not offer sufficient scope in this area? However, in order to prevent this welcome initiative from being shelved again, now that a difficult compromise has been struck, I would give it the benefit of doubt. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would point out that there is an undertaking made by the Ministers, which commits the Strategic Committee on Immigration<span class="bold"> </span>to implementing measures such as the joint training of border control officials through the creation of a European Institute for Crime Prevention and Control.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, we have firmly condemned the activities of a country which is hoping to accede to the Union, Turkey. People continue to arrive in Italy illegally by boat and Turkey must assume its responsibilities: the international authority has drawn up a list of what are known as <span class="bold">‘</span>rogue States’, but I would like to stress the responsibility of the ‘Mafia States’ too, which are making no effort at all to curb this appalling trafficking of people dragged into situations where there is no hope and which have no end.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the arrest warrant, I must point out that the Italian Government has endeavoured to ensure that this framework decision cannot be enforced until the Constitution has been amended.

The added value of this European Union of ours was also shown by the speed with which the European institutions, in particular the Commission and the Council, responded to the terrorist attack on 11 September with a whole package of measures ranging from the definition of the common offence via the European arrest warrant, to facilities such as joint investigation teams in Europol. This is a very positive response.</p>
<p class="contents">What is, however, highly problematic about certain areas of this decision-making process is the circumvention of Parliament – of Parliament, which represents the citizens of our European Union and the involvement of which is required by law and Treaty, indeed it must be involved prior to a resolution of the Council rather than afterwards. As this is not the first time this has happened, and since there seems to be method in this approach, I would like to take this opportunity to protest in strong terms. Such modes of action involving circumvention of the Treaty should no longer be tolerated. I wish to add to this the demand that Parliament be in future more involved in the adoption of third pillar measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation of 27 December stipulated the persons and groups whose accounts were to be frozen. I would be interested to know whether there is a report evaluating the success or otherwise of this operation, indicating which accounts were actually found and what funds were frozen.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by repeating my demand that Parliament should be involved in an effective way, as this would, on the one hand, enhance efficiency and, on the other, maintain legal certainty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, it caused the world to look, for the first time perhaps, at the whole question of Islam as a religion – but I will leave that for the moment. Secondly, it caused Europe, the USA and the West to look again at the whole question of international relations. We cannot close our eyes and minds to the problems of small countries thousands of kilometres away or impoverished and troubled regions – whether or not we agree with the regimes there – and just think that they do not matter. If we do, we run the risk that the problems will manifest themselves on our doorsteps. One way that happens is through terrorism, which obviously we cannot ignore. We counter it by international cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland said earlier that we need to be harder and firmer. In addition to repressive measures, it is fundamental that we look at and try to address the root causes – poverty, war, oppression and a whole range of issues – that lead to terrorism. We all abhor and condemn terrorism. These two reports are a first step towards greater international cooperation in addressing terrorism and increasing international police cooperation.

<p class="contents">The Italian situation is one example: our Italian citizens had to suffer humiliation and dissatisfaction on the part of the other Member States just because our government attempted, without success, to make the scope of the European Convention subject to certain conditions, excluding from it certain offences which are of great importance to our Prime Minister, who – by pure chance, as the State attorney for Milan, Francesco Saverio Borelli, would say – happens to be on trial in Italy for precisely these offences. I refer in particular to the offences of corruption and fraud. Failing in that attempt, our government had the gall to request, and this time obtained – a concession made purely to get out of the impasse – another misleading clause, which, in fact, is in danger of rendering the Convention on the European arrest warrant unenforceable in the foreseeable future. I refer to the clause to the effect that the government deems it necessary to amend the Italian Constitution in order to be able to implement the European rules. This is not the case: our Constitution does not need to be amended in any way; it provides all possible guarantees. My country can therefore now postpone indefinitely the introduction of a major instrument for fighting crime on the pretext that the Constitution has not yet been amended. I am aware that adopting the amendment we have proposed on this matter would be a superfluous gesture, but it would be the only way to make it clear that Parliament needs to be involved before decisions are taken, not afterwards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also agreed, particularly in respect of the arrest warrant, that it makes the adoption of common and high minimum standards a matter of urgency. Mr Watson and Mrs Terrón i Cusí have asked us today to take it on trust that it will be done as a matter of urgency. We have to take some things on trust, but I would be reluctant to take all on trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, standards alone are never enough because standards can be broken. The only thing that guarantees high standards being observed is effective remedies. One of the most effective remedies ever devised was devised by the English common lawyers – I speak as a Scotsman – in the way of making sure that those who are wrongly detained are brought to court and released if the jailer cannot show cause for keeping them there. That is a really effective remedy. In adopting the European arrest warrant each of our states makes its own judiciary the instrument of justice in another state. That is a good thing, that we help each other. But it should also be the case that if the powers of one country's courts are abused by misconduct of prosecutors in another country, they can be recalled with an effective remedy. An effective remedy must be a Europe-wide remedy and one that diminishes the risk of undue detention pre-trial like the old 110-day rule which we celebrate in my country.</p>

That means that what is being proposed here is to some extent an empty gesture. It is clear, however, that it is in danger of weakening legal certainty. The proposal means that extradition cases would not be examined in the same way as before and that special legislation against crimes specifically classed as terrorism would be implemented on very vague and unclear grounds. I think it is dubious, on such vague bases, to have a special legal system within a legal system.</p>
<p class="contents">We can now already see how people who ended up on the UN’s and EU’s terrorist lists have had their assets frozen without discovering why.

Most of us have realised that an attack on the United States is an attack on ourselves. Just a few months further on, however, there are circles that are busy relativising the threats by distancing Europe from the United States. None of us likes the restrictions and controls that hit all of us and limit everyone’s rights to freedom, but we have to accept them because we do not know where, and precisely who, the enemy is. We must, however, face the fact that until the divisions that divide the world economically, religiously and ideologically have been removed, it is impossible for us to bring about the area of peace, security and justice we want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">While I shall vote in favour of the framework decision on combating terrorism, I shall abstain from voting in favour of the framework decision on the European arrest warrant since the latter has not appeared on the scene because of the terrorist threat but serves the overall purposes of federalism and is not limited to striking a blow against terrorists.

<p class="contents">I agree fully with what he has said, but with one important difference. We are talking about minimum guarantees of procedure as if there were none. There are, and although they are not common, which is the case in many areas, they are equivalent. They are also adequate for the time being. Not having – as European citizens who wish to establish a common area of justice – to become involved in discussing how to improve these guarantees is another matter altogether. We must make a clear distinction between the two issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, together with the Socialist Group, will vote against these amendments, not because we are against the issues, as some speakers have claimed, but because we must make it clear that all Member States have minimum guarantees of procedure which are adequate and equivalent. We must, therefore, act on the basis of this trust.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want to be more ambitious for the future, however. The European Union flies the flag of human rights and guarantees and, therefore, when we establish this area of justice, we shall do so resolutely, in the committee that I chair and in this Parliament, as far as we can in this legislature.

I also believe that we have acted accordingly. I am myself from Germany. Germany, Spain and Great Britain are examples in the field of counter-terrorism, of which they have had experience. I think that is why we understand each other very well. It is also for this reason that Parliament has done its homework and always supported the Commission and the Council when they wanted to adopt reasonable measures and submitted sensible proposals. That has always, to date, been the way we have conducted ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office, my problem is, though, that this is not just about combating terrorist organisations. It has also become clear since 11 September that the combating of terrorist groupings is not sufficient on its own. To take Islamic extremism in the European Union as an example, there are groupings that we do not describe as ‘terrorist’ but which our security agencies, for example, nonetheless categorise as organisations detrimental to security. In my country, Germany, there are 30 000 adherents of an Islamic grouping called Milli Görüs, or, in Berlin, ‘Islamic Federation’. As they enjoy the right to provide Islamic teaching in schools, and thus to engage in the brainwashing of small children, I see them as being in several respects at least as dangerous as the terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that an arrest warrant and a definition of terrorism cannot be enough on their own, and that it is precisely for this reason that we have to concern ourselves very intensively with the other causes of terrorism as well. I work on the assumption that the Commissioner and the Presidency, being from Spain, are in a position to examine this danger very closely.</p>

<p class="contents">It is a procedural sham because the framework decision is already prepared and drafted. Everything was ratified at the Laeken Summit on 14 December 2001. The consultation of Parliament is therefore utterly illusory; it is worthless and I would even go as far as to say that it is insulting.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also a sham in substance, because its original purpose was to combat terrorism following the attacks of 11 September. In reality, the scope of the future arrest warrant was widened to include 32 offences, which means two things.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we are proposing to change from using a system of extradition between States, which guarantees individual freedoms, to a single legal system, without the representatives of the people being involved in this change.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that, on the pretext of combating terrorism, the European arrest warrant will provide the basis for cracking down on the convictions that are included on the list in question. In the future, for example, for having criticised an immigration policy that a judge supports, or for having declared one’s national preference in one’s country, or for having expressed an opinion that is deemed politically or historically incorrect, a patriot could be expelled from his country, arrested, and transferred to another country that has an unfamiliar language and legal system.</p>

<p class="contents">The Watson report, which has recently been provoking extremely serious debates and has caused a number of clashes, is back on the table today. Today’s debate is on the amendments made by the Council after the decision was approved by Parliament; these amendments include those of the Italian Government, of course. My respect for Parliament prevents me from focusing on the controversy triggered off by a certain political party. The passage of time has proved these accusation to be nothing but hot air, hot air which, I regret to say, has been blown this way again today, thanks, not least, to Mr Di Pietro, on whose behalf, as a friend, I take it upon myself to apologise to the House, especially for his grossly inaccurate accusations which are more the product of blind hatred of the individual concerned than proven facts.</p>
<p class="contents">The priority of internal security and the protecting external borders must therefore be underscored firmly once again. Internal security and the fight against organised crime can no longer be matters purely for national competence. The trafficking of drugs and human beings and terrorism are transnational phenomena which can only be addressed at a higher level.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the need to create an internal judicial space, the differences between national Constitutions and judicial systems must be taken into account so that national legislation can be genuinely harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">The European arrest warrant must be accepted as an essential tool for combating terrorism and crime but, if it is to be genuinely effective, it needs to be handled in the same way in all the Member States. Only thus will the citizens be able to have guarantees of effectiveness in the fair handling of individual cases and the certainty of justice rather than the freedom and rights of the powerful – as somebody in this Chamber has insinuated – but the freedom and rights of all the citizens, including citizens of third countries who wish to live and work lawfully in Europe. We must fight to stop Europe becoming the new forum for attempts to exploit the legal system to persecute political figures or other forms of intolerance which diminish the dignity of the individual.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, the battle against old and new forms of crime and unlawful activities, against organised crime, money laundering and corruption – combined with a bold fight against terrorism in all its forms – must not be confused with inquisition-like persecution. Henceforth, we must quickly build a common judicial space, maybe even placing the rules governing penal law under the first pillar again, making the different legal systems consistent and with the objective of combining inflexibility in fighting unlawful activities with firm consolidation of the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must never forget that our task here is to build, all together, a Europe based on the freedom of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we had introduced them before, we would not have suffered such irreparable losses. We have lost years of freedom and human lives and we have buried friends, dear friends, who would have been with us here today.</p>
<p class="contents">History has shown that human beings can be extraordinarily cruel if their actions go unpunished. This is why I say that, if we had acted previously, ETA would today be a thing of the past. We would have fewer orphans, fewer widows, less suffering and less fear.</p>
<p class="contents">Think about this when you vote, ladies and gentlemen. Be proud to be key players in this major decision and do not forget that, above and beyond all the speeches, what you are doing is giving life and freedom a chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament’s renewed consultation about the framework decisions on the fight against terrorism and on the European arrest warrant bears the hallmarks of a diversion, although it presents the Dutch members of the PVDA in this Parliament with an opportunity to express our satisfaction with the result achieved in negotiations by the Dutch Minister in the Justice and Internal Affairs Council. Thanks to this result, an initially unacceptable proposal proved satisfactory after all, a compromise that is nothing to write home about in terms of content but that does secure the important achievements of our criminal law policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we do support the amendment relating to the European <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> order. However, viewed in terms of the European Parliament’s relationship with the Council, this debate and subsequent vote actually constitute a mere show which compromises the credibility not only of Parliament but also of the Council. Every presidency pronounces touching words about the crucial dialogue with the European Parliament but, in this area, we have been taken for a ride twice. Firstly, Parliament was consulted about superseded proposals and, secondly, Parliament was allowed to have its say on completed proposals which were already set in stone. The vital new proposal on criminal procedural law seems to me to be a good opportunity to right this wrong and thus to better organise this dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Another reason for this Parliament and, of course, for me personally, to be pleased, is the fact that the decisions adopted by the Council at the Laeken Summit take up the tenor of the positions that this Parliament has expressed on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot however, approve the lack of sensitivity that the Council has shown towards Parliament – and this has been recognised by fellow Members and by the Council itself – with regard to consultation on the list approved on 27 December 2001.</p>

We cannot postpone the approval of resolutions and democratic standards which protect democrats against the terrorists and against those who prevent the exercise of the democratic freedom of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, it is also our duty to acknowledge that we have a certain responsibility to continue to create this area of freedom and security, an aspect that some Members of this House have already put forward in various amendments.

<p class="contents">On the one hand, a common definition of terrorist offences is introduced, which has been greatly improved thanks precisely to the intervention of Parliament and which is necessary for the effectiveness of our undertaking in this field. On the other hand, not least in the area of criminal law, we are starting to implement the principle that Parliament has already upheld by unanimously adopting the Di Lello report on the mutual recognition of judicial measures when it came before Parliament, which is based on the assumption that all the Member States ensure minimum respect for fundamental rights. Here, we do not have the Guantanamo prisons but the supervision of the Strasbourg Court to safeguard human rights, although there is room for improvement in all our systems, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, we are also bringing the effectiveness brought by joint action into play in the fight against terrorism, while still respecting the national diversities which make European integration unique. I regret to say that the slow progress of this integration means that the European Parliament is still in the situation where it is merely consulted by the Council. However, we can be confident that, once the Convention’s work and the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference reforming the Treaties are over, this will no longer be the case, and that the Community method, which provides the greatest guarantee of democratic decision-making across the board, will be fully adopted in the Third Pillar too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I agree with the speakers who said that this is a great day. I would say that it represents a huge step forwards in the construction of this area of security, justice and freedom. Although it has been suggested that we could have done this sooner, the fact is that we are now, at least, on the way to achieving it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I should like also to say, Mr President, in response to the words of some honourable Members of this Parliament, who expressed their concerns that the implementation of these decisions could endanger fundamental rights, human rights and the idea that every European country accepts the primacy of the Rule of Law, I should like to say that this primacy and the safeguard of these fundamental values and human rights are the foremost considerations of the Council and the Member States when implementing these antiterrorist measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We are convinced – as I feel sure Parliament is – that the best way to combat the scourge of terrorism is precisely to do so on the basis of our system of values and with the law behind us. And also to fight resolutely, in order to safeguard this system of values, which terrorism wishes to ignore. I therefore wish, on behalf of the Council, to offer every guarantee that citizens’ rights will never be violated by the implementation of the decisions taken by the Council, which are also supported by this Parliament in the two Watson reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr de Miguel, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is pleased to be able to take part in today’s debate, which we consider politically important for the future of the area of freedom, security and justice. We have, on several previous occasions, examined the legal configuration of the European arrest warrant and the framework decision on measures for combating terrorism in the light of the Watson report, which was adopted by Parliament on 5 September 2001. I would like to reiterate that the Commission was already working on these areas over a year ago, at the request of the Tampere European Council, and I think that Parliament can testify that the Commission treated this subject with the desired importance, so that negotiations could be completed by the deadline we were set by the Extraordinary European Council following the events of 11 September. Moreover, I would once again like to praise the efforts of the Belgian Presidency to achieve the results that are the subject of our debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">The two texts before you are an important step in improving the ability of the European Union and the Member States to fight effectively against organised crime in general and against terrorism in particular. As we wished, the European arrest warrant will fully replace the extradition process throughout the European Union, something that had been requested by the Tampere European Council in October 1999, a request that was reiterated by the Extraordinary European Council of September 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to stress that, from the outset, the Tampere European Council not only advocated using the European arrest warrant to combat terrorism, but also to make the European arrest warrant an instrument that would replace the entire extradition procedure between Member States. The requirement of ‘dual criminality’ – under which the person accused can only be surrendered if the facts that motivated the issuing of an arrest warrant also constitute a crime in the Member State where the arrest warrant is to be executed – is abolished for 32 offences that are punishable by a term of at least three years’ imprisonment in the Member State which issued the arrest warrant. This list effectively covers the most serious crimes and the largest part of these was taken from the Europol Convention, which was ratified by all the Member States, meaning that it was subject to the democratic vote of the national parliaments of the 15 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European arrest warrant will enable European magistrates to work directly together, with full independence and whilst fully observing fundamental rights. The administrative phase of the extradition procedure has been abolished, the political nature of the extradition procedure has been abolished, the procedure has been placed entirely under the authority of the magistrates and judges of the Member States, and I think that this plays a crucial part in strengthening the area of freedom, security and justice. As far as terrorism is concerned, the text will enable us to harmonise the definition of terrorist offences at Member State-level.</p>
<p class="contents">The text defines terrorist offences in terms of specific acts, such as attacks upon a person’s life or upon the physical integrity of a person, kidnapping or hostage taking, causing extensive destruction to a government or public facility and seizure of aircraft, and also in terms of the aim pursued such as intimidating a population, destabilising the structures of a country or an international organisation, unduly compelling a government or an international organisation to perform or abstain from performing any act.</p>
<p class="contents">It also provides a definition of a terrorist group, which is inspired by the concept of a criminal organisation established by the Joint Action of 21 December 1998, and makes it a specific offence to direct a group and participate in a terrorist group.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, a mitigation mechanism provides for a system that aims to facilitate the cooperation of reformed terrorists with the police and judicial authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that this definition is particularly important, at a time when the European Union must speak with the same voice at the negotiations that are currently taking place at the United Nations in New York on the adoption of the international convention on global terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We intended, however, to clarify some aspects of the text, particularly in the light of the many comments by MEPs. I hope that you will be pleased to see your views brought together by the text which was adopted by the Council, particularly those views regarding trade unions or anti-globalisation demonstrations. These activities cannot, under any circumstances, be classified as crimes by the framework decision, even when they do occasionally get out of hand.</p>
<p class="contents">To claim that the aim of this instrument is to punish such demonstrations would be a purely popularity-seeking exercise. Everything is now perfectly clear and established in law.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council will be issuing a recital and a statement to confirm that the framework decision will not apply to the behaviour of those who are acting in order to preserve or restore democratic values.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the respect for fundamental rights, a subject that both Parliament and the Commission treat with particular attention, I believe that the two texts are satisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the arrest warrant, it has been repeatedly reiterated, most notably in Article 1, that in the execution of a European arrest warrant, the Member States and judicial authorities must always ensure that they scrupulously observe the principles recognised by Article 6 of the Treaty and that are reflected in the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also confirmed that it is not possible to expel or extradite a person to a State where there is a serious risk of that person facing the death penalty, torture or other punishment or inhuman or degrading treatment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I would like to stress, and I understand Mr MacCormick’s concern on this issue, that your amendment may have the opposite effect. I am being very honest with you. I would like to point out that the <span class="italic">habeas corpus</span> amendment is contained in the legal system of each Member State and that, in addition, Articles 5 and 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, taken up by the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, contain rules on the conditions governing detention and release, where the detention is unlawful. There is nothing in the European arrest warrant that derogates from the application of the provisions of the national legal system and the European Convention on Human Rights in relation to the definition of conditions governing detention, which exist in the European Union Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes that these texts will be formally adopted in May at the latest, as soon as the Parliament’s final reservations have been dispelled. All the Member States must then adapt their national legislation so that the two texts can enter into force on 1 January 2004 for the European arrest warrant and 1 January 2003 for combating terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The key to the success of the process initiated with the European arrest warrant will be mutual trust in independent and effective legal systems. That is why, as you advocated in several of the amendments tabled today, and as I announced the last time I came before the House to speak on this matter, the Commission will issue a communication this year on minimum procedural guarantees within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first discussion document is already available electronically via the Commission’s web site and you can all access this document directly. The document will enable us to launch a public debate on these issues and to prepare the communication that the Commission will present before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">In this communication, we will tackle questions as diverse as the right to language assistance, legal assistance, the rules on appeal, the collection of evidence, and the issue of alternatives to provisional detention or decisions by default. Our medium-term objective is to propose a legislative instrument in this area, following the public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am still bearing in mind the prospect of implementing these texts within the framework of the enlargement of the European Union. The key to success in this area will also be mutual trust in independent, reliable and effective legal systems.</p>
<p class="contents">People have accused European legal affairs of lagging behind for years. The two texts before you today are without doubt a major step forward and I am counting on the commitment of the Spanish Presidency and on the commitment and support of the European Parliament to pursue this ambitious integration. The message is clear. Violence is unlawful. We have the legal and legitimate tools to protect democracy because the urgent demand to provide security and to combat terrorism expressed by all European citizens is something we are taking seriously.</p>
