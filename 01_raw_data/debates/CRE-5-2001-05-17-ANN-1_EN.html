<p>The Council is aware of the higher risks of money laundering when the euro is introduced.</p>
<p>The Council has had extensive discussions on the very complex question of money laundering. At a joint ECOFIN/JHA meeting on 17 October 2000, the Council drew up an initial review of accomplishments in action against financial crime one year after the Tampere Summit and gave the necessary guidelines for continuing the programme as defined by the European Council. The Council stressed that significant progress has been made recently in the fight against money-laundering. The main progress is the following:</p>
<p>the adoption, on 30 November 2000, of a common position with a view to a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Directive 91/308/EEC on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering. The Directive will constitute a major step in the fight against financial crime. It will extend the prohibition against money laundering to all forms of serious crime and involve new professions in the mechanism for preventing and detecting money laundering. The proposal for an amended Directive has recently passed second reading in the European Parliament. The Council will shortly decide weather it can accept the amendments made by the European Parliament;</p>
<p>the adoption, on 30 November 2000, of a protocol extending the mandate of Europol to money laundering transactions in general;</p>
<p>the adoption of the Decision facilitating co-operation and information exchange between the financial intelligence units of the Member States;</p>
<p>the expected adoption, in May 2001, of a framework Decision on money laundering, the identification, tracing, freezing, seizing and confiscation of instrumentalities and the proceeds from crime;</p>
<p>within the Council there have been discussions on how to reduce the risks of money laundering when introducing the euro. It is important to examine the risks for money laundering when introducing the euro and determine which common actions that need to be launched in order to prevent and detect money laundering.</p>
<p>The Council expects all these actions to help countering the threat of money laundering when the euro is introduced.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0375"></a>

<p>A violent civil war has been raging on the Moluccas in Indonesia since 1998, and has hitherto been portrayed as a religious conflict.

<p>The religious leaders have cooperated in drafting a national reconciliation plan, including a strong economic and social dimension. To launch this reconciliation programme and put it into practice, external aid is needed, and the delegation of religious leaders from the Moluccas has appealed for such aid to be provided.</p>

<p>The Council agrees with the honourable Member that the conflict in the Moluccas is not only of a religious nature. The tensions there also have ethnic, political, historical, sociological and economic causes. The honourable Member should be aware that the European Union has actively tried to help create peace in the Moluccas by often raising its fears with the Indonesian Government and by sending an EU delegation to the Moluccas in October 2000 and participating in another one in February 2001. In view of the security situation, the European Union has so far concentrated on humanitarian aid but, as the situation is progressively improved, consideration could be given to providing reconstruction aid and aid for reconciliation initiatives.

<p>1. Trafficking in, and exploitation of, human beings, especially for sexual purposes and, in particular, when children are involved is such an urgent issue for the European Union that the fight against activity of this kind is mentioned specifically in the Treaty of Amsterdam among those measures which facilitate the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice.<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a></p>
<p>2. In spite of the fact that the Council has already adopted quite a few measures to combat activity it views as inhumane, it is continuing its efforts to improve the opportunities for combating these crimes with the help of criminal legislation. The Council is at present discussing both proposals from 22 January 2001, reproduced in a communication from the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament and concerning, firstly, measures to combat the trade in human beings and, secondly, measures to combat child pornography and the sexual exploitation of children.<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> The explanatory statements in connection with the proposals mention those measures which the Council has already taken in this area.</p>
<p>3. The vessel Etireno</p>
<p>Illegal immigration into the European Union is one of the main issues being discussed by the Council, as may be seen from the conclusions of the European Council’s meetings in Tampere, Santa Maria da Feira and Nice. The honourable Member is surely aware that the European Council requested the European Union to intensify cooperation in order to combat the trade in human beings following the tragic occurrence in Dover last year. Even though the Council strongly condemns occurrences of this kind, it is not, however, the Council’s task to implement such an investigation.</p>
<p>4. I want to remind the honourable Member of the measures taken in recent months to try to solve the problem of illegal immigration and, especially, to counter those networks involved in trafficking in human beings. These measures began with the seminar on the fight against illegal immigration networks, organised in July of last year during the French Presidency. France’s initiative concerning penalties for people who facilitate illegal immigration and for transport companies which convey people who do not have the required documents for entry into the EU is at present in the process of being discussed. It may be noted that the European Parliament was urged to issue an opinion on these initiatives and rejected them on 15 February 2001<a href="#defann_12_3" name="refann_12_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>5. I would also remind the honourable Member that, in this spirit, the EU has used the mechanisms in the Lomé Convention to try to solve problems in connection with human rights, democracy and the principle of the rule of law. The advantages enjoyed under the General Preference System (GSP) may, in certain specific cases, be revoked because of the use of unacceptable methods. These include all forms of slavery or forced labour and export of goods manufactured by prison labour. This procedure was instituted against Burma/Myanmar with regard to forced labour and led to the General Preference System’s being revoked, a state of affairs that has applied since 1997.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the December 2000 EU/US Summit the crucial need to provide better access to affordable pharmaceuticals and commodities to prevent or to treat communicable diseases was recognised.

<p>In December 2000, at the EU­US Summit, both parties reiterated their commitment to cooperate in the fight against communicable diseases in Africa. It was also an occasion for the EU and US to take stock of efforts already made since the June 2000 Summit when the commitment was made initially. The EU and US noted inter alia that both had substantially increased financial resources dedicated to combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Looking at future cooperation, both parties emphasised that addressing the difficult issue of communicable diseases in Africa requires a multi­faceted approach forming part of a wider comprehensive framework of actions to meet the whole range of development and poverty reduction needs. Thus, efforts aiming at making medicines and commodities more available and affordable represent an important task but should not be seen in isolation.</p>
<p>Indeed, as underlined in the December 2000 statement, joint efforts should also include co­operation between EU and US diplomats in Africa, who are encouraging local governments to set national health care priorities, to re­organise their health care sector, to draw up and implement action plans to strengthen capacity to deliver health services and treatment, to commit new resources and to enhance EU­US cooperation in research and development with the view to benefit African countries.</p>
<p>The EU has since the beginning of this year been engaged in a comprehensive review of its policies and actions aiming at fighting communicable diseases. The process started with the presentation by the Commission of its Programme for action on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of poverty reduction. Accordingly, work with developing countries to strengthen pharmaceutical policies will continue, as will efforts to explore and support opportunities for local production of pharmaceuticals and to build capacity to manage health, research and trade­related issues including the implementation of the TRIPS agreement. Public support for research and development will be reinforced through better co­ordination in Europe, in line with the objectives of the European Research Area, and incentives will be introduced to encourage private investment, and ensure participation of developing countries at all stages of the research process. Building increased capacity for research in developing countries will also be a particular priority.</p>
<p>With a view to inviting the new US Administration to continue the EU­US cooperation on communicable diseases, which started under President Clinton’s last year in office, Commissioner Patten wrote to the US Secretary of State Colin Powell early March to draw his attention to the Programme for Action and to invite the US to join forces with the EU in implementing concrete measures against the three diseases. Commissioner Patten indicated inter alia that the EU is particularly interested in working with the US Government to lower the prices for key pharmaceuticals for the developing countries, as this seems to be the most realistic and feasible means to deliver results on a short term basis.</p>
<p>Similarly, Commissioner Lamy has written to USTR (US Trade Representative) Zoellick, addressing the issue of tiered pricing. The Commissioner also considered the recent initiatives taken by pharmaceutical companies to lower prices to be a step in the right direction and expressed the wish that European and US governments should send out the same messages to their pharmaceutical industries.</p>
<p>Tiered pricing can only be sustainable if measures avoiding product diversion and re­importation are implemented. Legislation and regulation represent a possible option. The Commission has issued a paper on the subject and has consulted the Member States on the issue. With Commissioner Lamy’s letter to USTR Zoellick, the discussion has been extended to include the US. For the time being, the new US Administration has indicated that it is not able yet to support EU suggestions on differential pricing as the White House is reviewing its policy in a wide range of issues, inter alia communicable diseases.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0401"></a>

<p>The decision to which the honourable Member refers was made by Mr Haekkerup within the framework of his powers as the UN Secretary-General’s special envoy to Kosovo (and not by KFOR which is responsible for those aspects affecting security and military issues in connection with the international presence in Kosovo). This decision was made without the European Union’s first being consulted in accordance with what are the normal procedures of UNMIK (United Nations’ Mission in Kosovo) when it comes to issues of this type.</p>
<p>The Council understands the concern expressed by the honourable Member but wishes to emphasise that, according to the information to which the Council has access, Mr Haekkerup’s decision does not relate to tariffs (which can only be imposed at external borders which, in this case, consist of the border with the former Yugoslav republics of Macedonia and Albania). Instead, it relates to taxes, and not tariffs, collected at the administrative borders between Kosovo, Serbia and Montenegro.</p>
<p>It is important to emphasise that these taxes, which are collected on an ad hoc basis, are of crucial importance in guaranteeing the progressively increasing sustainability of Kosovo’s consolidated budget, something which has repeatedly been called for by the international donor community and which is entirely within UNMIK’s powers in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244.</p>
<p>Because cooperation with the Federal authorities is necessary to avoid any risk of the double taxation of goods introduced into the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and intended for Kosovo, Mr Haekkerup has, according to the information to which the Council has access, duly informed the Yugoslavian authorities concerned by letter. These authorities have said that they understand the logical basis for this decision and have also offered to cooperate in finding a suitable long-term solution to this problem.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0409"></a>

<p>At the sixth EU/Russia Summit (Paris, 30 October 2000), it was decided to establish a regular energy dialogue in order to facilitate progress in defining and bringing about an EU/Russia energy partnership with a view to making it easier for the Community’s private sector to invest in Russia’s energy sector in order to modernise the infrastructure, promote energy efficiency and environmentally friendly technology and improve the rational use of energy in Russia. This will also help promote the energy trade connections between the EU and Russia. Russia’s planned ratification of the Energy Charter Treaty and the improved climate for investment will be important in this connection.</p>
<p>In view of the EU’s situation when it comes to security of supply, it has been clear for a long time that the dialogue with all the producer countries and regions must continue. Obviously, Russia’s share of the EU’s oil and gas imports make the planned energy partnership with Russia one of the important dialogues.</p>
<p>Following discussions with the Russian government, the Commission proposed that four topic groups should be set up to clarify the opportunities for a strategic energy partnership within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement, namely energy structures and energy balances, investments, infrastructure and technology, and energy efficiency and the environment. These groups include experts from the Member States, the European energy industry associations, the Commission and the Russian Federation. The groups have already arranged quite a few meetings and established priorities.</p>
<p>The Presidency’s conclusions from the European Council in Stockholm note, in this regard, that the dialogue in the energy area has begun, and the importance of the northern dimension is acknowledged in this context. Moreover, it was observed at the fourth meeting of the Cooperation Council between the EU and Russia in Luxembourg on 10 April 2001 that ‘exploratory talks on the structured energy dialogue between the two sides were progressing well’. Finally, the Commission will report to the next EU/Russia summit in Moscow on 17 May 2001, where it will be possible for decisions to be taken on forthcoming stages in the dialogue.</p>
<p>It was made clear right from the beginning that environmental protection and nuclear safety are among the factors and considerations which should form the basis of the continued dialogue with Russia. The Cooperation Council reiterated the importance of nuclear safety, and the European Union expressed concern about Russia’s plans to extend the life of its oldest and least safe reactors. It should be emphasised in this connection that one of the four topic groups has expressly addressed issues of nuclear safety, including the necessity for complying with recognised international standards.</p>
<p>Regarding sustainability, Russia is a major consumer of energy, and there are compelling environmental reasons for improving energy efficiency in Russia: according to EBRD statistics, Russia, with less than one per cent of the world’s gross product, accounts for 7% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions. Both the EU and Russia are well aware of Russia’s huge potential for energy savings, a matter which was on the agenda for two of the topic groups in connection with both energy savings in the proper sense of the word (for example, the condition of piping and losses of capacity) and energy efficiency (for example, in buildings).</p>
<p>As has been said, one of the purposes of the dialogue is to facilitate investment for the Community’s private sector, not to lead to ‘public money commitments’, as the honourable Member puts it in his question. Moreover, a large number of possibilities are being examined in the dialogue, for example with regard to sustainable energy, and no ‘concrete measures’ have been decided upon, either with regard to conventional energy or other types of energy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0410"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member is aware, the Copenhagen European Council in June 1993 laid down the political criteria for accession which stipulate that candidate countries must have achieved stability of institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law, human rights and respect for and protection of minorities.</p>
<p>Against this background, the Council has closely followed the question of national minorities in Latvia. This issue has been included amongst the priorities of the Accession Partnership for Latvia, adopted in December 1999, and has regularly been discussed with the Latvian side in the framework of the Europe Agreement bodies, in particular the Association Council which held its latest meeting in February this year.</p>
<p>The 2000 Regular Report from the Commission on Latvia's progress towards accession concludes that Latvia continues to fulfil the Copenhagen political criteria. More specifically, this report, which includes a section on "Human rights and the protection of minorities", states that "several important steps were taken to support the integration of non-citizens into Latvian society, including the adoption of a Language Law and implementing regulations that essentially comply with Latvia's international obligations and the Europe Agreement, as well as a Programme for the Integration of Latvia's Society. Latvia has thereby advanced in addressing the short-term priorities of the 1999 Accession Partnership".</p>
<p>The Council therefore observes that as of today significant progress has been achieved regarding the treatment of minorities in Latvia and that OSCE has declared that the Latvian legislation is essentially in conformity with Latvia's international obligations and commitments. At the same time, and in accordance with the findings in the Regular Report, the Council is of the opinion that the Union will have to continue to monitor the situation carefully, in particular as regards the implementation of the measures that I have just mentioned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0419"></a>

<p>The Fisheries Council decided on 25 April 2001 to call a halt to the negotiations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the conclusion of a new fisheries agreement, 17 months after the expiry of the previous agreement under which 477 Community vessels and 4400 fishermen operated in Moroccan waters.

<p>1. At the meeting on 25 April 2001 and in accordance with the conclusions of the European Council in Nice, the Council (Fisheries) requested the Commission to submit a special action programme for restructuring the Community fleet as soon as possible, given that the negotiations with Morocco for a new fisheries agreement had broken down.</p>
<p>2. The Commission is actively working on such a proposal, and I can assure the honourable Member that the Council will discuss this proposal promptly so that appropriate measures can be taken as soon as the European Parliament has expressed its opinion.</p>
<p>3. On discussing the Commission’s proposal and the European Parliament’s opinion, the Council will devote particular attention to the financial resources to be allocated to the programme, given that the European Council believes that the programme must come within the Budget. It cannot, at this stage, be established from which Budget headings such a programme is to be financed because it depends upon which practical measures are to be taken.</p>
<p>4. The Commission is at present in the process of renegotiating an extension to the protocol to the fisheries agreements with Senegal and Mauritania. The Council is following these negotiations in detail. As far as possible, efforts will be made to move vessels which previously fished off the coast of Morocco to these countries or to other countries where there is scope for licences for new fishing vessels in similar categories to those which have fished in Moroccan waters.</p>
<p>5. When it comes to the diversification of economic activity in regions affected by the fact that the fisheries agreement with Morocco is not being renewed, the Council has still not received any proposals from the Commission for changing or augmenting already existing measures within the Community’s structural policy for regions covered by Objective 1. I would remind you that a number of interventions by the FDF (Fisheries Development Fund) and through other instruments and programmes, especially within the framework of the regional and social structural funds, can contribute to such diversification.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0427"></a>

That applies to the whole of its hydrological river basin district.</p>
<p>2. The Water Framework Directive<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the aim of which is to conserve and improve the Community’s water environment, that is to say inland surface waters, transitional waters, coastal waters and groundwater.

For river basins extending beyond the boundaries of the Community, Member States should endeavour to ensure the appropriate coordination with the relevant non-member States. Both the Danube Convention and the Water Framework Directive specify that the programmes of measures and the management plans for the river basin districts concerned must take account of everything of consequence for the aquatic ecosystem.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It is very difficult to predict the consequences of the present outbreak of foot and mouth disease on the European and world wool market. Although the United Kingdom is the largest producer of wool in the Community it still only accounts for a little over 2% of the world's production. Notwithstanding this, it is evident that if sheep numbers in the United Kingdom were to fall significantly as a consequence of the foot and mouth disease wool supplies would be affected to some extent, leading to a possible increase in price. However, it has to be borne in mind that the majority of United Kingdom wool is exported to Belgium for the manufacture of carpets. Any effect on supplies resulting from the problems in the United Kingdom would therefore probably be limited to this specific market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0389"></a>

<p>The Commission is currently co-funding a research project involving laboratory animals regarding the use of transgenic technology on fish; the FAIR programme 3482, drawn up in 1997 (Fourth Framework Programme on Research), started in January 1999 and is scheduled to finish in December 2001. The project, in which partners from France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain and Norway are also involved, is coordinated by the Julius-Maximilian University of Würzburg. This project was granted a budget of EUR 924 000.</p>
<p>The aim of this project is to assess the risks presented by fish which have been genetically modified with the aid of recombinant nucleic acid techniques. The project is not, then, aimed at breeding transgenic fish with genetically altered characteristics, at genetically engineering commercial types of fish or at releasing genetically modified organisms into the environment.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that several articles on genetically modified salmon have appeared in the press and that North American companies have shown an interest in this area; in this connection, the Commission has, indeed, already answered written questions 1489/00, 1627/00 and 2223/00. The Commission is not aware of any current funding by one or more Member State of research into genetically modified fish for the aquaculture industry in the EU.</p>
<p>Applications to release genetically modified fish into the environment are considered within the framework of Directive 2001/18/EC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms. Approvals are only granted if there is no indication that release could endanger human health or the environment.

<p>The Fisheries Council decided on 25 April 2001 to call a halt to the negotiations between the European Union and the Kingdom of Morocco on the conclusion of a new fisheries agreement, 17 months after the expiry of the previous agreement under which 477 Community vessels and 4400 fishermen operated in Moroccan waters. A further 4000 land-based jobs in the ancillary industry were directly linked to the agreement and 30 000 indirectly linked, in addition to 10 000 jobs in the conserving and processing industry, without counting jobs related to marketing and port activities.</p>

<p>The Commission is aware of the situation which has arisen as a result of the failure to conclude a new agreement with Morocco. Two measures must now above all be swiftly implemented:</p>
<p>1. The Commission has proposed extending the system of compensation for the affected fishermen and shipowners until 30 June 2001. The Commission must wait for Parliament to adopt a position on this matter so that this measure can be decided upon by the Council.</p>
<p>2. We are concerned here with the plan to restructure the affected fleets in accordance with the conclusion of the Nice European Council. The Commission is holding detailed discussions with the relevant departments in Spain and Portugal on this subject and also discussed this issue last week with the Spanish Minister for Agriculture, Miguel Arias Canete. In any case, to implement the plan, the Commission first needs a practical restructuring plan from both Member States concerned.</p>
<p>As soon as the Commission receives these detailed plans from Spain and Portugal, it will immediately submit a formal proposal to the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>The financial resources in the form of Community assistance allocated to fishing fleets and fishermen are usually provided via the fisheries structural programme. The allocation of additional funds, over and above these, within the framework of the current financial perspective is being looked into on the basis of the conclusions of the Nice European Council.</p>
<p>As regards the possible relocation of fishing activities to waters belonging to other third countries, the Commission cannot for the time being confirm the figure of 80% quoted in the question. At present, negotiations are underway with two of the countries mentioned, namely Mauritania and Senegal. The fishing opportunities within the framework of these two agreements will primarily depend on the condition of the stock in Senegalese and Mauritanian waters.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0433"></a>

<p>In the year 2000, aid allocated by the European Union in the livestock farming sector amounted to EUR 6 724 million, of which EUR 4 547 million was distributed to the cattle industry, EUR 1 737 million to the sheep and goat industry, EUR 354 million to the pigmeat industry and EUR 86 million for poultry meat and eggs.</p>
<p>In the financial year 2000, the expenditure in the beef and veal sector, with the exception of export refunds, refers solely to aid totalling around EUR 4 billion which was granted to farmers in the form of premiums, as well as within the framework of the special measures adopted as a result of the BSE crisis.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to make it clear that these measures in no way affect aid for the trade in animals within the Community.</p>
<p>As has already been mentioned, the majority of the direct aid is paid to farmers either for animals which are present on farms at that point in time or for slaughtered animals which spent a minimum amount of time on farms.</p>

<p>The honourable Member is requesting to be informed on whether the Commission is examining models for establishing a salary for those mothers and fathers who are dedicating all their time to the raising/education of their children.</p>
<p>The honourable Member considers that the existence of such a salary would help both mothers and fathers when having to choose between carrying on with their professional work and staying at home.</p>
<p>The issue which the honourable Member is referring to, is a matter of family policy. The European Commission would like to remind the honourable Member of Parliament that this area of action does not fall within community competencies, but is a matter governed by national legislation. However, the European Commission would like to refer to the following legislative acts which may be related to the issue in question:</p>
<p>Framework Directive on parental leave (96/34/EC) which has already been transposed by all Member States into national legislation and which provides that all workers shall have the right to take at least three months' parental leave on the grounds of birth or adoption of a child until a given age of up to eight years, and Directive 97/81/EC on part-time work which allows for a flexible organisation of working time and thus contributes to a better reconciliation of family and work.</p>
<p>Moreover, within the framework of the Employment Strategy, the issue of reconciliation between work and family has been given high priority; indeed, the 2001 employment guidelines foresee the adoption of family friendly policies for enabling women and men to reconcile their professional and family responsibilities.</p>
<p>Last but not least, the Commission would like to remind the honourable Member of the various activities that have been undertaken within the framework of the Fourth Action Programme on equal opportunities (1996-2000), and to reassure him that these activities will carry on under the new Programme on Gender Equality during the years 2001-2005.Answer</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0381"></a>

<p>The Commission would like to highlight that the negotiations on temporary agency work which are been conducted by the European social partners have not come to an end yet, as far as it is informed.</p>
<p>The negotiation process is a complex one and it is true that prior to the Stockholm European Council, the European social partners clearly acknowledged the difficulties that they have encountered during the negotiations.</p>
<p>However, the member of the Commission in charge of Employment and social affairs met with the Secretary Generals of CEEP, UNICE and ETUC in Stockholm and then again at the beginning of April and May and they showed their political willingness to explore all the possibilities of finding a workable agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission remains confident that the social partners will be able to conduct this process in a responsible way. It has however to recognise that today, more efforts have still to be done and that the discussions are very difficult.</p>

<p>The call for proposals concerned (VP/2001/002) is an action resulting from the Work Programme laid down by the Social Agenda. It aims at deepening the analysis of the social situation in the Community.</p>
<p>The nature of this type of financial support requires that all practical steps should be completed within a relatively short time-frame, ensuring that all financial commitments are finalised before the end of the budgetary year. The financial rules applicable, provide for a series of steps which this call for proposals fully respects.</p>
<p>The period between pre-information early-January and deadline for applications end-April should allow a maximum number of interested parties to submit a proposal Therefore, the Commission does not see any need for an additional extension of the deadline.</p>
<p>As far as a country participation is concerned, the call for proposals specifies the need for transnational co-operation of institutions. Therefore, counting the number of project co-ordinators per country provides a false view of actual participation of institutions per country.</p>
<p>As far as the quality of projects is concerned, no assessment can be given yet, as the Evaluation Committee still has to start the analysis. Given that the deadline for transmitting an application is determined i.a. by the date of mark by the post, the Commission provides for an additional number of weeks to allow all projects to be received by the Commission before the proposals are opened and the assessment is started.</p>
<p>Over the next two months the Commission will proceed: first with the evaluation of the proposals and second with the procedures related to the budgetary commitment with the objective to have the contracts signed before the summer holidays.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0324"></a>

On the one hand, according to Horeca Vlaanderen, 56% of cafés and public houses are in the hands of brewers with a market share below 10%. On the other hand, Interbrew has requested a five­year exemption for exclusive contracts.

<p>What measures and/or adjustments to the regulation is the Commission considering - possibly in consultation with the Belgian Competition Authority - in order to put an end to exclusive purchasing obligations for owners of cafés and public houses?

<p>The honourable Member states that 56% of Belgian cafés are controlled by brewers with a market share of less than 10%. This position is based on an article in the Belgian newspaper De Standaard, in which figures from Horeca Flanders are used. According to further information from Horeca Flanders, 70% of the cafés in Belgium are tied by means of exclusive purchasing agreements with brewers or wholesalers (beer merchants), of which 80% (this means 56% of all Belgian cafés) are supplied by beer merchants. The remaining 30% of the cafés is not tied to any brewer or beer merchant. Therefore, based on the Horeca Flanders figures the conclusion cannot be drawn that 56% of Belgian cafés are tied by brewers with a market share of less than 10%.</p>
<p>As to the specific questions raised by the honourable Member, the Commission can make the following observations.</p>
<p>The Commission is not considering any adjustments of Regulation no. 2790/99 at the moment. Regulation no. 2790/99 as well as Regulation no. 17/62 enable the Commission to take appropriate measures if these appear to be necessary in order to enhance competition between brewers and to broaden consumer choice. In such situations, the Commission would follow its standard practice of keeping close and constant liaison with national authorities.</p>
<p>The Belgian beer market, and more particularly the effect of exclusive purchase agreements, is being investigated in the context of Interbrew’s request for an exemption from the prohibition of article 81 (1) of the EC-Treaty for its distribution contracts. This notification is dealt with in the broader context of the Commission’s investigation concerning a possible abuse of a dominant position by Interbrew, which started with surprise inspections in July 1999. This case is currently being assessed by the Commission. It is too early to comment on the possible outcome hereof.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>It is indeed the case that, under Council Regulation (EEC) 3409/92, a Member State may decide to require an air carrier to withdraw its so-called "basic fare" for a given route, if that fare is excessively high in relation to the air carrier's costs. (The basic fare usually equates to the standard full fare for the journey).</p>
<p>If it chooses to challenge a fare in this way, the Member State must draw up a decision and present its reasoning to the Commission and the air carrier involved. A Member State may only proceed if the Commission raises no objections. If it wants to take such an action, in essence, a Member State must show that the air carrier is making an unacceptably high profit from a given route.</p>
<p>As regards the specific situation in the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the Commission cannot make any comment or any judgement in the absence of a proposal and clear argumentation from the appropriate authorities in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>It must be noted that ten routes in the Scottish Highlands and Islands are operated under a public service obligation contract. The routes include those from Glasgow to Barra, Cambeltown and Tiree, and various other routes within the Shetland Islands, the Orkney Islands and the Western Isles. Fares for these routes cannot be challenged since they are offered according to a formula agreed between the United Kingdom authorities and the operating air carrier.

<p>As already mentioned in the Commission's answer to question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2001-0082_EN.html">H-0082/01</a> imidacloprid and fipronil are to be reviewed in the framework of the Community re-evaluation programme of existing active substances.</p>
<p>According to Article 4 of Directive 91/414/EEC it is the Member State's obligation to ensure that existing active substances do not cause any unacceptable effects on non-target species, including honeybees.</p>
<p>On 6 April 2001, the Commission adopted Commission Regulation (EC) No 703/2001 laying down the active substances of plant protection products to be assessed in the second stage of the work programme referred to in Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414/EEC and revising the list of Member States designated as rapporteurs for those substances</p>
<p>This Regulation covers fipronil. It provides that the time limit for the submission to the rapporteur Member State of the dossiers by the notifiers and the other relevant information by any interested party is set at 30 April 2002. The Commission invites the honourable Member to encourage that all relevant information concerning possible effects of fipronil on honeybees is submitted before that deadline to the competent authorities of the rapporteur Member State, France.</p>
<p>It is expected that the Commission will adopt by the end of this year a Regulation to cover the third phase of the review programme; imidacloprid will be included in this Regulation.</p>
<p>An epidemiological study will be carried out in France over the next 2 years, and its results will be taken into consideration during the review both in France and in the Community re-evaluation programme. The Commission has until now not received any scientific information on similar problems in other Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to believe that, based on the information available, it is not necessary to take immediate action at Community level. However, if there are particular concerns for certain uses, Member States have the possibility to take the necessary measures. The Commission understands this is the case in practice because, as a precaution, France has suspended the use of imidacloprid on sunflowers and none of the other Member States mentioned by the honourable Member have granted an authorisation on sunflowers. The Commission will follow further developments and will take the appropriate measures in due course should this be required.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>A group of 75 Members of Parliament, representing all political forces, asked the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Bulgaria for a binding interpretation of Article 93, paragraph 2, of the Constitution.

The Court ruled that only those citizens who had resided in Bulgaria for more than six months a year during the five years prior to the election were eligible candidates. That ruling excludes 800 000 Bulgarian citizens from the basic right of being eligible to stand for election to the Presidency of the Republic.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider the interpretation by the Bulgarian Constitutional Court of Article 93, paragraph 2, to be too restrictive?</p>

<p>At the request of 75 Members of the Bulgarian Parliament, the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Bulgaria has issued a ruling on the interpretation of Article 93(2) of the Constitution. That article stipulates that, to be eligible for the presidency, candidates must have been resident in the country for at least five years by the date of the election. According to the Court, only candidates who have resided in Bulgaria for more than six months a year in the five years preceding the election may stand for election as president. That ruling deprives 800 000 Bulgarian citizens of the basic right to stand as candidates in the presidential election.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that the Bulgarian Constitutional Court's interpretation of Article 93(2) places an improper restriction on the exercise of the right of suffrage and perverts the democratic process?</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the Court's interpretation is compatible with Articles 6(1) and 8(2) of the Treaty on European Union regarding respect for fundamental rights?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the ruling of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court on Article 93, paragraph 2 of the Bulgarian Constitution concerning eligibility to stand for Presidential elections in Bulgaria and in particular the interpretation of the 5-year residence requirement.</p>
<p>In general terms, it would not be appropriate for the Commission to comment on the detail of the court case. The Commission is not in a position to give a view on whether the interpretation of the Bulgarian Constitutional Court is too restrictive, or on its potential compatibility with Article 6.1 and 6.2 of the Treaty on the European Union.</p>
<p>However, the Commission notes that the Bulgarian Constitution has different provisions on eligibility for election to the National Assembly, which do not include a residence requirement, so there remains a possibility to participate in the political life of the country.</p>
<p>The Commission follows closely the fulfilment of the various criteria for Union membership by all Candidate countries including Bulgaria. In this context, the independence of the judiciary, as well as functioning of the democratic institutions, are crucial elements which are monitored on an annual basis and reflected in the Commission's Regular Report which is issued in autumn every year. This year the Commission will of course pay particular attention to the general and presidential elections in Bulgaria.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In particular, the Court has held, inter alia, that: 'Discard’ in Art.1(a) includes both disposal and recovery of a substance or object<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 2</span>; the concept of waste may not be interpreted restrictively, but in accordance with the aims of Directive 75/442 and requirements of the EC Treaty<a href="#defann_38_3" name="refann_38_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 3</span> (high level of environmental protection, precautionary principle and that of preventive action); the fact that a substance or object is capable of economic reutilization is irrelevant to the question of determining the existence of waste<a href="#defann_38_4" name="refann_38_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a><span class="sup"> 4</span>; the fact that a substance forms part of an industrial process does not exclude it from being waste in the sense of Art.1(a).</p>
<p>The fact that such residues can substitute alternative energy raw material or be recycled as high-quality fibre raw material waste, does not mean that recovery of such waste has no environmental protection relevance.</p>
<p>The Commission doubts that the use of residues is impeded rather than encouraged by European law, since Directive 75/442/EEC makes a clear distinction between waste for recovery and waste for disposal so that the recovery of waste is encouraged. In particular, Article 11 sets out conditions under which Member States may derogate from the permit requirements. Moreover, wood waste - if not contaminated by halogenated organic compounds or heavy metals - is excluded from the scope of Directive 2000/76 on the incineration of waste (Article 2(2iv)).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Commission is aware that the different interpretations given in some cases to the waste definition by national authorities can be problematic. The Commission is presently assessing the issue and all elements, including legitimate expectations of all stakeholders, are being given full consideration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission fully recognises that the scale of the global tuberculosis (TB) problem requires an extraordinary response from the international development community. Developing countries need a massive increase in support that will need to be sustained over many years. Effective TB control and care will necessitate resources to strengthen national health systems, to provide essential TB drugs, diagnostics, and vector control products and to roll out successfully the DOTS approach.</p>
<p>The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended DOTS produces cure rates of up to 95% even in the poorest countries, prevents new infections and the development of drug resistant strains of TB. Even if a lot of progress has been registered since 1995, additional efforts are necessary in order to promote the wide-spread use of DOTS; the potential of this cheap and effective strategy to reduce TB morbidity and deaths has not yet been realised in all settings.</p>
<p>Since DOTS was introduced on a global scale, some very encouraging results have been reported. In half of China, cure rates among new cases are 96%. In Peru, widespread use of DOTS for more than five years has led to the successful treatment of 91% of cases. By the end of 1998, all 22 of the high burden countries that bear 80% of the estimated incident cases had adopted DOTS. WHO targets for the years to come are to detect 70% of new infectious TB cases and to cure 85% of those detected. To this end, Governments, NGOs and civil society must continue to act to improve TB control to reach these targets worldwide.</p>
<p>The accelerated Programme for Action (PFA) against TB, and against HIV/AIDS and malaria, the other two major communicable diseases associated with poverty – presented recently to Parliament and Council - highlights indeed the importance for further investments and public private partnerships for public health priorities in developing countries.</p>
<p>The Commission is now developing detailed workplans and will further examine, with WHO in particular and other donors concerned, opportunities to accelerate and scale up resource flows to needy countries to confront these diseases.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0339"></a>

<p>A number of States decided that they wished to separate their spent fuel into re-usable uranium and plutonium and a highly active waste. The latter is then treated and stored in vitrified form ready for its eventual disposal. There are two facilities in the Community that undertake this reprocessing activity – at Sellafield (UK) and La Hague (F). Once the process has been completed, the products are to be returned to their country of origin. In some instances, the plutonium and the uranium are returned in the form of mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel for re-use in nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>The protests in Germany in March 2001 were against the transport back to Germany of high level radioactive waste that had been separated out of spent nuclear fuel from German nuclear power plants. Similarly, the earlier shipments to Japan were returning to their country of origin materials for recycling and waste separated out from the spent nuclear fuel from Japanese nuclear power plants. These countries have a contractual obligation to take back their radioactive materials, in particular the waste, and this practice is clearly endorsed at an international level, including in the Joint Convention on the Safety of Spent Fuel Management and the Safety of Radioactive Waste Management that will enter into force on 18 June 2001.</p>
<p>Neither protest appeared to the Commission to be aimed at the processes carried out at Sellafield or La Hague as such.</p>
<p>On this subject, it is the responsibility of the national authorities to ensure that the plants meet the environmental, health and safety regulations in force in their respective countries.

<p>The subject raised seems to relate to different problems. Several measures are being taken at an international level, according to different timetables, aimed at creating greater cooperation in the field of financial stability, the fight against money laundering and against unfair tax competition.</p>
<p>In this respect, in June 2000, the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF) identified a list of 15 non-cooperating countries and territories, which currently include Liechtenstein and certain Caribbean states. The implementation of defensive measures in relation to non-cooperating countries which refuse to take the necessary measures could be decided in June 2001.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in relation to tax, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) published, in June 2000, a list of countries meeting the criteria for classification as tax havens, which include Liechtenstein and certain Caribbean states. This list will provide a basis for a list of non-cooperative tax havens which is expected to be published in July 2001, but countries which in the meantime commit themselves to eliminating their unfair tax practices by 31 December 2005 will not appear on it. In addition, in June 2000 the OECD also published a list of preferential tax systems in force in its member countries, which includes Luxembourg and other countries. The members of the OECD intend to eliminate their preferential tax systems by April 2003.</p>
<p>Finally, within the framework of the work of the ‘Code of Conduct’ (company tax) Group, the Member States have committed themselves and their dependent or associated territories to a timetable for eliminating their unfair tax practices which expires on 31 December 2002, subject to a ‘grandfather clause’ until 31 December 2005.</p>
<p>In summary, it seems that these specific measures, which are not the direct responsibility of the Commission, but with which it is often associated, may be clearly distinguished and do not appear to give rise to any unfair treatment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0346"></a>

<p>In response to oral Questions Nos <a href="/doceo/document/H-4-1998-0290_EN.html">H-0290/98</a> and <a href="/doceo/document/H-4-1998-1165_EN.html">H-1165/98</a> by the honourable Member, the Commission had carried out a enquiry and concluded that the company Nederlandse Omroepproduktie Bedrijf (the Netherlands broadcasting organisation) was bound by the European rules on tendering for public contracts.</p>
<p>In fact, the Commission considers that this company should be classed as a ‘contracting entity’, and more specifically a ‘body governed by public law’ within the meaning of the Community directives on ‘public contracts’.</p>
<p>During informal contacts with the Commission services, it has been pointed out to the national authorities that the NOB should be classed as a ‘contracting entity’ within the meaning of the public contracts directives and that the NOB is therefore obliged to comply with the regulations in question.</p>
<p>Following these contacts, there was no reason to doubt that the NOB was complying with European regulations.</p>
<p>The Commission has never been alerted by the national authorities of any other Member State or by any plaintiff, to any possible non-compliance by the NOB with the European regulations on public contracts.</p>
<p>In response to the question now being put by the honourable Member, the Commission has carried out research in the databases containing the contract notices, which are published at European level. The NOB has not in fact published any contract notices in the Supplement to the Official Journal of the European Communities during the years 1999 - 2001.</p>
<p>However, this fact is not in itself sufficient reason to draw the conclusion the NOB has violated the Community rules on tendering for public contracts. The European rules only oblige a contract notice to be published in the Official Journal in cases of works contracts exceeding EUR 5 million and supply and service contracts exceeding EUR 200 000.</p>
<p>It should be borne in mind that the NOB carries out very specific and limited activities. The NOB is responsible for ensuring that programmes prepared for broadcast on television or radio are technically suitable for that broadcast. Therefore, the NOB is more a supplier of services to other companies than a buyer of services.</p>
<p>Because of the specific nature of these activities, it is unlikely that the NOB has issued public contracts which exceed the threshold contained in the directive in question.</p>
<p>With a view to examining whether, during 1999-2001, the NOB has issued contracts exceeding the thresholds contained in the directives on public contracts, the Commission will ask the Netherlands authorities to supply it with information concerning the activities of the NOB during the years in question, in particular information about purchases of products or services.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission has been most concerned by the numerous reports of breaches in the rules governing specified risk material (SRM) with regard to imports of beef into the United Kingdom. Removal of SRMs remains the most important measure for public health protection. Of the thirteen incidents that has come to its attention since 1 January, seven have involved German exports. In an exchange of letters with Minister Kunast during February and March, the Commission called for swift action against the offending export plants and received assurances that SRM controls had been tightened to prevent further infringements. The Commission has again been in contact with the German Chief Veterinary Officer about the latest incident discovered on 30 March.</p>
<p>But the issue is more global. During the April Agricultural Council the Commission re-emphasised to all Member States the importance of efficient SRM removal in the protection of Public Health. It was referred to the latest Food and veterinary Office (FVO) missions on the SRM controls of which preliminary reports indicate that shortcomings prevail. It should however be taken into consideration that the very reason for the Commission to ban vertebral column was the possibility for its contamination with dorsal root ganglia and remnants of spinal cord. Therefore, conclusions on the risk for human health can not be drawn solely derived from the outcome of import controls, the Commission should also assess whether the vertebral column is properly removed at the points of sale. It is of crucial importance to receive the complete picture from the FVO mission reports. As soon as this is available the Commission will consider what action to take. But it can assure the honourable Member that it will not take this issue lightly !</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0355"></a>

The European Union is also assured of the support of Canada, Japan, China and Russia.</p>
<p>The impact of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol on the competitiveness of European industries or others in relation to American industries should be highlighted. It is already clear that the impacts are diverse: there are, potentially, costs but also advantages resulting from being pioneers in the essential new technologies, with or without Kyoto.

<p>The Commission is examining the costs and benefits of certain specific measures for reducing emissions of greenhouse gases within the context of the European Programme on Climate Change. European industry is well represented in this programme and will be fully involved in the debate.</p>
<p>It is therefore not yet clear whether the United States’ withdrawal from the Kyoto process will necessarily and automatically be a competitive advantage for American industry.</p>

<p>The project to divert the River Acheloos, mentioned by the honourable Member, is not part of the Community Support Framework (CSF) 2000-2006 for Greece and is not therefore eligible for Structural Funds. Within the context of the CSF 2000-2006, no proposal for the co-financing of the diversion of the course of the River Acheloos towards Thessaly has been submitted to the Commission.</p>
<p>A proposal of this type, submitted in 1994 in the context of the CSF 1994-1999, has not been followed up by the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the framework of the Operational Environment Programme 2000-2006, the Greek authorities have submitted the large-scale project of the reconstitution of the Karla lake in Thessaly. This large-scale project should at least partially help to resolve the water problem in Thessaly and restrict the damage caused by the winter flooding of the Pinios river.</p>
<p>However, the Commission considers that the solution to the water problem in Thessaly should be sought less within the framework of large-scale public works, and more by means of the efficient management of the existing water resources.</p>
<p>In this respect, the correct application of Directive 2000/60EC will be of great importance. This directive, adopted last year, is intended to bring about an improvement in the quality of water, both groundwater and surface water, by 2015. The directive is also intended to alleviate the effects of drought as far as possible.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Council Directive 92/46/EEC of 16 June 1992 laying down the health rules for the production and placing on the market of raw milk, heat-treated milk and milk-based products<span class="sup">1</span> stipulates, in Article 4, that Member States must ensure that raw milk intended for direct human consumption is not placed on the market unless it satisfies certain requirements.</p>
<p>The Commission’s interpretation of this provision is that the requirements are only applicable in the event that a Member State has decided to authorise the placing on the market of raw milk or raw milk-based products.</p>
<p>According to the information available to the Commission, Denmark, while meeting its obligation to allow onto its territory raw milk-based products legally produced in another Member State, does not authorise the placing on the market of raw milk. It is therefore not necessary for Denmark to transpose the provisions mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>

<p>In answer to the honourable Member’s previous question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-1999-0575_EN.html">H-0575/99</a>, the Commission emphasised its view that the health and safety of the children is crucial and that crèche provision should therefore be beyond reproach.</p>
<p>With that objective in mind there have been several developments in policy: an Internal procedure to be followed where there is a suspicion or complaint about serious child abuse was prepared in June 2000 and after adoption by the COCEPE (COmité paritaire de gestion du CEntre de la Petite Enfance), was sent to all parents in October 2000.</p>
<p>In order to increase the level of alertness to the problems and symptoms of the abuse of children, childcare staff at the crèches followed training courses given by the Office de la Naissance et de l’Enfance (ONE) in 1999 and 2000.</p>
<p>A neutral, professional and independent system of control and evaluation of the service offered by the Commission crèches has been established and, since July 1998, there have been regular contacts with the Belgian public bodies responsible for matters related to young children – ONE (for the French Community) and Kind &amp; Gezin (for the Flemish Community). ONE was not able to provide help with the control and evaluation activities but fortunately, Kind &amp; Gezin has been able to act in this capacity. Controls have been carried out this year in the three Commission’s crèches (Clovis: 01/02/2001, Beaulieu: 22/03/2001 and Palmerston: 29/03/2001).</p>
<p>Since the last reply to the honourable Member, a new contract for the management of Clovis has been concluded (June 2000), following a call for tender launched in July 1999. The new contractor is SAPIENS S.A.</p>
<p>More generally, in the context of Commission Reform, several approaches to providing high quality childcare provision have been set out in the Commission’s Consultative Document of 28 February 2001 “Facilities and services for Staff of the European Commission”1. Consultation with staff and staff representatives is now under way and will continue until July, after which finalised proposals will be adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>On the question of support given to the alleged victims and their parents, the Commission informs the honourable Member that one of the parents requested the Commission to reimburse the fees of lawyers engaged in connection with the ongoing criminal proceedings. The Court of First Instance (Judgement of 27 June 2000, T-69/99) has concluded that the Commission could not assist parents as civil servants under Article 24 of the Staff Regulations, as requested by one of them. However, the Commission has given financial support under Article 76 of the Staff Regulations.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission is informed that the case relating to allegations of the sexual abuse of children at the Clovis crèche will be heard by a Belgian criminal Court on 21, 22 and 23 May 2001. The Commission will be a “partie civile” in that case.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission – in line with the Community Strategy for Waste Management1 as well as the Parliament Resolution2 and the Council Resolution3 on waste management in the Community – considers that “prevention of the generation of waste shall remain the first priority. Where the generation can not be avoided, it should be reused or recovered for its material or its energy. Preference should be given, where environmentally sound, to the recovery of materials over energy recovery operations”. In other words, recycling shall take precedence over incineration.</p>
<p>Insofar as biomass waste is concerned, material recycling may take the form of composting or anaerobic digestion for those “clean” fractions suitable for producing soil improves of good quality.</p>
<p>Research on wastes such as sewage sludge, animal manure and biodegradable waste from households received a great impulse in the 80’s and early ‘90s via the Community funding of a Cooperation Project on Scientific and Technical Research COST 68/6814. The Commission published in 1992 a report5 reviewing the outcome of this research, which includes aspects pertaining to composting and anaerobic digestion techniques.</p>
<p>More recently, the Commission organised an International Symposium on issues related to the management of biodegradable waste that constituted an important event in gathering the European and international experience and scientific expertise in the field.

<p>The Commission deeply regrets the events in Algeria of the last 10 years, including the continued violence of the last months. It supports the efforts of the Algerian authorities to end violence and to move towards national reconciliation. However, national reconciliation is only possible if it is based on justice and the rule of law. Algeria has to solve the problem of impunity of repentant terrorists.</p>
<p>The Union persistently raises the issues of violence, disappearances and violations of human rights in its political dialogue with the authorities. At the 57th session of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva in March 2001 the Union Presidency urged Algeria to take concrete measures in this regard and to respond to the requests by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture and the UN Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial Executions to visit Algeria.</p>
<p>The issue of disappeared persons is a point of special concern for the Commission. Lists of specific cases have been handed over to the Algerian authorities on several occasions since 1999. Preliminary answers to some of those were received in March 2000. At the recent Troïka meeting in Algiers on April 24, 2001, a consolidated list of 30 old and new cases were submitted.

<p>Individuals who, as a result of their nationality, are obliged to hold a short stay visa, must make their visa request in their country of residence, in principle at the consulate of the Member State which they intend to visit. Their request is dealt with in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Schengen common consular regulations, which is now integrated into the Union’s framework. These procedures require the applicant to present a certain number of supporting documents and, in certain cases, oblige the competent consulate to consult other authorities.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that, in certain circumstances, such as war or crises, these procedures may make it extremely difficult to obtain a visa, given the living conditions in the regions or countries concerned.</p>
<p>However, the Commission would like to point out that the Schengen legislation contains a certain number of provisions and mechanisms which may contribute to facilitating the issuing of visas to persons originating from these regions or countries:</p>
<p>- bona fide persons – for example, well-known personalities – may obtain multiple entry visas valid for one year, or even more in certain exceptional cases;</p>
<p>- owing to the on-site exchange of information, local consular cooperation allows visa applications to be dealt with more efficiently;</p>
<p>- in certain countries, in particular countries in crisis, where no Schengen State has consular services, the visa applicant may approach the consulate of a Member State which is representing one or several other Member States;</p>
<p>- Member States’ border authorities may, in exceptional cases, issue a short stay visa at the border to persons who, for unavoidable reasons, have not been in a position to request a visa in advance. This possibility may be applied to personalities originating from regions or countries in crisis or at war.</p>
<p>Lastly, it should be noted that personalities are often in possession of diplomatic passports, service passports or passes from international organisations and that in these cases Member States are free, in accordance with the powers conferred on them by Regulation No 539/2001 on visas, to exempt these categories of people from the need to hold a visa.</p>
<p>The Commission does not agree with the honourable Member’s suggestion of creating a specific body within the institutions of the European Union to facilitate the issuing of visas. The Community’s competence in the field of the procedures and requirements for the issuing of visas, based on Article 62(2)(b)(ii) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, simply means that the legal provisions in these fields have now become Community standards. The competence to take their own decisions in relation to granting or refusing visas remains in the hands of the consular services of the Member States. This legally excludes the possibility of imposing on Member States, or associating Member States with, a specific Community body.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0391"></a>

<p>The Government of the Autonomous Community of Extremadura (Spain) recently approved a bill designed to tax the savings held by those institutions located in Extremadura which fail to reinvest in lucrative projects for the region. In practical terms, a new tax of between 0.3% and 0.6% will be levied on deposits held by credit institutions operating in Extremadura, although the sums reinvested by these institutions in works and services of benefit to the region will be tax-deductible, given the Extremaduran authorities’ intention to penalise savings not reinvested in the region rather than to tax all savings held there.</p>
<p>Does the Commission believe that this new form of taxation may constitute discrimination that distorts competition? In its view, could this measure be in breach of the code of conduct for business taxation?</p>
<p>Does it see the aforementioned form of taxation as a barrier to the free movement of capital?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>With regard to whether the draft law of the Autonomous Community of Extremadura could constitute discrimination between various credit institutions according to whether or not they invest in the region, this law could include some State funding. However, the Commission is unable to make a firm statement on this issue, given the information to which it has access.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct for business taxation covers tax measures, providing for a significantly lower effective level of taxation (including zero taxation) than those levels which generally apply in the Member State in question, which attractiveness is likely to affect in a significant way the location of business within the Community. The bill approved by the Government of the Autonomous Community of Extremadura does not seem to fall under these rules.</p>
<p>Finally, as far as the third question is concerned, the Commission takes the view that it may not be excluded that the effects of the tax mentioned by the honourable Member could represent an obstacle to the free movement of capital in virtue of Article 56 of the EC Treaty. Such a tax could constitute a barrier for investment between the Autonomous Community of Extremadura and the Member States, which according to the Treaty, is prohibited. However, the Commission considers that at this stage it would be premature to comment further on this matter given that the question refers to a draft law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0392"></a>

<p>The criticisms of the management of the UNIDCP have created a situation of malaise, as a result of certain serious allegations which have been made. An internal United Nations audit is under way.

<p>The Hellenic authorities are not presently in a position to inform the Commission on the plans of the school in question regarding its transfer to a new site (needs for new building etc.) and whether, if such a project exists, it will be co-funded through the CSF III, because the projects and actions of the Operational Programme “Education and Initial Training ” of the CSF III have not yet been selected by its Managing Authority.</p>

Similarly, all land planning and building permits are the exclusive responsibility of the Member State.</p>

<p>The Commission takes the view that move needs to be done to stimulate innovation in the Community, in particular in the less favoured regions in the Community.</p>
<p>The technology gap among regions in Europe has a negative impact on cohesion. This is precisely one of the reasons why the Commission approved on 31st January this year, a communication inviting each region in the Community to submit a regional programme of innovative actions with technological innovation and Information Society as two priority themes, along with sustainable development.</p>
<p>Among the most important constraints for increasing the innovation level for islands and peripheral regions is the fact that less favoured regions in Europe are under-investing in the field of innovation, research and technological development and the information society. Moreover, the regional innovation systems in these regions are not only relatively inefficient compared to those of the more advanced regions but also more fragmented. In this sense, for example, university – enterprise relationships, clusters (inter-firm networks), cooperation links among technology centres and access to finance for businesses are clearly underdeveloped. Regions will be able to reduce disparities and create stable and quality jobs if they develop their innovative capacity in order to adapt on a permanent basis to a rapidly changing economy. It is through innovation that they will be able to better compete in the global economy.</p>
<p>One way of giving a major boost to innovation in less favoured regions, including islands and the fishing industry, is through channelling the structural funds to the priorities of technological innovation and the information society, as set out in the Commission’s guidelines for structural funds programmes for the period 2000-2006.</p>
<p>The Commission has insisted, throughout the negotiations on Objective 1 and 2 programmes, on the need to develop these priorities. Moreover, the new generation of innovative actions by which the Commission has invited every region in Europe to submit a regional programme is a further opportunity to do so. Innovative actions are laboratories to test new approaches that allow regions to invest more and, more importantly better, in strategic fields for their economic future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0402"></a>

At this meeting the President of the Commission informed the working party and, simultaneously, Parliament’s representatives, of the decision taken by the Commission that day concerning the task entrusted to Mr Vitorino – to act as an interlocutor between Parliament and the Commission in the sphere of information and communication vis-à-vis the wider public. In the context of this task, a meeting of the interinstitutional working party will be held on 15 May to discuss with Parliament’s representatives the cooperation to be put in place. The ideas emerging from this meeting will be most constructive as far as the Commission’s future communication is concerned.</p>
<p>At the same time, as President Prodi emphasised in his reply to Mrs Fontaine of 19 April 2001, the restructured Press and Communication Directorate-General is already preparing a communication on information strategy. The aim is that the Commission should adopt it before summer. Needless to say, the suggestions made by the President of Parliament in her letter of 22 March 2001 will be taken into account, without prejudicing the final position adopted by the Commission.</p>
<p>As regards the honourable Member’s concern that civil society should be involved in this new strategy, the Commission will continue, as in the past, to involve it in its new policy.</p>
<p>The Commission considers civil society in the broad sense to be an important interlocutor and the ‘White Paper on Governance in the EU’ will devote due attention to it. The Commission’s aim is facilitate and make this partnership with civil society more effective, not least by means of an appropriate information policy for the benefit of European citizens, taking full account of their new expectations.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission considers, as the honourable Member is aware, that a practical way of making this partnership effective consists in issuing calls for proposals in the framework of general information on the European Union aimed at the various actors in civil society.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0403"></a>

<p>Conditions in hospitals in the Serb Republic of Bosnia are dire. Doctors and hospital staff are working under extremely difficult circumstances as they are without absolutely essential drugs such as insulin for diabetics and standard drugs for the treatment of heart conditions, let alone drugs to fight cancer. Moreover, the conditions under which the population is living outside the hospitals are no better. The situation is exacerbated by the inequitable distribution of EU aid. The Croat-Muslim side (representing 2/3 of the population of Bosnia) receives 97.5% of that aid, and only 2.5% is destined for the Serb side (representing 1/3 of the population).</p>
<p>Are the above figures correct, i.e. is there a provocatively inequitable division of EU aid to Bosnia in favour of the Croats and Muslims? What measures will the Commission take to ensure that the Serb community's hospitals do not face such enormous problems, which endanger the lives of so many people?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Republika Srpska (RS) does not suffer discrimination in the delivery of Community assistance. Community aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) in the period 1991 - 2000 amounted to over &#x80;2.1 billion and included both humanitarian aid and longer term strategic assistance, now delivered via CARDS.</p>
<p>In line with the overall Community policy of reinforcing BiH as a state, assistance is delivered to BiH as a country. It is not differentiated by Entity, but directed on the basis of need. In some sectors, e.g. refugee returns, RS has received less than expected because refugee returns have, regrettably, been obstructed more in RS than in the Federation of BiH. Moreover, it should be remembered that all assistance projects in BiH are subject to consultation and agreement with the central BiH authorities; they obtain BiH Council of Ministers agreement and signature before implementation. RS is represented in these fora.</p>
<p>Since European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) no longer operates in BiH, Community humanitarian assistance is no longer delivered to hospitals in either Entity. Nevertheless, CARDS continues to target the reform of the health sector. Since 1995 nearly &#x80;10 million has been donated, benefiting both Entities. Moreover, this aid is structural in nature. By facilitating systemic reform the Entities should be enabled to provide citizens with more effective and efficient health care using national resources. The Commission believes that CARDS' strategic approach holds out the best prospect of sustaining long-term improvement in the health sector. There are no grounds to believe that there has been an unequal division of such aid between the Entities.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0406"></a>

<p>The Commission regrets that already 20 persons have died. A solution is urgently needed from a humanitarian point of view irrespective of the political motives of the inmates. The Commission views the intention of the Turkish government to amend the Anti-Terrorist Law as a clear sign of willingness to solve this very critical situation. It therefore calls upon the Turkish government to implement, after adoption by the Turkish Grand National Assembly, this new policy of ending isolation in prisons truthfully and forcefully. It also encourages the government to enter into dialogue with representatives of the inmates in order to explain the way it plans to put into practice this new policy.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission fully supports the recommendations adopted by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture (CPT) as well as its current efforts to halt this state of affairs.</p>
<p>The improvement of detention conditions in Turkish prisons is addressed in the Accession Partnership for Turkey adopted on 8 March 20011. In this document, the adjustment of the detention conditions, to bring them in accordance with the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of prisoners and other international norms, is considered as a medium-term priority. Furthermore this issue was dealt with in the Commission’s Regular Report of November 2000.</p>
<p>Already during the events of December 2000, the Commission expressed its concerns about the way the operation were conducted by the security forces and on 8 January 2001, the Commission clearly stated in the Parliament that it shared the Parliament’s concern in this regard. It asked the Turkish security forces to exercise restraint and said that further investigation should be made into the way the operations were conducted in December 2000, and into allegations of torture and ill treatment of prisoners.</p>
<p>Moreover, on 21 March 2001, the Commission released a statement in Ankara together with the Swedish Presidency, regretting that the first death due to hunger strike has occurred. Irrespective of the motives for the hunger strike, the Commission urged the Turkish authorities to take all appropriate measures to avoid further deaths and it recalled the recommendations of the CPT.</p>
<p>Furthermore, indeed the ban adopted on 14 December 2000 by the Istanbul State Security Court, prohibiting the media to report on the situation in the prisons, has been enforced for a couple of months. At the present the ban is de jure still in force, but is de facto not applied.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0413"></a>

<p>It falls to the successive presidencies to encourage the European debate in cooperation with the Commission and with the participation of the European Parliament.

<p>These will be pluralist by definition. It will also be pluralist on a European level.</p>
<p>An existing example of this is the Futurum site (), which was created in collaboration with the European Parliament and the Swedish and Belgian Presidencies. This site provides a common space where all the contributions to the debate can be gathered and, being translated into all the languages of the Union, made accessible to all the interested parties, including the citizens themselves.</p>

<p>The European aluminium-processing industry has long been calling for a reduction in the present rate of import duties of 6% on primary aluminium. An official request has been submitted by the United Kingdom for the existing rate to be halved. The European Union is two-thirds dependent for its supplies on imports from third countries. At the same time, demand for and use of aluminium in the EU is rising continuously. An import duty of 6% consequently can no longer be economically justified. The European processing industry and the consumer are the losers under this provision.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the EU import levy on aluminium can still be justified? Does the Commission not think that it would be well advised, in the light of the above factors, to take the initiative by itself submitting a proposal for these import duties to be lowered?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In January 2000 the British authorities asked the Commission to open an autonomous tariff quota for 900,000 tonnes of raw aluminium with a duty rate of 0% for the year 2001. This proposal was discussed in detail with the Member States in the competent Working Group but was not sufficiently supported by the other Member States. In the first quarter of the 2001 the representatives of several Member States indicated that an autonomous tariff suspension at a reduced duty rate might be acceptable them. The British authorities have therefore at the beginning of May 2001 transmitted a request to replace their request for an autonomous tariff quota by a request for an autonomous tariff suspension for the same product at a duty rate of 3 %. The Commission immediately informed the other Member States about the modification of the request.</p>
<p>The Commission will carefully study whether the modified request can be accepted in view of the principles set out in the “Commission communication concerning autonomous tariff suspensions and quotas”. Should the request be considered acceptable by the Commission an appropriate proposal will be transmitted to the Council in due time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2001-0426"></a>

A veterinary report (XXIV/1448/98 MR (23.10.98)) of an investigation in Belgium between 13 and 18 September 1998 portrays a glaring lack of application of, and checks on, this directive. In recent years the Commission has also carried out spot checks in France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal and Greece, revealing that a lack of effective checks has resulted in very little progress in applying and verifying application of the directive. Despite all these violations and formal notice being served on a number of Member States, including Belgium, there are to be no more inspectors.</p>
<p>Does the Commission think that four inspectors, responsible for animal welfare throughout the Union, are enough to apply an important directive such as this one?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the first instance the Commission must recall that the implementation, enforcement and surveillance of Community Animal Welfare rules in national law is the responsibility of the Member States. The role of the Commission is to verify that the Member States respect their obligations. This is done by the Commission Food &amp; Veterinary Office (FVO). FVO inspectors evaluate the systems put in place by the competent authorities of the Member States to ensure that Community rules are thoroughly respected.</p>
<p>Currently, the FVO has four inspectors in its animal welfare group, who carry out inspections exclusively in the area of animal welfare. However, it is important to note that animal welfare is also taken into account in the course of inspections carried out by the FVO in other areas, such as animal and public health. This adds substantially to the information gathered on the enforcement of animal welfare rules.</p>
<p>During 2000, the four inspectors of the animal welfare group carried out 12 inspection missions, of which 6 were related to on-farm welfare and 6 to welfare of animals during long distance transport. These 12 missions represented 5 % of all missions carried out by the FVO.</p>
<p>As a result of the findings of these inspections, it was recommended that two infringement procedures be launched against Member States. In a further case, it was recommended that an infringement procedure already opened should be continued. In all three cases, the national enforcement-systems demonstrated severe deficiencies of animal welfare for animals during transport.</p>
<p>For this year, 7 on-farm animal welfare missions and 3 missions related to animal welfare during transport have been planned. In addition, in co-operation with the Directorate General for Agriculture, joint inspections in the field of export refunds have been carried out. However due to the current animal health situation in Europe, no transport of live cattle from the Community to third countries is taking place and therefore inspections are not currently taking place.</p>
<p>The Commission has responsibility for carrying out inspections in a wide range of areas falling under the Community food, veterinary and phytosanitary legislation. In developing its mission programme it must take into account how to achieve the most effective use of its resources while at the same time addressing key priority areas. Currently these include inspections in the area of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), foot-and-mouth disease and inspections to enlargement countries. Taking this into account, the Commission believes that its current arrangement for carrying out animal welfare inspections represents the best use of the limited resources available to it.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
