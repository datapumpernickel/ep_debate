<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dimas Stavros,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Μember of the Commission</span>. <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, the Commission is fully aware of how serious the drought is in Spain. It understands the concerns in this respect and is determined to help.</p>
<p class="contents">There exist today means which provide possibilities in situations such as this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already issued, on 10 May, a decision allowing areas in set aside to be used for grazing animals in nine independent communities in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission has received no other specific request on the part of the Spanish authorities in connection with the application of direct aid schemes within the framework of the situation created by the cold weather and the drought.</p>
<p class="contents">Any request submitted by the Spanish authorities to the Commission, for example for payment of advances, will be given serious consideration. The Commission's response will be based on current legislative provisions, taking account of the budget available.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has issued a communication, in which it outlines the various alternative possibilities for combating the dangers and crises in farming. As talks on this issue are at a very early stage in all the institutions, it is too early for the Commission to commit to specific action, even pilot action. Nonetheless, I can say that the Commission, in response to a request from the European Parliament, will shortly set a pilot study in motion on the subject of farm insurance schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, I should also like to refer to the question of transferring intervention reserves raised in the resolution. The Commission is firmly against this sort of transfer, in order to avoid distortions of the market which put local and regional producers and wholesalers at a disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the call for flexibility in the common market organisation in fruit and vegetables in the resolution, the Spanish authorities are responsible for this matter, subject to certain criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">Although there are possibilities for using rural development resources to relieve producers hit by the drought or cold weather, the Commission has not as yet received any such request from the Spanish authorities. If such a request is submitted, the Commission will examine it immediately, so that it can do whatever possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this framework, it could examine the possibility of redistributing amounts already budgeted on the basis of rural development, by channelling them to actions to reinforce measures such as 'replacing farmers' for which provision is made on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Spanish authorities, as happened in the case of Portugal, could examine the possibility of derogations from the application of certain measures, such as agricultural environmental measures, by notifying the Commission of cases recognised as cases of '<span class="italic">force majeure</span>' on the basis of Commission Regulation (EC) No 817/2004.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the risk of forest fires, certain preventive actions can be included under rural development measures financed by the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund on the basis of Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities could also ask for the regional programmes to be amended, in order to reinforce, within the framework of these programmes, measures to prevent forest fires. However, it should be mentioned that additional support based on the above measures can only be set in motion subject to compliance with the budget for existing programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards using the Solidarity Fund, it is true that the serious drought and cold weather may be seen as a natural disaster and, as such, to generally fall within the scope of this fund. However, in order to mobilise the Solidarity Fund, the interested Member State must submit the relevant application to the Commission within ten weeks of the date of the first damage noted.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to qualify for aid, the calculated cost of the overall direct damage must exceed EUR 3 billion at 2002 prices or 0.6% of the gross national product of the country in question, whichever is the lower. This means that the damage threshold for 2005 applicable in Spain's case is just over EUR 3.1 billion at today's prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund can only cover specific emergency aid measures taken by the public authorities, such as, for example, temporary replacement of infrastructures of vital importance, which will allow normal daily activity to resume. It is important to emphasise that the Solidarity Fund of the European Union was not set up in order to cover all the costs connected with natural disasters. In particular, the EU Solidarity Fund does not allow compensation for damages of a private nature, including in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has repeatedly proven that it uses all the possibilities offered by the Solidarity Fund for the benefit of states hit by disasters, including mobilising the Solidarity Fund for the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. However, the effort being made to achieve a degree of flexibility does not mean that certain provisions of the regulation will be overlooked.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, as the honourable Members of Parliament will know, the Commission approved, on 6 April, a proposal for a new Solidarity Fund. This proposal, which will need to be examined by the Council <span class="underline">and</span> by Parliament, makes provision, among other things, for a significant reduction in the damage threshold for mobilising the fund, extends its scope and defines a broader range of eligible actions. The Commission will be delighted if its proposal is supported by Parliament, given that it moves to a considerable extent in the direction being sought today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Spain may decide to compensate farmers with state aid for loss of income as a result of the serious drought and cold weather.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities must notify the plan to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, nonetheless, fundamental that:</p>
<p class="contents">- firstly, they must prove that the losses caused by the weather reach the 20% or 30% threshold;</p>
<p class="contents">- secondly, that there is a direct connection between the losses and the bad weather;</p>
<p class="contents">- thirdly, that there is no overcompensation of the damage caused.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish authorities can also use the new 'de minimis' rule for state aid. Aid of up to EUR 3 000 per farmer may be granted for three years without notifying the Commission, provided that, among other preconditions, the upper limit applicable to Spain is not exceeded. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Antonio López-Istúriz White, </span></span>  <span class="italic">on behalf of the PPE-DE Group.</span> <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for what you said. It clearly indicates your sensitivity towards the urgent problem, indeed the tragedy, currently facing the Spanish countryside.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, you have confirmed some of my suspicions about the Spanish Government’s inertia in this connection. I hope that this resolution and other measures that we are adopting as a matter of urgency in this Parliament will also be a wake-up call to our government.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the damage caused in Spain by the frost and drought is already in excess of EUR 2 000 million, representing a third of the aid received by our country under the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the estimates made by farming organisations, the effects of the bad climatic conditions suffered in January, February and March will go on being felt for a number of years, since a substantial number of trees have been lost, and farmers will not regain their productive capacity in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been most affected is production in terms of fruit, olives, plants, flowers and crops. Cattle breeding has also been affected by the loss of pastureland and the damage caused to the water supply. This is a pressing matter in my own region – that of the Balearic Islands – where, in Menorca, there is currently a shortage of more than 1 500 tonnes of food for the animals – a very serious situation for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The shortage of pastureland, combined with the problems in piping water to farms, has also caused extraordinary harm to cattle throughout Spain. The increase in fuel prices also exacerbates an already critical situation, so it would be as well to take account of the requests that are being made for a European directive to be prepared that would slow down this increase in fuel prices, which is such a burden on our farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish regions most affected by this frost and drought are as follows: Valencia, Murcia and Andalusia, where 50 000 hectares of olives may disappear, with a major environmental disaster somewhere along the line and, shortly afterwards, a possible process of desertification; Aragon, Castille-La Mancha, Catalonia, Estremadura and, as I said, the Balearics; and La Rioja, with its vineyards, and Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should devise specific instruments for tackling extreme situations such as this disaster happening in Spain. I should be grateful to you, Commissioner, if the matter of this insurance fund could also be addressed. These are practical measures that need to be implemented as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Solidarity Fund was set up a few years ago following the floods, remembered by all of us, in the centre of Europe. As you mentioned, it was also used for some very practical measures. Think of the aid granted to Spain following the accident involving the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, the funds duly requested by the People’s Party government or the money used to restore the vegetation in a number of areas affected by the fires.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, Community solidarity should also be demonstrated through the release of resources from this fund to cover, at least, the costs sustained by many Spanish farmers due to loss of productive capacity, since the frost in question has damaged numerous plantations, often irreversibly.</p>
<p class="contents">As your draft resolution points out, the frost and drought are causing damage to the economies and living conditions of many areas this year.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President interrupted the speaker)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall attempt to sum up.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking advantage of the presence of the Commissioner, I should like to urge the Commission to be flexible, since the situation experienced in Spain is ultimately the result of a climate disaster, the kind of event for which this Solidarity Fund was first set up.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from referring to this fund, the resolution also mentions simple measures that can be applied. I hope that the Spanish Government will act quickly and that we shall be able to implement these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">My political group has proposed this series of measures in this resolution, and I hope that they will be approved by plenary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also want to say that this is due in part to the fact that the previous government did not put the plans relating to drought into effect. These were to have been fully implemented by 2003, and we are attempting right now to make up for this failure. We must, however, focus in any case on current measures with a view to the future, and it must also be said that the government has now already made contact with the services of the Commission, even if it has not yet got the assessment under way in practical terms. This is because the frost damage is being assessed throughout the south. A start has now been made on assessing the impact in the north of Spain, specifically throughout the northern half of Spain. As I said, our government has already been in contact with your services, and the interventions both of our government and of Commissioner Fischer Boel in recent days are a specific incentive to conclude this assessment, which was obviously going to require more time than had been expected because of the problems I mentioned, relating to the frost.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures proposed by our Socialist Group in the European Parliament are, specifically, this flexibility that the Commission is planning to apply, the anticipated aid, the release of grain reserves for livestock – which are also in a very critical situation – and flexibility in also making available to such livestock fields and pastureland that have been taken out of cultivation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also put forward the proposal – and I hope that the Commission will be alert to this – for special attention to be paid to preventing the fire risk that, throughout the northern part of Spain and especially in Galicia, will increase over the next few months, and we should naturally also like to demand or propose that special consideration be given to the problem of drought in the context of the Solidarity Fund, which is now being adapted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would ask the Commission to establish a European Drought Observatory because we believe that this drought is neither unique nor peculiar to the present time but that, precisely because of the climate change that is under way, it will become a structural phenomenon. We would ask the Commission, then, to coordinate all the preventive and remedial actions and all other possible measures, from the environmental to the agricultural, in order to ensure that this European Drought Observatory can prevent future problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these are no isolated phenomena. We remember the heatwave in France last year. The fact is that nine of the ten hottest years during the last 500 years have now occurred during the last ten years. Moreover, it is not good enough merely to alter agricultural policy in order to compensate farmers who are affected. We must have plans for dealing with disasters, but the big plan expected of us in this House today by future generations is one designed to combat climate change. Otherwise, what has happened in Spain will just be the first in a long list of disasters in which people, animals and natural features suffer as a result of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate research shows unambiguously that not even our ambitious objective of a no more than two-degree temperature increase will be achieved with the objectives we have set for emissions reductions. On the contrary, a much more vigorous policy is required. We must not adjust policy in the wake of disasters. Rather, we must adjust policy in order to remove the reason why disasters occur. The former Spanish Government, which for a long time fought EU initiatives to introduce climate taxes and to alter the energy system with a view to protecting the climate, must, in actual fact, be criticised on this point. If this fight against constructive work on climate change continues, Spain will be hit on further occasions too. I therefore hope that, on behalf both of future generations of Spaniards and of people in the rest of the world, the Spanish Government will now place itself in the forefront of combating climate change on our earth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In any event, the problem of the drought in Spain is also a problem in Portugal. The entire Iberian Peninsula is suffering the consequences of the drought that has already lasted for many months and that, in tandem with the frost, has had a devastating effect on vegetables, flowers, grasses and fruit trees, and on livestock and certain manufacturing sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">In many towns in Portugal, however, there is even a risk that there will not be enough water to supply the population. I should therefore like to stress at this point that water is an irreplaceable public asset and a universal human right, which must be protected and which must not, under any circumstances, be treated as merchandise.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to standing shoulder to shoulder with Spanish and Portuguese arable and livestock farmers, we are also showing solidarity with the towns and populations affected by a tragedy that could have serious consequences in the not too distant future. Whilst it is important to take one-off measures, such measures do not take account of the fact that the situation could last for many more months, due to the shortage of seed and cattle feed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are similarly concerned about the risk of forest fires, and various regions are already under threat. We therefore feel that effective action must be taken, as a matter of urgency. What is needed is an effective, Community-wide system to protect European farmers from the risks and crises of the situation in Portugal and Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be borne in mind that the reform of the common agricultural policy forces farmers to take responsibility for managing the risks that had previously been absorbed by policies supporting the market and prices. As a result of trade liberalisation, farming is now much more vulnerable to specific risks and crises that are beyond the farmers’ control. It is therefore not enough to say that a study is due to be carried out into the pilot project study agreed in the 2005 budgetary process to set up a Community insurance scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">We must press ahead more quickly with the creation of a compensation mechanism such as a farmers’ insurance scheme financed by Community funds, aimed at offsetting the effects of natural disasters such as droughts and forest fires, by guaranteeing a minimum income for farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">We also urge greater openness and flexibility so that resources from the solidarity fund can be used to minimise the damage to production capacity in a large number of regions and to remedy the most serious cases in Portugal and Spain. That way, the standard of living and economic stability in many regions will not be affected.</p>
<p class="contents">There must also be financial support to offset the rise in costs and the reduction in agricultural production and in farmers’ incomes. Full-time farmers on low incomes must also be temporarily exempt from social security contributions, without loss of rights, and seasonal credits must also be extended for two years, interest-free. We also feel it is important to look into the possibility of setting up a European Drought Observatory and of taking action to encourage people to use water more sensibly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, on 14 April, in this House of European Democracy, Mr Casaca expressed his solidarity with the people worst affected by the drought, especially the farmers of the South of Portugal and the <span class="italic">Raia de Portugal</span> region, as well as the farmers of regions such as Seville, Huelva, Badajoz and Cáceres.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, drought cuts across national borders. This is a genuine, large-scale, natural disaster, on which the European institutions, and consequently Parliament, must focus a great deal of attention. Accordingly, to pick up last month’s debate, we wish to restate our solidarity with Spain and with Spanish farmers. Crop and livestock farmers, and producers of forest products, must be compensated for the considerable losses that they have suffered and will continue to suffer. We must minimise the effects of the drought suffered by workers who depend on crops, livestock and forests and who have already lost their jobs, or whose jobs are under serious threat.</p>
<p class="contents">In Spain and in Portugal, exceptional measures must urgently be taken to promote jobs in the affected areas. In my country, the Farming, Food and Forestry Union puts the number of workers who have already lost their jobs, or are in danger of losing their jobs, at 50 000. This situation is expected to worsen as stocks in water protection areas and in groundwater run out, and given the impossibility of operating irrigation channels.</p>
<p class="contents">In Portugal and in Spain, it is the oak groves that are under the greatest threat. Thousands of Iberian oak and holly oak trees are in the throes of death. Major regions of the Iberian Peninsula are on the brink of desertification. We are not embellishing a situation that is genuinely dramatic. My description of events is based purely and simply on objective facts and realistic parameters.</p>
<p class="contents">Desperate times call for desperate measures. The European institutions have not ignored this disaster. The Commission, for example, has committed itself to providing assistance in its resolution, which we note and welcome. At European level, however, we must do more and do better; the support that has been offered must be stepped up and a multifaceted programme of action – given that the situation is complicated by a wide variety of factors – must be drawn up and implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">The Europe that we are constructing must be a thing of great substance, hence my words today, which are both an overview and a call for action; an overview and a call for action not addressed to the deaf and the mute, but to each and every one of you, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. I address these remarks primarily to your conscience, as free, fair and fraternal men and women. We are counting on you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a European problem, the tackling of which has, for many years, been postponed when dealing with overall policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is very important to bear in mind that drought is a disaster which, moreover, also afflicts areas least able to be defended against water shortages or bouts of frost.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow MEPs have already talked about the tragedy of losing more than EUR 2 000 million. For myself, I should like, however, also to talk about the human factor. I walk every weekend through my own region and know what it is to see black trees that will never grow again. I know the nature of a people like that of the Mediterranean region in which those with substantial farms, in many cases on the verge of retiring from farming with no one to take over from them, also think that the trees being planted will take more than six years to grow.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this disaster, much of the land will go uncultivated and will be liable to end up as mere desert. Let us not forget – and this is an important factor – that, in the future impact assessment, due weight will need to be given to the fact that it is, for example, the very olive groves and almond trees that are key factors in preventing desertification and preserving the scarce rain in our soil.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor must we forget that livestock are dying of thirst. The other day, a shepherd told me, ‘twenty-five per cent of my livestock will be going to the slaughterhouse this year. I cannot keep so much livestock. I have no water. The animals are thirsty’.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say something more. The Natura 2000 network, about which Europe is so concerned, is in danger because the wetlands are without water. Those of us who live at this Mediterranean latitude in Murcia, Valencia or Andalusia know perfectly well that the birds are already no longer heard in the mornings because they have gone to places where they can drink. Even if householders put water out for them to drink, that is not enough because they lack not only drink but also food. That much is obvious, and Europe will need to include the fact among the variables it will have to study.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a series of measures proposed by the European Union. I am grateful for what you said, Commissioner, about forestry aid, but let us bear in mind that the summer has not yet begun. The Mediterranean climate, pitiless as it is, is really going to put us through it because our situation is already critical. It is May, and it has not rained.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also grateful for the idea of a pilot study, but I would point out that such a pilot study will have to be comprehensive.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only has my government acted belatedly, but it has taken measures that will exacerbate the situation. Why? Specifically because, four years ago, this Commission was presented with a National Hydrological Plan whereby water would be carried to these regions, indeed to the whole of the agricultural area. The European Commission delayed accepting the plan, the subject became politicised and, in the end, the Spanish Government kept the water where it was. Water is what, moreover, would have enabled the wetlands to thrive. It would have created a degree of hope and enabled the trees planted to replace those seriously affected by the frost or drought to grow again. We now face bleak prospects, a plan having been shelved for entirely political reasons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to make a number of brief comments:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Commission has repeatedly demonstrated that it is flexible and that it uses all the possibilities at its disposal, such as, for example, the Solidarity Fund, which it tried to use in order to respond to requests from various countries including, as I mentioned earlier, Spain in the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to Mr López, as regards the question of insurance, which is extremely important that, as I mentioned in my initial statement, we have set in motion and have in fact already started this study. We do not yet have any results but, in all events, they will form part of the more general debate on combating and managing the dangers and crises in farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to Mrs Figueiredo, I should like to say that, as far as insuring farmers' income is concerned, this runs counter to the principle behind the revised Community agricultural policy and most of the issues she referred to come within the jurisdiction of the Member States. In all events, as I said in my initial statement, the national government has the facility, without any other procedure, to pay EUR 3 000 to farmers who have sustained losses.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Schlyter's comments on the adjustments needed in various countries in order to combat climate change are absolutely correct. In Buenos Aires we agreed, within the framework of the United Nations, on the adjustments needed in all countries, especially in very poor countries, which have trouble meeting requirements caused by the overheating of the planet and, of course, in the Member States of the European Union, where measures of this sort are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that the Mediterranean will face an even bigger problem from climate change, given that the temperature has risen over the last 100 years by 0.6°C in the world as a whole, but by approximately 0.9°C in the Mediterranean. In other words, we had a far bigger increase in temperature and, as a result, many more problems, including the problem of drought.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Mrs Ayala's proposal on a drought and forest fire observatory is very interesting. The Commission is examining this proposal and evaluating the possibility of creating such an observatory, but has not taken a decision in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to mention that the Commission is particularly concerned about the situation prevailing in Spain. We have already taken a number of actions to help farmers and their families, which will, in turn, help the agricultural economies which have been hit.</p>
<p class="contents">For the time being, preliminary preparations are being made for a number of additional actions and, at the same time, my colleague and Commissioner with jurisdiction, Mrs Fischer Boel, is in close contact with the Spanish Minister of Agriculture. I have taken note of the various important comments made and, of course, I shall pass them on to my colleague who, I am sure, will take them into serious account. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
