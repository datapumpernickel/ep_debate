There appears to be agreement as far as my report is concerned, which is a good start.

We are withdrawing the resolution since its content has been reproduced almost in full and to the letter in the joint resolution signed by the Chairmen of the main political groups. I note with satisfaction that this acknowledges the high quality of the end-result arrived at on 21 November by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on the basis of a transparent and balanced compromise between the various positions. While withdrawing the resolution, however, I express the conviction that this Parliament would have made its voice heard better if, in anticipation of the Council of Nice, it had devoted a specific and separate resolution to these important and difficult topics of the Intergovernmental Conference, instead of dealing with them in a single resolution that also embraces all the other points on the Council agenda. That was what the Committee over which I currently preside had proposed in carrying out its mandate, consistent with Parliament’s action on the eve of the Amsterdam Council in 1997 and on other similar occasions before that.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Madam President, that the powers and initiatives of our parliamentary committees ought not to be constrained.</p>

I voted against in protest at the fact that the European Union is still not managing to intervene in this matter as it should. In fact, those concerned with enforcing shipboard living and working conditions, as the title of this report states, are unable to lay down that seamen who go to sea are, throughout Europe, entitled to receive their pensions and end their working lives earlier than other people. Many seamen are grandfathers and do not see their grandchildren because they are always at sea; fathers do not see their own children. In short, this job is different from others and entails many more sacrifices than other jobs. Therefore it is fair that they should be entitled, if they wish, to take their pensions before other workers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU's policy merely maintains and extends this unaccountability, given that even the inadequate protective measures decided under pressure from the grass-roots movement will never be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">Regional decisions on safety at sea seriously undermine the role of the International Maritime Organisation (ΙΜΟ) and the economic war being waged exerts a constant downward pressure on safety regulations, which are sacrificed to profit. At the same time, big shipowners ply their trade uncontrolled under flags of convenience and the state of world shipping goes from bad to worse. The unaccountability of shipowners is being bolstered by the privatisation of shipping registers, which shipowners now control, and by the lack of any basic inspection controls or other form of involvement on the part of government authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We urgently need to take preventative action for ships flying under the flag of Member States of the European Union, to improve existing legislation and, more importantly, to ensure that it is applied. We need to change the system of shipping registers by moving them from the private to the public sector. We also need to extend seaworthiness surveys and inspections by the competent authorities to ships of any nationality sailing in the territorial waters of the Member States and to promote similar measures at international level under resolutions by the ΙΜΟ, paying particular attention and applying particularly strict measures to ships sailing under flags of convenience. Merchant ships need to be inspected by government departments with suitably trained staff and proper technological facilities, with the active involvement of the shipping trade union movement.</p>
<p class="contents">A real policy to protect safety at sea, human life at sea and the environment needs, first and foremost, to address the unaccountability of shipowners, apply strict measures to punish their infringements, stipulate how ships are to be crewed in keeping with their enhanced requirements, help to improve living and working conditions on board ship and ensure that the trade union movement is properly involved when decisions are taken on shipping, especially on safety issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the proposal to amend the current Directive on ship inspections and the Watts report fall far short of what is actually required, they are a step in the right direction and the MEPs of the Communist Party of Greece have therefore voted in favour of the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only has our Parliament accelerated the legislative procedure, which was to be expected, but it has also succeeded in staying at the forefront in matters of safety by putting across principles it has recognised for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, on three accounts, Mark Watts has managed to reinforce the measure envisaged by the Commission:</p>
<p class="contents">- Not only must ships which have been detained more than twice in the course of the preceding 24 months in a port of a Member State be barred from sailing but, in the opinion our Parliament, this should apply irrespective of the age of the vessel.</p>
<p class="contents">- Ships that have flown the flag of a blacklisted state for 3 consecutive years shall be barred from sailing in the waters under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This is aimed at dissuading states issuing these types of flags of convenience and shipowners from having recourse to this illegal practice.</p>
<p class="contents">- A black box shall be installed on board ship. A ship that does not have a black box will in future be refused access to Community ports.</p>
<p class="contents">Public opinion is waiting for us to act and is impatient for our vote. We have not accelerated the procedure only to hold it up at the finish line through conciliation with the Council, which would be spread out over several months. The risks of accidents and pollution are too great, to say nothing of shipboard working conditions and the wages of the seamen. Let us demonstrate our drive and energy and let us vote in favour of this progressive report. This will be to our credit and preserve our environment, and hence give us a better quality of life. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, making maximum profit is often all that matters, to the detriment of safety, the environment and the personnel. Human error largely results from overloading, underpayment and the fact that the sailors have not received adequate training. The Commission proposal looks reassuring, but is not proof against deliberate sabotage. I therefore welcome the fact that the rapporteurs Watts, Vachetta and Piétrasanta have endeavoured to close the gaps still present in the Commission proposal. They propose that ships which pose a risk or sail under cheap flags and those lacking voyage recorder data should be banned from EU ports, that we should counteract brass-plate companies, stop ships rinsing out their tanks in the sea, and increase the number of inspectors. It is significant that Mrs Vachetta has proposed that the level of manpower, the working hours, the pay levels and the training of sailors should be improved. I support any improvements and am disappointed that some of them will not get a majority vote behind them even now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission proposes to introduce a certain uniformity of inspection procedures and sets out the conditions under which access to the ports of the Member States of the European Union can be refused: these are the minimum conditions for a common policy on maritime safety.</p>
<p class="contents">These provisions have the effect of strengthening safety checks on ships in our ports but do not make it possible to ban dangerous ships that do not drop anchor at one of our ports from sailing in our territorial waters. The limitations of these proposals are therefore clear. One can therefore deplore the fact that the Commission proposal has not taken up the idea of the establishment of a European surveillance body on the model of the coastguards in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We will settle for setting up a European system of surveillance and information exchange between Member States. The European Parliament will have to ensure that the financial and human resources that are needed to effectively establish this rapid reaction and information exchange system are quickly made available by the Member States. I would point out that the European Union has some 270 inspectors charged with state port control. This figure falls far short of the number of inspectors needed to implement the measures we are proposing in ports.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has put forward a number of proposals enhancing the binding nature and effectiveness of these inspections. I fully support the ban on navigation for ships which have been detained twice in the course of the preceding 2 years, irrespective of the age of the ship. However, I believe that this measure should be considered a minimum requirement and I hope that we will be able to go much further.</p>
<p class="contents">To do so, we must be sure that the measures we are proposing today are implemented by all the Member States of the European Union. The responsibility for putting these measures in place rests therefore with the Member States. Without additional inspectors and without extra financial resources, the controls proposed in the ports will remain a fiction. We therefore call on the Member States to make a real commitment to maritime safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is right to want to stop Europe lagging behind America. We must not allow single-hull tankers to carry on sailing in our waters when they are no longer present elsewhere after 2005, 2010 or 2015. If we do not implement the necessary measures in good time we will end up with the old, high-risk ships that have been sent for scrap in the States in our own waters.</p>
<p class="contents">Double-hull tankers reduce the risk of oil pollution, but do not rule it out. In particular, in recent years there has been a dramatic increase in tanker and fast passenger ship traffic in the Baltic Sea off Estonia and Russia. The risk of ships crashing into each other is so great there that without extra supervision and inspections, shipping accidents are becoming increasingly likely. There is therefore every reason to tighten up the Commission proposal, just as the rapporteurs for the other reports on safety at sea that are on the agenda today have done. Unfortunately, rapporteur Hatzidakis has done the opposite. He fears a shortage of tankers and would rather wait for internationally agreed measures. I support the Commission proposal. However, the ways in which it has been toned down make it inadequate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, making the construction of double-hull vessels, especially those used to transport toxic and/or dangerous goods, more widespread as quickly as possible is a useful measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must not be out of step with regulations in the United States which, thanks to the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, aim to phase out single-hull vessels between 2000 and 2015. We must at least keep pace with the United States while adopting measures not to shift the activities of the whole fleet of coffin ships towards third-world countries. Moreover, replacing the outdated ships is a means of giving a fresh boost to shipbuilding.</p>
<p class="contents">We must envisage improving the system of double hulls. Many technical experts have pointed out the difficulties encountered when inspecting the space between the two hulls and during its maintenance. Yet Mr Hatzidakis makes proposals which restrict the scope of the Commission proposals. As he explained, they aim to enhance maritime safety while respecting the system of competition or, in other words, the quest for the lowest cost. In short, what is being proposed is to eliminate the lack of maritime safety without attacking its causes.</p>

The loss of the <span class="italic">Erika</span>, which occurred in December 1999, put the issue of maritime safety on the Community’s political agenda and it was due to pressure from the European Parliament that the European Commission proposed the texts we voted on today, almost a year after the accident. It took a second maritime disaster, the wreck of the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, to accelerate the first reading of these texts.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted in favour of Mr Hatzidakis’s report and I would naturally like to congratulate the rapporteur on persevering with such a sensitive issue. The mandatory double hull for oil tankers and the progressive phasing out of the oldest ships are measures which go in the right direction and are a practical response to the legitimate concerns of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The lengthy transitional period during which single-hull vessels will still be able to sail is to be regretted, however, even though the scope of the measure is such as to justify the gradual rate of their withdrawal. We must pay the greatest attention to amendments to the timetable for withdrawing the oldest ships which may be proposed by the Council. In all eventualities, the ultimate deadline of 2015 must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the unilateral decision taken by the United States to ban single-hull oil tankers from calling at American ports after 2015 poses a real threat to maritime traffic passing through EU waters, where these ships are likely to ply their trade. It is therefore crucial that the timetable for eliminating these ships from our seas must be in line with the American timetable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must not forget that the mandatory double hull for oil tankers can be but a single element in a genuine European policy of maritime safety. This decision is important but it does not go far enough. Promoting more stringent regulations at an international level must continue to be the fundamental objective of our maritime safety policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Oil tanker traffic in the Baltic may now increase dramatically, since Russia is planning a number of oil ports along the Baltic coast, in the Gulf of Finland, in something approaching a major concentration of the Russian oil industry.

This measure by Mr Ortuondo Larrea, regulating inspections and control visits to ships, is extremely important, just as all inspections and controls are important. I remember when the inspectors of the states that had to check the ship came on board. They would shut themselves in a cabin with the chief purser and come out loaded with cigarettes, bottles of spirits and maybe other things too. Inspections are serious business! I believe we should try to get European inspectors to go on board European ships, because this habit of governments and the Council of refusing inspections must come to an end, especially in this activity of cleaning up the sea and our coastlines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After the wrecks of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> and the <span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>, which recently affected the shorelines of France, it is time that the European Union reacted and took firm control of the classification societies which authorise coffin ships to sail. It is against this background that European legislation is vital.</p>
<p class="contents">This report, which aims to improve the control of ships and to establish harmonised procedures and rules of inspection must therefore be supported, as it is a step forward, even though, in our opinion, the rapporteur’s approach does not go far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that, whilst he provides for the harmonisation of inspection criteria for all Member States, nothing is envisaged for ships from third countries inspected outside the European Union. What is there to prevent, for example, a Maltese or a Cypriot ship in poor condition from sailing close to our shorelines. When will the European Union finally take the decision to ban access to its territorial waters to any ship that does not comply with the rules it promulgates?</p>
<p class="contents">Will Europe, normally so swift to legislate on environmental issues, continue to ignore maritime safety because colossal financial interests are at stake and because the interests of its Members differ? When will the European Union free up the human and financial resources commensurate with the task at hand so that this text does not remain a simple declaration of intent?</p>
<p class="contents">We will vote in favour of this report, which goes in the right direction, whilst at the same time deploring what it fails to do: to determine the precise liability of the polluters (inspectors, shipowners, charterers, insurers); to introduce preventative and penalty measures to fight against intensive tank cleaning, which is responsible for most marine pollution; to draw up a blacklist of coffin ships, and to refuse access to EU territorial waters to any ship posing a significant threat, irrespective of age.</p>
<p class="contents">The revision of Directive 94/57/EC is becoming a matter of some urgency, especially since Malta and Cyprus, the fourth and sixth largest fleets worldwide respectively, are candidates for accession to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This Community action must be accompanied by the reactivation of the IMO which, endowed with genuine police power to enforce the International Safety Management Code, would be an effective instrument on a par with Interpol.</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, recognition of classification societies is devolved to Member States without any prior control or harmonisation at European level.

Ships save on port fees by continuing to sail through stormy weather and by risking fatal accidents at other times too. As long as it costs less to transgress rules than it does to comply with them, companies that have maximum profits in their sights will carry on making the wrong choices. The flag states are still incapable of organising the inspection of seagoing ships for seaworthiness and environmental safety for themselves. They contract this work out to internationally operating companies that are dependent on the favours of shipping companies. The shipowners that register voluntarily as customers can, if desired, transfer to another bureau whose requirements are less strict. It is a step in the right direction that the recognition accorded classification societies can be withdrawn, that liability is to be harmonised and that classification societies will always have to transfer their data to the competitor who takes over from them. It would be better still if inspections were to take place biannually and if classification societies were not permitted to be dependent on one large company alone, which builds, repairs or utilises ships. But the best result of all would be if harmonised inspections were to become the direct responsibility of the government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important section as it relates to classification societies.</p>
<p class="contents">I voted in favour of this report, which proposes the introduction of a certain uniformity amongst Member States in terms of quality and the expert capabilities of classification societies, whose recognition will henceforth be the preserve of the shared responsibility of the Member Sates and the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals also step up the liability of classification societies by providing for financial sanctions and the suspension or withdrawal of their recognition in the event of accidents that may be attributable to them. The arraignment of the classification societies in the wake of the loss of the <span class="italic">Erika</span> in December 1999 recalls their vital role in evaluating and preventing the risks associated with the condition of ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The navigable condition of a ship is the responsibility of the state whose flag the ship flies. I hope the involvement of the European Commission in recognising classification societies and the increased liability of the latter will make it possible to do away with flags of convenience altogether. From this perspective, these measures must be implemented without delay in the candidate countries, whose fleets must conform to the standards and safety criteria of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of classification societies goes far beyond the borders of the European Union. The European Commission must therefore free up the resources to monitor the enforcement of the new measures by Member States and candidate countries alike. Finally, our common policy on maritime safety must be an international role model and the obligations we place on our ships must be extended to third-country fleets. Maritime safety must not simply be an issue arising out of a state of urgency in the wake of each new disaster that hits our shorelines, but the object of an internationally integrated and constant policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In particular, we reject calls for a European constitution, at least if it entails the subordination of national constitutions. We reject the idea of a restrictive Charter of Fundamental Rights being integrated into the Treaties, since it would trigger a formidable spiral of standardisation. We reject the general extension of qualified majority voting accompanied by the simultaneous extension of codecision and the abolition of the Luxembourg compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Nice Council did not reach an agreement on this basis, it would not in our view be a failure, as the federalists claimed yesterday in their attacks on the French Presidency and Mr Védrine. Rather, it would be a great success, as the Europe we need on the eve of enlargement is not a supranational Europe which is inflexible, hierarchical and remote, but a Europe which is flexible and close to its people, therefore founded in respect for national democracies.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the current Nice agenda is concerned, we believe that the Charter of Fundamental Rights should remain a simple declaration, that the Commission should be composed of one Commissioner for each Member State, that the weighting of votes in the Council should respect the parity of the large States, that majority voting should not be extended to the most important issues, such as immigration, international negotiations on services, taxation and social security and, finally, that specific acts of cooperation should be accepted very liberally, including outside the single institutional framework.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, we believe that, after Nice, further negotiations should be entered into, this time in the right direction, to make the institutions more flexible and to re-establish control by the people, by turning Europe, not into a super state, but into a network of national democracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Notwithstanding a few phrases, as pompous as they are empty, on democracy and on the interests of the people, the debate which is under way within these institutions bears no relation whatsoever to the interests of the working classes and the majority of the population.</p>
<p class="contents">We will certainly not be taking part in the bickering between the mouthpieces of the three or four major powers competing for domination of the European Union. It is of little consequence to us whether the Charter of Fundamental Rights is incorporated into the Treaty on European Union or not, because, in any case, this Charter, allegedly a Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only refuses to include the elementary rights of workers, it actually clears the way for retrograde social measures. Instead of raising human and social rights to a higher level, the Charter will make it easier to bring them down.</p>

There is no satisfactory agreement in the offing yet.</p>
<p class="contents">The increasingly open struggle for power between many Member States is clouding the view in terms of possible compromises. Quite a number of Member States, particularly the large ones, seem only to be interested in consolidating their own position of power in the future. The lion’s share of the tabled resolutions show that Parliament too has fallen prey to the temptation to regard the Nice Summit as largely successful because its own authority has been extended.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no time for this attitude. An ambition for power alone is not enough to prepare the European Union for the future. The very first thing that is needed if we are to have a European Union in which the various nationalities can live peacefully together, is for the governments to seek a sustainable balance, in mutual respect and empathy. The institutions of the European Union must be in a position to fulfil their tasks without having to step into the shoes of the Member States. Now, and in the future too, each country must be able to truly show itself to best advantage in a Union based on justice. I believe that is a crucial criterion by which to judge the Treaty of Nice. Unfortunately though, I do not see any evidence of this notion in the motions for resolutions. I am anticipating complete justice in the future realm of the Lord Jesus. That must not stop us, the people of the European Union, from seeking this justice in the here and now, here on earth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have also made known through the individual votes, we have, throughout the Intergovernmental Conference, been opposed to the much expanded agenda which, by means of repeated motions for resolutions, the majority in the European Parliament has been trying to draw up. Many of the motions for resolutions tabled by the different political groups are therefore also based upon a deep concern about how much success there will be in achieving the goal in Nice, which is to make the EU ready for admitting the new Member States of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important task in Nice is to ensure that the EU has effective institutions. As a prerequisite, the solution should involve striking a balance between small and large countries, not only where the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers is concerned, but also when it comes to the composition of the European Parliament and the Commission. These two institutions contribute very significantly to the EU’s continuing to concentrate its efforts on the common objectives and cross-border tasks, while the rest is left to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Enlargement is a major project requiring backing not only in the applicant States but also in those countries which are already Members. Many Members of the European Parliament have ambitions to see the Treaties made into a constitution, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights included and qualified majority voting used in all areas. To keep harping on about these aims, for which there is, in any case, no broad support to be won, during the current Intergovernmental Conference is unwise in our view and will contribute to Parliament’s losing influence. We have also emphasised this during the individual votes today. We have chosen to vote in favour of the report as a whole because we wish to put pressure on the Heads of State and Government to achieve a good outcome in Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With regard to the Intergovernmental Conference and the subsequent reform of the European institutions, it is particularly serious that moves are being made towards strengthening the power of a small number of large countries to the detriment of the decision-making ability of the great majority of small and medium-sized countries. This may happen with the extension of qualified majority voting, instances of closer cooperation situated within a hard-core concept, the application of closer cooperation to areas like security and defence policy, the prospect of moving towards a European Constitution based on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which itself has a content that is restrictive and in several aspects retrograde compared with similar international or national documents, the latter applying to the case of Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">In the social sphere, the proposals are too timid and do not even effectively flesh out the commitments adopted at the Lisbon Summit, particularly as regards the need for strengthening economic and social cohesion. The Council must, therefore, re-examine its positions and move to oppose the wave of company mergers and concentrations in various sectors, interrupt the current liberalising processes, and change macroeconomic policies with the aim of fighting for quality employment with proper rights and against poverty and social exclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reform of the European Union Treaties must take account of the needs and interests of smaller Member States. Failure to do so would upset the delicate balance that is the very basis of the proper functioning of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like, in particular, to highlight a number of elements that I believe could hold inherent danger for the future stability of the Union as well as raising questions as to the democratic legitimacy of the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the general extension of qualified majority voting is concerned, I do not believe that this is a helpful proposal as it would pre-empt the right of Member States to take a decision at the appropriate time on whether a policy should be communitised. I firmly believe that any change from unanimity to QMV should be considered on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither am I in favour of an automatic linking between QMV and codecision and once again believe that any decision to extend the powers of codecision should also be made on a case-by-case basis. I am already on record as being absolutely opposed to bringing the common agricultural policy into the codecision sphere and will not further elaborate on that issue at this point.</p>
<p class="contents">In so far as the Charter of Fundamental Rights is concerned, while I am in favour of promoting the rights referred to in this document, I do not support its incorporation into the eventual Treaty of Nice. An alternative solution such as EU accession to the European Convention on Human Rights merits much closer examination.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever is finally agreed at Nice by the 15 Member State governments may well have to be ratified by the Irish people through a referendum. I can assure you that the current negotiations are being followed in my country, as I am sure they are in all of your countries. We must tread carefully and not run ahead of public opinion or of what our populations are ready for. European integration for Ireland has been a very positive experience and I believe that one of the keys to this has been the gradual approach.</p>
<p class="contents">In order for Treaty reform, and indeed enlargement, to be a success it must have the full support of the people. In this sense, no decision about the development of the EU should be taken which risks alienating the citizens of Europe. After all, any democratic system is built upon the trust and confidence of the people. If the Union loses public support then it loses its very legitimacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU, within the framework of NATO, will take part in imposing a new world order which has little sympathy for the fate of the Palestinians and which is preparing to effectively endorse the liberalisation of rail transport and postal services.</p>
<p class="contents">The accession of new countries is a pretext for emphasising a European structure which is satisfactory only to industrial groups. All the advocates of a liberal Europe are enlarging is the scale of misery of peoples already crushed by poverty and not only that but, on this occasion, they are imposing a political agenda which involves placing on an official footing a core of rich countries which will control an expanded European market.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the EU is taking the initiative on the new liberal demands of the WTO and capitalist globalisation.

<p class="contents">This text uses the future (and ever more distant) enlargement of the European Union as a pretext to call for the reinforcement of a system which has already run out of steam. As if that were the only solution! As if on our continent no other form of organisation were possible except the integrationist model, originally designed, need I remind you, for a hard core of five or six countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Why seek to find a solution to the squaring of the circle represented by the enlargement of the European Union and the representation of States and peoples in a system which is already saturated, when a different model, that of a Europe of Nations, would provide simple and effective solutions?</p>
<p class="contents">Why deny, furthermore, that the democratic alibi of this integrated Europe is nothing but a false nose? An enlarged integrationist Europe is not by nature democratic: in fact it violates one of the most basic of human rights, the right to nationhood. Need we remind ourselves that democracy does not boil down to having a vote? Democracy presupposes dialogue, which in turn presupposes a shared feeling of community, which is often linked to language. Our debates within this Chamber increasingly resemble a series of monologues than real exchanges. Compare them to the vivacity, energy and pertinence of the debates in national parliaments: the members of parliament in the Palais Bourbon, Westminster, the Cortes are able to compare ideas because they are expressed within the same cultural framework and in the same language.</p>
<p class="contents">I also voted against a text which calls for the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the eventual Treaty of Nice. This is an ambiguous and contradictory text, open to all sorts of interpretations. It is impossible to claim, as some do, that this text is inoffensive. In the hands of the European Court of Justice – ‘one jurisdiction and one mission’ as one of its judges said some years ago – the Charter may become the most undemocratic instrument to which European integration has given birth.</p>
<p class="contents">The Convention which was given the task of drawing it up foreshadows this: the sanctioning of the dominant role of influential groups and activist agencies in the construction of a federal Europe in the pipeline. It is a body which, by its very nature, can find only a minimum consensus on the rights to which the people of Europe are already entitled. It is a body which has produced a text which will not fail to create a conflict of judicial doctrine between the Court of Justice and the Court of Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Constitutional Affairs prepared a draft resolution outlining the expectations of the European Parliament. While I may agree with the broad thrust of this resolution, “to make the European Union more democratic, more effective and closer to its citizens”, I am nevertheless unable to take on board a certain number of proposals which seem to me to be rather vague. I therefore prefer to abstain.</p>
<p class="contents">On the crucial issue of the institutions, however, the proposal of a satisfactory all-round formula is to its credit. The explicit affirmation of the principle of the double legitimacy of the European Union, that of the peoples and that of the Member States, is, in this respect, essential. It will make it possible for negotiators from the least populous Member States to defend, in Nice, the principle of adequate representation in all the institutions, including the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is becoming ever more apparent that opening the debate on proportionality (votes in the Council and seats in the European Parliament), one might go so far as to say on the balance of power between the Member States, has opened a Pandora’s box which will be very difficult to close in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, there are squabbles not only between the ‘larger’ and the ‘smaller’ but among the ‘larger’ too.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a good idea for the European Council to decide, from the outset, to base all its institutional decisions on the principle of double legitimacy, which has proved itself from the very inception of the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have always believed it was unrealistic, and it has proved to be so in the eight years since it was adopted by the Maastricht Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Ironically, and just for the record, I should mention Article J2, the third paragraph of Title 5 of the Maastricht Treaty, which states: “Member States shall ensure that their national policies conform on the common positions”. This article has not been respected once; nor indeed have the other articles in Title 5. On the contrary, it has been consistently flouted, the last example to date being London’s recognition of North Korea. The President-in-Office of the European Union deplored this breach, which, and I quote him, he described as “exceptional”, and then, three days later Berlin followed suit without even taking the trouble, it seems, to inform the French Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">We are a laughing stock and, basically, that is just one more disappointment for the poor old construction of Europe or, rather, the deconstruction of Europe. I am thinking, for example, of the reform of our institutions, which was promised for 1995, then 1997, and which still seems to be in the doldrums just a few days away from the Nice Summit. This will be just one more disappointment to add to our vagaries on enlargement, which itself has been promised for ten years, to say nothing of the successive and, I might add, cumulative collapses of the euro. But these are just examples. I could go on and talk about the reduction in appropriations for the MEDA programme or the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">There is just one thing to be retained from these reports and, if only for that, we would have to oppose it. That is the almost ritual reference to NATO since, basically, the only thing that Mr Brok has managed to put in the 1999 annual report is the Kosovo affair. It has to be said that, this time, the Europeans have found an arbiter in Washington and that, thanks to the rearguard of American generals, Europe has finally found a certain unity. This is laughable, I repeat, and when historians write the history of Europe in the twentieth century, I think they will mention neither the common foreign and security policy nor the League of Nations, and perhaps that is just as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

His new role has put an end to the traditional neutrality of Ireland, Sweden, Finland and Austria. After 1945, defence was taken to mean the defence of one’s own territory against foreign attackers. So a country’s defensive army did not have any tasks beyond the territory of the state that had established it. NATO abided by this formula during the first 50 years of its existence. The United States army moved into Vietnam, the Dominican Republic and Grenada, whilst France and England tried to gain control of the Suez Canal, but countries did not take action as part of NATO outside their own territory. That did not happen until the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact – which for years had justified the existence of NATO – had collapsed. My party, the Socialist Party of the Netherlands, rejects any attempt on the part of the European Union to imitate the superpower America.

<p class="contents">As every year, this ritual report prepared by the European Parliament, which is in principle devoted to the annual general budget of the CFSP, employs the well-known method of gradual shifts which work on a federalist crevice found in a given area in order to extend this breach with scant regard for the Treaties or the decisions of the European Councils. In this case, it is the area of the Helsinki Council and common foreign policy, a field in which the rapporteur sets himself three main objectives. We have no alternative but to reject these objectives, which are as follows: to reduce European action in the world to that of the European Union as sole actor; to establish a European Ministry of Foreign Affairs intended to absorb the functions of national ministries and, finally, to get rid of the structure of the European Union in terms of pillars by widening the Community method, in particular by placing the High Representative under the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This action plan, which deals with the structures, leaves out just one albeit decisive element, the definition and content, at an earlier stage, of a European foreign policy. The truth is that, far removed from the virtual visions which hold sway within this Parliament, diplomatic realities are entirely different and the CFSP hardly exists. Glaring proof of this has just been adduced, as if this were necessary, by the recognition of the Republic of North Korea by the United Kingdom and Germany, without waiting for a common position to be adopted. Hence, it is clear that the way to strengthen the weight of European diplomatic action is to seek the harmonisation – where desirable, opportune and effective – of decisions which remain fundamentally the prerogative of the national actor, not through structural constraints which are totally ineffectual.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our group once again voted against the absurd proposals to communitise national diplomatic services included in Articles 74 and 75 of the resolution, to turn European Union delegations into actual European embassies, and to establish a European diplomatic academy. The mind boggles at the proposal to put the entire diplomatic staff of Europe of an estimated 40 000 perfectly real people at the service of a virtual foreign policy. This proposal is both specific and surreal! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are nonetheless a number of features of the report about which we have reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, it is important to state that, because of its reservation in the military sphere, Denmark cannot contribute forces to the common European rapid reaction force. Secondly, we are sceptical about the ideas for establishing a proper European space policy, if the intention behind this is for Europe to have a defence system such as that which the United States is in the process of establishing. From a research point of view and in relation to the monitoring of the environment, a common European space programme may nonetheless have some advantages. Thirdly, there are a number of points in the report which leave one wishing that the European Parliament had more influence in devising a common European security and defence policy. We think it is very important to state that formulating security and defence policy is an intergovernmental concern in which the European Parliament neither can nor should be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Further institutionalisation of security and defence policy in the EU is therefore a development that we cannot support. It is up to each individual Member State to decide to what extent it wants to participate in a common European security and defence policy. Nor, furthermore, is it a task for the European Parliament to define what capacity a European rapid reaction force should possess and whether or not it should, for example, include a capacity for intervention by air and sea. Parliament’s desire for all Member States to contribute financially to the European rapid reaction force, even if they are not involved in operations, is in our view inappropriate since it could mean, for example, that some countries are involved in a conflict they do not wish to take part in. In connection with this, it is also important to emphasise that those Member States that are neutral must not in any way be compromised. Their desire to remain neutral must be respected in every way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">1. We do not consider that there is any real threat to Europe at present; rather, it is now high time for an active disarmament policy and civil development. We are convinced that a Europe of Peace will not be created through military alliances. Future conflicts will not be solved through military intervention but rather via a policy for social, economic and ecological justice. Our peace policy analysis is based on the conflict theory that militarisation does not create a more secure and more peaceful world, but rather contributes to growing uncertainty and increased risk of military conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">2. We feel that civil crisis management is a valuable instrument for preventing conflicts, something which we must unfortunately state has not been given sufficient attention in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">3. We feel that military initiatives within the common security and defence policy must only be implemented following and in accordance with resolutions by the UN Security Council, a view that the rapporteur does not seem to share.</p>
<p class="contents">4. The report is based on an intervention philosophy that we do not share. We consider that international law and the sovereignty of the national States must be respected and must be the guiding principle of international policy. There is talk of the EU’s common interests and values as grounds for military armament. We do not consider that there is reason for militarisation on the basis of these values, which are not defined, and we would question what they mean.</p>
<p class="contents">5. Mrs Lalumière clearly points out that it is probable that in the future within the EU we will be forced to defend all the boundaries of EU Member States from third countries. This is not compatible with the freedom from alliances of certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">6. Furthermore, freedom from alliances is not taken up at all in the report and in the explanatory statement section of the report we sense a lack of respect towards States that are neutral. In Paragraph 49, Member States who do not wish to or cannot participate in a task are nonetheless obliged to make a contribution to the financing of the task. This is not compatible with freedom from alliances.</p>
<p class="contents">7. We consider the idea of a large-scale defence force to be an insult to the candidate countries that already have stretched economies and that need to invest money in, say, social welfare rather than military armament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It emphasises the development of the European Union’s military assets and capabilities and the Member States’ effort to close the gaps that currently exist in this field, as they have just done in the fields of strategic air transport, cruise missiles and reconnaissance and navigation satellites.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally serious is the intention that any State that does not wish to take part in a mission should be required to pay a financial contribution to be divided up among the States participating in that war.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point deserving our disapproval is the satisfaction with the framework agreement signed in Farnborough by six countries of the European Union, since this will facilitate the restructuring of the defence industries in Europe and emphasise a space policy covering the civilian and military aspects of the use of space and combining the European Union national and multinational resources the holds in the military field.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it should be noted that in Nice, as the report states, the definitive CESDP bodies – Military Committee and Military Staff – may be set up with responsibilities and decision-making powers enabling swifter progress to be made towards the implementation of the common security and defence policy.</p>

In this way, Europe is exposing its imperialist character, with the protection of its investments abroad, the penetration of its goods, access to raw materials and the exploitation of cheap labour. It will act in concert with the United States within NATO. But this European army will primarily serve to stabilise the immediate periphery of the European Union. The commercial annexation of the East and of North Africa can but exacerbate social inequalities, which in turn will lead to social explosions, local armed conflicts and massive displacements of populations. In the future, by coordinating its diplomatic and military forces, the European Union will try to optimise what its Member States did individually all through the last century, and all in the name of ‘maintaining’ peace and ‘humanitarian operations’.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not need euro-militarism. We are radically opposed to this European army as we are to NATO and to our own national army. The creation of a European military industry (EADS, Dassault, BAE) capable of checkmating the United States would in the first instance result in a dramatic increase in the military budget and a transfer of scientific and technological research to the military sector.

The 50-year anniversary of NATO was marked by the first NATO war. This war enabled Milosevic to continue ruling Serbia and Montenegro a year longer because it gave him the opportunity to set himself up as the Serbs’ best guarantee against foreign aggression. The rapporteur now cites a number of reasons for taking action outside one’s own territory, one being justifiable outrage at ethnic conflicts outside the Union. It is positive that we are dealing with this by using mediation techniques, producing models for administrative solutions and delivering humanitarian aid to those who have felt constrained to move as a result of this conflict. It is no good trying to impose a solution from outside using military methods, because it does not tackle the root cause of the conflict or change public opinion. The fear that energy supplies will not be made available for the Member States could never be a valid reason for unilateral intervention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not consider that an arms build-up, with the resultant increased military expenditure, is the answer to the challenges faced by Europe in 2001 and beyond. Now, in the decade following the upheavals in the East, we think that, with these reports, ‘the European peace project’ is sending an unhelpful signal to the applicant States. Secondly, the reports set the stage for a split with the non-aligned countries which, it is proposed, would be involved through their financing of the common European security and defence policy. The talk about being ‘united in diversity’ rings hollow, especially for the non-aligned Member States, if only parts of the content of the reports are put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a new form of territorial defence, which would come under the aegis of a Vice-President of the Commission it has also been proposed, is a point that we cannot support either. A break of that kind with NATO, only to see a new partitioning of Europe, is far from the enigmatic words spoken following the fall of the Berlin Wall. What we definitely do not need is the development of further military structures. However, it would be to the EU’s credit if the priorities of the Petersberg tasks were turned around and the focus placed upon model solutions of a civil and humanitarian nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report certainly has the advantage that it exists. However, I am not very comfortable with some of the wording in it. In my own country of Luxembourg, we are in the normal situation of making no distinction between manual workers, whether they work in industry, in households or anywhere else.</p>
<p class="contents">They are entitled to a statutory minimum wage and to membership of the health, accident and pensions insurance schemes. In short, there is no discrimination against them in relation to other employees. That, of course, almost sounds like a perfect world when I read all the proposals for possible exceptional arrangements that are listed in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no reason, for example, why the working conditions of domestic staff should be in any way untypical.</p>
<p class="contents">It is actually incredible that, in the twenty-first century, we should still be recommending that Member States guarantee the right of domestic staff to social security cover and adequate pensions. I am equally astonished by the demand that prices and costs in respect of domestic work be adjusted at national level to take account of individuals' financial resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for simplification of administrative formalities for employers, on the other hand, makes good sense.</p>
<p class="contents">In Luxembourg, we decided to carry out this type of simplification within the framework of the national employment plan. It works very well and is a model which I, in all modesty, would recommend.</p>
<p class="contents">The demand that domestic services be made tax-deductible to reduce the difference in cost between employing undeclared and declared workers is also a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">National governments should be magnanimous here, so as to ensure that employees and employers have an incentive to stop offering and engaging in illicit work.</p>
<p class="contents">May I also warn against granting migrant women work permits for domestic work. The gangs who smuggle people into our countries would be delighted and would naturally ensure that all the women they intended to bring into EU countries illegally were declared as domestic staff.</p>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur feels that a legal framework is required at European level that makes it possible for persons providing domestic services to be covered by employment protection legislation. Smet proposes, amongst other things, that a European definition of domestic work be introduced. In addition, the rapporteur requires the Member States to introduce tax allowances for domestic services so that the differences between the costs of “black” and “white” labour are reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">There is great demand for domestic help. However, the high taxation rate both in Sweden and in other EU countries prevents supply and demand from intersecting in the non-shadow economy. Income taxes, social security contributions and VAT drive up the hourly rate to levels that almost no household with a normal income is prepared to pay. More or less all domestic work that is carried out against payment is currently carried out in the black economy. Many women and young people work in this market. They have no rights, no insurance, no pension credits, no sick pay and no security. Too many young people are at risk of their first contact with the labour market being a job in the black economy. It is highly unfortunate that unreasonable tax rules are forcing people into the black economy in this way.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore agree with the rapporteur that it is important for the differences between the costs of ‘black’ and ‘white’ labour to be reduced and feel that the Member States should introduce a tax reduction on domestic services. This will allow the people who carry out domestic services to be covered by insurance, pension schemes, sick pay and security. However, we are against the introduction of a legal framework containing detailed rules at European level for domestic help. These matters should be dealt with at national, regional or local level, and consequently we are voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This especially applies to work performed by poor women in the households of the rich. That kind of work is usually organised on an informal basis, with no trade union representation, works council, premium payment or collective labour agreement. The employee has little or no protection and in many cases is largely dependent on the discretion of the employer. The very worst situation is when the women concerned also come from distant countries, having taken the work on out of desperation because they have no other way of continuing to provide for themselves. It is an occupational group that is often forgotten in a world still heavily dominated by men. Everyone is aware that the situation is open to abuse, but many people are inclined to seriously underestimate the scale of this abuse and the impact on those concerned. This own-initiative report is a useful product of the Commission’s fight for women’s rights and equal opportunities. The talks held with interested organisations and the itemisation of the problems that exist remind me of investigative reports on the position of workers over a century ago. Although my group considers the report to be too limited and the conclusions too modest, they will help us to start moving in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have given their pension contributions to the various national governments, which have quickly made them vanish like clever magicians. I should not want President Prodi too, like a clever magician, like a modern European Houdini, to succeed in making the funds at the disposal of all European citizens vanish.

This resignation, the outcome of a long process of deterioration, must not however make us forget that the ‘Delors Commission’ bore heavier responsibilities than its successor.</p>
<p class="contents">This resignation, imposed by the elected representatives of the nations of Europe, revealed the pressing need for far-reaching reform of working methods within the various Directorates-General of the Commission, and of decision-making procedures and structures, in order to improve the utilisation of the available resources in the management of Community resources and policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, while taking note of the serious infringements of the past, will not criticise the Commission and its reform out of hand. It is clear, however, that the exercise it is engaged in must seek primarily to restore the widely and legitimately shattered confidence of public opinion in the European institutions. This must come about, as the report says ‘by means of a significant improvement in performance and efficiency’, but also by means of more transparent practices.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission reform will be judged on actual evidence, hence the need for regular follow-up reports, which the European Commission will present throughout the programme, and the importance of the overall report, which is expected in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the ABB is concerned, on the basis of whose activities the budget is established, we recall that it presupposes an amendment of Article 19 of the Financial Regulation, which establishes the distinction between Part A (administrative appropriations) and Part B (operating appropriations). As a result, the Commission must ensure that it does not call into question Parliament’s powers with respect to the allocation of resources. The French delegation will naturally oppose the introduction of the codecision procedure in amending the Financial Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">By imposing the dismantling of the Technical Assistance Offices with a view to increasing the Commission’s accountability for programme implementation, this House wishes to point out that ‘only tasks not requiring public authority intervention might be outsourced to the private sector, and this in the form of one-off contracts’.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards commitology, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group denounces the report’s federalist vision, which claims that Member States, through management and regulatory committees, encroach on the Commission’s independence as regards management, and reproaches Member States ‘through those committees, of promoting national interests which are sometimes at odds with those of the Community’. The rapporteur even takes the view that ‘reforming the Commission must provide an opportunity to restrict their intervention solely to areas where no expenditure is involved’.</p>
<p class="contents">The management of Community policies must reflect the pragmatic agreements entered into between the countries of the European Union. For our part, we take the view that, especially because of the widespread lack of bureaucratic transparency which prevails and the scandals and inefficiencies of a still recent past, Member States must be more than ever involved in the decision-making process. The willingness shown by the rapporteur to eliminate their influence is, in this respect, edifying!</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposals, in the context of its reform, raise a number of questions as regards human resources. I will cite but one: the early retirement measure concerning some 600 staff, which is 3% of the total staff employed. The Commission services tell us that this would not have any significant impact on the budget. Our group hopes this is the case, but this is not a sufficient condition and it is necessary to ensure, in particular, that the statutory provisions are respected and that these measures do not obscure the other priorities of the reform and do not give rise to a political settling of scores.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, moreover, common knowledge that certain nationalities are manifestly over-represented in the junior grades of categories C and D, for the undisclosed budgetary reason that the staff concerned would not benefit from the 16% expatriation allowance!</p>
<p class="contents">These discriminatory practices are unacceptable. The fact is that unemployment exists in all our countries and the Commission would be well advised to take advantage of future procedures for early retirement and for the recruitment of hundreds of new civil servants to start putting its house in order. By the same token, nepotism and lack of transparency must be eradicated from the Commission services, especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group forcefully recalls that the citizens of the European Union expect more than ever that reform measures and staff recruitment must take account of the diversity of opinions and convictions which are expressed in our countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This resignation revealed the need for an in-depth reform of the structures, procedures and working methods within the Commission services in order to ensure optimum use of resources in the management of Community policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals contained in the White Paper, which are to a large extent drawn from the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts, should make it possible for the Commission to equip itself with the optimum organisational structure and operating methods so as to fulfil to the best of its ability the tasks assigned to it by the Treaties, without, however, encouraging it to exceed the limits of its prerogatives as defined in the Treaty, which has all too often been the case in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is there any doubt, by virtue of the powers and competences conferred upon it by the Treaty, that Parliament is required to fully exercise its powers of scrutiny with regard to the Commission, particularly as regards transparency and the implementation of the Community budget. The fact is that the citizens of our 15 nations, who elect their representatives, would not understand if this were not the case, because it is their money which is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite clearly, the effectiveness of the reform proposed in the White Paper will be judged by its results in terms of the use made of financial and human resources, particularly by the application of the relevant financial provisions being effectively monitored with appropriate supervisory and sanction mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards standards of behaviour in public life, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group welcomes the establishment of a set of codes of conduct for the Commission (code of conduct for Commissioners, code of conduct governing relations between Commissioners and departments and code of good administrative behaviour for relations with the public) and reiterates its view that these texts should have a legal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Delays in the payment of sums due by the Commission often appear unjustified. It is important therefore that this situation is remedied as quickly a possible by speeding up payment of the sums due, lest the smooth running of all the European institutions be damaged. The fact is that Community policies are reflected in moral and financial commitments to our citizens and third-country nationals. It is therefore necessary to ensure that these commitments are respected much more closely than they have been in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as human resources are concerned, the quality of employees and greater transparency in staffing policy in general must become the strong points of the new administrative reform. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group welcomes in principle the response represented by the Commission White Paper to the appeal made by the European Parliament inviting it to carry out far-reaching reform of its human resources policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, however, forcefully recalls that, as regards staff recruitment, the Commission reform must take account of the diversity of opinions and beliefs which are expressed in our countries regarding Europe, its past and its future. The citizens of our respective countries would not understand if this were not the case. By the same token, lack of transparency and nepotism must be eradicated from recruitment, especially as regards recruitment for temporary posts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union for a Europe of Nations Group does not at this stage wish to express any opposition to the early retirement of hundreds of officers from the Commission services provided, however, that the statutory provisions are respected, that the early retirement measures do not hinder the priorities of the reform, that these retirements have a neutral impact on the budget, that they are implemented in the interest of the service and under volunteer termination of service and do not give rise to a political settling of scores.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I feel bound to say that we expect this reform, which is essential for the future, to introduce greater discipline and greater transparency into the day-to-day running of the Commission, but it must also lead to a greater sense of accountability on its part, within the strict framework of the competences that have been devolved to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would still like to give some kind of explanation though because illness prevented me from taking part in the previous round of discussions in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not vote in favour because we feel that all too often the development cooperation within the Commission is still regarded as a stopgap measure. When I read in the Commission documents that integration into the globalised world is the name of the game for poor countries, then I am afraid we overlook the fact that we, i.e. the western economies, are the ones pushing globalisation, and that we are therefore not actually seriously doing anything about what we regard as our number one priority, i.e. fighting poverty, because we often cause the very poverty we then seek to fight.</p>
<p class="contents">I did not vote against this report because it embraces a number of worthwhile issues and because I want a robust line to be taken. I advocate maintaining Community development cooperation at EU level but I am afraid that if the reforms do not go well, it will add grist to the mill of those who actually want to renationalise all the aid programmes. As far as I am concerned, Parliament has missed its chance to make a serious contribution to the analysis of the errors, and we should also have spent more time on a clear analysis of the remedies proposed by the Commission. I regret this and that is why we abstained from the vote as a group, because we feel that the NGOs have done badly out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to close with a procedural motion. I have now heard all the judgments on the voting of my fellow Members on all kinds of subjects imaginable and that is why I have taken the liberty of ignoring your rap on the knuckles to some extent, because I thought it is going a little over the top to stay here especially to have your say on everything once again, even though we all have our thoughts on these things of course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
