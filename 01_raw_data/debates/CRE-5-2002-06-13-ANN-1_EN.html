<p>European enterprises face an ever increasing volume of liability rules in vastly different areas (environmental liability, product liability, etc.). The host of national and Community legal provisions under which an entrepreneur can be held liable for his business activities are a burden for European SMEs, in particular, because they are so numerous as to cause confusion and so complex in terms of what they regulate and in many instances, because of the financial consequences they involve, they are even a threat to a firm's existence.</p>
<p>Is the Commission thinking of including a schedule of the business liability rules which exist in the 15 Member States and in Community law in the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship decided on at the Barcelona summit?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At Lisbon, the Community set itself the clear goal of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world. To achieve this goal, the Community also has to have the will and the means.</p>
<p>Economic analysis and surveys seem to indicate a lack of dynamism in Europe and it is generally felt that there is scope for enhancing entrepreneurial activity, particularly if the Community is to exploit fully the opportunities arising in the knowledge economy. The Community must allow entrepreneurship to play its full part in delivering the shared objectives.</p>
<p>Hence the significance of the Green Paper on Entrepreneurship, which must look at the whole range of issues that has to be addressed.</p>
<p>The Barcelona Council (March 2002) has noted that the Commission will submit the Green Paper before the 2003 Spring European Council.</p>
<p>The approach that is envisaged is that a broad debate should be launched on the significance of entrepreneurship, on how to promote entrepreneurial drive and how to achieve the right balance between entrepreneurship policy and other policy considerations.</p>
<p>The Lisbon conclusions were based on the idea that economic performance, social cohesion and sustainable development mutually reinforce one-another.</p>
<p>In this context, it will certainly be necessary to face the issue of regulatory and other restrictions on entrepreneurial activity. It will be necessary to stimulate debate about the complementarity between the objectives of providing an encouraging environment for entrepreneurs, to enable them to create growth and viable jobs and the objectives of social cohesion and sustainable development (NB. as stated in Lisbon, economic performance and social cohesion do not oppose each other, but rather go hand in hand!).</p>
<p>In referring to these issues, it is important to bear in mind the parallel debates on Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainable Development, and the fact that many businesses recognise the need to integrate ethical, social and environmental considerations into their strategy and daily operations. They do so as a way of better managing risks, improving their performance and ensuring their long-term sustainability.</p>
<p>The particular issues concerning environmental liability, product liability, etc raised by the Honourable Member, are certainly instances of a more general regulatory issue that arises from both Community and Member State legislation. There may indeed be reference in the Green Paper to such specific concerns, by way of focusing attention. However, it does not look likely at this stage that the Green Paper will want to highlight the question of regulations concerning liability, to the exclusion of other regulatory questions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0409"></a>

<p>The development of the trans-European rail network features in the political guidelines proposed by the White Paper on European transport policy. Progress updates are given on a regular basis in the report on the implementation of Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European network which were adopted in 1996.</p>
<p>As part of a review of the above-mentioned guidelines, the Commission proposed, last year, to include in the list of specific projects the East European combined transport/high speed train link (Stuttgart-Munich-Salzburg/Linz-Vienna), which will be carried out in phases until its completion in 2012.</p>
<p>Parliament adopted this proposal at first reading on 30 May.</p>
<p>In addition, since 1996, one of the specific projects of the trans-European network is the high-speed train east, between Paris and Strasbourg, which is due to enter into service around 2007.

<p>In addition, work on rail interoperability has recently started with regard to technical interoperability specifications for high speed links and is due to begin on conventional rail. Aspects of importance to persons of reduced mobility will be examined and discussed as part of this work.</p>
<p>In any case, the Commission is ensuring that all the work carried out is consistent and intends to involve all the organisations affected by these concerns, through individual consultations and more extensive public hearings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0442"></a>

<p>The Commission sent out a letter last year, encouraging airlines to inform their passengers on the possible risks of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) during long flights, and on precautionary measures to take, for example leg exercises during travel and it plans to contact the airline associations shortly, to find out which initiatives have been taken so far.</p>
<p>As for adequate legroom for passengers, it should be noted that the distance between seats in aircraft cabins is regulated for safety reasons, in particular to allow evacuations during emergencies. Medical opinion seems to indicate that the real problem concerns immobility. Both passengers from economy and first class can be vulnerable, even though more legroom is available in first class. The leg exercises, proposed by doctors, can be carried out in the legroom presently available in aircraft.</p>
<p>In order to find a clearer answer to the question of how far DVT is linked to air transport, the Commission will co-finance a study on DVT. This study will be carried out by experts, under the auspices of the World Health Organisation. The study aims to measure the strength of the link between air transport and DVT, and the importance of other, patient-related factors, like age, weight and medical condition. It will also examine the effects of cabin conditions, like low air pressure and levels of oxygen.</p>
<p>As the strength of this link is not known, it is not possible for the Member States or the World Health Organisation to collect statistics at this stage. The above mentioned epidemiological study will certainly facilitate the design and collection of statistics, once the results are known.</p>
<p>The Parliament will be kept duly informed of the results of this study.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Over the last months, the public debate in Lithuania on the early closure of the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (of an RBMK type similar to the reactors at the Chernobyl NPP, but with improved safety features) has been particularly intense. The Commission is encouraged that this debate will lead to Lithuania taking its decision in the near future. The Ignalina NPP is the only nuclear power plant with power reactors of the RBMK type in candidate countries. The Union expects Unit 2 to close by 2009, at the latest. On 14 May 2002, the Lithuanian Parliament passed a resolution, giving the Government a mandate to negotiate the terms for the closure of Unit 2 with the Member States of the Union. A clear commitment of Lithuania to close down Unit 2 by 2009 at the latest will be needed for the closure of the chapter Energy in the accession negotiations.</p>
<p>Within the framework of its regular dialogue with Lithuania, the Commission has constantly highlighted the expectation of the Union with regard to the closure date. Since 1999, the Commission has enhanced this dialogue through a joint Community-Lithuanian Working Group on Energy. Members of the Commission have persistently pursued the said closure date during their bilateral meetings with Lithuanian interlocutors.</p>
<p>Also since 1999, the Commission has committed Community funding from the PHARE financial instrument to support Lithuania, Bulgaria and Slovakia in their decommissioning efforts regarding the respective power reactors subject to early closure. With regard to Lithuania, in view of the burden of decommissioning that is not commensurate with the size and economic strength of the country, and acknowledging that decommissioning will last for decades the Commission furthermore proposed, earlier in 2002, to the Member States to continue its assistance as an act of Union solidarity with Lithuania also after accession.</p>
<p>In its information note of October 2001 to the Gent European Council meeting on a mid-term review of the implementation of the enlargement strategy, the Commission stated that the closure commitments regarding Ignalina, Bohunice V1 and certain units of Kozloduy must be respected and therefore duly included in the Accession Treaties.</p>
<p>With regard to Bulgaria, according to an Understanding reached in 1999, the Commission expects Bulgaria’s decision on the closure dates of Units 3 and 4 at the Kozloduy NPP by the end of this year, and that the firm date for final closure of units 3 and 4 will be no later than 2006. The Commission is already closely monitoring the preparation for final shut down of Units 1 and 2 by the end of this year, following the schedule that Bulgaria agreed with the Commission.</p>
<p>The Commission has no reason to assume that Lithuania, Slovakia or Bulgaria will not close the reactor units in time, once all closure dates will have been decided. The Commission is also engaged, together with the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) as the manager of the three International Decommissioning Support Funds through which the bulk of Community-funded support to decommissioning measures in the three respective candidate countries is delivered, in pursuing that the necessary decommissioning projects are designed and implemented without undue delay. The Commission both chairs the Assemblies of Contributors to these three Funds as well as represents the Community as the largest single Contributor.</p>
<p>Thus, the Commission is continually engaged in a variety of actions to ensure the timely closure of certain reactor types that the Honourable Member has summarised as “high-risk”.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0362"></a>

<p>Any complaint that a conviction was “unjust” would have to be made to that court. However, before any action can be brought before the European Court of Human Rights, domestic remedies must first be exhausted.</p>
<p>Consequently, the reply to this question must be that the planespotter tourists must first of all appeal against their convictions in the Greek Court of Criminal Appeals.

<p>If the appeal is unsuccessful, an application can be made to the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
<p>The facts of this case and in particular the Greek provisions on the crime of espionage fall outside the scope of Community law. Consequently, the Commission is not able to offer any assistance to the planespotters since there is no legal basis for an intervention on the part of the Commission.

<p>The Commission has defined the preservation of the European agricultural model as one of the core elements of its Agenda 2000 reform proposal. This requires both a clearer recognition and a more determined defence, both internally and externally, of the multifunctional role of agriculture in European society: it needs to be stressed that agriculture not only plays an economic role but also makes a social and an environmental contribution.</p>
<p>To the above end, the Commission obtained from the budgetary authority a financial framework enabling the above objective to be met. It is clear from the first two years of implementation of the Agenda 2000 reform that attainment of the objective is feasible within that financial framework.</p>
<p>The Commission's recent proposal concerning the agricultural dimension of enlargement was based on the principle that the acquis communautaire should be applied. It is compatible with the existing financial perspective (which will, in any case, need to be adjusted in the wake of enlargement).</p>
<p>As regards the mid-term review shortly to be submitted to the Council and Parliament, the Commission will be guided by the same objectives. There is no question of the CAP being undermined.</p>
<p>From a longer-term perspective, the Commission will of course strive for the continuous improvement of the instruments of the CAP (entailing their simplification, as well as the further development of subsidiarity, as is already the case for the utilisation of the national envelopes for the COMs and the rural development measures), and it will, at the same time, continue to work for the preservation of the CAP's basic principles.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0372"></a>

Does the Commission not consider that the issue of Georgia’s accession to the EU should no longer be evaded, and that therefore, without further delay, Georgia should be included in the list of candidate countries, on the understanding that its membership will depend on its ability to integrate the acquis communautaire into its national legislation?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Georgia entered into force in July 1999. The Union supports Georgia's aspiration to integrate further into European models and structures. Since independence in 1991, the Union has provided technical assistance of some EUR 350 million to support Georgia’s transition. For example, the Union Food Security Programme covers about 65% of budget of Ministry of Agriculture, a sector accounting for 40% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and 60% of labour force.</p>
<p>However, the country faces very severe difficulties:</p>
<p>Since 1991, one million people have left the country;</p>
<p>GDP per capita has decreased by 70%;</p>
<p>60% of the population is poor;</p>
<p>Two unresolved internal conflicts have generated nearly 300 000 internally displaced persons;</p>
<p>Corruption (including vested interests in maintaining status quo on conflicts) is rampant;</p>
<p>Announced reforms in the electoral code, local self-government were not adopted following the Presidential elections in 2000;</p>
<p>Religious minorities are victims of aggressions which the authorities have difficulty in punishing.</p>
<p>All of this, as well as the lack of implementation of existing legislation, hamper progress and limit the impact of Union assistance. Commitments undertaken by Georgia in October 2000 to adopt a national programme for PCA implementation have not yet materialised. Respect for the rule of law in trade and business (customs, taxes) is a key concern. Foreign investments are almost non existent. The Union reviews all these issues during the regular annual meetings. Furthermore, we want to be stricter in ensuring Georgia fulfils all conditions linked to our assistance.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Commission considers that it cannot envisage any further step at this stage other than to pursue full implementation of PCA. This depends mostly on political, social and economic reforms, as well as on resolution of two internal conflicts on which the lead must come from Georgia itself. The Georgian authorities who have not requested Union membership or candidate status are very well aware of the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0374"></a>

This end-user driven approach will trigger research on the development of new, safer, fully traceable, seafood products and feeds.

<p>In the support it gives to consumer organisations under the current financial legal basis for Community activities in favour of consumers the Commission works at two levels<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>:</p>
<p>-first, the Commission provides financial support for the activities of European consumer organisations of which national consumer organisations are members. There is no direct core funding allocated to national consumer organisations;</p>
<p>-second, the Commission provides financial support for specific projects to promote the interests of consumers in the Member States. These projects can be described as follows:</p>
<p>The Commission develops education and capacity building measures, which are most helpful to weaker national consumer organisations, including organisations from Ireland.</p>
<p>As presented in the new Consumer Policy Strategy<a href="#defann_15_2" name="refann_15_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission will develop an on-line inter-active project to improve information and education for consumers. This website is designed for consumer associations and other multipliers to train their staff in specific aspects of cross-border transactions such as financial services. To this end, the Commission will make full use of best practices developed by Member States and consumer organisations.</p>
<p>The Commission is also launching a training project to strengthen the capacity of consumer organisations. The Commission will organise, from 2002 to 2004, training actions for staff members from all consumer organisations - including Irish consumer organisations - in 3 areas: management, public relations and lobbying, as well as Union consumer law.</p>
<p>There are also specific programmes to which national consumer organisations can apply provided they meet certain criteria.</p>
<p>Every year, the Commission publishes call for projects and gives financial support to specific transnational education projects. Several education projects have been co-ordinated by Irish consumer organisations in the past.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile mentioning the annual European Young Consumer Competition, organised since 1993, in which more than 1200 schools participate. Fifty-six Irish schools participated in this project in 2001.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Under the Edinburgh decision Denmark does not participate in supranational EU decisions in the area of justice and home affairs, and a number of parallel agreements have therefore been concluded with Denmark over the years, particularly in the field of police cooperation.</p>
<p>However, it was reported on 30 April that in future the Commission did not wish to enter into similar arrangements which could ensure coordination in the area of civil law, e.g. as regards the application of the insolvency regulation or the rules on decisions in custody cases, etc.</p>
<p>According to the newspaper ‘Politiken’, the Commission intended this alleged refusal to be a ‘pedagogical signal’ to the Danish government.</p>
<p>Can the Commission confirm or refute these rumours and indicate the objective grounds on which it would refuse, contrary to past practice, to conclude parallel agreements with Denmark in fields where the Danish government should wish to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters that the honourable Member has raised in his oral question are governed by Title IV of the Treaty establishing the European Community. However, the Protocol on the position of Denmark, annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, stipulates that Denmark shall not take part in the adoption of measures governed by Title IV of the Treaty. Furthermore, none of the provisions of Title IV and no measure adopted pursuant to that Title shall be binding upon or applicable in Denmark.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, in certain specific cases, the non-participation of Denmark in measures under Title IV of the EC Treaty risks jeopardising the homogeneity, coherence and legal certainty of Community rules and/or upsetting the balance between the mutual obligations and responsibilities arising from the commitments made by all the Member States, including Denmark, prior to the communitarisation of the areas in question.</p>
<p>Given these risks, the Commission believed that the Community should seek solutions legally compatible with primary Community legislation which will enable Denmark to ‘take part’ – on an exceptional basis and as a temporary solution – in certain instruments based on Title IV of the EC Treaty, by concluding agreements between the Community and Denmark.</p>
<p>With regard to legal cooperation in civil matters, the Commission perceives only two measures that meet these criteria:</p>
<p>- Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (‘Brussels I’)<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which, following the Treaty of Amsterdam, communitarised the Brussels Convention of 27 September 1968. Denmark is, of course, party to the Brussels Convention;</p>
<p>- Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000 of 29 May 2000 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters, by which the Council communitarised a convention of 26 May 1997 concluded within the framework of Title VI of the Treaty on European Union (but which has never entered into force). The ‘Brussels I’ regulation explicitly refers to the provisions of the Regulation on the transmission of documents for its application.</p>
<p>This solution was devised by the Commission, observing the following principles:</p>
<p> In accordance with its Protocol, Denmark does not have a case-by-case opt-in facility as regards the measures based on Title IV of the EC Treaty which do not represent an extension of the Schengen acquis. The restrictive wording of Article 5 of the Protocol relating solely to the measures ‘to build upon the Schengen acquis’ does not allow, under any circumstances, its application to be extended to other measures under Title IV of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p> At any time, Denmark may, in accordance with its constitutional requirements, inform the other Member States that it no longer wishes to avail itself of all or part of this Protocol. In that event, Denmark will apply in full all relevant measures then in force that have been adopted within the framework of the Union (Article 7 of the Protocol).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the Commission’s opinion, the long-term objective must be Denmark’s full participation in the measures based on Title IV of the EC within the institutional framework of the Community, once Denmark has fulfilled the necessary constitutional requirements to this end.</p>
<p> It follows that any mechanism enabling Denmark to participate in all or a significant number of the measures based on Title IV of the EC Treaty, such as the conclusion of agreements on the instruments mentioned by the honourable Member and adopted in accordance with Article 65 of the Treaty in the area of family law or insolvency, where this participation did not take place within the institutional framework of the Community, would be incompatible with the spirit of the Protocol on the position of Denmark. It would certainly make it less in Denmark’s interest to renounce its Protocol and the answer to the fundamental problem raised by the honourable Member must, ultimately, be that it should renounce the Protocol.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considered, when adopting its decision of 30 April 2002, that the conclusion of parallel agreements with Denmark in the area of judicial cooperation in civil matters can only be envisaged in the two exceptional cases set out above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As East Timor is to celebrate its independence on 20 May it appears that many East Timorese living in Indonesia are concerned about returning to their homeland for security reasons. Furthermore, the same security forces that are allegedly responsible for crimes against humanity and several violations of human rights in East Timor are now operating in Aceh and West Papua. Many human rights abuses have been identified by local NGOs and these in turn have been threatened by militia.</p>
<p>As the Commission is actively involved in promoting development projects in Indonesia, I would like to know what it proposes to do to address these very serious and consistent human rights breaches. Would it suspend funding or condition the allocation of funding to the thorough respect of human rights? Would the Commission send an inspection team to ensure that human rights are respected and that the militia are disbanded?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is concerned by the security situation and human rights abuses within Indonesia and continues to monitor the situation closely, participating in appropriate Union demarches to the Indonesian authorities.</p>
<p>The situation is calm in the newly independent Democratic Republic of East Timor. Independence on 20 May was attended by the President of Indonesia Mrs. Megawati Soekarnoputri who was welcomed by President Xanana Gusmao of East Timor.</p>
<p>Of the 250 000 refugees in West Timor in 1999, approximately 30 000 East Timorese still remain in Indonesia and most of them reportedly want to stay there. The Commission has provided EUR 6 million through United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to assist repatriation of refugees from West to East Timor, including a contribution to the Reception, Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which has been operating in East Timor since January 2002 to facilitate re-entry of refugees and resolution of post-conflict tensions. The Union continues to encourage Indonesia to proceed with the Ad Hoc Human Rights Tribunal investigating past human rights abuses in East Timor.</p>
<p>The situation in Aceh has preoccupied the Commission for some time now. Union Heads of Mission visited the region in October 2001. The Commission has therefore welcomed the Joint Statement issued on 10 May by the Indonesian Government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), following two days of consultations in Geneva. This Statement recognised the Special Autonomy Law as the starting point for further negotiations in an all-inclusive dialogue and confirmed the intention of both parties to work on an agreement for the cessation of hostilities. It is our view that full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be key to a durable resolution of the present situation.</p>
<p>Papua has equally been a matter of continued concern. The Union has condemned the kidnapping and murder of Theys Eluay in November 2001 and called on the Government of Indonesia to ensure a full investigation of this dreadful incident and bring its perpetrators to justice. Union Heads of Mission in Jakarta also visited Papua in February 2002. In the case of Papua, too, it is clear that full implementation of the special autonomy legislation will be key to the resolution of the current situation.</p>
<p>The Commission has included in its Country Strategy Paper for Indonesia, now in the final stages of preparation, particular emphasis on institutional capacity building, good governance and rule of law, as well as conflict prevention. Financial support has already been committed to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)-managed Partnership for Governance Reform, and Technical Assistance has been provided to the Attorney General’s Office. Provision has been made in the draft National Indicative Programme, 2002-2004, for a specific programme to support implementation of the Government’s policy for decentralisation in Indonesia and to promote good governance at the local government level. In addition, Indonesia is one of 29 focus countries of the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we have also taken steps to support conflict resolution more directly. Following discussions between the Commissioner in charge of External relations and the Indonesian Foreign Minister last November, and in the context of the Commission’s Rapid Reaction Mechanism, an independent mission on conflict prevention in Indonesia visited the Moluccas, Sulawesi and Papua in February 2002. (A visit to Aceh was not possible at that time because of security conditions.) The expert mission met a wide range of Central and Local Government representatives, as well as Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in these areas. On the basis of the mission’s report, a package of projects is now in preparation for the Moluccas and Papua. The projects in Papua will support both the regional authorities and civil society.</p>
<p>All of these measures are consistent with the Commission’s support for the Union’s stated position, which firmly supports the territorial integrity of Indonesia, while encouraging the Government to make urgent efforts to address and resolve peacefully Indonesia’s internal conflicts, whether separatist or sectarian in character. The Commission will continue to follow this approach and to provide all possible support for constructive action to deal with these very difficult situations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0388"></a>

<p>Respect of human rights, including non-discrimination of homosexuals, is a key element of the political accession criteria laid down by the European Council at Copenhagen in 1993. This was confirmed by the Commissioner in charge of Enlargement, speaking in the Parliament on 4 September 2001.</p>
<p>Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the Community provides a basis for action to combat discrimination on a number of grounds, including sexual orientation. Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation shall be prohibited.</p>
<p>The 2001 Regular Reports published in November 2001 provided an assessment of the progress made by candidate countries in this respect and referred to anti-homosexual legislation in particular in the field of criminal law in a number of candidate countries.</p>
<p>The Report noted that Romania decriminalised homosexuality in June 2001 by repealing Article 200 of the Penal Code. This was confirmed by the Romanian Parliament at the end of 2001.</p>
<p>In some candidate countries, the existing criminal law still provides for different ages of consent for heterosexual versus homosexual relations, which is however also the case in some Member States.</p>
<p>Candidate countries are required to transpose Council Directive 2000/78/EC<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation by the time of accession to the Union. This Directive prohibits direct and indirect discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and a number of other grounds.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to monitor closely and assess developments in this area, in particular in the context of preparation of the 2002 Regular Reports. In its contacts with candidate countries, the Commission highlights, where appropriate, the importance to remove any kind of discrimination in legislation or in practice.</p>
<p>The Commission stresses that compliance with the Political Criteria is the essential precondition for opening of negotiations with any candidate country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Fishmeal is, in the main, produced from fish for which there is no market for human consumption and for which Community fishing is restricted in order to limit its impact on the marine environment. However, as indicated in its proposal to reform the common fisheries policy, the Commission will give particular attention to this area and will request the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to carry out an evaluation of the impact of industrial fishing on marine eco-systems.</p>
<p>Council Decision 2000/766/EC of 4 December 2000<a href="#defann_20_2" name="refann_20_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> banned the use of processed animal protein (PAP) in the feed of animals intended for use in the production of foodstuffs. The use of fishmeal in feedingstuffs for non-ruminants is still permitted, however, under certain conditions.</p>
<p>In organic farming, where synthetic nutritional supplements are banned, the practice of not using fishmeal has caused problems of well-being in farmed poultry, giving rise to a deficiency in these animals of certain essential amino acids such as methionine, lysine and threonine.</p>
<p>In March 2001, the Commission presented an analysis<a href="#defann_20_3" name="refann_20_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> of the consequences of the ban on PAP, and more generally of the consequences of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) on supply and demand relating to plant proteins. Following the ban on mammalian meal for ruminants in 1994, protein from fish- or animal meal represented, in 1999, only 2.4% of crude protein used for feedingstuffs, and that was mainly for pigs and poultry. Most of the protein was obtained from meat-and-bonemeal.</p>
<p>Plant products containing proteins, such as oilseeds and cereals, in particular, are widely available on the markets, and there has not been a significant or sustained increase in their price following the ban on PAP.</p>
<p>Replacing fishmeal with plant proteins or synthetic or hydrolysed amino acids does not pose any major technical or economic problem for traditional livestock farming.</p>
<p>In terms of organic farming, some problems have been noted and zootechnical solutions are currently being examined for these.</p>
<p>For fish farms, however, there are still major problems, given that the majority of species of farmed fish require certain nutritional substances which are not found in fishmeal. There is currently no possibility, therefore, of an effective substitute for fishmeal in aquaculture.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission, which has recently received reports that include the specific cases referred to in the question of the Honourable member, remains concerned by the human rights situation in Iran and Pakistan and views the practice of inhuman punishment in these countries, such as stoning, as particularly disturbing.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the comprehensive dialogue between the Union and Iran, questions regarding human rights, including stoning, are consistently raised by the Union side.</p>
<p>As to the draft negotiating mandate submitted by the Commission to the Council for a Trade and Cooperation Agreement with Iran, with which no contractual relations have yet been established, the Commission can confirm that a clause on human rights is intended to be included in the future agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission is actively participating in joint Union efforts to address human rights issues in Pakistan. The new Community-Pakistan Cooperation Agreement, which contains a clause on human rights and democratic principles, will offer, once it has entered into force, the possibility to re-establish the full cooperation dialogue with Pakistan, including on human rights issues.</p>
<p>The Union has consistently opposed the imposition of the death penalty and has set out its policy in the Guidelines to Union policy towards third countries on the death penalty. These guidelines also underline that those States which persist in applying the penalty must do so in a manner which inflicts the minimum possible suffering. Clearly, the practice of stoning would not conform to that condition. The Union also pushes for moratoria pending abolition.</p>
<p>In addition to raising the issue of the death penalty in contacts with States which retain it, the Union has also taken a strong lead in international fora. The Union tables the annual resolutions on the death penalty at both the United Nations (UN) Commission on Human Rights and at the Third Committee of the UN General Assembly. It also draws attention to the application of the penalty in particular countries.</p>
<p>The Council Working Group (COHOM) will take stock of recent Union efforts against the death penalty in both Africa and Asia at its meeting on 20th June.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0392"></a>

<p>During a recent study trip to Murmansk in north-west Russia, I was able to note that nothing had been done to clean up and dispose of nuclear waste from nuclear submarines and ice-breakers since my last visit two years ago. More scrapped submarines than previously, with nuclear fuel still on board, are laid up in the Murmansk region. The clean-up of the Lepse, a vessel used for transporting nuclear waste, which is partly EU-funded under an agreement signed in 2000, has not yet begun since Russia has failed to approve the MNEPR agreement, which regulates matters concerning responsibility.</p>
<p>Can the Commission step up the pressure on the Russian Government in Moscow to take responsibility for the nuclear waste and to sign the MNEPR agreement?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission is very much aware of the seriousness of the nuclear waste situation in North-West (NW) Russia, and of the importance of working together with the Russian authorities to address this. The task is not an easy one, in part because most nuclear sites in the regions still come under the control of the military. Moreover, nuclear safety or clean-up projects are very complex and expensive activities, which must be carried out in a stable and well-defined legal framework which currently remains to be completed.</p>
<p>Significant progress is being made in the context of the Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership (NDEP) Support Fund, which the Commission hopes will soon start its operations with the full political and financial involvement of the Russian Federation. The Commission has already indicated its willingness to contribute EUR 50 million to the Fund, and a pledging conference bringing together all potential contributors will be held in Brussels in July.</p>
<p>In this context, the Multilateral Nuclear Environmental Programme in the Russian Federation (MNEPR) will make an important contribution to improving the legal framework in which some donors can operate (though Tacis, for example, is already covered by a separate agreement). Negotiations on the text of the MNEPR agreement had made considerable progress last year, when the Commission and other Western donors had agreed with the Russian authorities on a compromise text. More recently, however, it seems that the different Russian authorities concerned have not been able to confirm their agreement on this text, whose signature has therefore been delayed.</p>
<p>This is a matter to which the Commission and other Western donors attach great importance, and the topic has been raised at a number of meetings, at all levels, held with the Russians in the last months. Most recently, this matter was raised at the Union-Russia Summit on 29 May, and the Commission shall continue to press for an early signature of the MNEPR agreement at every available opportunity. While awaiting resolution of this issue, however, the Commission does not think it useful to delay in implementing the NDEP Support Fund, nor our other contributions to nuclear safety and waste-management in the region.</p>
<p>As regards the Lepse issue, we likewise remain committed to the successful implementation of this important project. The next (industrial) phase is currently in an advanced stage of preparation, and donors, including the Community, are coordinating their efforts with the beneficiary to achieve an early and effective commencement of these activities. This will however require a positive resolution of negotiations on the MNEPR agreement, confirming the importance of this agreement as a major step in addressing nuclear safety and waste issues in NW Russia.</p>
<p>More generally, it might be noted that the Commission of course remains extremely active in addressing nuclear safety and waste issues in this region and elsewhere in Russia and the other New Independant States (NIS). Over the period 1991-2001, the Union has committed some EUR 825 million under the Tacis programme to international efforts to improve nuclear safety levels in the NIS. Along with this financial effort, the Commission continues to give nuclear safety issues an important place in the Union policy dialogue with the Russian Federation, with the overall objective of raising awareness and promoting a whole-hearted Russian participation in the solution of these critical issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0393"></a>

<p>According to information received from the Greek authorities, the “Cross-border Commercial Exhibition and Export Center Promakhon AE” project was co-financed by the Structural Funds during the 1994-1999 period. The project was selected for support in response to a call for an expression of interest launched by the managing authority (Northern Greece Agency for the Development of Private Infrastructures) in relation to the financing of commercial, distribution and exhibition centres, either of a cross-border nature or in urban areas. The project provided infrastructure needed for such a centre which is an eligible expenditure in accordance with the rules governing the Structural Funds. The business premises developed under the project were leased to companies active in various sectors. No contractual obligation exists that would limit these to a 'cross border transit centre'.</p>

<p>In particular the Commission is verifying whether or not the aid measures are covered by broader State aid schemes already approved by the Commission in the past.

Public money may play a role but other factors may be more decisive in terms of where to invest.

Firstly, in the guidelines on regional national aid<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission laid down provisions which oblige those receiving structural aid to maintain any investment or employment created during a period of five years.

Furthermore, the Community has limited grants of aid for olive oil produced from olive trees planted before 1 May 1998.

<p>Over the past few weeks there have been several allegations about alleged misuse of Union monies by the Palestinian Authority (PA) and/or by President Arafat personally. The Israeli Government has prepared a dossier claiming to show that President Arafat and the PA used funds provided by the Union (along with Arab states, Norway, and others) to finance supporters of terrorism, or even directly to underwrite acts of terrorism.</p>
<p>These are most serious allegations and have been carefully examined by the Commission. It should be stressed that the Commission's preliminary findings, on the basis of documents made available by the Israeli Government, are that there is not any evidence corroborating allegations that Union monies have been misused to finance terrorist activities; or for anything other than their original purpose.</p>
<p>The Commission provides EUR 10 million a month to the PA. This constitutes only 10% of their overall budget and is not targeted at any specific spending but is a global contribution to the PA budget. This assistance is subject to strict control and to a number of conditionalities covering the management of funds and Palestinian institutional reform. Disbursement of Union funds is closely monitored, on the ground, by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which reports to the Commission on a monthly basis. To date neither the Commission nor the IMF have any evidence of Union budgetary support being used for any other purpose than that agreed between the Commission and the PA.</p>
<p>The Commission will of course continue to monitor compliance with all conditions, and will give utmost priority to investigating all allegations concerning the misuse of funds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0410"></a>

<p>During the passage of the review of the COM in sheepmeat and goatmeat through the European Parliament last autumn, I tabled a number of amendments which aimed to prevent the widespread exodus of sheep farmers from this sector. One such amendment which was accepted by the Parliament proposed that 'for the purposes of calculating the extensification premium, the first 15 livestock units of ewe/she-goat shall be excluded from consideration'.</p>
<p>As the Commission agreed on the record in the Parliamentary debate to deal with this issue under the mid-term review, what measures will the Commission adopt to include this much-needed provision in the review which will prevent further exodus of European farmers from the sheep sector?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An important aim of the Agenda 2000 reforms in the beef sector was to tighten the eligibility criteria for extensification premium scheme for beef cattle by including in the calculation of stocking density all bovines, actually present on the farm, and all sheep for which premium is claimed.</p>
<p>That is the reason why, at the time of the discussions of the sheep reform, the Commission was reluctant to consider any exemption for sheep from the calculation of the extensification payment because the objective of the payment is to encourage producers to practise extensive beef production, that is, to produce beef at low stocking density.</p>
<p>While the Commission is aware of the arguments forwarded at the end of last year by the Honourable Member, since then, an ongoing Special Report of the Court of Auditors on the extensification payment goes further against any flexibility in this domain.</p>
<p>The Court criticises the fact that the stocking density calculation fails to apply to all sheep present but only those receiving premiums. This means that the Commission must now answer questions over why the eligibility rules are not tighter, rather than weaker, with regard to sheep.</p>
<p>Turning to considerations of the beef and sheep sectors and the Mid Term Review, the Commission has been analysing the situation of these livestock markets and their prospects in the annual Medium Term Forecasts.</p>
<p>The high price that has been a feature of the sheep meat market in the Union since the year 2000, coupled with the new, fixed level of the ewe premium of EUR 21 head (or EUR 16,8 for producers marketing sheep's milk or products based on sheep's milk), have been identified as contributing to very favourable prospects for the sheep sector, such that the relative profitability of sheep compared to beef is expected to improve.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Honourable Member can be assured that this issue has been taken into consideration in our preparations for the Mid Term Review. It is in this broader context that the Commission would expect the problem of preventing the exodus of sheep farmers from this sector to be addressed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0411"></a>

<p>In October 2001, the Commission sent the United Kingdom Government a formal request for information about its application of EU law relating to excise duties on tobacco and alcohol, following a complaint about the rigid application by UK Customs and Excise of quantitative ‘guidelines’ on imports of duty-paid alcohol and tobacco. Such practices have included the seizure not only of goods but also of the vehicles used to transport them – often private cars. In December 2001, the United Kingdom sent a reply.</p>

<p>In October 2001 the Commission initiated an enquiry into certain practices of United Kingdom Customs &amp; Excise. The purpose of this enquiry is to ensure that the United Kingdom applies the harmonised rules on excise duties properly, in distinguishing between individuals holding excisable goods for commercial purposes, and travellers engaged in legitimate cross-border shopping who bring back such goods from other Member States, solely for their own use.</p>
<p>This matter, which concerns the crucial but delicate balance between the general principles of the Internal Market and the fight against fraud, obviously calls for a most thorough analysis. Thus, in addition to the information provided by complainants and the British Government, the Commission recently dispatched officials on a mission to the United Kingdom to gain first-hand impressions of the situation.</p>
<p>The material gathered by the Commission’s services is still being carefully considered. The Commission hopes to be able to reach its final conclusions shortly, but it is still too early to announce any action that the Commission may decide to take.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0413"></a>

<p>Following the recent extension of the EU list of terrorist organisations to include the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), there is a growing fear that the Turkish state's policy of oppression against the Kurdish people will be reinforced.</p>
<p>How, in the Commission’s view, will this decision affect a peaceful resolution of the Kurdish question?</p>
<p>Whom does the Commission consider to be its interlocutor in the peace process on the Kurdish side, now that the PKK has been included on the list of terrorist organisations?</p>
<p>Joint Answer</p>
<p>The Council Regulation 2580/2001<a href="#defann_37_1" name="refann_37_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, to which the Honourable Members refers, sets out specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities with a view to combating terrorism. This Regulation is intended to implement the Common Security and Foreign Policy Council Common Position of 27 December 2001 establishing the list of persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts. The Regulation and the Common Position implement Resolution 1373 (2001 of the Security Council of the United Nations (UN), which is based on Chapter VII of the UN Charter and thus creates an obligation for UN Members to act.</p>
<p>This list was further updated by a Council decision of 2 May 2002 to include other groups and entities. The Council decided to include the PKK and the DHKP/C among the groups and entities in this list. It will be up to the Council to decide whether, when further adapting the list, to include KADEK (successor of PKK) among the groups and entities involved in terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring closely developments in Turkey in the context of the enlargement process. As an Union candidate country, Turkey has to comply with the Copenhagen political criteria. The respect for cultural rights for all Turkish citizens, regardless of their origin is a short-term priority of the Accession Partnership.</p>
<p>Other short-term priorities concern the use of languages other than Turkish and the reduction of regional disparities, with a view to improving the situation in the Southeast. The Accession Partnership also provides for the lifting of the state of emergency in the Southeast as medium-term priority.</p>
<p>Implementation by Turkey of these political criteria and priorities, on which the Commission will be reporting in its Regular Report in October 2002, should help achieve the objectives to which the Honourable Members refers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Formalisation of Basarwa tenure rights has never been granted. However, over a long period they enjoyed undisturbed use of lands in Wildlife Management Areas and the Central Kalahari Game Reserve.

<p>Referring to the questions of the Honourable Member on the status of waste water treatment of certain regions in Greece it can be stated as follows.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Commission initiated an infringement procedure under Article 226 of the EC Treaty against Greece for failure to comply with Council Directive 91/271/EEC<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, given that the Gulf of Thessaloniki was not identified as sensitive area and the urban waste water of the city was not subject to a sufficient treatment. In their reply to the letter of formal notice sent by the Commission, the Greek authorities have reported that since November 2000 urban wastewater in Thessaloniki was subject to more advanced and stringent treatment than secondary treatment under the Directive (nitrogen removal). Nevertheless, as the Gulf of Thessaloniki was still not identified as sensitive area by the Greek authorities, the Commission decided in December 2001 to address to Greece a reasoned opinion. In April 2002 the Greek authorities identified the Gulf of Thessaloniki as sensitive area.</p>
<p>Concerning the collecting system, the Commission found out that a minor part of Thessaloniki might not be in compliance. This fact is currently still under investigation. Non-compliance regarding collecting systems was not subject of the above case.</p>
<p>The Commission is not informed on details of the connection of specific industrial areas and its laboratory tests.</p>
<p>As regards the situation in Athens (treatment plant in Psittalia) and the Saronikos Gulf, an infringement procedure was initiated by the Commission in 2000 for non-compliance with Directive 91/271/EEC concerning the identification of sensitive areas and insufficient waste water treatment. In December 2001 the Commission decided to bring the case before the Court. As a consequence the Greek authorities designated the Saronikos Gulf as sensitive area in April 2002. The construction of treatment facilities for more advanced than secondary waste water treatment in Psittalia is underway and will be finished, according to the Greek authorities, by the end of 2002.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

Can the Commission guarantee that the Antwerp system can co-exist with the new EU system until a watertight system has been established? The adage 'trade not aid' still seems to hold true for the diamond trade in spite of its considerable disruptive effect in Africa. This regulation affords the Commission the very opportunity of integrating trade and development policy.

<p>Both government representatives and representatives of the industry and non-governmental organisations have been involved from the start in the Kimberley Process.

<p>These intense contacts have been maintained during the preparation of the proposal for an implementing Regulation which the Commission will soon submit to the Council.</p>
<p>To mention but a few contacts, the Ministries concerned, notably those in the United Kingdom and Belgium indicated organisations or companies in the private sector and non-governmental organisations like Global Witness.

<p>Mr Souladakis’ interpretation is inaccurate. Council Regulation (EC) No 1493/1999 on the common organisation of the market in wine does not contain a definition of dried grape vinegar.</p>
<p>Only wine vinegar is defined as, vinegar which “is obtained exclusively by acetous fermentation of wine”. The Commission has already given a legal interpretation of this, which it has announced officially to the representatives of the Member States. Only products that comply with this definition may be described as wine vinegar.</p>
<p>The Commission has not taken any steps to impose restrictions on the marketing of grape vinegar. Many other types of vinegar are produced in the Member States and placed on the Community market. In this case, the name of the substance or fruit from which the vinegar is obtained may accompany the word 'vinegar' on the product label.</p>
<p>Let us not forget that Annex I to Regulation No 1493/1999 defines wine as the product obtained exclusively from the alcoholic fermentation of fresh grapes, whether or not crushed, or of grape must, and that the alcoholic fermentation of dried grapes cannot produce wine.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore considers that the above definitions and the general rules on the presentation of foodstuffs laid down by Directive 2000/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council are sufficiently clear and precise as to ensure that consumers are correctly informed with regard to these products.</p>
<p>It therefore considers it unnecessary to lay down specific, more precise rules for the presentation of vinegar.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission considers that, within the framework of the Community method – which is a unique decision-making method adapted to the specific nature of the Union, a Union of States and peoples – the Commission alone must have the right of initiative, the right of decision-making being the joint prerogative of Parliament and the Council. This distribution of powers is intended to avoid the institution responsible for making a decision being responsible for the proposal as well.</p>
<p>The Commission points out that Parliament has already declared itself to be of this opinion in the resolutions containing Parliament’s proposals for the Intergovernmental Conference which drew up the Treaty of Nice<a href="#defann_44_1" name="refann_44_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and again, recently, in the resolution on the division of competences between the European Union and the Member States (the Lamassoure report)<a href="#defann_44_2" name="refann_44_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The reason, which is still valid, why the founding fathers conferred an almost exclusive right of initiative on the Commission is the need to make an independent institution responsible for discerning the general interest of all the Member States and proposing suitable solutions for furthering it. Indeed, it is important for the decision-making and legislative process to be based on an initiative which is not geared towards the specific interests of one or more Member States and/or towards the interests of certain ‘stakeholders’. It is Parliament and the Council, however, who make the final decision.</p>
<p>The Commission would point out that granting Parliament a right of initiative would, in all probability, lead to a right of initiative being granted to the Council or the Member States. In an institutional system which is not based on the conventional national model in which there is a government formed by a parliamentary majority, this solution would be likely to cause great dispersion of the Union’s action. The results of the experience within the ‘third pillar’ of a right of initiative shared between the Commission and the Member States have not been conclusive.</p>
<p>Lastly, it should also be pointed out that Parliament – like the Council – may, at any time, request that the Commission submit any appropriate proposal on matters on which it considers that a Community act is required for the purpose of implementing the Treaty (Article 192 EC). Moreover, the Commission undertook in the framework agreement concluded with Parliament to give Parliament’s requests maximum consideration.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission conducts on a continuous basis broad consultations on the subject of trade in services in order to ensure a balanced input in the current services negotiations.</p>
<p>Over the last years, the Commission's Directorate-General for Trade has engaged in a dialogue with civil society organisations, encompassing industry, trade unions and non-governmental organisations (NGOs). In the context of this dialogue, services-specific meetings have been organised on several occasions to give all stakeholders the possibility to express their views. For example, Directorate-General Trade officials held such meetings on 25 September 2001 and on 7 May 2002; the Commissioner responsible for Trade held debriefing talks on the whole of the Doha agenda, including services, on 14 December 2001 and 18 April 2002. It is regrettable that some of these meetings have not always been well attended by all organisations that expressed their interest in the subject.</p>
<p>In addition, during the same period, the ESF organised four meetings (including its semi-annual meeting) on world trade in services, to which the Commission was invited as an observer. As for ESF’s attendance at the ad hoc 133 Committee (Services) meetings, this is a question that should formally be addressed to the Council. Nonetheless, as far as the Commission is aware, the ESF does not take part in or have any access to meetings of the ad hoc 133 Committee, nor is there any form of cooperation between this Committee and the ESF.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue its cooperation with civil society by organising regular sessions of information and discussion. The future venues can be consulted on DG Trade’s Website, under the icon “civil society dialogue”. In addition, the Commission has repeatedly asked civil society representatives at such events to provide written contributions but, apart from industry, only a limited number of contributions has been received from other organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0441"></a>

<p>Fishing effort and capacity limits are an essential part of the proposed reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Management of fishing effort and capacity in line with sustainable catching opportunities will have a positive impact on the fish and shellfish stocks. There is no estimate of the overall effect of a reduction of effort and capacity to sustainable levels, but the scientists (International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF)) have assessed the effects of a reduction in fishing mortality on a large number of stocks. In general the scientists predict an increase in stock size resulting in increased productivity leading to not only a higher catch per effort but also in an increase in the total yield. The predicted effect is on the condition that fishing effort is kept at the sustainable level and not allowed to increase again.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0447"></a>

<p>The Commission considers that its proposals for reform of the Common Fisheries Policy are compatible with Parliament’s resolution on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) adopted on 17 January 2002 and do not contradict it.</p>
<p>Parliament agreed with the Commission’s analysis about, inter-alia, the critical state of many Community fish stocks, the lack of proper compliance, the inadequacy of scientific information, the failure of multiannual guidance programmes (MAGPs), the over-capacity of the fishing fleet, the need to ensure coherence with other policies, to involve the stakeholders in policy shaping and to strengthen the international dimension of the CFP.</p>
<p>The Commission’s proposals for reform are designed to provide for timely and effective answers and solutions to the pre-occupations expressed in Parliament’s resolution, and reflect most of the ideas expressed therein. For example the Commission’s proposals fully respond to the demands of Parliament to preserve relative stability, to incorporate environmental requirements into the CFP under the Treaty, to put the precautionary principle at the forefront, to improve the scientific basis upon which decisions are taken, to reduce discards and by-catch through stricter technical measures, to adopt measures to protect cetaceans and other non-target species and habitats, to subject industrial fishing under the same conservation rules as other types of fisheries, to maintain support measures for safety onboard vessels without entailing an increase in fishing effort, to simplify the monitoring of fleet, to take into account Member States past performance in the new fleet policy, to foresee more effective sanctions, to maintain measures for small-scale fishing, to take into account the needs of outermost regions, to strengthen control and enforcement, to create a Joint Inspection Structure, to foresee development of observers, to pay more attention to environmental problems in third countries waters, to proceed to rigorous stock assessment of third countries’ resources, to ensure coherence of external fisheries policy and development policy, to take initiatives to combat illegal fishing, to promote social dialogue, to provide for financing for social measures, to consider health and safety at work issues, to consider aquaculture as an integral part of the CFP and to help the sustainable development of that sector, to provide support for research, to provide for the integration of the Mediterranean into the CFP, to promote greater stakeholder involvement, and the simplification and transparency of legislation.</p>
<p>There are also ideas in the Parliament’s resolution that the Commission shares and will take into account within the framework of its forthcoming supplementary reform proposals foreseen for example for the Mediterranean, the international relations and aquaculture.</p>
<p>There are a number of areas, however, where the Commission does not share the Parliament’s views. While the Commission agrees with the continuation of structural support for the fisheries sector, it strongly believes that such support foreseen for renewal, modernisation, and export of vessels and for the creation of joint-undertakings should be re-oriented towards reduction of fleet over-capacity and socio-economic measures to address the regional and social consequences of the inevitable restructuring of the sector.</p>
<p>Public aid should work for and not against conservation. Given the current dramatic state of affairs in European fisheries, with which the Parliament agrees, this is the only way to deal effectively with fleet over-capacity which is at the root of the current problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0448"></a>

<p>The Union has identified water as a priority issue for the United Nations World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). In that context the Commission has proposed an Union water initiative to be presented in Johannesburg. The initiative is focussed on the delivery of the millennium targets in relation to drinking water supply and the provision of sanitation. The initiative also foresees that these targets should be delivered within the framework of an integrated approach to water management based on river basins or catchments. Such an approach will inter alia ensure that ecological objectives are also taken into account as well as providing a framework for the management of trans-boundary water bodies. The initiative provides for joint efforts from the Member States, the Commission, international funding bodies, the private sector and Non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The Commission believes that efficient and sustainable management of water resources is one of the major development challenges. It believes that the proposed initiative will make a significant contribution to addressing the problem.</p>
<p>The linkage made between the proposed Union water initiative for the WSSD and the Spanish National Hydrological Plan is not appropriate. The Union water initiative is a contribution to the challenge of 1.2 billion people without drinking water and 2.4 billion without sanitation: where thousands are estimated to be dying each day from water related problems. In relation to the Spanish hydrological plan, the Commission has on many previous occasions made it clear that the plan both in design and execution must respect relevant Union legislation and in particular the legislation dealing with habitats, water and environmental impact assessment. Union contributions to the funding of the plan (structural funds and cohesion funds) will be subject to the normal rules and procedures.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0453"></a>

<p>The Commission is currently implementing verification actions regarding fisheries products imported from Norway into the Community under cover of movement certificates EUR.1 or invoice declarations. These actions include a mission made by European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) and Danish Customs to the Norwegian Directorate of Customs and Excise in Oslo (18-09-01), and the communication by Norway to OLAF of their report on verification of origin of codfish exports (16-11-01). The first phase of the verification program has been finished by the Norwegian competent authorities and communicated to OLAF in May 2002. The measures to be considered by the Union depend on the results of this verification program, and could include the publication of a notice to importers informing them about the situation as well as the collection of guaranties for any customs duties that might be liable.</p>

<p>The factions in Afghanistan agreed on 5 December 2001 in Bonn/Petersberg an Agreement which contains numerous specific references to the role and participation of women in the Interim Administration and the Emergency Loya Jirga. It recognises that the interim arrangements set out in the Agreement are intended as “a first step towards the establishment of a broad-based, gender sensitive … and full representative government …”.</p>
<p>The Commission has consistently made clear to the authorities that compliance with the terms of the Bonn/Petersberg Agreement is a fundamental conditions of its support for the reconstruction process in Afghanistan. To this end, the Commission has committed up to EUR 2 million to set up the Emergency Loya Jirga in conformity with the Bonn principles. The work of the Emergency Loya Jirga Commission is being closely monitored.</p>
<p>The Commission will equally expect the Transitional Authority which follows the Interim Authority to abide by the Bonn/Petersberg Agreement. The situation of women and girls in Afghanistan has been a specific concern over many years. The Commission’s aid programme, which has implemented health, education, nutrition and employment projects aimed at refugees, internally displaced persons and other vulnerable groups has consistently contained significant components which addressed the plight of Afghan women.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the Commission sent expert missions into the field to make proposals for initial quick impact projects in the areas of education, health, rural development/food security, urban regeneration. A gender specialist accompanied these missions, with the specific objective of ensuring that gender issues and the need to improve social conditions and opportunities were fully taken into account.</p>
<p>The expert’s proposals are now being incorporated into the first tranche of EUR 57 million for programme support in 2002. One of the health projects will provide women with the opportunity to meet with other women outside their direct family. Another project includes a health education and community-based sanitation component, through the establishment of a network of women to work as health and sanitation educators and community mobilisers to work in a number of urban districts.</p>
<p>Whilst it is not possible to be precise on the percentage of these activities which directly benefit women, the Commission is intent on mainstreaming a number of gender concerns and in its second Recovery Programme (EUR 70 million) expected to be approved in the fourth quarter of 2002 specific projects in health and institutional support will address contraints faced by women in urban and rural areas.</p>
<p>Regarding emergency humanitarian aid provided by the Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO), women have always been implicated in various types of projects, even in the Taliban era : all medical and nutritional projects funded by ECHO aim to treat malnutrition among children under five years of age, as well as monitor the health status of women, in particular lactating and pregnant women. Usually, non-governmental organisations (NGOs) organise elementary hygiene education for women.</p>
<p>NGOs have access to all beneficiaries, women included, and can employ women as local NGO personnel in medical related programmes, in spite of the fact that separation between the two genders has to be strictly observed. Medical NGOs play a great role in the medical training of women.</p>
<p>Furthermore, over two years, income generating activities for women have been started to encourage their self-sufficiency, and are increasingly being supported by ECHO. ECHO has financed “Food For Work” (FFW) projects for men and women through various partners. While men are occupied in land recovery works and city drain cleaning, women are given raw material and knit quilts and sweaters to be distributed to other beneficiaries. This operation implies that some educated women will first conduct a survey to identify the most vulnerable women, among the widows, handicapped and internally displaced people. This kind of programme ensures the participation of women coming from a variety of socio-economic classes, from educated to illiterate women, each of them using their knowledge and/or manual ability. The programmes have proved successful and will be continued as they provide an immediate impact on people's livelihood.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On the basis of the information received from the Greek authorities, the Commission would like to inform Mr Folias of the state of progress of the projects concerning biological treatment works and the project to supply water from the Aliakmon river, which received cofinancing under the Cohesion Fund for 1994-1999.</p>
<p>Work is complete on the waste water treatment plant, which has been operational since November 2000. Furthermore, the state of progress of work on the concentrated waste water reception tank may be estimated at approximately 90%. The Commission conducted a detailed inspection of this project in November 2001 and corresponded with the Greek authorities with regard to the acceptance of the conclusions of the envoy.</p>
<p>Work on the infrastructure of the project to supply Thessaloniki with water from the Aliakmon river is in the final stages, and the overall state of progress of the project can be estimated at 80%. In this regard, priority is given to the completion of the drinking water treatment unit. Tests are due to start in August.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0459"></a>

<p>The Commission fully shares the Honourable Member’s concern at the rising tension between India and Pakistan, which has reached a dangerous level. It is indeed extremely urgent that this tension should be reduced.</p>
<p>The Commissioner in charge of external relations visited Islamabad and Delhi on 22-24 May, where he met, inter alia, Pakistan President Musharraf and Indian Foreign Minister Singh, as well as members of both country's civil society and media. The Commissioner in charge of External relations concluded from his visit that the situation was exceptionally worrying with a real danger of miscalculation leading to war between nuclear powers.</p>
<p>The Commissioner reaffirmed Union’s full rejection of any form of terrorism and stressed that a stop must be put to terrorist activities. This implies tangible progress in reduction of infiltration into Jammu and Kashmir.</p>
<p>He made it absolutely clear that Pakistan has to deliver on this. President Musharraf must follow-up on his 12 January speech, and also implement United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373. No country should allow its territory to be used for terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The Commissioner retained the strong impression that India’s patience is at an end. However, there is still potential to avoid a war, providing that Pakistan takes rapid and efficient measures to put a stop to cross-border terrorism. Both sides must also row back on the rhetoric which is only inflaming matters.</p>
<p>As regards the Honourable Member’s suggestion that the Union should act as a facilitator, the Commission remains convinced that a solution on the Kashmir issue can only progress through dialogue between the parties based on their genuine commitment to reach a peaceful settlement.</p>
<p>International involvement through mediation requires that both sides agree on it. This is not currently the case. However, it remains of course legitimate to express serious concerns at the conflict and use contacts to press both sides to find a solution. The Commission stands ready to help if it is asked to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2002-0462"></a>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The data contained in the annual report from the International Labour Organisation (ILO) on deaths caused by work-related accidents and diseases world-wide is shocking. These deaths, numbering 5000 every day or approximately two million a year, are due to deficient or downright non-existent health and safety measures, and this in turn is due to the cost of taking such measures, which would run counter to the sacred cow of competitiveness, coupled with the immunity enjoyed by employers under capitalism. This is the price paid by the working class at the altar of the free market economy, namely achieving at all costs that system’s supreme goal of extracting the largest possible profit. According to the ILO report, the annual rate of death from work-related diseases is 32% from cancer and 23% from traffic injuries, while deaths from work-related accidents amount to 19%. It concludes that 80% of work-related accidents and deaths could have been avoided if countries had enforced the application of health and safety measures.</p>
<p>Since the situation in the EU itself is not much better, what measures does the Commission intend to take to protect the life and health of all workers and to ensure that they are not sacrificed on the altar of an uncontrolled drive for enormous profits?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>As indicated in its communication "Adapting to change in work and society: a new Community strategy on health and safety at work 2002–2006"<a href="#defann_58_1" name="refann_58_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the Commission is of the opinion that, in spite of the number of occupational accidents falling by just short of 10% between 1994 and 1998, the absolute figures remain high, with almost 5,500 deaths and 4.8 million accidents resulting in periods off work for three days or more.</p>
<p>These figures do call for heightened vigilance, since what they indicate is that the preventive approach set out in Community directives has not yet been fully understood and taken on board by the various players, nor applied effectively on the ground.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore proposes in its communication a Community strategy based on:</p>
<p>a global approach to well-being at work, taking account of changes in the world of work and the emergence of new risks, thus enhancing the quality of work;</p>
<p>a culture of risk prevention, relying on combining a variety of political instruments - legislation, social dialogue, progressive measures and best practices, corporate social responsibility and economic incentives;</p>
<p>building partnerships between all the players on the safety and health scene.</p>
<p>As regards international cooperation, the Commission will continue its active collaboration with the agencies of the United Nations — the World Health Organisation and the International Labour Organisation — which have a similar role to play in improving the level of protection of workers at world level.</p>
<p>In response to the Commission's communication, the Council adopted a resolution 3 June 2002 calling on the Member States:</p>
<p>to develop and implement coordinated, coherent prevention policies, with measurable targets set for reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses,</p>
<p>to ensure better implementation of the legislation in force, in particular through more effective inspection and monitoring, through making available to businesses, especially small- and medium- sized businesses, suitable advisory and consultancy services, as well as through improved occupational risk-prevention training and the adoption of measures aimed specifically at reducing accidents at work and occupational illnesses in high-risk sectors.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
