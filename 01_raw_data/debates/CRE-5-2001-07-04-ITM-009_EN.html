<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haug (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this evening we are holding the joint debate about the three reports produced. Looking around, we all know already what everyone is going to say, and we have said it all before. Even the Commissioner has listened to us more than once, so let us just say it one more time for the record. The Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget is a completely non-contentious issue in the Committee. The most important points are, firstly, funding for 27 new posts for RTD projects; secondly, the OLAF establishment plan and the necessary funds in the budget line for the recruitment of new staff; and, thirdly, an increase in the Commission’s payment appropriations required for the EU assistance in the Balkans. In other words, we want an additional 100 million plus.</p>
<p class="contents">This was all agreed unanimously in the Committee on Budgets with the support of all our colleagues. At this point, I would like to thank Herbert Bösch very warmly once again for the solution to the OLAF issue. He worked very hard to ensure that we reached this compromise. The fact that the balance from the 2000 budget gives rise to a surplus of EUR 11.6 billion is one reason for this House to underline yet again that the budget management is very frugal, and for the Council it is a cause for rejoicing. However, what is the report concerning the European Union’s own resources about, and why has it been drawn up?</p>
<p class="contents">We – Parliament – have taken the initiative and called on the Council to discuss with us, prior to every budget procedure and before the Commission produces its draft budget, the situation concerning the European Union’s own resources. Please note that I said ‘discuss’, not ‘codecision’. We thought this was a very cheap option, but far from it, the Council is resisting, and that is what it is doing this evening too. It is simply not listening! It refuses even to discuss the European Union’s revenue with us. As a result, we looked at the EU’s own resources without having discussed them with the Council. What we noted for the 2001 budget year is no different from the trends observed in previous years.</p>
<p class="contents">Traditional own resources and VAT resources are becoming less and less significant. The transfers from the Member States as a GNP resource share have increased steadily. In total, own resources constitute 98.3% of revenue for the 2001 EU budget. This is equivalent to 1.06% of their GNP, which is far less than the own resources ceiling percentage of 1.27% laid down in the financial perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">This shift towards the GNP resource can undoubtedly be viewed with mixed feelings. It could lead to a fairer division of burdens between the Member States, as GNP is probably the best indicator to measure the relative wealth of the Member States’ economies; indeed, if we look more closely, some Member States already cover 22, 29 or even 33% of their contributions to the European budget from traditional own resources – in other words, from money which has already belonged to the European Union for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it changes the nature of the European Union’s own resources, transforming them from real own resources into a form of Member States’ contribution. Thirdly, it simply does not create a visible link between the European Union and its citizens. When the Belgian President of the EU, Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt, spoke this morning, it warmed my heart. He too is questioning this indirect financing of the European Union. He too is calling for more transparency. He too wants citizens to become more familiar with the European Union, and this includes more transparent financial arrangements.</p>
<p class="contents">We want financial autonomy at European level, and we want to work towards this now. We want this financial autonomy to be shared jointly and on an equal basis with the Council, and we want to have co-decision rights in this area. We want equal rights in all areas; we want to be one of the two arms of the budgetary authority, in respect of all expenditure and all revenue. We want complete budgetary autonomy. A European tax may still be a long way off, but the Belgian presidency, the Belgian President of the European Union himself, has called for this. The Belgian Finance Minister supports this demand, and even the German Finance Minister no longer rejects it outright. A European tax may still be "future music", as the Germans say, but if we do not start playing it now, we will not be dancing to it in future.</p>

I would therefore like to take this opportunity to thank the rapporteur for her outstanding work on the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of my report, which I am honoured to present here, is to prolong two temporary posts, 1 A7 and 1 B5, and create two new temporary posts, 1 A5 and 1 A7, for the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. Naturally, I fully support this proposal in terms of content; this is a very serious matter as it concerns the refurbishment ...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Laughter)</span></p>
<p class="contents">... of the Belliard building. After all, it is also in the European Parliament’s interests to ensure that sensible use can be made of this building in Brussels in the long term. I would particularly like to stress the fact that the two Committees are making the necessary resources available through savings in the personnel field, which I think is very positive. This shows that the willingness to make savings, which is something we have demanded from all the institutions, is being implemented very effectively by the two Committees. I therefore recommend that items VI and VII of Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget no. 3 be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I should also like to make some general comments, as my group has kindly granted me a few minutes so that I can conclude my part as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I welcome the fact that this House is debating two Draft Supplementary and Amending Budgets simultaneously. This is a contribution towards saving tax-payers’ money while taking matters forward on a simpler administrative basis. I think this is also worth mentioning.</p>
<p class="contents">I would point out that on the revenue side of the 2000 budget – as Ms Haug has already mentioned – the surplus of EUR 11.5 billion shows that there is still quite a lot of scope here. I remember the ritual – which we will have the honour of continuing in July – when we fight over every euro, with the Council sinking to its knees and accusing us of supping from a horn of plenty. Finally, by developing a serious Commission budget policy, but also through Parliament’s constant monitoring and support to ensure a prudent use of budget resources, we are now managing to generate surpluses which might actually make some of these rituals unnecessary in future. I should mention in passing that the finance ministers of the Member States are delighted to receive a generous rebate towards the current budget. I am sure this will be reflected in the Member States’ eternal gratitude to us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to make several comments on the issue of own resources. Ms Haug, according to my information, a separate European tax was already being debated before my time, namely in April 1994. It would seem that even then, people were making music that nobody danced to. I am not sure whether it is useful at this stage to initiate a debate at European level on financing through taxation. Let me say this quite clearly: we have other priorities first. The first task which Europe must address is the issue of a more precise delimitation of powers between the European Union and the Member States. The public would also like to have some answers. What is Europe responsible for, and why does it need money? In a second step, we must of course discuss what kind of long-term institutions are required in Europe so that the tasks entrusted to Europe can be performed in a democratic and transparent way. Finally, at the end of this process, decisions must be taken on how the necessary resources can be made available. I think that if we approach matters on this basis, we will be on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">By supporting a European tax at this stage, Europe’s citizens are more likely to be frightened off by what is happening here. It will not help us to achieve lasting acceptance among citizens in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as he is the next to rise, I should like to express my warm thanks to Mr Costa Neves who had the difficult task of setting out the parameters for the forthcoming deliberations with the Council. Yet again, there are a number of problems for next year. The Committee on Budgets can look forward to some lively debates. However, I think that Mr Costa Neves has carried out his task with the necessary care and wisdom for a serious proposal to be put forward to the tax-payers, whom we – in our role as part of the budgetary authority – are representing here. I am pleased that the German Social Democrats are also very receptive to the proposals from Bavaria. This also opens up entirely new perspectives for the coming year.</p>

This is a lengthy and complex process which, on the basis of the proposals made by the European Commission, seeks to achieve agreement between the Council and the European Parliament, the two branches of the budgetary authority. Such agreement will require respect for the regulatory framework, for the existing agreements and between the institutions concerned, taking account of the representativeness of each one and the priorities that they legitimately define. We must, therefore, work on the essence of the positions held by each of the parties involved, otherwise we will not be able to reach any kind of agreement. I must emphasise that the report we are now discussing is a basis for negotiating with other institutions, which has been defined in accordance with the guidelines that we adopted in April; it is not the European Parliament’s final position on the 2002 budget. As the basis for negotiations, it must not address issues on which Parliament has the final say. It must lead to a discussion of aspects on which more positions held from more of a remove are required on issues on which the Council has the final say. This applies to agricultural spending, security policy and international fisheries agreements. It is the most basic common sense also to address other key issues, such as the level of payments for next year and the pace of the Commission reform. We are therefore, I repeat, in a negotiating phase.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise the essence of Parliament’s positions, with which you are, of course, all familiar. In December 2000, the Council agreed that, by 30 June of this year, the Commission would present a progress report on a raft of matters, with a view to increasing the levels and the quality of budgetary implementation, improving coordination between legislative and budgetary procedures, and ensuring the success of the Commission reform. This means that one of Parliament’s priorities is to consider issues of the budget’s quality, and their impact, and to assess and take account of the budget’s implementation. The progress report has already been presented by the Commission, which is cause for satisfaction, and we are sure that it will seen as the crucial instrument that it is and which we are already beginning to study.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in April of this year, the European Parliament adopted guidelines that suggest the perennial matters in the progress report that I have just mentioned as political priorities, as well as food safety and consumer confidence, together with sustainable agriculture, the definition of priorities and, more generally, better implementation of the budget, including very specific aspects such as <span class="italic">e</span>-learning, a key aspect of the priority that is always given to issues of employment and social inclusion, and policy development in the field of asylum and immigration. In this context, it is understandable that there should be concern at the speed at which commitments are met by making payments in due time and, at the same time, effectively reducing the amount of delayed payments and reducing the amount of RAL (amounts outstanding). We feel, therefore, that we must take maximum advantage of the payment possibilities laid down in the financial perspective and we want to respect the financial perspective for 2002 to a value of 1.14% of the combined GNP of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also highlight the following: the need for a precise, rigorous and up-to-date assessment of the implementation of the common agricultural policy reform, specifically taking account of the consequences of the BSE and foot-and-mouth crises. We also need a timetabled approach to the future, which involves respecting the commitments given by the European Union at successive European Councils, particularly the Lisbon Council on employment and competitiveness, the Tampere Council on asylum and immigration and the Nice Council on the consequences of failing to conclude fisheries agreements with Morocco; the clarification of costs for external policy and common security, particularly with regard to the division of responsibilities between the Council and the Commission, respect for the financial perspective’s ceilings in category 4 too, in which attention must be paid to the traditional priorities of the European Parliament, which are well-known; the precise identification of real expenditure resulting from the enlargement process, with particular emphasis on administrative expenditure in category 5 and lastly, real consideration of the proposals previously made by Parliament, especially those relating to preparatory action and pilot projects. I shall end here, in the hope that on 20 July – the date scheduled for the conciliation meeting – the positive and constructive spirit that I personally feel, will spread to all of those present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It gives a powerful signal indicating what Parliament does and does not want. Coming from the Committee on Fisheries, I also notice that, with regard to agriculture, the European Commission has in any case understood that Parliament would like to set aside a large proportion of the budget for food safety and the fight against animal diseases, but as for the fishery guidelines, I have to say that it appears as if the Commission is still on a different planet.</p>
<p class="contents">It does not breathe a word about the problem that, after the failure of the fisheries agreement with Morocco, less money is being spent. Neither does it mention the problems this has caused in vulnerable coastal regions in Spain and Portugal. Nothing about the problems in the northern regions as a result of the temporary fishing ban due to the worrying cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the Council is, for the time being, not taking any action further to implement Nice. Needless to say, it is evident that the transfer of money from one heading to another, from heading 4 (external actions) to heading 2 (structural policy) is no child’s play. Also because the ceiling of Berlin has been determined per heading. But financial crisis management, such as the fight against the BSE crisis and aid for the Balkans, has shown that decisive politicians are not hindered by strict budget rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The EP’s Committee on Fisheries agrees with rapporteur Costa Neves where he states that both the Commission and the Council may actually be slightly too relaxed in some areas. At the same time, it prompts him to boost the creativity and decisiveness of the Commission and the Council. Our proposals are as follows. We would earmark the funding that has not been used for fishery agreements under external actions, heading 4, to alleviate the effects in the coastal regions of South-Eastern Europe. We would target structural funds to address the crisis in fisheries, which have been left over following the failure of the fishery agreement with Morocco, and further to the measures which have been taken to protect cod and hake stocks. We would, for the time being, set aside any balance in the account in 2001 to restructure the fisheries sector and, if possible, use the instrument of flexibility to fight the fisheries crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we would also like specific research to be initiated into the use of genetic modification techniques in fish farming. Europe is lagging far behind the United States and Canada in this respect, and only sound research will provide a basis to keep this technique in European fish farming at bay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, as we know, it will not be possible this year to use the flexibility instrument in this chapter. We have just heard what the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Fisheries has said.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to point out that the extension of the Union’s activities in this field, particularly in the field of the CFSP, requires sufficient contributions. The uncertainty in the allocation of resources compromises the credibility and prestige of an external policy which must be in a position to fulfil its commitments and ambitions. For all these reasons, the Committee on Foreign Affairs – in the context presented to us by the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, of a stage of the budgetary procedure, both in this conciliation procedure and at first reading, and in accordance with the priorities set in its opinion of 20 March, approved unanimously in the Committee on Foreign Affairs – has the purpose of requesting the allocation of sufficient budgetary resources to finance the new priorities. This of course, Mr President, bearing in mind their healthy, effective and transparent management.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has included approximately 120 million in relation to the fisheries agreement with Morocco, and we, like the general rapporteur for the budget, ask that the commitments made at the Nice Summit be fulfilled. Therefore, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs wish to say that if the European Union wishes to have influence on the world stage in the economic, commercial, financial and industrial fields, we must be coherent and provide ourselves with the necessary resources to do so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we are preparing for the initial contacts with the Council. We also know, however, that those contacts will never solve everything entirely. That is also evident from the absence of the representatives of the Council on the other side of the table. Their curiosity only gets the better of them once the real procedure reaches completion. That is why we can only make some general comments at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of my Committee, I should like to say that generally speaking, we agree to continuing last year’s policy, although we do have a number of specific concerns. Our main concern is actually related to the proposals of the European Commission itself. I have already drawn your attention to it. Particularly the huge cutback which the Commission proposes for the employment chapter gives us great cause for concern. If you add this to what is happening in the funds, for example in model projects, our concerns only grow. These concerns are exacerbated even more if one considers other projects which we agreed on last year in the budget, yet which failed to get off the ground. They do seem to get snarled up in the Commission apparatus, but I do not want to go into that now. That is worrying because we are making an arrangement here in respect of the budget, namely if the Commission agrees to that arrangement, it is also responsible for the implementation, and it should not try to get out of that responsibility via all kinds of legal or illegal backdoors. In my opinion, that can be an extremely difficult issue in this procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">That is, in actual fact, our main concern at the moment. It is no longer a matter of money. It is now simply about appropriately spending the money that is available now and that was allocated in the previous budget. We know that there are plenty of projects, but ever stricter criteria are being prescribed. In some cases, the number of countries increases dramatically. Originally, it was possible for three countries jointly to submit a project. That has now suddenly increased to seven. We then wonder whether that is how both institutions should deal with each other. I should like to put this to you now. We will return to the other issues in due course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any event, in this joint debate on Supplementary and Amending Budgets Nos 3 and 4, the mandate for the budgetary conciliation and the report on the situation concerning the European Union’s own resources, the PPE-DE Group wishes to state that it is voting unanimously in favour in the first two cases and in favour by a majority in relation to own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, the most potentially controversial issue in this Haug report relates to Parliament’s support for the possibility of opening a debate on the establishment of a direct Community tax which would be a source of autonomous funding for the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Within all the groups. Mr President, there are differing sensitivities in relation to European integration, and this is all the more obvious when it comes to funding issues. Therefore, Mrs Haug’s tendency towards this possible tax is too much for certain national delegations. However, I believe that the majority of my Group will possibly agree with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Of more immediate importance is the mandate for conciliation by Mr Costa Neves, and we publicly thank him for being prepared to hold dialogue and for seeking a consensus. We are sure that, thanks to this way of proceeding, we will be able to achieve successful results. We are presenting clear proposals for the conciliation of 20 July, which the Council should not reject, because they represent the majority will of this House elected by the citizens of Europe. Amongst these concerns I would like to stress our doubts about the reserve in agriculture, the low implementation of appropriations in food safety and the future of rural development. I would also like to stress the will for the Council to comply with the Nice commitments with regard to overcoming the problems caused by the absence of a fishing agreement with Morocco and the need to safeguard Parliament’s external priorities, which are always cut at first reading by the Council and, even more, the indispensable consultation procedure which the Council should carry out with Parliament when adopting commitments on external policy. Lastly, I would like to mention the need to deal with the problems that have already been mentioned in Category 5, especially the separation of administration expenditure and the identification of the Council’s expenditure in that category.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, all of this makes up the hub of Parliament’s negotiating position for the conciliation of 20 July, with regard to which we ask the Belgian presidency to maintain an open position and hold dialogue so that we can deal with the final part of the budgetary procedure with guarantees of success for all the parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Walter (PSE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I am afraid I must begin by informing Markus Ferber from Bavaria that he will not necessarily find commonalities on those points where he hoped to find them. Let me explain why. He said that we must first establish a different form of institutional development for the European Union before we talk about the EU’s finances. I think this is wrong. This is especially apparent from the issues before us today.</p>
<p class="contents">If you ask any member of the public nowadays what the European Union spends its money on, 30% will say ‘to cover its administrative costs’, and another 30% will have no idea at all where the money goes. That means that 60% do not know what we do with the resources provided by the tax-payer. However, the tax-payers know that what they see as massive amounts of money are involved. Enormous sums of money are spent, and I think that today of all days, the general public would be astonished, yet again, by what is happening at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, we have a Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget. In one of them, the European Union, the Commission, shows that it has no intention of complying more than cursorily with the will of Parliament, at least as far as the sections on UCLAF or the new OLAF structure are concerned. We made a very clear statement on this issue during the year.</p>
<p class="contents">We wanted to shape personnel and the staffing structure in such a way as to create a new institution which fulfils modern requirements. In fact, it is only thanks to our colleague Herbert Bösch, who was willing to grasp the nettle, that no attempt was made to redeploy the staff and reshape this same institution – which, of course, was the focus of intensive debate last time – into another, which cannot develop entirely new structures as its personnel remains the same. This also deserves criticism here.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is this. We will be returning EUR 11 billion to the Member States. EUR 11 billion means that we have a budget underspend of around 10%. We have an underspend in the field of consumer policy, where just 74.7% of funds are being used. Consumer policy – that is a word to savour! This is the issue we have spent more time and energy discussing over the last few months, if not years, than any other – and yet only 75% of its budget is actually being spent.</p>
<p class="contents">We have allocated funds to address one of the European Union’s major problems, namely under-employment. Let me give you the rate of expenditure in the field of employment policy: 39.6%. We have millions of unemployed, money has been made available, and yet less than 40% of these funds is being spent. Explain that to the European public!</p>
<p class="contents">We are handing back billions! In category IV, i.e. external actions, we see that just under 60% of the funds allocated to the European initiative for democracy and the protection of human rights – an issue which we spend hours discussing for every resolution, as well as under "urgent business" – is being spent. The rest is forfeited and goes back to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make it very clear: the European public must be told where the money goes. However, they should also be told where it comes from. That is being discussed quite specifically today, for it is always implied that the Member States provide the money. That is the case here today as well. We must ensure that the public understands the situation. We must make the revenue side and the expenditure side more transparent. We cannot continue to explain why we battle against the Council in the budget debates to secure an extra 11 billion, only to hand it back in the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget at the beginning of the following year because it has not been used. The money then goes back into the relevant national budgets. We must move away from this situation. There must be a reliable and accountable source of revenue which is transparent to the public. Whatever form this takes, we must not cobble together a solution – Markus Ferber is quite right on that point. We must not be tempted, as a knee-jerk reaction, to agree any old solution as quickly as possible, for an uncoordinated, unstructured debate only leads to confusion. We must be able to manage this. Once we have set this up on the revenue side, once it is directly linked to citizens, and the expenditure side is then controlled by citizens as well – for they will look very carefully at what we are doing with the money – no further funds will be returned to the Member States. Instead, they will ask us: how have you actually managed the money? This is where we draw together the two issues which we are discussing today – the Draft Supplementary and Amending Budget, with massive movements of money on the one hand and own resources on the other. In other words, the issue is this: how much is the public actually paying for Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, there is no need to be frightened about telling the public what we are doing. We have good arguments, we have very good policy areas and policies, and we can present them persuasively. There is no need to be frightened of the public: we simply need to approach them very openly and transparently, and invite them to work with us on building Europe here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to express my sincere thanks to the rapporteurs, Mrs Haug, Mr Ferber and Mr Costa Neves. Last year’s accounts are astonishing: they show a surplus of more than eleven billion euros. This is because revenue was EUR 3.3 billion more than was estimated and expenditure EUR 8.5 billion less than forecast. The increase in revenue is a good thing. However, the saving in expenditure is deceptive, based, as it is, mainly on the lamentable under-utilisation of Structural Funds. A good 20% of payments were not taken up, amounting to EUR 6.5 billion. These payments will be carried over to the years following, meaning that no real savings have been made at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reason for under-utilisation was that new Objective programmes were slow to be approved. Only half of the EU Objective 1 programmes came to be approved in 2000, almost two years after the Agenda 2000 decision taken in Berlin. Just 8% of the Objective 2 programmes were approved. No money at all was spent on new Community initiatives for the second year in succession. Administrative payments are in a pitiful state. The Commission must improve its ability to pay considerably. It has to bear the responsibility for seeing to it that matters are dealt with efficiently and on time. The present omissions will be reflected as backlogs in budgets in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The other peculiarity in the accounts is the reduction in the refund made in respect of the United Kingdom’s contribution. It is odd that amendments should be made to this supplementary budget that go back to the budgets of two and four years ago. Why were these amendments not made at the time?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Costa Neves’s report provides a good basis for discussions next year. According to preliminary estimates, administrative expenditure of the institutions under heading 5 will exceed the financial perspectives, which is mainly due to the increase of more than 9% in the Council’s expenditure, which, in turn, is the result of a rise in CFSP expenditure. Parliament must strongly insist on its demand that a separate plan showing a structure of the posts involved in the administration of this policy should be put forward. This expenditure is not part of a gentleman’s agreement between Parliament and the Council according to which the institutions do not interfere in one another’s budgets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tables appended to Mrs Haug’s report and dedicated to the subject of own resources do not give a correct picture of the different share of contributions among the Member States. It has to be said aloud that the United Kingdom is one of the EU members getting a free ride. It has been given a reduction on contributions. It should form part of the report’s conclusions that the United Kingdom should be made to pay its contribution according to the same principles as everyone else. In addition, the report’s statistics disguise the real situation with respect to the customs duties the UK collects on behalf of the EU. But customs duties disguise the share of contributions made by Holland and Belgium still more, as these countries also collect customs duties on goods bound for other countries. Holland and Belgium are not the large net contributors the figures show them to be.</p>
<p class="contents">The report’s conclusions call for the introduction of a special European tax. This is no mere accident. The country holding the presidency, Belgium, has also announced it will pursue the issue. There are two different opinions on this in our group. The tax is supported by those who are guided by the spirit of European federalism, while those who wish to preserve their national sovereignty are opposed to the EU having the power to levy and collect taxes. Federalism is the making of the European Union into a federal state. If the EU is given the power to levy and collect taxes we will be paving the way for federalism. As a representative of taxpayers in a small net contributor country I cannot endorse European taxation for the purposes of a federal state. Mrs Haug’s conclusion in her report is too radical. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have read the notes on the work programme by the Belgian presidency and there is little or no reference to it. There is only one reference to the tax on flows of speculative capital – the so-called Tobin tax. That was voted down by Parliament only a few months ago. At the end of the document there is also reference to direct or indirect funding of the European Union, so that we can once again operate with the European Union’s own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I put to her that the Prime Minister of Belgium only, in the last few days, said that he does not want to pursue this path towards a European Union tax because "it is sensitive". It is very much a sensitive matter and totally unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Haug mentions that the amount of money coming in from the nation-states through gross national product is going to rise. I accept that. I sat in the House of Commons in the United Kingdom for 18 years before coming into this Chamber. I always thought it was marvellous that the percentage of gross national product coming into European spending was declining. That downward path has continued during the last two years. I applaud that. It shows good and effective control of spending and nation-states do not mind passing on that money to the European Union. I see no reason whatsoever for the European Union to raise its own direct tax. That is why I have tabled four amendments tomorrow for voting. Two of those will be on a roll-call vote. You can see this evening that there is opposition from various countries. I hope that people will vote in support of my amendments and oppose the European tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Färm (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me first thank the rapporteur, Mr Costa Neves, for his proposal and for such good cooperation. We on the Committee on Budgets have reached agreement on most areas.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my guess that, this year, it will be issues of principle which dominate the budget debate more than individual budget items, issues which will feature increasingly in the debate in the coming years. I am thinking particularly about enlargement and the development of a common foreign and security policy and its budgetary effects. I am thinking of the reform of the agricultural and fisheries policies. In addition, I am thinking of internal reform, especially the Commission’s ability to actually implement the decisions of the budgetary authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic conditions are quite worrying. Popular faith in the EU is waning in many Member States. At the same time, we are on the threshold of perhaps the most important change ever – eastward enlargement. In the face of this challenge, the EU’s ability to carry out its priorities <span class="italic">must</span> be strengthened considerably. It is therefore worrying, even if some finance ministers are rubbing their hands with glee, that the level of budgetary implementation is so low that we now have to pay back EUR 11 billion to Member States. The problem of promises of aid and assistance being delayed or not being carried out is an obstacle to the whole Union. It is therefore good that the Commission now wants to increase payments and reform the work in the direction of more modern, efficient and open management. This is something that the Council must not change.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the points at issue, I want first to raise the subject of the Common Agricultural Policy. Although this is a large and complicated issue, we must now increase the pace of change. Before we adopt the budget for 2002 and, above all, before we fully conclude negotiations with the prospective Member States, we absolutely must be clearer about the future Common Agricultural Policy. In this context, I would like to point out the view of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. This committee is seeking, in its proposals for amendments, to confirm that agricultural expenditure is to be kept within the framework of the budget, but although there are technical difficulties, especially in the light of enlargement, they are also seeking to redistribute funds in the interest of comprehensive development of the countryside, category 1B. This is to be welcomed, and I believe that we should continue on this path. Otherwise, we are currently mostly concerned with the reason for the Commission wanting such large reserves for BSE and foot and mouth disease when they still have the opportunity of adjusting the proposed budget themselves. In this respect, we would like to postpone any further decision on our position until we have received more answers to our questions.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also briefly comment on the breakdown of the fisheries agreement with Morocco. The fact that this cannot now be implemented will have consequences for the fishing fleets of several countries. I, for one, am sceptical about the EU’s major subsidies within the agricultural and fisheries policies, but we must still, of course, take into account the problems of the fishermen who have been counting on new opportunities for earning a living. We must support proactive restructuring and test the possibility of creating funds for this under budget headings other than category 4. In addition, there is a need for developed proposals from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the conciliation into which we are currently entering primarily concerns headings 1, 2 and 5, we would like to take the opportunity to highlight a few other points. Last year, Parliament promoted an extra focus on employment and small businesses. Following the development of the Lisbon Process at the Stockholm Summit, there is every reason to keep to this set of priorities. As such, we must also clear up a number of the problems about which Mr Pronk, for example, spoke earlier. In addition, we would now also like to focus on the area of e-learning, which we believe must receive resources in order for it to be developed into the key area it must become if we are to be able to increase growth and ensure that this growth is more evenly distributed across Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally: we are also concerned about the external undertakings. They have presented the greatest difficulty in 2000 and 2001. These problems have not, of course, gone away. We have made considerable commitments to Kosovo and Yugoslavia, at the same time as having major and neglected needs to meet in other, even poorer areas of the world. This is one of our most vital tasks, but we have huge problems which we must be able to solve in order to implement everything we have promised. Although there are major challenges ahead of us, I nonetheless believe that, with good will, we will be able to solve them together. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The setbacks are the outbreaks of animal diseases. The impact of those setbacks for the following year will probably not be fully known to us until the end of October, to be exact.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: the strokes of luck will not last forever. We can expect setbacks in the form of outbreaks every year. I am about to repeat what I said last year, the year before that and God knows how long before that.</p>
<p class="contents">It is irresponsible, in my opinion, to have EUR 41 million earmarked in the budget for the outbreak of infectious animal diseases. If we consider how much BSE and swine fever outbreaks have cost, and what foot and mouth is costing now, then those 41 million are a mere pittance.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the Commission should adopt a structural approach in order to improve the situation. Is it possible to have insurance cover in place? Is it possible to have a specific cattle fund, and does it not amount to distortion of competition if the national portion in one country is to be paid by the farmers, while it is entirely government-funded in other countries?</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the aspects which the Commission, the Member States and the rapporteur need to work on in the short term, for it is quite likely that we will be experiencing setbacks of this kind again in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It comes around every year. The positions are well known, and in a way it seems quite unnecessary to repeat the debate and decisions year after year.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from the questions of pure principle, one might wonder whether higher and new taxes are what EU Member States and EU citizens really need. We are all highly taxed. Certain Member States have some of the highest taxation levels in the world – I myself come from one such country. If we look at them, it is hardly these countries which have experienced the greatest economic growth in the last decade. Of course the report talks about tax <span class="italic">in total </span>not increasing. However this is a theoretical proposition which has very little to do with practical reality. I also believe it is the case that if a tax is introduced, particularly a new tax level as in this case, taxation will also increase. It is almost inevitable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention the fact that the rapporteur says he is seeking to strengthen the link between the Union and its citizens’. This is no doubt admirable and important, but in my view it should happen in a completely different manner. I am very doubtful <span class="italic">indeed</span> whether people would feel any stronger connection with the EU through having to pay higher taxes than they do already. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There have been calls here for fiscal autonomy and codecision for income and expenditure, but first we must achieve suitable and fair funding of Community policies and we already know that there are differing opinions about the most efficient system for achieving it.</p>
<p class="contents">Sooner or later we will have to reach a permanent agreement, but first we will have to debate and clarify the issues selected at the Nice Council. It seems a pointless exercise to talk about a new philosophy for own resources without having cleared up the fundamental unknown factors first. It is not very prudent to begin building a house from the roof. In any event, to use the argument of the issue of net balances – as has been done – does not move in the right direction, but, for many reasons, contributes to undermining the principles of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The question today is whether the new decision on own resources effectively makes progress towards greater equity and transparency and takes more account of the Member States’ tax capacity. It is clear that the gradual reduction of the maximum reference rate for the VAT resource contributes to correcting the regressive aspects of the system in force. The Member States’ contributions via the fourth resource or VAT must be proportionate with their contribution to the Community GDP as a key element of safeguarding the equity of the system. Therefore we must keep up our efforts in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also has some negative aspects, which are far from negligible. The maintenance, albeit with a modification of the calculation system, of the so-called correction of budgetary imbalances in favour of the United Kingdom, confirms that this procedure is totally contrary to the desired transparency and simplicity.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the 2002 budget, I would like to point out that the Costa Neves report – and I congratulate the rapporteur on his work – provides the necessary elements for a good negotiation. I believe that there is a margin for reaching final agreements with the Council. I would ask the Commission to fulfil its commitment to propose a suitable instrument and funding to deal with the failure of the fishing agreement with Morocco, which also means that the aid can be used in projects for alternative economic activity in the regions affected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, rapporteurs, honourable Members, there is always a lot to do, discuss and decide where budgets are concerned, and today we have just had four important points: the two supplementary budgets for the current financial year, the resolution on financing the budget and the preparations for the first reading of the 2002 budget in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Amending Budget No 3/2001 is concerned solely with personnel matters, in the field of research and in OLAF. Amending Budget No 4/2001 is concerned with the use of the budget surplus from last year. Both budgets are discussed in the report by Mrs Haug and Mr Ferber. In the matter of the Commission’s research personnel, they suggest a different establishment plan. This is acceptable to the Commission. So far as the change to the OLAF establishment plan is concerned, this is now based on a compromise arrived at in lengthy negotiations and I should like at this point to make a few observations about it. Firstly, a comment on the fact that the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control which is before us today still speaks of serious irregularities in OLAF, specifically that there are more A grade officials than posts.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this word “irregularities” I should simply like to point out once again that the budgetary authority authorised a certain number of grade A posts for the year 2000 establishment plan. Not all of them were actually filled by the Commission or OLAF, but when it came to the 2001 budget the budgetary authority then decided to cut the number of grade A posts to fewer than there were officials in place. Nothing like that has ever happened before and of course it creates difficulties, but to call it an irregularity and to create the impression that the Commission has filled posts it was not authorised to is simply not correct and I must reject the term irregularities in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that the Commission passed the OLAF Director’s establishment plan proposals on to the budgetary authority unchanged precisely in order to underline OLAF’s independence. On the other hand, some of the European Parliament’s resolutions amount to very detailed micromanagement, which naturally at least raises a few questions as regards independence.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the fact that posts are being blocked and also that unfortunately not all posts have yet been approved is not exactly making it easy for OLAF to operate, and the authority does now have some really big tasks, and above all a wide range of different tasks, to cope with. I can at this point only assure you once again that the Commission is doing all it can to create good working conditions for OLAF.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the second Supplementary and Amending Budget. The year 2000 budget ended with a surplus of EUR 11.6 billion, as has been mentioned here several times. This is in part the result of increased revenue, the fruit, for example, of a more favourable trend in gross national product than was initially assumed, but for the greater part it is the result of resources not being implemented on the expenditure side. I must now say something about structural policy – it is after all the largest chunk, accounting for 6 of these 11 billion – namely that account was already taken of the fact that it would probably be difficult to implement all resources in the first year when the Interinstitutional Agreement was drawn up and signed. That was more or less taken for granted and it was therefore decided that commitments could be redeployed for subsequent years, and that is what has been done, which ensures that no resources are lost to the Structural Funds because of implementation difficulties in the first year.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion to be drawn from this is in my opinion that we must start much earlier with preparations and decision making for a future support period. I should like to point out, for example, that Parliament’s position on the Community initiatives was adopted in April 2000. We can see here that the whole process began too late. In other words, we must simply set an earlier timetable for the next support period. That applies to everyone, it applies to the Commission, it applies to Parliament and it also applies, of course, to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the entire resources of EUR 11.6 bn are not being returned. EUR 1.6 bn were already deployed in the 2001 budget, among other things to finance the BSE measures decided in Supplementary Budget No 1. EUR 2 075 bn are used to finance the budget correction for the United Kingdom, and unlike the previous speakers I am not looking at Mr Wynn here.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also proposed using EUR 350 million to top up the resources for reconstruction in the Balkans and to return the other part, namely EUR 7.5 bn, to the Member States by reducing their contributions to the 2001 budget accordingly. The rapporteurs are now proposing that not just EUR 350 million but 450 million be used to top up the resources for the Balkans. The Commission actually wanted to fund the difference by making further transfers from other areas, but we now agree to your proposal, especially in the light of the time factor, which is very important. We really do not want to run the risk of having to suspend payments for measures for Kosovo or Serbia. We all know how sensitive this area is and I very much hope that Parliament’s proposal in this connection will meet with the Council’s agreement so that the entire proposal can be adopted before the summer break.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the present motion for a resolution on own resources. The subject is becoming increasingly topical because of the question of what is the best way to finance the European budget. On the one hand, of course, we have the following situation: a new decision has been taken on own resources with a new structure, and this own resources decision naturally applies until something else is decided, with everything that goes with it, including the British rebate. That is the law as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the structure of financing is concerned, the Treaty states that the public budget is financed out of own resources. That is what it says in the Treaty. The agreement with Parliament in 1975, for example, also stressed again that they should be genuine own resources. But instead, the <span class="italic">de facto </span>trend has been in quite a different direction, and you showed in detail in your report, Mrs Haug, that it has taken a different direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the financing that we currently have, I simply have to say that it is not transparent for the citizen. It is one of the most serious points, that hardly any citizen knows how the EU is financed, and what they do not know is all the more unfathomable and leaves room for every kind of speculation. For my own part, I can only say once more that I very much welcome the fact that the Belgian presidency intends taking up this matter of how the EU budget is financed and, Mr Ferber, I consider it to be a subject forming part of the whole issue of the delimitation of competences between the Member States and the European level. That is where it really belongs.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is of course also quite important that all who welcome a restructuring on the revenue side should now also find a common vocabulary as soon as possible. If we talk about introducing an EU tax, that sounds like inventing some new kind of tax that the European Union will be entitled to levy. That is not what it is about at all. It is about specifying a tax, some or all of which will flow into the European budget, where responsibility for the amount raised will lie at European level, and it naturally also involves the problems of the European Parliament’s budgetary powers. From my own point of view, I can only stress what Mrs Haug said, that the real issue is: will the European Parliament continue to have these reduced budgetary powers on the revenue side as it does on the expenditure side?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe an opportunity has presented itself, and we should in my opinion go with the momentum when the Council presidency raises the issue on its own initiative, because if it is not adopted as a topic for Laeken at this point in time, I fear the matter will be buried again and we shall not be able to debate it for a long time.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to Mr Costa Neves’s report. This concerns the conciliation procedure before the Council’s first reading on 20 July, preparations for which take place in the trialogue on 9 July. I should again like to stress that the 9 July trialogue is of course also an important date, an important point in the whole budgetary procedure. Since Mrs Theato is here, I should like to make a brief comment. Mrs Theato, you sent me a rather strongly worded letter asking me kindly to come to the Committee on Budgetary Control to debate a periodic report on 9 July instead of going to the trialogue. I must again point out that I cannot of course be in two places at once and it goes without saying that it is part of the budget Commissioner’s duties to take part in the trialogue in preparation for the conciliation procedure for the 2002 budget.</p>
<p class="contents">But now to the points that will be at the centre of the conciliation. Mr Costa Neves has described these in detail. I should like to say the following. Firstly, I consider the Commission’s proposal to provide a EUR 1 bn reserve in the agriculture budget to be highly appropriate given the uncertainty surrounding the direction agricultural expenditure will take in the forthcoming year. We now have the first bills for foot and mouth disease on the table and more will come in, and they confirm that a large reserve is really necessary. We ought to play safe, and we will of course be able to be more precise in the Letter of Amendment in the autumn, including on the question of how much we shall have to pay from the budget for foot and mouth disease. But for the present I believe the level of reserve proposed is the best way forward and I very much hope that the European Parliament will support this in the conciliation procedure with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the abortive fisheries agreement with Morocco, which has been mentioned by several speakers here. It is an important point; I therefore want to speak about it briefly. The Commission plans to propose a cofinancing programme to assist with the restructuring of the Spanish and Portuguese fleets concerned by the end of July. It will be a programme financed in the category of the structural funds. But now you will say the structural funds category is empty or fully committed. The Commission will for this reason be making a proposal that the flexibility reserve, or part of it, be used to finance this restructuring programme. It would then be a one-year programme, implementation of which may extend over several years.</p>
<p class="contents">How the resources released in category IV by the abortive fisheries agreement should be used will have to be considered weighing up every aspect, including, and I say this expressly, the aspect of budgetary discipline.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of common foreign and security policy, Parliament takes the view that resources could be cut this year, too. In fact, the preliminary draft budget is the same as the 2001 budget, and the Commission sees no need for further cuts here, but the Commission will, of course, assist the rapporteur as requested in order to improve the budget commentaries.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a word on administrative expenditure. I share the European Parliament’s concern about the future trend of Category V and I therefore fully support the efforts for greater transparency and ease of planning for any new areas of activity, such as justice and home affairs. But I also want to make clear that it is not the expenditure on Commission reform that is putting a strain on the financial framework here. We all have to consider necessary reforms, and I believe it is essential that all institutions try to put forward a medium-term plan so that we can see where changes are necessary in order to get to grips with Category V. We really need to give thought to whether a high level group or similar should be deployed to deal with these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">You have drawn attention, Mr Costa Neves, to the report that the European Parliament had called for and which deals, among other things, with matters of budget implementation. I should like to thank you for the positive comment that it was completed on time and that it is a useful tool for discussing the questions raised in Parliament’s declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">There will also be close cooperation in the field of any actions included in the budget by the European Parliament. As also agreed, the Commission will be involved in the discussion by the various committees at an early stage in order to ensure that actions and pilot schemes can be implemented. That, too, is important for us and I should like to highlight in particular the areas of asylum and immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief word on priorities in <span class="italic">e-learning</span> and employment policy as they affect small and medium-sized enterprises. These are areas where large sums of money are available not only in the budget lines of Heading 3 but also in the structural funds, and the Commission believes that the new instruments introduced in the last budget must first prove their worth before they are substantially increased or expanded.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, all this shows how much we still have to discuss. Over the coming months we must work out the year 2000 budget together, and I hope that we shall be able to make good use of the next few weeks and the forthcoming meetings to arrive at common positions so that we shall have a good start to the budget negotiations.</p>

I am rather surprised to hear her say I wrote her a strongly worded letter. She quotes me as having written that she should kindly come to the Committee on Budgetary Control. That cannot be true. I wrote a businesslike letter in which I asked her to come to us in the Committee for Budgetary Control in accordance with our agreement between the Commission and Parliament. If Mrs Schreyer has other commitments, I do, however, assume that she is able to send a senior official to give the Committee the information it requires. The letter has no other meaning. Mrs Schreyer, I am somewhat astonished that you read the letter in that way. It was entirely businesslike. I just wanted to explain that. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
