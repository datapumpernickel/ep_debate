Once adopted it will have a direct impact on about 15 million new passenger cars presented for registration in the EU each year and, to a certain extent, on more than 200 million used passenger cars circulating on the roads of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is designed to benefit the internal market, the citizens, the car industry and the environment. First of all, the proposal contains a number of measures needing to be taken at Community level in order to improve the functioning of the internal market, mainly by abolishing registration taxes – which currently involve unnecessary cost and administrative burdens, the lack of transparency and legal uncertainty for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed Community measures are furthermore aimed at avoiding double payment of car-related taxes, when a car registered in a Member State is exported or permanently moved for registration to another Member State. Registration taxes also involve high costs and reduced competitiveness for the car industry and result in the fragmentation of the car market.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal also promotes sustainability by implementing fiscal measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from passenger cars, as it establishes a more direct relationship between taxation levels and carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to mention that the application of the proposed measure is budget neutral: the gradual abolition of registration tax and its replacement by an annual circulation tax does not involve revenue losses for the national budgets, nor does it increase the total tax burden for citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal takes a minimalist approach to car taxation and addresses only those issues that can best be dealt with at Community level. It only seeks to establish the principle and structure of passenger car related taxes; it does not seek to harmonise tax rates, which will continue to remain the responsibility of the Member States. It does not introduce new car taxes, but instead provides for the gradual abolition of registration taxes in the 16 Member States currently applying such taxes, as well as for their gradual replacement by an annual circulation tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal has been discussed only once in the Council so far, and the reaction of the Member States has been mixed. Strong support from the European Parliament can maintain the momentum and help the Council reach a unanimous decision. I want to emphasise that the proposed measures would make passenger car taxation citizen-friendly, car-industry-friendly and environment-friendly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jan Marinus Wiersma (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I think we are discussing an important topic today. A considerable proportion of the C02 that we all send into the atmosphere is accounted for by car exhaust fumes. Road transport is responsible for some 25% of European CO2 emissions, half of which is attributable to cars. As such, a reduction in CO2 emissions by our fleet of cars can make an important contribution to the Kyoto objectives to which the European Union has committed itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Only last year, in its report on climate change, this House pointed at the need for a considerable improvement in energy efficiency in the transport sector. Alongside this, technological innovation is of major importance in order to be able to achieve our climate objectives. Tax measures can be very effective in this. By differentiating taxes according to impact on the environment, we can discourage harmful practices, promote economy drives and stimulate technological innovation. In that light, we welcome the Commission proposal to differentiate annual road tax depending on CO2 emission, according to which a proportion of annual road tax would be calculated on the basis of the quantity of CO2 emitted by the car per km.</p>
<p class="contents">A car which is more economic in its fuel consumption, and therefore uses less CO2, will cost less, and we in this House also want other substances, such as nitrogen oxide and soot particles, included in the equation. It is important, though, that we apply a calculation basis that is progressive. That means that heavier engines that use more fuel and contribute more to climate change will, in relative terms, be taxed more heavily. Accordingly, there are low thresholds for driving modest models, whilst people will need to pay a price for driving around in the most expensive and biggest cars, which cause most environmental damage. We do not support the proposal of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to bring forward the date on which the directive enters into force. In our view, Member States need to be given the time to do the groundwork properly.</p>
<p class="contents">The second and, I believe, most controversial part of the proposal, alongside differentiating car tax, is to abolish registration tax on new cars. Whilst, according to the Commission, this solves a few internal market problems, it will, it believes, also accelerate the renewal rate of the fleet of cars, so that old and environmentally-unfriendly cars will make way for new and clean cars more quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that opinions on this subject within my group are divided, and I, as rapporteur for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, would just like to add that I made a proposal of my own, which did not make it to the finishing line, though, not to abolish this registration tax. I think that, based on the experience in my own country, this registration tax can also be used to promote the use of environmentally-friendly cars, the sale of which in the Netherlands has been boosted enormously through their no longer being taxed. Members of my group will, then, vote in different ways, but it is important that the Commissioner is aware that people are divided on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commissioner said something about the Council and mixed reactions. I wish him much strength, because although this is a rather important discussion, and this House, as we also know, takes a degree of pleasure in it happening, in the Council, though, a proposal such as this will probably quickly be vetoed out by one of the Member States in a flat refusal to talk about taxation at European level. Nevertheless, I hope that the Commissioner will succeed in achieving, in principle, a breakthrough on this score. I wish him good luck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The draft report she produced was a good one. Some of the points in it proved controversial when we came to vote on them. Where one of them – Article 4 – is concerned, a contradiction remains in the report that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has adopted, for we adopted two different – and mutually exclusive – versions of it, and it is for that reason that our group wants to reiterate our desire that the future tax on motor vehicles should be levied strictly in proportion to the amount of CO2 emitted.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Wiersma said earlier, energy efficiency is of course an issue, but any attempt to use tax policy to regulate everything you possibly can will end in failure. Our position is quite clear: we want tax to be strictly proportionate to CO2 emissions, without reference to the technology used, to the use to which the vehicle is put or to how big it is; in other words, we want it to be purely environmental. If an attempt were to be made to use this instrument to instigate some sort of campaign against larger cars, then that would be mistaken, for it is the bigger models, the more expensive cars, that make technological progress in the manufacturing of cars possible, in that it is they that are first fitted with important safety features and first take environmental considerations into account, since it is in these expensive cars that a new technology can be better developed.</p>
<p class="contents">No more calumnies on big cars, then; instead, let us stick with the objective we all share – that of achieving 120 mg per kilometre by 2010. That is difficult enough as a project, one that demands considerable efforts of some of the Member States, particularly of the new one, where the cars on the road are older than the average for the European Union. We need a degree of flexibility if our common objective of renewing the stock of motor vehicles is not to result in discrimination within the European internal market, and that is why we too believe – as a resolution of the Committee attests – that the Commission should additionally produce a study by 31 December of this year about what importance should be attached to factors other than CO2, in order to ensure a compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">We, though, have no desire to bring about a reduction in CO2 by dealing with all the other pollutants that are already being emitted, and that is where the divide between the groups lies, although I do believe that we can come to an understanding about this. We have tabled an amendment – the amendment in question is number 40 – to the effect that the Member States should be given the option of giving separate treatment to old cars that have been licensed for at least twenty years. As a rule, these old cars, being based on old-style technology, put out quite a lot of pollutants, but there are so few of them on the market that we can deal with them in the same way that several Member States are doing already.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as registration tax is concerned, I am persuaded that it should be dropped once certain transitional periods are over; it is an obstacle to the European single market, and so we should agree to let it expire in such a way that not only are the Member States’ fiscal interests taken into account but also an orderly transition is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude by saying that I wish you, Commissioner, a great deal of success. I know how difficult European fiscal policy is; harmonising it brings one up against problems wherever one turns. On many fronts, we are making next to no headway, and as long as unanimity is required, it will be difficult to make the sort of progress that really is of some use. With this in mind, we endorse the report and support you in your difficult task as Commissioner for tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">That is why the proposal formulated by the European Parliament, as contained in the rapporteur's report, should aim both at obtaining consent to the completion of the internal market and introducing fiscal convergence on passenger car related matters.</p>
<p class="contents">As a matter of principle, it cannot be disputed, at least not by the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, that taxation must gradually be combined with protection and improvement of the environment, as indicated in the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in order for this principle to be more broadly accepted and applied on a broader scale by the Member States, certain preconditions must be put into place, as mentioned in the rapporteur's report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, tax revenue losses from the abolition of registration taxes could, if the Member State so wishes, be covered by parallel increases of revenue from annual circulation taxes over a gentle and gradual ten-year adjustment period. The Commission proposes gradual abolition over five years; the European Parliament proposes ten.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the proposal to introduce a registration and annual circulation tax refund system for vehicles exported and transferred definitively to another Member State should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, a highly intricate passenger car taxation system should be avoided in future in order to achieve the objective of harmonisation laid down in this directive as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that the adjustment, from the year 2008, of annual circulation tax demands, on the basis of carbon dioxide emissions, should be examined by the Commission and the automobile industry should be given the chance to adapt.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers cannot be charged high annual circulation taxes due to high pollutants. The cost of adjustment must be borne by the automobile industry as it adjusts, while consumer associations must act on the question of transparency in the application of the directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to congratulate the rapporteur in her absence on an excellent report, which, I believe, is a very significant contribution to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I personally agree that taxation is the responsibility of the individual Member State. However, the thrust of this proposal would improve the functioning of the single market and, crucially, would greatly assist in our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions, without compromising the ability of any country to levy its own taxes. Ireland has one of the highest rates of VRT in Europe, with almost 10% of the total tax take coming from motorists. Last year its figures for VRT alone were in excess of EUR 1.5 billion, an increase of over 20% on the previous year, so the fact that Ireland will not be supporting this proposal will come as little surprise. But this is a short-sighted and short-term viewpoint, and we need to look at the wider implications.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe VRT is an anti-free market mechanism and one of the reasons why the EU passenger car market has not been functioning well. Indeed, consumers in nine Member States, including Ireland, have been penalised by a measure which has reduced their purchasing choices. The Commission’s proposal is a sensible one, particularly from an environmental perspective, since taxes levied on motorists would be linked to carbon dioxide emissions from the vehicle. Indeed, I agree with the suggestion in the report that other pollutant emissions should be part of the equation, although it might be difficult to include this measure initially.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think it is an excellent idea that Member States be encouraged to apply fiscal incentives for passenger cars, in order to encourage the placing on the market of cars and vehicles that meet energy-saving and energy efficiency requirements. When governments set targets for reducing CO2 emissions, they have a responsibility to introduce mechanisms and structures that will facilitate this. The Commission’s proposal is an excellent one and I fully support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When you burn one kilo of petrol or diesel, you produce more than three kilos of carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions from traffic have increased by almost a third since 1990. This completely wipes out the effect of a large proportion of the reductions in emissions in other sectors. From 2003 to 2004 alone, emissions in Europe increased so much that it was the equivalent of three million people driving their vehicles right around the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The European automotive industry is not going to achieve the emissions reductions for cars it promises by 2008. It is therefore important to boost incentives for vehicles that produce fewer emissions. The Commission’s proposal is not the best possible option in this respect. Taxation on vehicles in Member States varies widely. Abolition of registration tax in all countries will not make things better for the environment. Studies in the Netherlands show that the most effective way of getting consumers to choose vehicles that produce fewer emissions is a differentiated registration tax based on carbon dioxide emissions, as is the system in Denmark, for example. In Finland, on the other hand, car tax actually punishes those who buy vehicles that produce fewer emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">For changes in taxation actually to bring about a reduction in emissions, it is important to oblige Member States to ensure that any changes they make to the national taxation system are a step forward for the environment. If registration tax is replaced with an annual circulation tax, it needs to relate to carbon dioxide emissions rather more stringently than merely proportionately. It must also take account of emissions other than carbon dioxide. Furthermore, the tax should also apply to SUVs, that is to say, N1 vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">On the whole, the best solution would be one which, if possible, combined a differentiated registration tax based on emissions and an annual circulation tax. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance also believes that this should be possible. The export of vehicles from one country to another and the taxation solutions associated with it could be dealt with in another way, through a system of compensation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has resulted in an enormous amount of space being taken up by car parks and motorways, bringing with them noise pollution, air pollution and a lack of traffic safety. Now that cars are the most commonly used mode of transport, and the road infrastructure is very extensive, complex and expensive, we cannot avoid the question of who will be footing the bill for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Various Member States, when determining car tax, already take greater account of the pollution they cause. Unfortunately, the proposal for a directive is a half-hearted one since it appears to be mainly pursuing other objectives. A simultaneous attempt is being made, without this contributing to less pollution, to harmonise taxes in the Member States and to give the car market new growth opportunities by introducing a price reduction from 2016.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the draft directive, which aims to integrate the emission of cars gradually and partially in motorised vehicle tax, a quarter of tax should be based on the CO2 emission by the end of 2008 and half by 2010, but why stop there? Why did the Commission not propose right away to take the emission of NOx and soot particles, as well as the car’s fuel efficiency as a basis for calculating motorised vehicle tax, rather than wait for amendments? Why has the Commission, for the past ten years, not shown any support for Germany Greenpeace’s initiative to develop a car that uses half the amount of petrol? Instead, the Commission would like to gradually phase out registration tax on cars across the European Union and, in so doing, make the car cheaper in 16 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, taxes and the differences in them have been a matter of national autonomy and national considerations. If the Union does more than combat tax havens and other forms of large-scale tax evasion, it goes beyond its line of duty. The aim should be to reduce harmful emissions rather than provide the car industry, even after the market has been saturated, with customers who are keen to buy the latest model every year. My group has rejected a ban on registration tax.</p>
<p class="contents">Car emissions have over the past ten years increased by 30%, despite the Kyoto Agreement and despite technical improvements. Since the increase in the number of cars and the average mileage more than cancel out the technological benefits, my group believes that doing things by halves is no longer an option. As far as we are concerned, not just 50% of car tax should be based on their CO2 emission, but 100% on the pollution they cause. The easiest way of solving this is by changing motorised vehicle tax into a levy on fuel according to the emissions. In that way, it is the air polluter that pays, and not the car owner.</p>
<p class="contents">New cars will need to meet strict fuel efficiency requirements, and priority will need to be given to soot filters becoming compulsory in diesel cars. In addition, the car mileage will need to come down, and that is only possible by providing robust, healthy and affordable public transport. Belt-tightening measures and privatisation in this sector, supported by the European Union, have so far had only the opposite effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps it is not surprising that the European Union Member States have very different tax systems in place for passenger cars, but I am astonished at the argument by governments as to why this system should not be changed and gradually be harmonised at the European Union level. The arguments are of all varieties, covering taxation, administration and subsidiarity, but in essence they boil down to the argument that I found in the draft of my own country’s position. There, we read ‘if it ain’t broke, why fix it?’ I have always been an advocate of the subsidiarity principle in the field of direct taxes. Can a small and medium-sized European Union Member State, however, really carry out its own tax policy with respect to passenger cars with a specific goal of environmental protection or energy efficiency? By way of example, a few years ago in Latvia there was an attempt to sharply increase registration and annual taxes for very powerful motor cars. What happened then is what is also happening in other European countries – Latvians registered their cars in neighbouring Lithuania. I am therefore convinced that the reduction of CO2 emissions or other environmental goals in this field must be tackled at the European Union level, not at the level of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that, in view of the widely differing views of the governments of EU Member States on these issues, I think that Parliament ought to take a very even-handed step, and make the wording of this draft directive likely to be accepted unanimously by the Council, to avoid its being rejected for its very nature. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having, on behalf of my group, helped to produce the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I, too, have had to give this dossier my attention, and I would like now to concentrate on two principal points. Firstly, I would like to say how much I welcome the Commission’s proposal for the abolition of vehicle registration tax. It is this that leads me to endorse the report, subject to the condition that the progressive abolition of vehicle registration tax is retained.</p>
<p class="contents">Among those Member States that levy a registration tax, there are massive differences not only as regards the amount of the tax but also the basis on which it is calculated. Of all the charges levied on private motor vehicles in Europe, it is in registration tax that the widest variations are to be found, and, as these differences interfere with the smooth functioning of the internal market, the proposal for the abolition of registration tax should be acted on.</p>
<p class="contents">Along with my colleagues, in particular Mr Langen, I also endorse a direct proportional link between the tax burden and the amount of CO2 emitted. Every gram of CO2 discharged into the atmosphere has the same effect on climate and should therefore be subject to the same amount of tax. In doing this, the tax must also be technology-neutral; proportionate taxation guarantees that vehicles producing higher levels of CO2 will be taxed more than those that produce less, and that is crucial in terms of climate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that pollutants such as NOx and particulates should be included in the tax base for motor vehicle taxes in order to encourage environmentally-friendly cars. With this end in mind, we in the Committee on the Environment have already managed to get these amendments accepted, and tomorrow in the plenary I will be voting in favour of the report as a whole and of Amendments 10 and 19 in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What Parliament is about to approve is a specific package of measures for the other, equally important, objective, which we can call a Europe for the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">As everyone knows, the European Parliament is only consulted on taxation matters and the final decision rests with the Council, which has to come to a unanimous conclusion. Our hope is that the national governments will support this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs voted in favour of the proposal by a considerable majority because it aims at gradually abolishing vehicle registration tax and identifying common European standards for national circulation taxes to be linked to pollutant emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important measure that is only apparently of specialist and limited interest, since in fact it affects most people. Of course, it is not yet perfect and much more could be done, but it is moving in the right direction: it is a step forwards on the road to convergence, if not to genuine harmonisation of legislation within the confines of Europe, transcending national borders.</p>

Finland’s stock of cars is therefore one of the oldest in Europe, meaning old-fashioned safety solutions and less environmentally friendly cars. That definitely cannot be sensible. There is therefore a strong argument in favour of a more uniform road tax in the EU, and I therefore welcome the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for us to devise a road tax based on how much pollution is caused by cars. In that way we can reduce carbon dioxide emissions and acid rain. It is a fact that pollution from cars is one of the biggest sources of pollution of the Baltic Sea. A uniform road tax would also mean a more efficient common market and more efficient competition. As I say, new cars are also safer. We should thus be killing two or more birds with one stone. I therefore believe that Parliament should give its strong support to restructuring road tax – so strong that the national governments cannot ignore the signal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a blocking minority in the Council, and that is something of which we in Denmark approve – most of us, anyway - for the high registration tax has meant that, in Denmark as in a number of other countries, we have fewer and fewer cars. It is the purchase of cars that determines how many cars will be driven. If people own cars, they will drive them. A high registration tax is therefore a very good thing if we want to limit the number of cars. Go to Denmark or the Netherlands, and you will see that it works.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, a registration tax of this kind, as well as an annual tax, should be established on the basis of consumption. It should not be arranged on a proportional basis, as proposed here, but in such a way that we obtain results reminiscent of those we have seen in connection with refrigerators. A noticeable difference has been made where proper tax increases have been implemented. From almost every point of view, the present proposal will involve environmental damage. We are seeing many more cars, and with proportionality there will be more cars that are significantly more polluting and that consume more energy.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, there is a lot to suggest that Volkswagen and other representatives of the car industry have successfully got a handle on this matter, and when I hear the car industry lobbying really hard in Denmark to have registration tax abolished, I know that it is, of course, because they are counting on selling more cars as a result. They are not counting on selling cleaner cars or cars that consume less energy. On the contrary, they are producing huge numbers of cars that cause a very great deal of pollution and consume a very great deal of energy. I would therefore thank you for not allowing this proposal to be implemented. We hope to see a better proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Evasion is, after all, very lucrative, because the tax is high and the chances of being caught are minimal. Measures to avoid this evasion are therefore called for, not so much in the form of abolishing this tax, as the Commission proposed, but in the form of action by competent authorities. During the debate of 5 November 2003, I made a case for a transparent system of levies with clear goals. To link the levies to the environmental effects is a transparent and clear goal.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why further research into, and discussion about, the environmental effects of car taxes deserve our unqualified support. The Member States would then, based on research results, be able to harmonise their levies, and give accountability to environmental damage. To impose this measure from Brussels would be taking matters too far, though. After all, the Commission proposal falls outside the scope of Article 93 of the Treaty. Registration and motorised vehicle tax do not belong to the harmonised taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the differences in, for example, motorised vehicle tax that hinders the functioning of the internal market, but mainly an inefficient system of reimbursing levies in the event of car imports and exports. The Commission proposal is therefore in contravention of the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. That is the reason why I will not be voting in favour of this report or of the Commission proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to emphasise that this proposal does not entail introducing a European tax policy or the European Union encroaching on the sovereignty of the Member States when it comes to taking decisions about taxes. This proposal too will leave it entirely up to the individual Member States to decide to what extent they wish to tax motoring. What we are taking a decision about in this case is the structure and system of taxation with a view to facilitating the internal market. It will mean that it will become easier to buy and sell cars across Member States’ borders. Those who will benefit from this are basically individual consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say to our Danish fellow MEP, Mrs Auken, that what is important for us is to obtain new, modern cars. There is nothing so environmentally dangerous as the old stock of cars. New technology is good for the environment. We must do all we can to bring about the rapid conversion and modernisation of European cars.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to emphasise how constructive it is that, in her report, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen has also included a proposal for having tax incentives for new types of vehicle, for example hybrid cars or cars propelled by other fuels, as this would perhaps also lead to the motoring world being quicker to take increased account of the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of years ago, we in Sweden introduced a special incentive to promote the use of catalytic converters. This very rapidly proved to be a success and led to a very swift reduction in emissions. We now have an opportunity to go further down that route.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, also important that, through this approach to car taxation, we give the European car industry an opportunity to develop more quickly in terms of its response to environmental considerations. This also means more rapid modernisation. Better cars in Europe are good for the environment, but the outcome can also be a better and stronger car industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It intends to improve the functioning of the internal market and to implement the Community strategy for reducing CO2 emissions by passenger cars.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to meet European Union environmental protection aims and the Kyoto protocol, CO2 emissions should be significantly reduced in order to achieve the Community target of 120 grams of CO2 per kilometre. And taxes do provide a strong incentive for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be emphasised that the aim here is not to harmonise or introduce new taxes. The aim is to introduce a European Union-wide basis for levying taxes on passenger cars. Initiatives in individual Member States in this field are currently not very well coordinated and vary significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">A tax system where the vehicle registration tax depends on CO2 emissions is a step in the right direction. It provides the basis for the long term aim of achieving a convergence of registration tax rates and guaranteeing fair competition across the whole of the single market. Vehicle registration tax should be gradually restricted, which would help to eliminate discrepancies within the European Union car market.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also set up a cohesive and transparent system for refunding registration tax that is based on clearly defined criteria. Furthermore, it is important to ensure that the process of abolishing registration tax is implemented in line with the principle of budget neutrality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I flew out from Heathrow this morning. I have lost my luggage, so I have no clothes or make-up and look pale and ugly, but I hope that is alright! In London you have to take everything out of your bag. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, thank you for your contributions, and many thanks too on behalf of the Commissioner. We have already had a debate on this report and very much agree with the Commission’s proposal. I have to say that my country, Denmark, does not support the Commission’s proposal. I, for my part, do, however, even though I have amended it. I should like to thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs for its considerable support. I should also like to thank you for your sound amendments and thank the large majority that has supported me.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to discuss a number of points that I think it is important to emphasise before we vote tomorrow. Firstly, I should like to stress why this is a constructive proposal. It is constructive because it takes account of the environment. As is well known, the proposal is about abolishing registration taxes on passenger cars and instead introducing a new system involving an annual tax based on the car’s emissions of pollutants. In the committee, we have gone a step further than in the Commission’s original proposal, since the Commission only wanted an annual tax based on CO2 emissions. However, CO2 is not, of course, the only source of pollution. In my report I therefore recommend that the tax be based on all pollutants and particles detrimental to air quality. It is important to send a signal to the car industry to the effect that tax on cars depends on the level of pollution they cause. Hopefully, the proposal will therefore create an incentive for the car industry to produce cars that consume less petrol and cause less pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important consideration – to which the Commissioner too attaches a lot of importance – is freedom of movement. At present there are 25 different tax systems with 25 different ways of calculating car taxes. Many systems are based on outmoded rules, and registration taxes can be an obstacle to freedom of movement. There is a risk of double taxation, and car owners often have to pay proportionately much more on their used cars when they transport them from one Member State to another. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important from the committee’s point of view to emphasise that we want the proposal to be budget-neutral. It is very important that this change should not involve expenditure disadvantageous to the Member States - either in a transitional period or subsequently. Allow me to state, moreover, that the EU is not introducing a tax policy by means of this proposal. It is entirely up to the Member States themselves to decide how high the tax is to be and of what it is to be composed. I would therefore also call on the Council to vote in favour of this proposal, even though I know that it is on a sticky wicket in, for example, my own country and the United Kingdom. Consideration could of course be given to using the option offered by the Treaty of Nice of enhanced cooperation and allowing some Member States to go further than others.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is a fourth important consideration, namely that there should be a long transitional period. It is important for the whole market, the industry, car owners and systems generally to be able to get themselves organised, and I therefore consider that a ten-year period is necessary for countries to be able to change their systems without incurring anything other than necessary costs. This will also ensure renewal of the stock of cars on the road.</p>
<p class="contents">These are, then, the four relevant points: a long transitional period, budget neutrality, freedom of movement and consideration for the environment. Finally, I just want to comment on the proposals from Mr Langen on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. I support these proposals, since I agree that there must be proportionality between the tax on cars and those cars’ emissions of pollutants. I also of course agree that we must protect veteran cars, and I therefore have nothing against veteran cars being exempt from the proposal. I do not myself own a veteran car, but I have every sympathy for owners of such vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot recommend the amendments by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, since they are not in keeping with the overall thrust of the report, apart from anything else because an earlier entry into force would be unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">That was what I had to say. Mr President, and not Madam President - I can see there has been a change of President - once again, excuse me for being so late. I hope that you will bear with me, and I look forward to a constructive vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Amendment 18, which refers to Article 4, calls for a graduated progressive tax. However, Amendment 19 – creating a new paragraph 1a in Article 4 – seeks to introduce the notion of direct proportion. This notion was also included in the amendments by Mr Langen, although he has now withdrawn them. So what would such a notion mean? It would mean that the tax on a car with emission levels of 200 g/km could only be EUR 200 and that on a car of 160 g/km, EUR 160. As a result, the desired outcome – namely to effect a major shift in what the consumer decides when he buys a car – would not be achieved, since, if there is only a difference of EUR 80 between a car with 120 g/km emission and a car with 200 g/km emissions, then the market will remain unaffected. We must therefore vote against this direct proportionality and stick to the text on the graduated progressive tax.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission published a very interesting document last week on the efficiency of cars in Europe. On page 32 of the working document, there is a graph showing which category most cars fall into. You will see that almost 70% of the cars in Europe are between 140 and 200 g/km, and only 25% are below 140 g/km. So what we can achieve with this instrument is to levy an over-proportional tax on those between 140 and 200 g/km, so that we can effect a major shift to categories below 140, which is the target of the European Union. So, we have a contradiction in our text, and if we want to be effective we have to remedy this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the Commission’s insistence that this proposal is not aimed at tax harmonisation, it will force countries that apply tax on registration of vehicles to phase that out and it will make all countries apply the same level of emissions-linking to the so-called ‘annual circulation tax’. Is that harmonisation, or is it not?</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur gives the game away when she argues that in the long term it would be of great advantage to approximate the ACT rates – meaning the same rates of road tax in all countries. They simply do not understand that allowing countries the freedom to choose how much revenue to raise and how to raise it is a fundamental responsibility of our elected national governments. Moreover, competition over tax rates and tax bases between national authorities is actually a good thing for business and economic growth – witness the general reductions in company tax over the past few years.</p>
<p class="contents">The worry is that when the EU gets involved it inevitably screws up. For instance, despite eight directives on value-added tax so far, the administration of VAT remains as complex as ever and fraud is now running into billions. Unfortunately the drive for tax harmonisation in the European Union remains alive as always. I sincerely hope, though, that this particular piece of legislation may be stopped. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Based on the discussions we have had so far, in my view, there is consensus among the main powers involved that we need to get rid of the registration tax, a mechanism running counter to the internal market's objectives. This would support the free movement of people, while lower prices would contribute to the quicker renewal of the car fleet. At the same time, I also support the idea for us to put an end to this situation in a budget-neutral manner by introducing an operating charge. I do believe that Mr Kovács may also be familiar with fiscal pressure; after all, he had to vote for the registration tax in Hungary a couple of years ago. I think that the transition scheme is a good idea, as it gets rid of double taxation, while taking depreciation into consideration too.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other things I would like to mention. Firstly, Member States must be given the maximum freedom possible when they come to setting and applying the operating charge. On this subject, many have discussed an innovation fund, and a fuel charge, although these can be resolved as part of the income tax issue. I think it is too much to consider a mandatory 50% rate based on environmental considerations. In fact, if there is anyone who has had any great success with the Kyoto Protocol, let them decide what rate to consider. This is one of the reasons I suggested that the Commission recommended other factors when setting the operating charge.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I would like us to stick to this proportional or linear idea, as this should be the only way to be able to levy taxes with any taxation factor. In very many cases, having a car only a couple of years old is already a step towards renewing the car fleet, especially in the new Member States with old cars, where people are unable to trade in their old cars for new ones due to social or financial reasons. I support the 10-year scheme because I think that this is enough time to take advantage of the options available and for the economic players to adapt too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This report has to do with the taxation of motor vehicles, and there are two reasons why it is going in the right direction. The first is that it is reasonable, from the point of view of environmental policy, for all emissions to be included in the tax base for any taxation of private motor vehicles. Both the emission of CO2, which is responsible for climate change, and the pumping out of nitrous oxide and particulates, which are the causes behind the build-up of ozone and the incidence of lung diseases, should have an influence on taxation; that is reasonable and the right way to go about things.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is that the planned demise of vehicle registration tax is also to be welcomed, not only from the consumers’ point of view but also in terms of environmental policy. It is because of registration tax that vehicles produced in one EU Member State are exported to another one with registration taxes, only then to be reimported by reimporters from the country in which they were made. This results in needless movement of vehicles and in higher purchase prices for them. It may be that the loss of registration tax in Europe will cause this reimport trade to be banned and the average age of the vehicles on the road to be reduced, which will ultimately be of benefit to the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the level of passenger car emissions is a function of the amount of fuel used, that is, the distance driven, the quality of the petrol, and, essentially, also of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed tax solution has two aims: to remove the currently compulsory registration tax and replace it with a new tax levied when the vehicle is purchased or annually.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue begs the question: what do the authors want? The new tax is, by definition, unfair. It places the same burden on consumers who travel great distances and contribute more to air pollution, and on consumers who travel short distances, only going out for Sunday trips to church, as we say in Poland. Furthermore, the legislation forces the consumer to pay tax upfront while the damage done, that is, the pollution, will be generated in the future. Moreover, the tax burden will affect the poorer consumers most of all, and make it more difficult to purchase used cars.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is the case, then doubts may arise as to whether this legislation has not been written to order with a view to the interests of car manufacturers. Stagnating demand means that these car manufacturers are on the lookout for solutions that will benefit them, especially as the new tax will pass through their hands, thereby increasing their revenues and cash flow.</p>
<p class="contents">The authors also say nothing of the level of this tax and there are worries or concerns about the amounts flowing into the budgets of the Member States. The programme that we would be prepared to support reads as follows: we should gradually set stricter emissions standards for new passenger cars, introduce more stringent standards for fuel quality and abolish taxes on the purchase of cars. We should perhaps also consider introducing an environmental tax on the cost of petrol and use the revenue this creates for research into new technologies and cleaner fuels. Only these solutions will benefit consumers, producers, environmentalists and the whole economy in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The more difficult it becomes to fly, the clearer it is that the car is a vital consumer durable for most Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation, in which the car is one of the most difficult objects to move inside the Union, is intolerable. Moving a car from one Member State to another entails considerable obstacles, which are still due to different tax laws and inflexible administrative legal practices. Furthermore, the citizens of the Union are treated completely unequally regarding car taxation, depending on where they live. For example, in Finland, a country where distances are long and the population is sparse, a passenger car is not exactly a luxury, but a necessity for working people and their families. If cars in Europe are to be redesigned and if there are to be more environmentally friendly cars on the road, it is appropriate to reduce car purchase tax, abolish registration tax, and compensate for that with moderate rises in circulation tax which acknowledge regional balance and on the basis of fuel consumption and polluting emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an unparalleled number of old cars on the roads in Finland, which in other countries would have ended up on the scrapheap by now. Car taxation should also move towards a system of tax concessions for equipment that increases safety on the roads. Obviously, it is not worth talking about car tax unless you include fuel taxes. In Europe we should be promoting tax concessions on biofuels and lowering taxes on diesel. Besides, the latest research shows that carbon dioxide emissions from diesel engines are lower than those from petrol cars. This needs to be taken into account when tailoring reforms. The environmental impact of road traffic should be examined as part of the Union’s wider policy on transport, although at present there is not enough proper debate on the compatibility of taxation on vehicles, fuel taxation and road transport infrastructure charges. That is what we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have an anomaly, and the Commission’s proposal, which has been markedly improved through Mrs Riis-Jorgensen’s report and excellent work, is a step towards finding a solution to this problem. We do not have an internal market in the automobile sector. That is the problem. It is still very difficult for a European citizen in one country to buy a car from another country and go back home with it. In many cases, this citizen is faced with prohibitive and disproportionate fees, and dated bureaucratic procedures in the form of so-called registration taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s proposal for registration tax to be done away with and be replaced with a system of environmentally-sensitive taxes goes in the right direction, because it removes obstacles to an open market and lowers the capital cost of cars while encouraging more environmentally-friendly consumption. Can this proposal still be improved upon?</p>
<p class="contents">Among other things, we must ensure that those who have already paid registration tax are given an adequate refund. We must see to it that the weaker members of society who cannot afford to buy those types of car whose purchase we are encouraging, are not penalised through higher payments. In the same way we cannot place further burdens on those who necessarily have to travel, for example, to go to work. We can find reasonable and transparent solutions so that there will be no such negative effects. It is not easy but we can do it. The position of the European Parliament, which I hope we will adopt so that registration tax will be removed, will be sending a powerful signal to governments of countries who are still resisting a similar agreement, including my own country’s government.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is realistic also because it is intended to come into effect over a reasonable amount of time in order to avoid causing a negative effect on national budgets. But until such an agreement is reached, we must still appeal to governments to act more reasonably by not imposing double taxation in the case of citizens who would be returning to their own country after at least two years working in another country of the European Union and find they have to pay tax once again on a car, which tax they will already have paid in another country. Ironically that is what is happening in my own country, Malta. Before my country joined the European Union, it was relatively easy for emigrants returning to my country, and bringing a car back with them, to pay a reasonable amount of tax. For the past two years however, people in this sort of situation are being asked to pay a prohibitive amount of tax. Then, these citizens justifiably ask us ‘What sort of internal market is this?’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Car engines have not changed for a hundred years, while mobile telephone technology changes every month. Why are we being held hostage to this fuel and these derivatives? It is a huge issue. The major scientist and inventor from Thessaloniki, who found a cheap method of splitting hydrogen, was sent packing, as were numerous other inventors who found other ways, other fuels to prevent our being slaves to oil.</p>
<p class="contents">We have heard numerous proposals here concerning the ratios between pollutants and taxation. It is one correct way forward. However, is car safety not also a correct way forward? Because, in an accident, an unsafe car injures more people who, when hospitalised, naturally affect other people's revenue. Therefore a safe car should pay less tax. But that is another viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the situation in Greece. We in Greece have higher registration taxes than any other country. Both the socialist government and the conservative government maintained high taxes. For example, we earn half what the inhabitants of Luxembourg earn. They earn EUR 1 000 and we earn 500; they pay EUR 20 000 for a car and we pay 40 000. We have the most expensive cars in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We need justice at long last. We need a uniform standard. The poorest country in Europe, with its deficits, cannot have the most expensive cars just because certain people cannot find a different ratio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looked at from that angle, the danger is that the public will once again misread our intentions. ‘Tax’ and ‘EU’ are inflammatory words virtually always capable of being interpreted and misunderstood to mean that Europe, the EU, is yet again attempting to impose on the public.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of the speeches we have heard today have explained why, in this specific instance, in the Riis-Jørgensen report, something completely different is at issue, but there have been those who have argued that this is no more than yet another attempt to reach into Europeans’ pockets. It is not surprising that, when the domestic political temperature is running high, politicians – and opposition politicians in particular – cannot resist the temptation to use anti-EU slogans as a means of whipping things up. In my own country, Austria, we have national parliamentary elections in four weeks’ time. Power is at stake, and so there are quite a few who are not mincing their words.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main opposition party, the Social Democrats, are covering large surfaces with posters claiming that Chancellor Schüssel’s Federal Government wants to bring in a universal toll on private motor vehicles. The fact that this is not the case does not bother them; they just try it on, and anti-European sloganising gives them a chance of scoring a few points. Let me tell you, then, that the Riis-Jørgensen report is a step towards a rational way of taxing motor vehicles and protecting the environment. That, and nothing else, is what it is about; it is something one can vote for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This tax has made cars unnecessarily expensive in Ireland. I am totally against EU interference in regulating national taxes. However, as Ireland levies VRT, it is a draconian tax that has no rationale except to bleed Irish car owners of money – a lot of money from citizens who, for the most part, do not have a public transport system that will allow them to manage without a car.</p>
<p class="contents">To collect car taxes for a reason like environmental protection makes sense. People can understand that and to some extent they can control the rate they pay by their choice of car. The Irish Government should make this change with or without Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must make this shift carefully and think of all the ramifications. The move to use road tax to effectively promote energy-efficient cars by charging significantly more tax for cars with bigger engines that use more fuel will mean that drivers will have to pay more for bigger and more powerful cars. However, these tax penalties will have a negative impact on families. Any family with more than three children, or families with grandparents or other household members, are dependent on bigger cars like people carriers and therefore will be forced to pay the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">I am advocating a dual system in which the road tax increases with engine size and, within each engine size category, by energy efficiency. The family can then reduce the tax they have to pay by choosing a more energy-efficient car which satisfies the family’s transport needs. We must ensure that measures are both environment- and family-friendly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Ireland we consider VRT to be a national tax and we consider the mix of taxation, the rate of taxation, to be a matter falling within national competence. Having said that, we are now holding out a prospect of abolishing VRT and perhaps somewhat dishonestly indicating to Irish consumers that at last they may get a car at a much cheaper rate, in much the same way as in other Member States. In fact, it was one of the carrots dangled during the single market debate in Europe – sign on here, vote yes, you will have cheaper cars.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about here will be budget-neutral, that has been said and on that we all agree and it will be the motoring public that will bear the cost of the tax if VRT is abolished. In Ireland VRT totals EUR 1.15 billion, which is a huge amount in a very small country. I do not want to see that put on direct income tax or any direct taxes. If we need that money to run our country – and that is a matter for our national government – it must still be collected from the motoring public. We must be equitable and fair as to how that is done.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I am all for balancing the taxation structure of motoring in order to decrease emissions - carbon emissions and particles and NOx and all the rest, but how that is done in each Member State is up to each Member State to decide and this is what we must be very careful about. I would love to see this debate taken side by side with the debate tomorrow on national allocation plans in relation to our Kyoto targets. We should be talking about sectoral targets for CO2 emissions and here transport is one of the biggest sinners. It is in that context that we should be talking about taxation on passenger cars and indeed all vehicles. This lack of joined-up thinking between two different sectors or two different parts of the DG in the Commission upsets me, because it is really part of tomorrow's debate as well and I would just like to make that point very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Manufacturers of cars have been selling cars to countries like Ireland, where there is a high rate of VRT, at a much cheaper rate than they have been selling them to other countries that have no VRT or very low rates of it. The manufacturers will increase the price of their cars, so our consumers may not benefit from the abolition of VRT.. Would that they could, but let us be honest with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report we have before us clearly addresses the issue of taxation. Whether a report deals with tax structures – which is the case here – or tax levels, it is not a competence of the European Union and these discussions should not, in my opinion, be taking place here. As with many other areas of business we debate, I fear that this would only be the thin end of the wedge in terms of EU interference with taxation: further treaty creep would most probably follow. In my opinion, sovereign Member States should be free to set their own criteria and levels of taxation, and not have the EU dictate to them. In that I agree wholly with Mrs Doyle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have to say I am pleased to see that Parliament is addressing an issue which the Commission has failed even to acknowledge: that of vintage vehicles. They must be excluded from the provisions of this directive and I personally will support any amendments to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">We all want to see cleaner vehicles on our roads. Indeed, in the UK we are moving to a car-tax structure based on emissions levels. However, harmonisation of tax structures is not the way to achieve this: better design, cleaner fuels and research into alternative fuels are the way forward, not a half-baked attempt to extend the competence of the EU into tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On top of this tax comes VAT and then, over the course of the years, you have to pay a circulation tax, which is a nominal amount. In other words, buying a car in my country is much more expensive than in most EU countries, and this makes no sense. Yet this is how it is and how it will continue to be, because the State – in this case Portugal, which is no different from any other State – likes to charge people up front.</p>
<p class="contents">I refer to this information, just as others have done, because it is relevant to what we are debating here. This Proposal for a Directive, aimed precisely at removing what is known as registration tax in EU countries and replacing it with an annual circulation tax, the amount of which will take account of carbon dioxide emissions, is fairer, more sensible, more environmentally-friendly and more economical. This is indeed the right system, as it will make cars more affordable for the middle and lower classes and will lead to a more rapid renewal of the stock of cars on the road, which makes sense from the point of view of both the environment and road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what some may believe, an increase in car prices via taxation is not always environmentally friendly. In my country, for example, because new cars, which are more environmentally-friendly, are more expensive, people buy less safe, more polluting used cars from other countries. On the other hand, a circulation tax, as advocated in the proposal for a directive, would ensure that the vehicle tax burden would accompany the car throughout its useful life and that citizens who settle in more than one EU Member State are not taxed twice over. It would also contribute towards more transparent rules in the internal market by enabling people to make a genuine price comparison of cars in the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to say that raising car prices does not reduce the number of cars in circulation. It merely worsens the quality of the cars we drive. A fair and balanced circulation tax is always better than an excessive registration tax, for the environment, for the economy and for the citizens. I only hope that the governments of the Member States also understand this at the appropriate time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are at present 25 different systems of vehicle taxation in the EU, and putting them on a uniform footing will help the internal market work better; that much we know, and to those Members who would deny it, one has to say that it simply has to be admitted that the effect of this proposal is to do away with the distortions and inefficiency that result from double taxation when vehicles are transported across borders. The registration taxes imposed in some Member States have – as we have heard often enough – the inevitable effect of making the public negotiate financial and administrative obstacles if they want to take a vehicle from one Member State to another. Registration taxes are a sacred cow; let us then slaughter it once and for all – not least because of the environmental considerations and perhaps, indeed, with them particularly in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, tax measures are one of the three pillars of the Community strategy for reducing the emission of CO2 from motor vehicles. That is the right approach, but I do not believe that it goes far enough; it is not only the emission of CO2 that should be taxed, but the emission of pollutants generally, for – as we have been told often enough already – there are, alongside CO2, also nitrous oxides and, of course, particulates, emitted into the atmosphere, and so these elements should also be taxed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite convinced that abolishing registration tax will have beneficial effects on the environment, for a natural consequence of it will be the sale of new cars. The object of reducing the costs involved in buying them is that the consumers will get rid of their old cars as soon as possible and replace them with new ones that save on fuel and pollute the environment less.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that taxes on vehicles should, in general, be based on the pollutants emitted by them, and if the tax levied is to be fair and neutral in the field of competition, then the rates must relate directly to the pollutants emitted in each instance. The tax burden per annum dependent on the emission of pollutants must increase in line with any increase in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Kovács, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, firstly I should like to thank the rapporteur and those MEPs who supported the abolition of registration taxes, the establishment of refund systems for car taxes and the application of fiscal measures to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars and improve fuel economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The latter implements the third-pillar measures provided for by the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars endorsed by the Council in 1996. It is the only pillar of the three that make up the strategy that has not yet been implemented at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to stress once again that the proposal of the Commission does not involve any kind of harmonisation and certainly would not touch the rates of car taxation. It would only propose the harmonisation of the <span class="italic">structure</span> of car taxation, certainly not the rate.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of the Parliament’s amendments. The Commission could accept 15 amendments in principle – amendments 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 19, 23, 24, 28, 29, 31 and 32 – which reinforce and clarify the proposal. We will do our utmost to take on board as many of them as possible during the forthcoming discussions in the Council. However, at this stage in the legislative procedure, the Commission will not formally revise its proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I now turn to the group of amendments suggesting that car tax differentiation should be based not only on carbon dioxide emissions but also on other pollutants – in particular amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 15, 16, 17, 18, 21, 25, 26, 27, 30 and 36. In principle the Commission encourages Member States to apply coordinated fiscal incentives under certain conditions – for example, to expedite the placing on the market of passenger cars satisfying future requirements. However, mixing the objectives on carbon dioxide emissions covered by the Kyoto Protocol with those on pollutant emissions covered by the Sixth Environmental Action Programme would lead to increased internal market fragmentation in the area of passenger cars and endanger the whole compromise in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, it is not necessary to include fuel consumption or fuel efficiency, because CO2 emissions and fuel efficiency are directly linked.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of you suggested that the transitional period – which in the proposal we set at between five and ten years – be fixed at ten years. That is acceptable to the Commission in the spirit of the compromise because it would certainly facilitate the smooth transition that we very much support.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of linear or progressive taxation, the Commission does not express any preference in the proposal. We want to keep it open for each Member State to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 4 refers to double taxation, while amendments 13 and 22 ask for a one-stop online solution in order to calculate registration taxes. Amendments 34 and 37 ask for the scope to be extended to cover light duty vehicles. The Commission, although sympathetic, considers that those measures would be difficult to adopt, mainly for reasons of subsidiarity of an economic or technical nature, or because they are beyond the scope of the proposed directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not support amendment 20, which requests that a study be carried out by the end of 2006. That is an unrealistic time period within which to carry out such a study. The Commission cannot support amendments 33, 35, 38, 39 or 40, either.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the support and efforts to conciliate and strike a balance, taking into account the complexity of the issue of passenger car taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
