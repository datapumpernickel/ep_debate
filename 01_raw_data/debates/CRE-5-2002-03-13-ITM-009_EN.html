<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Trentin (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, a slow recovery in economic growth seems to be taking shape in both the United States and Europe, although the timescale and stability of this recovery are still uncertain. Above all, the extent of the recovery already seems to vary greatly across the various sectors involved, and it is intertwined with restructuring and modernisation processes, which may be supported by heavy public investment and unacceptable protectionist measures, as is the case with steel in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem that the European Union is always faced with is how to prevent such a contradictory and non-uniform move out of recession from coinciding – because of a wait-and-see attitude of European governments and the Union – with a widening, and not a narrowing, of the innovation and competitiveness gap that already penalises Europe in comparison with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the report I am tabling highlights the urgent need to adopt a proactive policy – at the Barcelona summit, let us hope – which is, above all, in line with the Lisbon objectives, a policy mix that makes the social agenda adopted at Nice an integral part of a coordinated economic and social policy centred on the objective of increasing the active population and achieving full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">This seems even more essential if one bears in mind the need to abide by the constraints of the Stability and Growth Pact, particularly that of keeping budget deficits down to within 3 per cent of gross domestic product, which only leaves rather modest resources available for a counter-cyclical economic policy in the individual States. We therefore stress that it is not a question of concentrating new powers in Brussels but rather of making very selective choices and coordinating state intervention in order to achieve a critical mass, creating positive synergies of public intervention and private investment at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter, then, of choosing. In the report we uphold the need to prioritise the revival of a policy of investment instead of an across-the-board reduction in the tax burden, except for further exemption from labour costs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of public and private investment, we insist on a resumption of the Lisbon strategy, which today, especially in some countries, is making disturbingly slow progress. This means giving high priority to channelling Community resources and national investment into strategic sectors like research and innovation, lifelong learning as an integral and inseparable part of the structural reform of the labour market, and the creation of a European network of infrastructures and services, starting with telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Community projects need to be better coordinated with governments’ economic and social policy guidelines, and not only coordinated better but in good time – by the summer, in this case – so that they can affect the decisions of the national parliaments, which must be informed of the initiatives of the competent European Parliament committees in due time and be involved in them.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not just hope for coordination but promote it too, for instance by proposing – through the Commission – forms of open cooperation between different governments on common projects concerned with research, innovation, lifelong learning and active ageing policies, the latter being a prerequisite for achieving a reform of social security systems that is not disastrous for workers’ pension rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Social dialogue must also be involved in this policy mix, based on the need to set out the guidelines and financing methods for the continuing education policy. The participation of the social partners in defining a modern welfare state, turning it into a decisive factor in sustainable development leading to full employment, is one of the cornerstones of the European social model.</p>
<p class="contents">At Barcelona we must therefore reject any attempt to weaken collective bargaining and to remove from the Charter of Fundamental Rights a major part of its content. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I would also like to say a few additional words about the report. In Lisbon, a high-flown declaration was made that we would become the number one in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">It is now evident that things will not happen as quickly as some people had hoped. We might now think that target was over-ambitious. Perhaps we should be honest and totally forget it. A lot of things are now attributed to 11 September and to the economic downturn in the USA. It is certain that the tragic events of 11 September had an additional negative impact, but negative economic trends had already set in before then in Europe. In particular, from a German point of view we should not lose sight of the fact that Germany is the largest economy in the European Union and that countries that have far closer economic ties with the USA, such as the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, have far fewer problems than we do. We should move away from that. However, I fear that the Barcelona Summit has again proclaimed ambitious targets without us having done our homework first. When all is said and done, Europe should not raise expectations that the European Union does not have the power to meet. Instead, the individual Member States should take the announcements they make there seriously when they return home, and should do their homework, for example in the case of flexible working arrangements and corresponding tax reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also warn against repeatedly talking about coordination at European level. This kind of coordination could lead to additional illusory powers at European level. Ultimately, however, it is hard to move things forward in this area. What we need at European level is an offensive on behalf of small and medium-sized enterprises. It is SMEs that will create jobs in the future, and we assume that nine out of ten jobs will in future be created in companies with less than a thousand employees. It is important here to create framework conditions so that SMEs are not overburdened with bureaucracy and all the requirements that Brussels creates, and that in future the individual Member States should provide appropriate knock-on financing. However, at the end of the day it is also important for us to adopt a clear position here. This is also evident from the debate about the warning letter. I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Solbes for having insisted on the 3% being strictly adhered to. The discussions that have taken place in recent months about this have not only been damaging to the stability and growth market, but have also adversely affected Europe's reputation, its economy and the euro. We should turn our back on this sort of behaviour and have faith in our own economic strength. We should not be saying that America needs an economic upturn because it will benefit Europe – we should be able to achieve an upturn by virtue of our own strength and our own convictions.</p>
<p class="contents">Just a few more words by way of conclusion. I have just heard someone talking about "coordinating state intervention". I absolutely must warn against that. The best form of social policy is a good economic policy.</p>

<p class="contents">The rapporteur starts from a correct and appropriate premise and gives a rational presentation of the real causes of Europe’s current recession and provides a logical suggestion for an appropriate remedy. First of all, at political level, accentuating the need for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to play an active and regulatory role in laying down the broad economic policy options. Secondly, in terms of public finances, highlighting the need for a stable reference point from which to reaffirm the absolute need to fulfil the final objective of the Stability and Growth Pact, which is to have a budgetary deficit of less than 3%.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur nevertheless acknowledges and recommends an appropriate degree of flexibility, which is necessary if we are to use public policies as instruments of economic recovery, without making the zero deficit in 2004 an obsession that is disproportionate to today’s reality. Similarly, at structural level, he suggests and endorses the use of instruments to improve the general economic climate, in particular in training, in access to public services, in the creation of a knowledge-based society or in the adaptation of the labour markets. Finally, he takes up the objective of the Lisbon Extraordinary Summit and pursues this objective at the Barcelona Extraordinary Summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very well-produced report which has sought a consensus. We have been able to work together and the result will reflect the efforts we have made throughout its drawing up in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">This report could not have come at a more appropriate time: the day after tomorrow the Barcelona European Council will take place and it will deal with issues relating to the assessment to be made and the commitments to be assumed in relation to the Lisbon process, as well as, clearly, a series of issues which the Liberal Group has always insisted on and which the Commissioner is sufficiently aware of and which I am not going to repeat: the need to liberalise the most protected sectors; the opening up of the markets; the emphasis on training and education: the provision of more resources for scientific research and technological development; that is, the fulfilment of the Lisbon objectives. We hope that clear progress will be made on this issue at this meeting in Barcelona.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the report by Mr Trentin does not exactly establish a social dimension, which is also included in the Lisbon objectives and that, unfortunately, they are not taken into account and, therefore, I believe that the demonstrations which have been organised against the Europe of capital – of this Europe which we are building and which is a reality – lack justification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he indicated, the three wells from which the Union draws its economic policies are liberalisation, privatisation and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">These wells, if I may say so, contain toxic water. The dismantling of public services which were operating more or less properly has been the source of all kinds of social havoc and inefficiency: the railways in Britain, the postal and health services in France, electricity supplies in most parts of Catalonia, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In Lisbon the Council spoke of making the economy of the Union the most competitive in the world by the year 2010. At what price? At the price of all-out, dog-eat-dog warfare. We are far from the pursuit of happiness which the most perceptive politicians of the late eighteenth century regarded as an inalienable right of human beings. Instead, we have the prospect of permanent stress, widespread insecurity of employment, mass exclusion and perhaps, in due course, the same tragedy that has now engulfed Argentina. In Biarritz, Gothenburg, Nice and Laeken, grass-roots society has demonstrated against such aberrations. Tomorrow, in my own city of Barcelona, there may well be more demonstrations. I believe it is essential to listen to the voice of protest, and I feel that the Trentin report pays it insufficient heed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In his diagnosis he clearly emphasises that Europe is not cyclically dependent on the United States and that the research and technological-innovation gap between the two sides of the Atlantic is liable to widen, with the Union clearly lagging particularly far behind in terms of public and private investment. But how should we respond? Our Committee wished to adhere to the principle of coordinating national policies, which it sees as one of the mandatory precepts of the Stability Pact. But who can fail to observe the extremely poor results of this coordination? Who can fail to see that the Pact, while providing Member States with a useful discipline as far as public deficits are concerned, does not begin to define the policies that are required if the development targets set in Lisbon are to be met? As for the intensification of fiscal competition, it compels governments to cut public spending, even on essentials. And who can also fail to observe that the Member States will not let the Union acquire budgetary and fiscal instruments that would enable it to support a policy of investment and development?</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, unlike Mr Radwan and contrary to the letter of the report, I believe we cannot continue to operate within the bounds set by the present treaties. It will be necessary to go beyond the coordination stage and try to extend the powers of the Union. The broad economic policy guidelines and the Stability Pact must be reviewed if we want to adopt a truly cooperative approach, and we must press for the Union to obtain the budgetary and fiscal instruments without which it cannot pursue real economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Accordingly, our Parliament should seize the present opportunity to take a historic initiative by formulating proposals for submission to the Convention on the Future of Europe. It would be a cruel disappointment and, I believe, a political error of the first magnitude if the Convention did not try to strengthen the European Union and its powers in the sphere of economic policy at this precise time when some large question marks hang over the development and cohesion of our Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One passage among so many seems significant, however: the one about the need not to wait for the effects of the American recovery. Among the various reasons for agreeing with this statement is that we do not believe fully in the soundness of the revival across the Atlantic. The reversal of the unemployment trend and an upturn on the Nasdaq contrast, in fact, with the sharp rise in oil prices, perhaps because of the winds of war blowing through the oil-producing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of these aspects taken alone supports the points raised in the report before us, but they also support the need for it to have a wholly European focus, which includes maintaining the Stability and Growth Pact, because another perplexing aspect in the USA is, paradoxically, the increase in floating capital, perhaps as an intentional inflationary nudge to level off the huge public investments that have been made. This is an aspect that Europe cannot allow itself, with fifteen economies that are sometimes profoundly different from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the expectation is that as soon as possible the Union will achieve effective open coordination – in social as well as economic policy – with joint consideration of fiscal policies, but with the warning that without constant, real grass-roots participation there will be no economic growth that can be enjoyed by the general public. The reference to greater participation by local players is explicit, as the second report on cohesion has shown, but from the standpoint of enlargement there is also a clear reference to wider enjoyment, or at least greater access to information regarding Community support, since the fact is that the EAGGF, for instance, has reported significantly low take-up rates in the Member States. Similarly, what is needed for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, besides the hoped-for transparency about future action and the procedures for it, is the constructive requirement that the ways in which pre-accession funds are used should be better monitored, bearing in mind that in these countries, still coming to grips with setting up an own resources system, there are generally not enough funds available to support cofinancing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, extremely difficult to justify scientifically, as the Union demands, the inclusion of environmental sites on the Natura 2000 list before the Trans-European Networks are built. In the latter respect, more and better participation by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe in Community plans and programmes would be welcome, as would their greater participation in transport policy, including attention to Community corridors.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what I am trying to say is that not only are the economic and social plans extremely opportune, but so is the harmonious and integrated way they are implemented, with a vision that goes from the new, near borders…</p>

New areas of policy have to suffer interference from European institutions at the risk of being swallowed up by Brussels. The issue that springs to mind is that of employment, which is currently in the limelight of the Brussels bureaucracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Trentin particularly mentions national areas of policy, such as education and labour regulations. It is a report that pretends to deal with the economic situation, but, in fact, prescribes in a normative manner, that employment must be promoted through education and flexible labour in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We are eloquently informed that the promotion of employment should be regulated from Brussels. Education, scientific research and labour policy are mentioned as areas where Europe must play a coordinating role in order to achieve the objectives of the Lisbon process. But how is Europe to do this? And is Europe able to implement policy in those areas? And maybe the most important question: do we really want Europe to have a say in this?</p>
<p class="contents">Education policy and policy allowing people to take part in the employment process belong with the Member States. For it is they who know what type of education and what measures are needed to allow everyone who is eligible to do so to take part in labour and health care. Precisely in the Member States, where the government and citizen are closer together, is it possible to let the wishes of those citizens be expressed. In my view, these matters do not belong in a report on the situation of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it be clear that I fully endorse the objectives of promoting employment, good education and a fair social system. However, it is my firm belief that it is not the task of the European Union to contribute actively to policy-making in these areas. It would therefore be wise if Parliament were to show restraint in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this context, the Trentin report, which seeks to assist in preparing the broad economic policy guidelines for 2003, might have been expected to signal very vigorous reforms that could kick-start the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the case. All we see in it are reform proposals that are already very familiar, such as lifelong learning, support for research, completion of the market in financial services and the opening of the energy and transport markets, measures which will bear little fruit in the immediate future. The report also contains the traditional call for close European budgetary coordination, which is said to release what the report calls ‘positive synergies’, whereas in practice it could well add to the rigidity that already exists.</p>
<p class="contents">For our part, we should like to take this opportunity to call first and foremost for a sharp reduction in taxes and other public charges, because these are the number-one problem in the countries where growth is slow. This will inevitably be a major issue in the French election campaign in particular. The European Union, of course, has no direct legislative powers in the realm of taxation. This makes it all the more regrettable that Commissioner Pedro Solbes Mira, in an article that appeared yesterday in a French daily newspaper, spoke out of turn by apparently stating that a candidate’s promises to cut taxes were not backed by a corresponding pledge to cut public spending.</p>
<p class="contents">This comment is below the belt, firstly because our candidates’ platforms have not yet been finalised and secondly because Commissioner Solbes is not the head of an economic government of Europe, there being no such thing. He should leave the French electorate to decide for themselves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I therefore view the Trentin report in conjunction with the report already adopted on the economic consequences of 11 September. We certainly always debated them together in committee. I do not need to repeat that.</p>
<p class="contents">I stand by the Lisbon objectives. Yes, they are ambitious – but we need ambitious objectives, because if we just tread water and are complacent we will achieve nothing. However, we will only achieve these objectives if we do our homework. That applies not only to the European Parliament but also to the Council and the governments of the Member States. We need to get over this period of weakness, as it says in the report. But to get over a period of weakness you have to take measures and not just wait. We have to recognise that we have a great deal to do and cannot just wait for an upturn in America. We have to become independent from America's economy.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, that means we need a properly functioning internal market, in other words we must do everything to implement in good time the directives that have already been adopted, to eliminate obstacles to the internal market, and to achieve greater coordination in the internal market despite the variations in competence, in order to remove distortion of competition. Our objectives are an action plan for financial services, structural reforms, observance of the Stability Pact and the principles of the social market economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yes, we certainly have an internal market, but we also have 15 sets of national circumstances within this internal market. So there is not a level competitive playing field. For example, there is not a level playing field between large companies and SMEs, because there are already wide differences in taxation between them, nor is there a level playing field between companies that operate globally and those that operate at regional level. There is not a level playing field when you consider the system of taxes and charges in the Member States and how market access is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about wanting to become the most dynamic economic region in the world, that means that we have to increase our economic power. In a nutshell, that means that we either have to rationalise, which is in the economic interest of individual companies, but not in our macroeconomic interest, as it of course involves job losses, or else we can increase turnover. If we want to increase turnover, we need a market – we need customers. Customers who must have money. That means that we have to increase demand. Demand must come from both public and private investment. That means that people must obtain sufficient income from paid employment, if they are to be in a position to buy products in the first place. It is no good having the very best, most well-designed, most durable and most keenly priced product if there are no customers who can pay for it.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore simply believe that the contrast that is constantly made between economic policy and social policy is simply wrong. Mr Radwan, you said that the best economic policy is simultaneously also the best social policy. I would also like to turn that round: a good social policy is also a good economic policy. I say that because there is a common denominator here, which is why investments have to be taken into account. As I see it, education is not a form of consumption, but an investment in the future, because we have to develop new products. To do that, we need a skilled workforce. And that has to be built into this whole framework of investment activity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking now about the Trentin report, which we unanimously adopted in committee, and which relates to the broad economic policy guidelines and to a decision-making process which in the first place concerns the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament wishes to influence this process of coordination and opinion forming at a relatively early stage, without presenting a wish list the size of a mail-order catalogue. However, this is not just a question of keeping ourselves busy: Article 4 of the EC Treaty specifically provides for this common economic policy, this coordinated economic and finance policy. And, Mr Markov, that article prescribes the model as follows: "… in accordance with the principle of an open market economy with free competition". That is our principle, and that is why – not because it is what my group wants, but because it is part of the Commission's programme – the completion of the internal market and the further liberalisation of public-sector services are a priority, as is the fact that we need to equip ourselves for competition at world level, and the fact that we need to dismantle obstacles in the Member States and to tackle the process of reform. That brings us to the question that Mr Radwan referred to: where does the Commission's responsibility end and that of the Member States start? Where is subsidiarity appropriate and where do we need to act? The only answer I can give is that whatever the Commission may bring forward and whatever Parliament may agree, in the past it has been more the Council, which is an amalgamation of the 15 governments, that has acted as a brake on this motor of European development, which has now of course become even more necessary than ever with the euro coming into circulation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this debate and Parliament's decision only make sense if we specifically call on the Member States to respect their commitments and not to lag behind. That means that in the larger Member States, in which there is an especially big backlog of reforms, national reforms will have to be tackled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though it contains a clear endorsement of the stability policy, the report, as I interpret it, is characterised mainly by attempts to find new avenues, create openings, relax the rules and bring about greater freedom of manoeuvre. I also think that the amendments by the social democratic MEPs extend those lines of thought, in other words in the direction of creating a little more scope for expansion and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">That is positive, for I believe that Europe’s economy, which is still characterised by high unemployment, growing social problems and stagnation in important areas such as education and research, requires more expansion, dynamism and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who follows the politico-economic debate in the European Union will see that it is greatly concerned with rules, control, prohibitions, cohesion, coordination, discipline and such like. Really, it does not sound at all as if we are discussing a liberal market economy, but a rather bureaucratic and ponderous economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that vigorous efforts ought instead to be made to stimulate the economy and to channel public investment into education and research, something that is really needed if we are to realise the Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Major improvements in the environmental sphere also need to be made and, as Mr Markov pointed out, purchasing power needs to be increased and care taken to create demand so that companies can dare to begin investing again and so that we can invest in quality and in initiatives that help enable us to comply with the ambitious Lisbon objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">That is unfortunately not what I see. What I see is something resembling a straightjacket, characterised by stability, rules and discipline. That is not enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Andria (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Trentin report surely lays the initial bases for major future decisions on economic policy. These bases do, however, need to be more incisive and detailed in the proposals, so that they do not merely stand as statements of principle but can be swiftly put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">European leaders must apply themselves to rewriting the model for the social and market economy, bringing it up to date and rethinking it with greater emphasis on the social commitment. Signing up in general terms to innovation, training and flexibility and then backing out at the decisive moment is becoming not only disrespectful but surely detrimental to the working class as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, to get out of this rut, class and corporate interests must be opposed insofar as they are not compatible with modern reformism. Rather than taking to the streets – or rather getting the workers to take to the streets – the trades unions should be asking themselves how much the workers took home between 1992 and 2000, given the productivity achieved by companies, which was certainly substantial.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal to turn employment around is based on a new bargaining structure and real pay flexibility. The new bargaining framework may be a regional or territorial system, half way between centralisation and company-level bargaining, with the aim of strengthening pay flexibility at company level where productivity is created and the individual contribution is valued.</p>
<p class="contents">A large contribution may be made by company profit-sharing schemes, which allow ordinary shares in the company to be acquired up to a certain percentage of gross profits. It has been found that the companies with the highest profits are also those that use profit sharing to ensure that their best staff are paid effectively. In the USA, the companies that adopt profit sharing tend to have higher pay and higher returns. The pay of those who join profit-sharing companies goes up, while those that leave have to bear a substantial pay cut. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Solbes,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I am going to try to quickly mention most of the issues raised and I would firstly like to thank Mr Trentin for his report. It is a good contribution to the broad economic policy guidelines which we are going to discuss and I believe that, in accordance with our fundamental concerns, the report focuses on two objectives: one short-term objective; how to consolidate the emerging recovery and turn it into a lasting growth in Europe; and secondly, how to deal with our problems of growth potential and make progress with the Lisbon objectives, an issue which is particularly attractive at this time, immediately before the Barcelona Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the view of some of you that our difficulties did not begin with 11 September. We were already in a situation of less economic growth and I also share the view that the impact of the evolution of the American economy has been greater than we initially expected, but I believe we should acknowledge that the Union’s action in terms of economic policy during this period has been correct. The monetary authorities have taken advantage of the lower risk in the field of price stability in order to cut interest rates, and budgetary policies have supported the activity by means of the functioning of automatic stabilisers and tax reductions which have taken place during this period.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not share the view that we have had a procyclic policy. We only have to look at the impact the automatic stabilisers have had in Europe in percentage terms.</p>
<p class="contents">Good handling of macroeconomic policy is allowing us to achieve good results. I believe that we can now say that the slow-down reached its worst during the last six months of the year and that the main indicators demonstrate that we are starting a recovery. We are currently working on the round of forecasts for 2002 and I can point out that, according to those forecasts, growth has been gaining momentum throughout this year and we believe it will come close to potential growth and may even exceed it by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are two elements of particular interest to us: firstly, the trend in salaries, which has been extremely helpful during this period – both in terms of stabilising prices and creating employment – and we hope the same trend will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the need to take advantage of recovery for budgetary consolidation. We believe that this is a fundamental element. The difficulties we have had to face during recent months have basically stemmed from not having achieved a situation of budgetary balance or budgetary surplus during the previous improvement in our economic context. And in this respect it should not be inferred from my comments – which some speakers have referred to – that I had any intention whatsoever of entering into an internal political debate, but that I simply wanted to point out something that I have said many times and that is that, in my opinion, any reduction in taxes to confront our budgetary obligations must be based on budgetary surpluses or must be counterbalanced by spending reductions. That is all I have said, I have said it many times and I am saying it again, but I do not believe it is the only thing coherent with our budgetary commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Where must we go in the long term? The answer is unquestionably to increase our growth potential, that is to say, to implement Lisbon. And those are the objectives we are also going to find again in the broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we increase our production potential? In the report which the Commission has sent to Lisbon, we suggest some of the challenges we consider fundamental. It is true that Lisbon is a programme for ten years. We are currently considering what we must do over the next twelve months and, in this respect, we must define certain priorities which we consider essential to the labour market. Mr Trentin has mentioned this issue and in his motion for a resolution he stresses the importance of continuous training, mobility, flexibility and safety, as well as the non-wage costs of the workforce, above all at the lowest end of the scale.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with each of these points. However, I would like to add one point. I believe we also have to consider that work must be worthwhile; we must have a system which provides incentives for participation in work and, to this end, it is essential to modernise the tax systems and also the social construction systems, as well as the legislation on work protection in order to favour employment. I believe that we must avoid unemployment traps which clearly have a negative impact on our situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety in employment must be based on training and qualification, and this is a fundamental active element for everybody. Safety in work based solely and exclusively on rigid protection legislation may be an advantage in the short term, but there is no doubt whatsoever that it hinders modernisation and greater economic efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Resolution stresses, employment is not just a problem of wage costs, but it is also a problem of wage structures which are well suited to the productivity differentials in each sector of activity.</p>
<p class="contents">In our report we also refer to goods and services, and your Resolution also stresses the importance of integrated networks of transport and services infrastructures, as well as the need for rigorous competition policy and proposes that consumers be offered the possibility of choosing between different networks of services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission absolutely agrees with these contributions and we also point to the need to make progress in investment in priority infrastructure projects, an issue which we consider to be fundamental in order to stimulate our capacity for long-term growth.</p>
<p class="contents">In our recent report on the application of the broad economic policy guidelines for 2001, we point out that in some network industries, the older operators still maintain high market quotas, an indicator that the opening up of the market is still not as desired. Therefore, it is essential to make progress in order to have more robust competition which will finally benefit the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">A final particularly important point has been mentioned by Mr Trentin, and also by some others, and involves the need to pay more attention to the knowledge economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Your Resolution stresses the need to attach more importance to R+D. It is true that R+D is an essential factor for a sustainable increase in productivity and competitiveness, which are essential elements if we want to achieve the Lisbon objective of making our economy the most competitive economy in the world. And it is true that progress has been made with R+D, but it is also true that progress in the financial contribution is taking place essentially in the public sector, although the greatest differences in terms of investment in this type of activity arise in the private sector. This is undoubtedly a point which warrants attention. I hope some conclusion in this respect will emerge from Lisbon and we will have to work to try to improve this situation, just as I believe we should work to make progress with the Community patent, an essential element for technological innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Trentin has mentioned other elements connected to the participation of national parliaments. Nothing would please the Commission more than greater participation by national parliaments in this type of debate and you as a Parliament, and in particular the IMAC, have played an important role in the past in support of certain initiatives of this type, which have undoubtedly been enormously useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by saying that the Commission considers at this time that the broad economic policy guidelines, the basic document on guidelines, must continue to function in accordance with what was agreed in Lisbon, and in this regard it is absolutely essential to accept any contribution that the European Parliament may present in order to improve these guidelines. Your contributions, together with the debates which are going to come out of Lisbon, will be fundamental elements for defining our document, which will be presented, as usual, in April, so that it may be debated in the subsequent months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
