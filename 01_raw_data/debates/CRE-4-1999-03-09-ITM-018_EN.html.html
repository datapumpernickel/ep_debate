<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monfils </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (FR)</span> Mr President, the dossier on European cities of culture which has been open since October 1997 will be closed, I hope, tomorrow. The debate has lasted for more than a year and a half because the position of the Commission and the European Parliament was profoundly different from that of the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament wanted the choice of city to be based on the quality of the projects, without reference to any contribution made by the Member States or choice made according to Community decision‐making procedures, that is, the codecision procedure. The Council of Ministers had itself opted for Member States to nominate each year, in turn and on a pre‐established rotational basis, one of their cities as European capital of culture. The European Parliament rejected the Council"s common position at second reading by adopting a declaration of intended rejection.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore found ourselves faced with a choice: either to continue a dialogue of the deaf with the Council for several months, exhausting the procedure provided for by Article 189 – and I believe that there would have been no winners or losers at the end of this procedure, which would have continued indefinitely – or to see whether a compromise would be possible. We chose the second option and proposed to the Council of Ministers compromise amendments which took account of both the Council"s point of view and, naturally, the European Parliament"s position as well.</p>
<p class="contents">This procedure, which is rather uncommon in the context of informal contacts, was accepted by the Council which used the paper we submitted as a basis for discussion, and the bargaining ended with an agreement. I think it is a creditable agreement considering the gap which separated the views of Parliament and the Council. Admittedly, the Council"s idea of nominating cities in turn for each Member State has been preserved, but the direct choice of city to nominate by the Member State has been abandoned; several cities in the same country may submit an application.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the selection panel which was no longer included in the Council"s common position, was re‐established. It is composed of seven experts on the cultural sector, and it must issue a report on the nominations. Finally, each nominated city must make a detailed submission on its cultural project; this is something Parliament had wanted, and was also no longer included in the Council"s common position. We did not obtain the right of codecision in the choice of city to nominate, but the European Parliament may deliver a prior opinion on the nominations; the Commission forwards its recommendations, which are based both on the selection panel"s report and the opinion delivered by Parliament, to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">This compromise, which mainly reproduces the European Parliament"s position, has been made possible due to the concern expressed by the German Presidency regarding opening up to other cultures, which I salute. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is not very often that the Council takes Parliament"s point of view into consideration, and this bargaining seems to me to be a positive example of how our institutions work. However, this compromise would not have been possible either without the constant support of the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, and its chairman; they have continually supported the rapporteur"s opinions and have cooperated closely – through the amendments they have proposed – on the improvements to be made to the text, as well as taking part in the negotiations along with myself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to conclude by saying that I hope these amendments which the Council has obviously accepted will be adopted tomorrow by Parliament, and I am convinced that in the concrete follow‐up to this decision, the Commissioner responsible and his staff will pay particular attention to the cultural merit of the projects submitted.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Vaz da Silva </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the ‘European Capital of Culture' programme is a success story. For the Member States, it has become a very strong symbol, so much so that taking away their power to designate and administer the programme has become a sensitive issue.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is precisely because the governments do not want to lose control over the cultural capitals that the Commission and the European Parliament feel that a programme of such importance for the public could not remain in the inter‐governmental sphere. The Commission therefore presented, in November 1997, a proposal to communitarise the programme with the backing of the European Parliament in May 1998, demanding co‐decision for the nomination and selection of cities based on solid cultural criteria.</p>
<p class="contents">For the European Parliament, it was vital to involve as many members of the arts world as possible in the events, to instigate forms of lasting cooperation, to foster the creation and circulation of works of art, while enhancing our historic heritage and urban design, opening up initiatives to a wide‐ranging public and avoiding Eurocentrism by involving as many non‐European cultures as possible. In a nutshell, the Parliament wanted to ensure that the programme would bring about a real change in the quality of life of the cities and their inhabitants long after the festivities themselves are over.</p>
<p class="contents">The divide between the Council and the European Parliament turned into such an abyss that conciliation seemed impossible, yet it has succeeded. This is a great victory for democracy. Parliament's firmness and the negotiating skills of rapporteur Philippe Monfils worked the miracle of forcing the Council to abandon its undemocratic arrogance and come to the negotiating table. The outcome is an honourable compromise in which neither party loses face: the governments managed to hold on to the right to define a rota system among the Member States to decide which of them is entitled to nominate cities, while Parliament has been given the right to select the given cities within that system. The governments agreed to the principle of basing the choice of cultural capital on cultural criteria, on the basis of the opinions of a joint panel and the European Parliament, just as the European Parliament intended.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, as of 2005, the European capital of culture will enjoy the optimum conditions for using the event as an ideal opportunity for inter‐cultural collaboration. The governments are willing to come up with generous funding for this great joint festivity, as was the European Parliament's initial wish. Finally, I should like to say that today we are going to vote on this project and on behalf of my group I would ask you to lend your support to an excellent example of how politics work. That is because interinstitutional consultations are playing an increasingly important part in the Community's decision‐making process and that is why the Group of the European People's Party will be voting for this report without any hesitation or regret.</p>

But perhaps it is not so very important which city is finally chosen. Perhaps it is especially important, however, to define in precise terms the responsibility that city will have to assume. What is important here is the content of the submission, as listed in Article 2a for instance, including the need to promote dialogue between European cultures and those from other parts of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one thing we must not forget: in a future united Europe the cultural capital of Europe will not just represent itself but will act as Europe"s cultural ambassador for that period.</p>

<p class="contents">Article 128 of the Maastricht Treaty stresses the importance of cooperation among Member States to conserve and safeguard Europe's important cultural heritage. Europe has great cultural diversity: throughout history Europe has been – and still is – a pole of exceptionally rich and varied cultural development, where European cultures are still being shaped and disseminated. The desire for cultural integration in Europe also means becoming conscious of the European cultural area. Every city considered as a possible European capital of culture has its own characteristics which can be summarised in four key words: knowledge, tradition, mobility and communication. These words express the coexistence of attempts to modernise, innovate and safeguard our historical and artistic heritage: a combination of past, present and future which keeps alive the memory of the roles and functions which, down the ages, have led to a cross‐fertilisation of cultures, knowledge and hence communication, by which I mean a diverse pattern of mobility and interaction.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has indicated, the European Parliament wishes to see greater Community involvement in the process of choosing the European Capital of Culture in the years 2005 to 2019, by altering the system of automatic nomination originally drawn up by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggested changes to the common position include the possibility of having several cities nominated in any one year and the establishment of a panel of independent experts, appointed by the Community institutions to provide opinions on these nominations. The overwhelming majority of delegations in the Council are minded to endorse Parliament's suggestions and have called on the German Presidency to reach an early consensus with us.</p>
<p class="contents">This consensus needs to be found rapidly, so that each European city which is nominated can, firstly, draw attention to cultural trends shared by the European people which that city has inspired and to which it has contributed significantly; secondly, promote cultural events in association with other cities in EU Member States, designed to bring about lasting cultural cooperation; thirdly, circulate these around the European Union; and fourthly, foster dialogue between the cultures of Europe and the rest of the world, but above all enhance that city's historical and artistic heritage by improving the quality of life there. Europe's architectural heritage is the expression of our different identities and, at the same time, of our common origins, in that materials, elements, forms and spaces meet, unite and divide in constant search of a balance between old and new. Knowledge and understanding of our architectural heritage are therefore key factors in determining our cultural identity and bear witness to our origins and our history.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Oreja, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (ES)</span> Mr President, I admit that I was greatly relieved when I saw the agreement that had been reached and when I saw how it had been reached because, at one point in time, I was seriously worried as I doubted that we would be able to reach an agreement at all. The lack of such an agreement would have been very serious indeed as it would have meant the loss of the European Capital of Culture, one of the most symbolic results of all cultural Community actions. For this reason, I should like to thank Mr Monfils in particular for having had the determination and, at the same time, the flexibility needed to reach these agreements. Also, I should like to thank the President of the Commission who, through his enthusiasm and good judgement, helped make this outcome possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will remember, on 30 October 1997, the Commission presented a Community initiative for the European Capital of Culture. The Commission"s proposal centred around three main elements. First, the Member States notify the Commission of their candidate city or cities that are competing to organise the event. Then, the Commission forms a selection panel composed of independent members that will draw up a report on the cities nominated and submit it to the Commission. Lastly, on the Commission"s proposal and after prior consultation with Parliament, the Council will select the European Capital of Culture by qualified majority.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, what we discussed was replacing the intergovernmental procedure that had been used until that point and had also proved to be increasingly cumbersome as a Community procedure that involved Parliament, the Council and the Commission. Then, in its common position of July 1998, the Council arrived at a solution that was barely satisfactory and that was based on a rota system linked to the Presidency. The selection procedure was significantly different to the Commission"s proposal and, furthermore, Parliament was virtually excluded from the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The determination of this House and the declaration of intent to reject the common position announced on 13 January gave rise to the so‐called ‘mini‐conciliation" procedure and today we are reaping the benefits of negotiation between the two arms of the legislature, to which the Commission has also contributed.</p>
<p class="contents">The eight amendments we have before us, and which the Commission accepts, reintroduce the panel of leading independent figures back into the body of the text along with criteria that allow us to ensure the cultural quality and European dimension of the city"s programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and this is important – as an exceptional case the Council will adopt its decision on the basis of a recommendation by the Commission rather than a proposal. The recommendation will be drawn up after considering the European Parliament"s opinion and the panel"s report. In this way, a Community dimension going beyond the simple rotation of the Presidency will be introduced. We are therefore delighted by the outcome of the negotiations and we hope that both arms of the legislature will be able to accept the agreement that is today being put forward. And I should once again like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education and the Media, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Monfils, for his active involvement in this procedure.</p>
