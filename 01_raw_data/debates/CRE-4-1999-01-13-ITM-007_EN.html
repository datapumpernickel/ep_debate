<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">President</span> <span class="bold">.</span> – As they deal with the same subject, the following questions will be taken together: </p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 1 by <span class="bold">Patricia McKenna </span>(H−1172/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Convention on mutual legal assistance and lawful interception of telecommunications</span></p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council report on the outcome of the Justice and Home Affairs Council of 3‐4 December 1998 with particular regard to any discussion on the Draft Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance, and the protocol thereto, on any debate or conclusions reached on the lawful interception of telecommunications (ENFOPOL 98, 10951/98, and 10951/1/98 REV 1 amending the Council Resolution of 17 January 1995<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> – ENFOPOL 87), and on any ongoing discussion taking place at the K4 Committee and its working parties? How can the Council justify the secrecy and lack of consultation surrounding these initiatives when the documents become available anyway, and the only result is a lack of democratic debate, either in the European Parliament or in the national parliaments? Why do not the Member States debate the matter openly in advance before agreeing in the ‘group of twenty' countries, since these are such crucial and far‐reaching measures, with enormous potential impact on the realm of privacy? What exact legal redress is available to citizens, should they wish to challenge either these rules, as being in breach of rights enshrined in the Treaties, or the decisions taken under these rules?</p>
<p class="contents"></p>
<p class="contents">Question No 2 by <span class="bold">Inger Schörling </span>(H−1236/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: ECHELON</span></p>
<p class="contents">One of the subjects discussed during a debate in Parliament on 14 September was the ECHELON surveillance system. The Commission said on that occasion that it had no knowledge of the existence of ECHELON. It would, therefore, be valuable to know what emerged during the Council meeting on justice and home affairs of 3‐4 December 1998, particularly with regard to covert listening and monitoring of telecommunications and how that relates to ENFOPOL 98, 10951/98 and 10951/1/98 REV I amending the Council resolution of 17 January 1995<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> .</p>
<p class="contents">Why does the Council not find it appropriate to discuss these matters openly with Parliament, particularly in view of the fact that they concern the individual's right to a private life and that any agreements concluded may be in direct conflict with Member States' national legislation?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer the questions by Mrs McKenna and Mrs Schörling, and would like to welcome him once again.</p>

<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, in reply to this question, the Council has already pointed out on several occasions when answering questions on this subject in the House – and I can only repeat this – that it has never been involved with issues concerning the matter which the honourable Member refers to in her latest question. I would therefore ask her to appreciate that the Council is not in a position to provide an answer on this.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that the interception of telecommunications, which is the subject of the proposal for a Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters, seeks to promote international cooperation in order to control international crime. This type of interception does not pursue any other objectives apart from that of fighting organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add then that the honourable Members" questions are concerned with the interception of telecommunications for the purpose of solving crimes. The relevant Council bodies are currently dealing with a draft Council resolution on new technologies which is clearly connected with both the Council Resolution of 17 January 1995 on the lawful interception of telecommunications, and the discussions on the interception of telecommunications within the framework of the Draft Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The requirements of the competent authorities with regard to the technical implementation of lawful interceptions in modern telecommunications systems are summarised in the 1995 resolution. It should be noted that this resolution does not deal with the legal basis for authorising interception; it deals solely with the technical requirements for the monitoring agencies with regard to monitoring telecommunications on the basis of a valid authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1995 resolution is applied in principle to current and future telecommunications systems. In view of ongoing progress in telecommunications technology, however, it is being considered whether the resolution needs clarification on a series of points, pertaining to satellite systems and the Internet in particular. This draft resolution seeks to provide the necessary clarification.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Draft Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in criminal matters, the possibility of adopting rules on the interception of telecommunications for the purpose of solving crime has been carefully examined both by experts and by the Council itself. Conventional telecommunications systems operate within one country and are based on the assumption that a target in any one country can only be monitored by means of the telecommunications system in that particular country. However, these technical restrictions do not apply to the new satellite systems. New forms of cooperation are therefore necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The ongoing discussions involve a series of highly sensitive political issues. Moreover, the issues concerned are of a highly complex technical nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, due respect should be paid in this connection to the human rights angle and in particular to the relevant provisions of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 3 and 4 December 1998, the Council examined the most difficult political issues. These concerned cases of monitoring for the purpose of solving crime, where the technology could be made available for a country to monitor a target in another country without this country providing the technical support to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">A broad majority of Member States took the view that the country in which the target is located should be informed in these cases and should be in a position to demand that it is not monitored, or that it ceases to be monitored. One Member State declared itself in favour of providing for exceptions for reasons of national security.</p>
<p class="contents">Some other issues were also discussed, in particular the question as to what extent the Member State in which the target is located should be in a position to demand that material already seized be destroyed. In this connection, however, the question that requires urgent clarification is whether it is sufficient to merely inform the country in which the target is located, or whether this country should arrange for the target to be monitored under the mutual legal assistance arrangements in accordance with its legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is also particularly important because the result of an obligation to merely inform the country in which the target is located would be to shape technology in such a way that individuals could be monitored in their own country by another Member State.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> ‐What we are talking about here is that the Internet would be forced to put facilities in place so that the police can come in through the back door. If these plans were implemented ENFOPOL would be able to monitor almost every communication mode. This would be a gross abuse of people's right to privacy and of basic civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an internal Council document which was to be discussed. It has been put on the Internet in German. In the interests of transparency, this document should be available in all languages so people can see what is going on at these K4 meetings. Even though you talk about the justification for this, you do not mention what the consequences are or the cost effect for the Internet providers to provide such a facility. They are going to be asked to pay for this so that the police can, without warrants and without any justification, bar this bland statement by yourself, say that this is done to fight crime. We need openness and to know what is going on. Parliament should be informed, Member States should open up this discussion so that people in the Member States know what is going on before it is too late.</p>

This is rather an interesting piece of news, since it could be that discussions do not take place within the Council itself but elsewhere, for example in the K4 Committee and in other committees and working groups.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the question still remains: why does the Council not find it convenient to discuss the matter openly with the European Parliament, particularly in view of the fact that it has a direct bearing on the public"s right to privacy? There is also the possibility of any agreement turning out to be in direct conflict with national legislation. A reply would therefore be much appreciated.</p>

<p class="contents">My second question concerns illegal telephone tapping and more precisely the Echelon system, which is a global military surveillance system without any legal base. Has the Echelon system ever been discussed in the Council of Ministers, and is there any link between Echelon and the system of lawful interception that exists in the EU?</p>

<p class="contents">The Commission report on the operation of the EU's own resources system includes a proposal that the Member States should continue to pay direct aid under the common agricultural policy based on Community legislation as they do at present, but that instead of receiving a 100 % refund from the EU budget, they will receive only a partial refund of 75 %. Since, according to the Commission's data, such a change to the own resources system will not only harm the ‘cohesion countries', and particularly Greece, but will also undermine the basic principles and rules governing the common agricultural policy, will the Council confirm that no proposals will be adopted which deprive the cohesion countries of some ECU 1.2 billion annually, while the unacceptable refund arrangements enjoyed by the UK since 1984, amounting to some ECU 1.3 billion, are retained?</p>

Mr Alavanos will understand that the Council cannot comment on individual points mentioned during the discussions, given that the negotiations are still taking place and full agreement has not been reached. However, the Council can at this stage indicate that it was specifically asked at the Vienna European Council to carefully examine all the issues raised and viewpoints set out during the discussions, so that full agreement can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council has also asked all Member States to participate fully in helping to achieve, on the basis of solidarity and careful budgetary management, a fair and balanced outcome that is acceptable to all.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 4 by <span class="bold">Eva Kjer Hansen, which has been taken over by Mrs Spaak </span>(H−1176/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Institutional problems on enlargement</span></p>
<p class="contents">Do the unresolved institutional problems really mean that there will be no enlargement of the EU before 2005? There are still no plans as to how enlargement will take place: Firstly, the protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of the European Union reduces the number of Commissioners to one per Member State provided that the weighting of votes in the Council is modified, but 20 new Commissioners are to be appointed in January 2000 for a 5‐year term of office. Secondly, Article 137 of the Amsterdam Treaty lays down that the number of Members of the European Parliament must not exceed 700, but at the next elections 626 MEPs will be elected for a 5‐year term of office.</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer this question, which Mrs Spaak has now taken over.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, the Council would point out to Mrs Spaak that the protocol on the institutions with the prospect of enlargement of the European Union, which is intended to form the basis of a plan for adapting the institutions, has not yet entered into force, since the Amsterdam Treaty to which this protocol is annexed has not yet been ratified by all the Member States. As soon as all the instruments of ratification have been deposited in Rome, the treaty and the protocols in the annex, which constitute an integral part of the treaty, will enter into force on the first day of the second month following the deposit of the final ratification instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Spaak, this last sentence was so incomprehensible even in my own language that I should prefer to clarify it. In other words, if everyone has ratified the treaty by the end of March, it will enter into force on 1 May, and if everyone has ratified it by the end of April, it will enter into force on 1 June. I had trouble understanding the sentence myself.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Vienna European Council on 11 and 12 December, it was agreed that the ratification of the Amsterdam Treaty still constitutes our first priority. When it meets in Cologne the Council will decide when and how to tackle the institutional problems which are not resolved in the treaty, and which must be resolved before enlargement takes place. The important question which you raised, Mrs Spaak, must be considered in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Council would point out that, until now, there has been no formal confirmation of the date on which the current accession negotiations with the applicant countries will be brought to a close. The case considered by Mrs Spaak is therefore not on the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question on Article 189, formerly Article 137 of the consolidated treaties, it should be noted that the number of 700 Members of the European Parliament from the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty is valid for the number of Member States in the Union at that time. Apportionment amongst the individual Member States following enlargement will be negotiated at the appropriate time.</p>

The Council has not yet dealt specifically with the proposals you mentioned, but has merely discussed the question of how the unresolved institutional problems are to be tackled. As you know, the German Presidency was instructed only a few weeks ago to make a procedural proposal for the summit in Cologne. We are currently holding the necessary discussions on this, and I have just pledged within another parliamentary body to ensure that the discussion within Parliament and the opinion it forms will be duly taken into account, because Parliament has a particularly important role to play, especially concerning the development of the institutional character of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore not be able to reach a decision on the core issues regarding institutional reform during the German Presidency, and do not even wish to, because for the moment we have only been instructed to make a procedural proposal. I must draw your attention to the fact – and you of course know this – that agreement on a particular procedure is often already halfway to reaching overall agreement in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with enlargement, I should also like to tell you that in the opinion of the presidency, there is full agreement on the need to resolve the institutional problems by the time the first accessions take place. That the presidency also wishes to speed up the decision‐making process on institutional issues is a positive signal to the applicant countries, and I think it is in our mutual interest that this positive signal can actually be given as well.</p>

I am a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee with Poland. The Polish Government has indicated that it believes it will be ready for accession in January 2003. They may not be able to achieve that. But are we, in effect, shutting the door to any enlargement within the period of the next five years? It seems to me that if Commissioners are to be appointed at the end of this year on the same basis as they are at the moment, it would present serious problems. The same, to some extent, applies to Parliament. I wonder if some thought is being given to these issues. If we are going to wait until next year or later before we begin to think about these factors, you can see the difficulties that will arise.</p>

A date has not been fixed for the accessions. Neither a later nor an earlier date has been indicated, but rather the date fixed will depend solely on how the negotiations progress. As you know, there are altogether 31 packages for negotiation. You are aware of the current situation. Three of the 31 negotiation packages have been concluded provisionally, and four more are about to be concluded. We intend to start negotiations on six to eight more packages during the German Presidency, so that about half of all the packages are in the process of being negotiated by mid−1999.</p>
<p class="contents">By then we will have perhaps almost reached the stage where we can see how much longer we actually need. We will then have to decide whether or not to fix a date for the accessions. I do not see the danger you seem to in the effect that institutional reform would have on enlargement. According to the consensus we have established within the Member States, the institutional problems should be resolved by the year 2001. However, I would see this as the latest date for this. It is highly unlikely that an accession treaty can be agreed upon and concluded with any one applicant country by 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer this question very precisely, I do not believe that we will be in a position where the negotiations on accession have been concluded, but the European Union is not ready for enlargement because the institutional issues have not been resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is of the utmost importance for the German Presidency, and I am grateful to see that this is also an extremely important issue for Parliament. I firmly believe that the credibility of the entire enlargement process also depends on how seriously we work towards completing the institutional reforms.</p>

Experts within the Council group on police cooperation are dealing with crime in European cities. In the past, their work focused on violence in cities, police cooperation and violent gangs in urban areas.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to improve the exchange of information on proven methods, increase the exchange of experiences and extend practical cooperation, the group has agreed on an exchange programme for officials active in the area of violence in cities. One of the first exchange schemes for police officers who are active in the campaign against violence in cities took place in France in October 1998. Such exchange schemes will also be run in the future.</p>

In the last year, Mr Voggenhuber, Mrs McCarthy, Mr Schiedermeier, Mrs Pack and many others have been attacked in Brussels. My office carried out a survey of 300 offices in the European Parliament; over a third of them reported an incidence of criminal assault in Brussels within the last year.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European institutions need to be made safer. The Belgian national parliament is kept under surveillance by the army and the police force. As far as I know, the European institutions are not kept under surveillance at all. There are more than 10 reported cases of theft on average each month in the European Parliament alone.

<p class="contents">As a vice‐chairman of Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control, I was astonished to read the answer I received from the Council to my question of 1 October concerning the ending of duty‐free sales. I am a directly elected Member of the European Parliament, and the people I represent expect the questions I submit to be treated seriously, as do I. What I received on 19 November 1998 is not a serious answer. I therefore have no alternative but to resubmit my original question, and I expect that, this time, a proper answer will be given.</p>
<p class="contents">Duty‐free sales in the EU will come to an end on 30 June 1999. The 22nd recital of Council Directive 92/12/EEC<a href="#def_1_3" name="ref_1_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> states that before their abolition ‘a certain period of time will be required to take the necessary measures to alleviate both the social repercussions in the sectors concerned and regional difficulties ... which might arise'.</p>
<p class="contents">In a reply to the Ombudsman, the Commission takes the view that it is not required to carry out an analysis of these problems, stating that it had never been the Council's intention to impose such an obligation on the Commission and that this was confirmed when the Ecofin Council discussed the question in November 1996, adding that, as these were informal discussions, the conclusions were not recorded in the official minutes, but that the matter was again discussed by the Ecofin Council on 19 May 1998 with the same result (Commission's observations in response to a request from the European Ombudsman for further information (complaint by Freddy Blak, ref. 0879/97)).</p>
<p class="contents">Will the Council confirm the Commission's reading of the Council's conclusions and explain how this view is in keeping with the above Directive?</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 8 by <span class="bold">Gisèle Moreau </span>(H−1227/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Postponement of the abolition of intra‐Community duty‐free shopping</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 19 May 1998 the Council confirmed that the decision it took in 1991 to abolish intra‐Community duty‐free shopping would indeed be implemented on 1 July 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">All the studies that have been carried out highlight the very large number of job losses which will result from the abolition of duty‐free shopping in airports and on ferries. In France, for example, more than 12 000 jobs would disappear in regions where unemployment levels are already very high.</p>
<p class="contents">Is the Council prepared to draw the appropriate conclusions from these impact studies and postpone implementation of the decision abolishing intra‐Community duty‐free sales?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer these two questions together.</p>

The conclusions read as follows: With regard to the decision taken in 1991 on duty‐free sales for travellers between the Member States, the European Council has asked the Commission and the ECOFIN Council to examine by March 1999 the problems which may arise with regard to employment and, on the basis of proposals from the Commission, to look at how these problems can be dealt with, including the possibility of extending the transitional provisions for a limited period. From the Council"s point of view, it cannot say anything further on this matter at the present time.</p>

<p class="contents">My question relates in particular to the implementation of the directive on fresh meat, which dates from the 1960s, which states that checks on poultry can be made only on a through‐put basis, which would help producers. In fact, they have to be done on a one‐hour inspection. The increased cost to the United Kingdom alone is deemed to be £40‐£50 per inspection of each factory. I cannot believe that it was the Council of Ministers' and the Commission's intention to do this. There is also a 1972 poultry meat directive which makes EU and UK producers equally uncompetitive. I just want an assurance from the Council of Ministers tonight that it is not its intention to put our own poultry producers out of business.</p>

I should like in particular to point out to Mr Hyland that the employment problem in the rural areas of the European Union is the subject of a letter which the President of the Agriculture Council sent to the President of the European Council in November 1997 in the context of the special employment summit.</p>
<p class="contents">This letter focused in particular on the possible ways of maintaining a healthy rural population structure throughout the European Union. A European agriculture model was drawn up in the context of work previously carried out by the Council on the Agenda 2000 proposals. This model, which is to be further developed in the future, is for a multifunctional and competitive form of agriculture throughout the European Union, and also in the regions with specific problems, which is viable in the long term. It is a programme which should in particular be able to make an important contribution to the survival of rural areas.</p>

Does he agree that the contribution of farmers to a society cannot always be evaluated in purely economic terms and that their role as environmental managers and guarantors of food security and quality puts them outside the economic realm of other professions?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, does he agree that rural development policy will not achieve its full potential in isolation from integrated regional policy? Is it intended to make it mandatory on national governments to implement such a regional policy, thus providing jobs in the regions to sustain rural communities and provide off‐farm employment for farmers who do not have viable farms and other rural dwellers?</p>

I can therefore say in principle that the task of maintaining sustainable rural areas is a matter of priority for the Council. We must really make sure that the people in rural areas have the chance of a future. This future need not necessarily be in the traditional areas of agriculture. Opportunities for the future can of course also be created through structural change, as you know very well.</p>
<p class="contents">I firmly believe that we will manage to target European Union funds in the area of regional and structural policy even more efficiently on this objective, not least within the framework of the reforms which are being carried out under Agenda 2000. This is a really important objective of the Union"s regional and structural policy, in the opinion of the presidency at least. It not only involves making standards of living more equal, but it means that important agricultural landscapes in the rural areas of Europe will continue to offer people quality of life and job prospects in the future as well.</p>

Would the Council accept that agricultural policy is only one method by which we can assist rural areas? In particular, looking at reform of the structural funds, will he bear in mind that we should not just look at per capita income or unemployment but also at levels of population density and depopulation in determining areas that should qualify for Objective 1? I have in mind here – to be parochial – particularly the Highlands and Islands in my own country. On per capita income, it would not qualify but – given its other problems, particularly depopulation – it should in my opinion remain in the Objective 1 zone.</p>

The problem which we have just discussed can naturally arise in any of the assisted areas of the European Union, with the exception of urban agglomerations, of course. It can arise in Objective 1, Objective 2 and former Objective 5b areas, and we now need a coherent policy which coordinates and uses all our funds in such a way as to limit the effects of the problem we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I am firmly convinced that the reform proposals which are under discussion within the framework of Agenda 2000 will considerably improve the quality of life in the countryside as well. The adoption of Agenda 2000 is therefore also a matter of priority for the German Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the Employment Pact which Europe is seeking to achieve, it will depend to a great extent on not only bearing in mind the traditional areas of industry or the development of new technologies, but also taking into account in this context the specific problems of rural areas. I am able to add that the German Presidency will give this matter its fullest attention.</p>

In order to achieve this, it will actually be necessary to achieve greater coordination between the different policy areas and also to establish clear priorities.

Mr Gallagher will be aware that in view of the whole background to these discussions – that is, Agenda 2000 – decisions on these issues are being taken on a comprehensive basis. These decisions will include the future status of regions in the Community from the point of view of their classification according to different objectives and the corresponding financial support provided by the Community in the area of structural measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Council would point out that Ireland will continue to enjoy the Community support it currently receives until the end of the next programming period under a phasing out arrangement, no matter what the outcome of these decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of future enlargement, I should like to remind you of the general position of the European Union regarding the accession negotiations in the area of fisheries when the accession conference was opened on 31 March 1998. According to this, there will be no exceptions whatsoever for the acceding countries when adopting and transposing the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> .</p>
<p class="contents">If transitional arrangements are agreed, then these must remain the exception, and they must be for a limited period of time and restricted in their scope. They must have a plan that clearly establishes the individual stages of application of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> . It is therefore obvious that these accession negotiations do not involve negotiating mutual concessions, but rather guaranteeing that the applicant countries adopt all of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , and are also in a position to transpose it effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">So that the applicant countries are completely aware of the obligations which membership of the Union involves, an analysis of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire, </span> which is known as screening, is carried out by the Commission prior to the accession negotiations. The applicant countries are currently presenting their negotiating positions on fisheries. The Union will analyse these positions and prepare its response in the first half of 1999. As usual, the Commission will make a proposal for a common position to the Council, and the Council will establish the Union"s common position for the negotiations. The content of the common position cannot of course be anticipated at present.</p>

In short I presume it can be said that, in the negotiations, any applicant country will have to comply with existing criteria, and that any transitional arrangements will have to be limited. Unfortunately that is the situation. But can I say this to the President‐in‐Office: I am sure he will appreciate that in the region I represent – the west and the north‐west of Ireland – and indeed the entire Irish coast, we had at one time prolific fishing grounds until these were plundered, not by Irish fishermen but indeed by our partners in Europe. We have learnt a sad lesson from this and I would not wish this on any of the other countries who in future may join the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the regions and the coastal area of our country, an island state, we have no alternative source of employment. Priority should be given to this in any future negotiations. We will deal with the Irish case in the review of the common fisheries policy, but other small states should learn from the serious situation in Ireland, as a result of fisheries not being treated on the same level as agriculture or indeed industry. Let us learn from the past and let other smaller states benefit from our sad experience.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference was made to the Structural Funds, and I should like to ask the President‐in‐Office whether he believes that Ireland will qualify for the transitional arrangements. He will be aware that we are an applicant for Objective 1 status for the west coast of Ireland, which is very much part of the region that I referred to, but will he also let me have his view on having an Objective 5 or 6 or a specific objective for regions highly dependent on fishing, whether or not the country in question has Objective 1 status?</p>

Also, your country, Ireland, is participating in the accession conference and has every possibility to raise the national and supranational viewpoints you have described during the negotiations. I also firmly believe that this will be done. However, I am not in a position at present to tell you anything about the implementation of the redefinition of assisted areas, or the criteria which affect assisted areas, as the decision of general principle has not yet been taken. The individual Member States have obviously established their own positions. However, as you already know, the Council has not yet stated its common position with regard to Agenda 2000. I would therefore have to rely on assumptions at the present time, and making assumptions unfortunately serves no purpose in this case. We must continue to be patient and wait until Agenda 2000 can be concluded.

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, as far as organised crime is concerned, it is the presidency"s intention to actively promote the implementation of the action plan approved by the European Council at its meeting in Amsterdam in June, and to start discussions on stronger measures to fight organised crime in accordance with the request made at the Vienna European Council, as well as to guarantee the unrestricted protection of civil rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with this, the Council will examine measures to step up the fight against fraud and counterfeiting. On the basis of the Communication from the Commission on a framework for action on combatting fraud and counterfeiting of non‐cash means of payment, discussions on an instrument of criminal law in this area have already been started. The work begun under the Austrian Presidency on the protection of the euro under criminal law is being continued and intensified. Moreover, the German Presidency will take an initiative under criminal law against fraudulent activity in awarding contracts in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Particular attention is being given to creating a European legal and judicial area in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty. This European legal and judicial area will be, or is meant to be, equipped with instruments which are necessary for effective judicial and police cooperation. The presidency will arrange initiatives which will make it possible for the Council to closely examine to what extent and in which priority areas some form of approximation or harmonisation of the Member States" laws could help to fight organised crime.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the presidency will actively continue the discussions on the Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance, which will be an important instrument for officials working on the ground to fight organised crime. The effective operation of the European judicial network and the mechanism set up by the Council for mutual assessment will also be priority issues for the presidency. The German Presidency is particularly concerned to see Europol take up its duties. As the agreement entered into force on 1 October 1998, we are making every effort to remove the remaining legal obstacles so that Europol can take up its duties.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is of prime importance to clarify the questions which remain unresolved in terms of the adoption of rules for the joint data protection monitoring agency. Europol will take up its duties on the basis of a mandate which in the end was extended to include terrorism and certain aspects of trade in human beings. Its mandate is soon to be extended to cover criminal offences such as counterfeiting of coins and banknotes and of other means of payment. The German Presidency also intends to make a start with the discussions on the development of Europol in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty. In connection with this, consideration needs to be given to the role and duties falling to the judicial authorities in their relations with Europol in view of the extension of Europol"s powers.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the drugs problem, the German Presidency will actively continue to pursue the current initiatives, particularly in connection with Latin America and Central Asia. In addition, great importance is attached to the development of a strategy for the period following 1999, under which measures to reduce demand will play an important role. This role was confirmed at both the recent meeting of the United Nations General Assembly and the conference which followed it in Vienna in December 1998. The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is a very important player in the campaign to reduce demand.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – I would like to thank the President‐in‐Office for his response. Indeed, I am delighted to hear that he sees Europol's role as being central to the development of the fight against organised crime on a pan‐European level. I hope that the presidency will have the opportunity to expedite the removal of the remaining difficulties, by bringing fully into play the role and opportunities available through Europol's operational capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I was somewhat disappointed at your lack of response on the matter of consumption of drugs. The increasing use of drugs is one area where there is common concern across all Member States. Bland statements such as ‘reducing demand is an important aspect" is not good enough. What we want to hear from the President‐in‐Office to day are specific measures for a common European strategy to save the future generation from dying from the effects of drug abuse.</p>

Mr Crowley, you know of course that a special summit of Heads of State and Government on the subject of organised crime is planned for the second half of this year under the Finnish Presidency, and that the issues you mentioned in connection with the fight against drugs will also play a central role in the preparation for this special summit. However, in cooperation with the Finnish Presidency we will do our bit so that the preparatory work for this is under way and so that the decisions we are currently in a position to make can be made at this special summit. This limitation relates to the fact that we can obviously only make decisions which are in keeping with our capabilities, our resources, our instruments, and our institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency wholly shares the political assessment on which your question was based. We consider the fight against drug abuse to be a key task of domestic policy in Western countries, and indeed in all countries. It is naturally also a joint task which we should tackle – as far as possible – within the framework of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">Question No 18 by <span class="bold">María Izquierdo Rojo </span>(H−1217/98)<span class="italic"> Subject: Agenda items for the forthcoming Euro‐Mediterranean Summit in Stuttgart</span></p>
<p class="contents">What measures or proposals are being prepared in order to give substance to the ‘new impetus' to be applied to the Euro‐Mediterranean Partnership, as referred to in paragraph 116 of the conclusions to the Vienna European Council? What new suggestions are likely to be put forward at the Third Euro‐Mediterranean Conference, to be held in Stuttgart in April 1999?</p>
<p class="contents">I give the floor to Mr Verheugen to answer Mrs Izquierdo Rojo's question.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><img src="/doceo/data/img/hr.gif" width="100%" height="1" alt="" /></td><td align="right" width="16"><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="buttondocwin"><tbody><tr><td align="center"><a href="#top" title="Top"><img src="/doceo/data/img/navi_top.gif" width="16" height="16" border="0" alt="" /></a></td></tr></tbody></table></td></tr></table>
<p class="contents">
<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Verheugen, </span> <span class="italic"> President‐in‐Office of the Council. – (DE)</span> Mr President, please excuse the fact that this answer will also be relatively long, because it is a very complex issue. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, the Foreign Ministers" meetings which are held regularly generally serve to examine whether the Barcelona Declaration is being applied, and to define measures which make it possible to achieve the objectives of the partnership, as laid down in the Barcelona Declaration itself.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the conference in Stuttgart will therefore cover all three chapters of the partnership. As at the previous Euro‐Mediterranean ministerial conferences, the participants should confirm their total commitment to the partnership, examine the results which have already been achieved, and give new impetus by laying down new guidelines. The importance of the partnership"s balanced development in all three chapters of the Barcelona Declaration and its work programme should also be emphasised.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the case of the second ministerial conference, the Council expects a Commission communication this time as well; this should be available at the beginning of March, and will serve as the basis for establishing the EU"s position for the conference in Stuttgart. Close cooperation with our Mediterranean partners will continue to be necessary in order to guarantee a successful outcome at the conference. Within the framework of the economic and financial partnership, particular importance should be attached to the work carried out by government experts on economic transition and the overall view, which covers issues of free trade and the effects of economic transition in the region in accordance with the conclusions of La Valetta. This will serve as a basis for the discussions on the future strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the Council continues to hope that the negotiations on an association agreement with Egypt and Libya can be concluded before the ministerial conference in Stuttgart, and that progress can be quickly made on negotiating agreements with Algeria and Syria, in order to achieve the objective of creating an area of shared prosperity. Moreover, the Euro‐Mediterranean Conference on regional cooperation, which is being held on 28 and 29 January in Valencia, will prepare for the discussion of various aspects of regional cooperation at the conference in Stuttgart.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU"s programme for these discussions will essentially be based on the Council"s conclusions concerning the Communication from the Commission on the Euro‐Mediterranean partnership and the single market. The Council continues to expect proposals for the renewal of the MEDA regulation, MEDA 2 covering the period 2000‐2004, including proposals for the simplification of MEDA procedures, which the Commission should present before the conference in Stuttgart. The Council pays particular attention to achieving the political objective of creating a Euro‐Mediterranean area of peace and stability. At the ad hoc ministerial meeting in Palermo on 3 and 4 June 1998, an integrated approach for regional stability was adopted, and it was made clear that we need to devise a common understanding of the factors which can, according to general consensus, contribute to a regional stability programme of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">These factors include terrorism, organised crime, proliferation of weapons, illegal entry of immigrants, socio‐economic challenges, prejudice, racism and xenophobia. Furthermore, the Euro‐Mediterranean partners will concentrate their efforts on drawing up a charter which contains the elements mentioned, and which will help to create a stable political and institutional framework for the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of an area of shared prosperity will make it possible for the Council to firmly support common values that should be recognised and applied by all Mediterranean partners. With this in mind, the Council will work to ensure that greater attention is paid to human rights and fundamental freedoms as crucial elements of security in the region. Without a political framework, the economic, social and cultural progress in the Euro‐Mediterranean region will not be sustainable. The Council will work energetically towards the adoption of the charter which I have referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">The conference in Stuttgart could give a lasting impetus that allows us to move a little bit closer to achieving this objective.</p>

He did nothing more than make empty general statements that we had heard before</p>
<p class="contents">It is truly disappointing, Mr President‐in‐Office, to listen to a question from Parliament being answered in this meaningless bureaucratic tone. As someone who, in just over four minutes, said nothing, please now answer a question for me, and I only have one minute to ask this question. I want you to be more specific about something that is extremely important in the Mediterranean.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know what the German Presidency is going to do, as far as Algeria is concerned, to combat fraud, corruption and abuses of power. Above all – and this is a very important matter – how is it going to defend the human rights of the Algerian people? How are you going to safeguard the right to life of the dying rural population in Algeria – where 20 people died today, 20 yesterday and 40 the day before that – if the Council of the European Union does not take the hint, not even to say that it will take some action?</p>

However, I would ask you to understand that I must report the positions which are supported by 15 countries. Surely you realise as well as I do that one of the Union"s problems is that we do not have a common foreign and security policy in the stricter sense. Answers such as that which I have just given you are the result of this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an answer does not reflect the capabilities or intentions of the presidency; it reflects the state of affairs in the European Union in the area of foreign and security policy. I assume that you see this in exactly the same way as I do.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency is obviously not in a position to change internal relations in Algeria. It is merely in a position to exert an influence – by continuing the intensive political dialogue which has already been started with Algeria – on the improvement of relations with regard to democracy, human rights, rule of law, and fair social development. I can assure you that the German Presidency will work towards this in this dialogue.</p>
