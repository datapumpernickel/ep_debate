I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work. However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau. In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one. The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics. Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern? The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb. In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned. I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last. Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations. I pay special tribute to him for his success. I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé. I am quite sure that Mrs Kinnock’s report and the one on regional cooperation and integration had a major bearing on the outcome of these negotiations. I also thank the Working Groups on the small island states and climate change and the Follow-up Group on Fisheries for their excellent reports. We have had question times to the Council and the Commission and to the ACP Council, and I would like to thank those institutions for their interest in our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thrust of our work in both Assemblies was poverty eradication. The resolution passed went so far as to say that poverty amounted to a violation of human rights. It also emphasised the importance of abolishing gender inequalities and as I travel through Africa and see the work done by women I only wish there were more women in senior government positions and in presidential posts. We might then see an end to some of the fraud, corruption and mismanagement that seem endemic in some countries and that have to be stopped.</p>
<p class="contents">We had, as usual, many debates on countries where there are war situations. I visited Ethiopia and Eritrea to gain first-hand knowledge. The OAU is doing its best to broker a peace deal there. But Ethiopia is still calling for clarification on certain issues and the humanitarian situation in both countries is serious.</p>
<p class="contents">We were delighted to hear in Nassau that a trade agreement was being reached with South Africa after four years of negotiations. This highlights the problems of coherence between the EU and the developing nations, which came to a head at the WTO talks in Seattle. Much work has to be done to convince the developing nations of the advantages of globalisation and world free-trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">In Nassau, we had two interesting debates on East Timor and Cuba. Cuba has observer status but I understand has now shown a wish to join the ACP. All nations from within the confines of the ACP territory who can live up to the requirements of democracy, human rights, governance and an independent judiciary are, I am sure, welcome. I await with interest developments in Cuba. When Mr Dalmau, the Cuban Junior Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Assembly, he did not hesitate to let his feelings be known.</p>
<p class="contents">On East Timor, Mr Da Costa, from the Timorese National Resistance Council, gave a very moving address indicating that East Timor would also like to join the ACP when it becomes a state with a government. We must give them all our support to reach that goal. Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly. A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states.</p>
<p class="contents">I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President. I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May. We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the “them and us” syndrome.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates. This I think is the new Convention. Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work. These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly. We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive. We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too. I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries. I want to see civil society given a louder voice. But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on. We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance. Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand. I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used. A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to. The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission. I believe that as equal partners the EU– and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task. I beg to move acceptance of this report.</p>

Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty. But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU. With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation. In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">An example here could be the field of education, which will deserve and need special support in the ACP states in future. For instance, the very rapidly growing educational and technological potential of the Internet offers entirely new means of helping the developing countries, which at present still have modest resources, to move towards a global approach, as opposed to globalisation. I see it as a future task of the EU to contribute in this way to the establishment of small and medium-sized enterprises in the ACP states, which can promote self-help. An example here is the problem in Nigeria, which imports industrial finished products from all over the world and then has to spend substantial resources on product maintenance by foreign workers.</p>
<p class="contents">One way forward to promote the setting up of SMEs could be to train the Nigerian population adequately. It will be easier to take account of the developing countries’ very diverse problems, and EU aid could be prepared and implemented in a more targeted manner if, as the report makes quite clear, we take the urgently needed step of optimising our working methods, by introducing the proposed regional assemblies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Junker (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, it cannot be repeated often enough: since 1975, the Lomé Convention has constituted an important pillar of European development cooperation and has a pilot role to play in many respects. Based as it is on the principle of partnership and equality, and on parliamentary control by the Joint Assembly, it is an example to the world. Most appropriately, given that this year we are celebrating 25 years of cooperation under Lomé, we will shortly be signing a new and more advanced partnership agreement, which also upgrades the Joint Assembly into a genuine parliamentary assembly on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">So I do not want to look back only to the year 1999. The rapporteur, Mr Corrie, has already done so most expertly. Much of what concerns us today is the outcome of fundamental processes of transformation in all parts of the world since the late 1980s. They also had strong repercussions in the developing countries. The after-shocks can still be felt. ACP cooperation is a dynamic process. The content of the agreements has progressed steadily between Lomé I and Lomé VI. At the same time the number of partner states has increased considerably, now standing at 71. All those involved were particularly moved by the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba has just knocked at the door, and, if Cuba is also accepted into the ACP-EU community, that will be a momentous step and will bring in its wake processes of change in Cuba itself. So ACP cooperation remains very exciting, and not only because of the new emphases introduced in the new Convention. Fighting poverty and promoting sustained economic, cultural and social development are important objectives in the endeavour to build up democratic societies, based on respect for human rights, in the ACP states. That also means strengthening the democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">The history of the Joint Assembly provides impressive evidence of a positive trend in that direction. In the past, the representatives of the ACP countries tended to be government members, government officials or ambassadors; but today at least three quarters of the ACP delegates are elected members of parliament. We ought to throw a big party when the figure reaches 100% in the near future, which is indeed what the new Convention is aiming at.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately there is far too little appreciation of the steady advance of processes of democratisation which, unlike the various crises that arise, largely pass unnoticed. One special aspect of multilateral cooperation with the ACP states is regional cooperation and integration.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one wish on the European Parliament’s long wish list that will be fulfilled: as we have already heard, the Joint Assembly will soon also be able to hold regional assemblies. Enhanced regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts based on ethnic, economic, social or religious factors, i.e. have a preventive effect. For the same reason the European Parliament has always called for civil society to be involved in the decision-making processes and in cooperation management, and emphasised the importance of decentralised cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The enhanced contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social partners provided for in the new Convention are another step in the right direction. But I am a little sad that the European Development Fund has still not been incorporated in the Community budget. I hope it does not take another 25 years before we finally achieve that too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Lomé Convention has been an expression of a real partnership between the EU and the ACP countries for over 25 years. That it has continued at all in the face of overwhelming pressure against it from many quarters, including the WTO, is a triumph of sorts. But of course the new Convention must be measured not by the fact that it exists but by the extent to which it can contribute to the EU commitment to poverty eradication and the achievement of the international development targets. Measured by this yardstick there are a number of serious shortcomings in the new arrangements. For example, the agreement is particularly disappointing for those ACP countries suffering from short-term fluctuations in export earnings.</p>
<p class="contents">During a marathon negotiating session in December a compromise was reached which provided that, in respect of least-developed, landlocked and island states, assistance would be provided in the event of a minimum 2% loss of export earnings rather than the level of 10% for the other ACP states. But at the final negotiating session the EU claimed that it had never actually agreed to the inclusion of islands and landlocked states among those which would qualify for the support on the basis of the 2% threshold.</p>
<p class="contents">This change has been devastating for the Windward Islands in particular which may be the only ACP state which will actually lose massively from the new arrangements. This seems a particularly perverse outcome since the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable of the ACP states and they are now going to have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé arrangement.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, on the trade side, pressure from the WTO to ensure that any Lomé Convention is WTO-compatible has meant that there is a huge momentum behind the idea of the so-called regional economic partnership arrangements or free-trade agreements. Non-least-developed countries are likely to face considerable pressure to accept these arrangements. Yet it is quite clear that even after a transitional period a number of countries will simply be unable to open their markets yet to the chill winds of free trade without wrecking their own domestic economy. We therefore need to be particularly vigilant to ensure that genuine options are open to those countries which are not yet ready for free-trade arrangements. We need to ensure that strategies for promoting regional integration within the ACP are pursued in their own right.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, during any new trade round the EU and the ACP states should press jointly for a reform of GATT Article 24 in order to explicitly provide regional non-reciprocal trade agreements between structurally and economically dissimilar groups of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lomé Convention is a unique partnership; but if it is to be truly effective it needs to extend beyond the discussions within the context of Lomé and involve a participation of the WTO and a partnership in all other international negotiating fora.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

People have the gall to say they benefit from the Lomé Convention, but even looking at trading relations alone, the Lomé Convention has done nothing to protect those countries; their already feeble share in trade with Europe has been halved. That reflects the growth of inequality between EU and ACP countries. The Lomé Convention essentially benefits a few large industrial or financial conglomerates, which continue to pillage those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, notably on the former colonial powers. </p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to so-called development aid, given that underdevelopment in the majority of these countries is getting worse rather than better, development is clearly not what the aid is for, even when it is not just a disguised export subsidy for European manufacturers. The aid is primarily a windfall for incumbent regimes, and the poor majority does not benefit at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Even if it were properly redirected this aid would not be enough to finance the most basic infrastructure for health care, education or drinking water supply. For some years now the great powers have been reducing the amount of this already derisory aid, and it is the height of cynicism when this is done on the pretext of human rights violations or corruption. After all, who protects these deeply corrupt regimes, if not the governments of the rich countries? They turn a blind eye to the masters of corruption, the big groups controlling oil, water supply, or public works. They could clamp down on them since their head offices are here in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries. I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority. A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly. </p>
<p class="contents">In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental. I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric.</p>
<p class="contents">My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development. I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the European Parliament – through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly – must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries’ budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries. We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here. I refer to Cuba’s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us. Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba’s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible. That is important, for at least three reasons. First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations. Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba’s application has the support of all the ACP countries. If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them. Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter. By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of ‘playing but not paying’, and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there. Ideally the European Parliament’s representatives should be able to support Cuba’s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing. Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member. The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it. It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Cuba’s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle. I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the <span class="italic">détente</span> and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not have very long in which to speak, and I really only want to take up two questions. </p>
<p class="contents">The first is about the fight against poverty, which I think is becoming an embarrassment both for the EU and the Member States. In spite of the fact that, both in the Treaty and at the UN’s meetings in Rio and Copenhagen, there was an undertaking to work to eradicate poverty in the world, the budget for development aid is, in actual fact, being cut back, when the express desire was that exactly the opposite should happen. We must put a stop to this trend. We must begin by writing off debts. We must follow up words with action. I should like us to take a leading role in this work. </p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the fact that, in many contexts, we talk about the ACP countries having to learn the principles of democracy. Paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution demand, within the context of the new agreement, that working methods should be developed and optimised. The ACP countries are to be urged to allow a whole range of political opinions to come up for discussion. I think that is a very good idea indeed, and I fully subscribe to it. However, we must also ask ourselves about our own democratic arrangements. How do these operate within the European Parliament’s delegation to the ACP-EU’s Joint Assembly? In contrast to how things are done here in the European Parliament and in Parliament’s committees, where rapporteurs are nominated and appointed to produce reports, there are no regulations whatsoever applied within this delegation to the Joint Assembly. The two large groups share all the reports and consultative documents etc between themselves. In order to change this undemocratic arrangement, we, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, have tabled Amendment No 6 in which we request that the rapporteurs appointed to produce reports and consultative documents, together with the members of working parties, should be appointed in accordance with clear, democratic rules. In this context, account ought to be taken of the smaller groups, and consideration given to introducing more representative arrangements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The eradication of poverty was central to our work and many speakers highlighted the need to preserve an essential tool for achieving that ambitious aim, to whit, preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries within the framework of the Lomé Conventions. The challenge was immense. Globalisation, free trade, and the hegemony of the WTO with its internationalist philosophy, were imperilling the very essence of the North-South dialogue. So we can only applaud the conclusion of a new partnership agreement for development, and personally I am convinced that the work of the last Joint Assembly did have a decisive influence on breaking the deadlock in the negotiations, as did the new climate created by the events at Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while I welcome the renewal of the agreements, what I find most interesting is the new wind blowing through our relationships and finding expression in the balanced nature of the negotiations now drawing to a close. The European Union seems to me to have finally emerged from the old paternalist, or frankly neo-colonialist, logic where those giving aid are all too eager to start giving lessons, following a formula our friend Michel Rocard is so keen on. The Union has finally accepted the idea that dialogue cannot be genuine or effective unless it is the expression of a contract which respects the dignity of the partners.</p>
<p class="contents">By refusing to allow the idea of good governance to become a tool, in the hands of technocrats, for imposing new sets of conditions, the European Union is demonstrating wisdom and modesty. We have spent two centuries laying the foundations of a democracy whose fragility is constantly brought home to us by events. What right have we to try to impose our model on people whose history, values and identity are sometimes so profoundly different from our own?</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I prefer the willingness that is clearly flagged up in these agreements to extend the partnership to new agents – local authorities, non-governmental organisations – which seems to me to represent the only possible way the people of these countries can progressively achieve ownership cooperation. In short, this is the only way they can emerge from humiliating and childlike dependence on aid and take responsibility for themselves, the proof of success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Parliament’s opinion on the activities of the ACP-European Union Joint Assembly has always had a major impact, undeniably contributing to a consistent policy and role for the European Union in development and cooperation. The important role of the increasingly parliamentary Joint Assembly in strengthening relations between the European Union and the ACP countries needs to be stressed. In view of this positive action, there is every advantage to be gained from according the Joint Assembly a budget compatible with improving the quality of its work. We back the rapporteur’s proposal to introduce regional parliamentary assemblies, under the aegis of the Joint Assembly, in the six regions of the Convention: the Caribbean, the Pacific and four African regions. These regional assemblies would monitor action in their respective areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty has been the common denominator of all the debates in the Joint Assembly and its eradication is the priority for the European Union’s development policy. In line with the resolution at the Nassau meeting, we must concentrate on meeting the poverty reduction targets agreed by the international community. Consistency and action are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">The next Lomé Convention must specify the investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and the participation of local bodies. The participation of local bodies is absolutely essential. In a wider context, the priorities, as I see it, are to convert poor countries’ debt into programmes for poverty eradication and sustainable development, as well as control of fraud and corruption. We need to make progress with concrete and consistent action. People in the poor countries are beginning to despair.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to act on the rapid accession of East Timor to the Lomé Convention as one means, amongst others, of promoting the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, in order to strengthen its internal democratisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I must congratulate the Council Presidency on the coming Europe-Africa Summit and call on all the participants to contribute to solid practical action to promote the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in the underdeveloped countries of Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly’s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria. The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role. In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system. With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries’ special economic and social limitations. Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with. I do not agree. That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned. It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly. </p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament’s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open. It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door. Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter. With regard to Cuba’s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba’s application. The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU’s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex. With regard to the Côte d’Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities. With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered. For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores. </p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed. It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament’s decisions on this subject. There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions. This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon. In this regard, I am simply pleased – delighted, in fact – here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa’s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU’s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa. So the “Grappa War” is over. Peace has broken out, and we can now look forward to cooperation with South Africa in accordance with the common dreams and values which ought to have underpinned the whole business from the start. I think this rather nicely puts the finishing touches to a debate which has, on the whole, been quite positive, and I would repeat my thanks to the rapporteur and to Parliament for the cooperation which has gone into our relations with the Third World on precisely the work in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
