<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Alyssandrakis (GUE/NGL)</span></span>  <span class="italic">, rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this European Commission proposal is about developing a space policy not at the level of individual Member States but at the level of the European Union. It was drafted together with the European Space Agency and proposes three lines of approach: strengthening the foundation for space activities, enhancing scientific knowledge and reaping the benefits for markets and society.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy welcomes these lines of approach and acknowledges the overall benefit of developing space activities. In fact, the development of launch systems is prerequisite to any other space activity. We can build in this sector on the experience and technical know-how which the Member States have acquired over several decades, especially from the Ariane launch system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line of approach is a perfectly natural one, in that space is an ideal place for carrying out research which cannot be carried out on earth, such as astronomic research into radiation which cannot penetrate the earth's atmosphere, research under conditions of zero gravity etc.</p>
<p class="contents">The third line of approach is very broad and covers everything we call space applications. These applications range from satellite telecommunications to navigation and earth observation systems and have become an integral part of our daily life. I should like to stress here that, if mankind is to benefit from space activities, then space must not be used as a platform for strategic competition. It is highly significant, in my view, that the committee report emphasizes in the very first paragraph that space activities should only be intended for peaceful purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly worried by the amendment proposing to add the phrase “which purposes may include strategic applications within the context of peaceful operations”. If we adopt this amendment, we shall be opening the door to all manner of strategic activities in space, provided they are cloaked in the mantle of a “peaceful operation” and we have seen plenty of them on earth over recent years. In short, this is a Trojan horse that will change the tone of the report and allow all hell to break loose.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on all my fellow Members to keep to the Commission text. I also propose that they adopt Amendments Nos 2, 3 and 4 from Mr Souladakis’s opinion. I must stress that taking a stand against the militarisation of space is terribly important, especially following the recent decision by the United States’ government to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Agreement and its insistence on developing the so-called anti-missile shield. I tabled Amendment No 5 because I wanted to put the implications of this action on the record. May I also point out that, in my personal opinion, certain aspects of the proposed GMES programme involve strategic activities.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of space policy is also the subject of this debate. The European Space Agency has operated on a transnational basis on our continent for several years now and has played a pivotal role in developing the space activities of European countries. It is therefore only natural that there should be close collaboration between the European Union and the European Space Agency and we have already reaped rewards from this collaboration. The committee report notes the role of the European Space Agency and proposes that it be integrated into the European Union in the long term, but without losing its independence. I must say that I personally am against this. What worries me is that, if this happens, the European Space Agency will lose the independence which has helped it emerge as a global player. International collaboration is a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>in the space sector and the committee report refers favourably to it, stressing the need for international collaboration to be developed not just with the Russian Federation, the United States, China and Japan, but also with less developed countries for which the European Union could provide access to space.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to raise the subject of funding. As we all know, access to space has its rewards but does not come cheap. Τhe Sixth Framework Programme for funding research classifies space and aeronautics as a priority sector. That may show willing, but it is not enough. We do not just want a more general commitment, we need a more general commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate is important to the future of the European Union's space policy. I trust that the direction taken in the final vote will be to the benefit of our nations and mankind as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it notes that the CFSP is dealt with as an economic and development issue rather than as a defence and safety issue, with all that implies for Europe. This is in all probability due to the fact that the CFSP is still under development. In this sense, I suppose that this proposal will mature at the next stage, as far as foreign policy and defence systems are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the content is concerned, I have several comments to make. First, there is a medley of policies in the Member States, which need to be more or less unified. Secondly, on the question of the strategic use of space: the strategic use of space is unavoidable <span class="italic">de facto</span>, but it must be used for peaceful purposes such as Petersberg-type tasks. In all events, our committee is opposed to the type of strategic mentioned in the famous Star Wars policy. It will, nonetheless, need to be used for missile interception installations in space and during wars, which destroy satellites.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I believe that we need to push forward with this policy, on which we agree, our criteria being that these methods must be used for peaceful applications, policies must be unified and any action taken must be integrated into a single European policy because, in the final analysis, Europe must not be dependent for its safety, communications and security on the satellite systems of either the United States of America or Russia. In this sense, quite apart from the fact that this initiative is of interest from a development point of view, it will also be of political interest and must therefore be considered crucial to the common foreign defence and security policy of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Ever since Lisbon, we in Europe have had the ambitious objective of being the best in the world, and technology and science are of course part of that, although I am not primarily thinking of the electronic voting apparatus we tested yesterday, but of advanced technologies such as, for example, telecommunications, earth observation and ecology. Europe must – as the past demonstrates – concentrate its strengths in these areas. Airbus and Ariane, based in Toulouse, are showpiece projects, demonstrating that Europe, if it concentrates its strengths, is capable of competing on a global scale. Industry is becoming ever more concentrated, and what counts here is the creation of European structures linking the European Union, the ESA and the Member States, which will facilitate more effective cooperation across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">Thought should, though, also be given to international cooperation beyond Europe. Here, I am thinking not only of the USA, but also of Russia and China. Any European research policy should of course be of the sort that is also likely to attract the rising generation in this sphere. I am myself from the aerospace industry and have been given to understand that fewer and fewer young people have been studying these subjects in the last few years. We should be tackling that ourselves and not looking to immigration as we do in other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need clear objectives in this area, though; hence the urgent request to the Member States to vote clearly in favour of Galileo. Industry, too, should break new ground here. It is important to the future that not only State bodies should take on responsibility, but that industry should also contribute to the development of services that the citizens can use and that are also capable of being marketed.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to deal with an important point that has been mentioned, namely the so-called militarisation of space. I do not think that Europe should be developing a ‘Star Wars’ programme, but I find the idea of equating any military use of the infrastructure with SDI highly dubious. After all, we do not speak of the militarisation of telecommunications just because the German Army uses the telephone. We want a European foreign and security policy, we want a Rapid Reaction Force, we send soldiers to other countries, and these troops must receive the information they need. So we should indeed be thinking at a European level about becoming independent in this area and capable of using our own infrastructure in the future, so that we can do what our responsibility for our own soldiers and our political responsibility in this area require of us. I therefore ask for support for the amendment that Giles Chichester and I have brought in. We really cannot talk here in terms of an SDI; on the contrary, this is a sensible use of the infrastructure in Europe's interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is not the first report that Mr Alyssandrakis has drawn up on the subject of space and, I suspect, not the last.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group will be supporting the report. We believe that space has important civil and industrial applications. Europe cannot afford to be sidelined. Europe cannot afford to allow the US and the other space powers – Russia, China and Japan – to leave us behind. We need to develop further the technological basis of space activities, in particular launchers, to move eventually to European independence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the way to European independence we may have to work with those trying to catch up with the US's enormous lead. We therefore welcome the statement in the report that space research is one of the priority themes for the Sixth Framework Programme for research and development. Europe, unless it gets an unequivocal agreement with the United States that it can have access on all occasions to the GSP system, will have to work with others inside and outside the European Union, in industry and government, to develop its own independent system.</p>
<p class="contents">We can support the amendment from Mr Chichester to the effect that we can include military applications for peacekeeping purposes. At the same time we support the rapporteur's own amendment, Amendment No 5, which deplores the US withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty and deplores the development of national missile defence, which we believe will trigger a new arms race in East Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">To make our position absolutely clear, we are also willing, if Amendment No 1 is passed, to support the rapporteur's Amendment No 2, to the effect that we believe space should be used to create peace rather than conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not see these as contradictory but rather as establishing a limit beyond which we do not wish to go.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that in the vote tomorrow we achieve what we intend, as I have set it out this evening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lucas (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – I would like to add my congratulations to the rapporteur and to focus on just one key issue in the short time that I have, namely the dangers of the militarisation of space.</p>
<p class="contents">Many European citizens are deeply critical of the proposed US national missile defence system, which they rightly see as an offensive system which is certain to start a new and costly international arms race. How much more concerned would they be if they realised the aims of some of their own politicians and legislators? I do not mean people here, but there are others who have ambitions to launch their very own, home-grown European Union programme to militarise space. That is what some people would like to turn the European space programme into. We need to send a very clear message with this report, to make it absolutely clear that any use of space should be solely undertaken for peaceful purposes and in accordance with international law. I therefore welcome in particular the emphasis which Mr Alyssandrakis has given to this in his report and appreciate the amendments he has tabled to strengthen these aspects still further.</p>
<p class="contents">It follows that I also very much regret the amendments by the PPE Group, which again introduces that idea of using space for military applications. Although I accept that this has been put in the context of what are called peacekeeping operations, I am still concerned that this is the start of a slippery slope. I am very happy that Mr Radwan does not want to see an EU Star Wars, but I am very concerned that his intentions could be misinterpreted: that other people could see peacekeeping in a different context from the one that he sees it in.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to remember as well the context of the report released by the European Space Agency in December 2000 in which the so-called Three Wise Men looked into the future of ESA and concluded and I quote: "Embarking on development of a European defence system, including a space component, will provide a significant part of European public investment." That report went on to say: "We see it as logical to use the capabilities of ESA also for the development of more security-orientated aspects of European space policy." All this adds up to the very real possibility that the European space policy will adopt a very specific military component and therefore it is timely and urgent to send a message with this report that we want to keep space for peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My first observation is that the use of space for research and for commercial applications is often overlooked in the wider world because it is not as dramatically exciting as projects like the Apollo moon landings, yet it is extremely important, as this report emphasises. I welcome the objectives set out in the communication for European policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I confess I particularly like paragraph 10, which calls on the industry to do more about commercial exploitation of space. That is an important way ahead. We want industry to be very much involved in the exploitation of space.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that this report is something of an appetiser – or hors d'oeuvre – for the Galileo report, which we will be considering next month in our Strasbourg part-session. Paragraph 12 in particular refers to Galileo as being part of the European strategy and to its importance for transport. We should take careful note of that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to recognise the difficulties in obtaining funding for space exploitation, space research, space utilisation. I particularly welcome also the reference in the report to the need for international cooperation drawing in other powers and partners. I come back to the question of using military applications for peacekeeping operations. To be realistic, we need funding from defence budgets for space projects in a number of fields. We should not be frightened of drawing on that source of funding for applications intended for peacekeeping. That is very important to emphasise. I regret that Mr Alyssandrakis has taken fright at my reference to military applications. He should take more note of the phrase "peacekeeping operations".</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have my doubts, though, when I see the downright interminable tug-of-war about the establishment of Europe's satellite navigation system, Galileo. So I am all the more pleased that there are some first positive signs that European space travel is to be given new momentum, something that is urgently necessary if Europe is not to lose its connection to this important and forward-looking high technology sector. Whether the systems we are working with are for communication, navigation, or observation, satellites play a decisive role.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not make the mistake of comfortably relying on the existing systems of other, even friendly, nations. We should rather be demonstrating our own capabilities in this field, which is the only way that we will have reliable operational freedom and that European industry will have a chance of a healthy future.</p>
<p class="contents">I speak from my own experience, having on several occasions been Parliament's rapporteur on the European satellite navigation system. In Europe, the potential we have in this field is so valuable, that we should not simply leave it unused. ‘Tackle it!’ must be our watchword. A political signal is indispensable.</p>
<p class="contents">The first stage on this road is the drafting of a coherent strategy for space travel policy, and the Commission has done very good work on this. I emphatically support the proposed lines of action. Europe must accord space travel more importance in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me sum up my priorities for European space travel in a conceptual pairing that may perhaps seem paradoxical: independence and cooperation. Independence means our own strength, autonomous structures and jobs geared to the future. Cooperation, on the other hand, represents the strengthening of the EU's relationships through compatibility and exchange. Space travel should be given new impetus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That said, given the progress made on Galileo, I think that we are still a long way short of the target and that we must not give up what we already have for something far less certain. In other words, the intergovernmental method is now proving that it is working better than the Community method. This is because, throughout the world, space development cannot be achieved unless a number of conditions are in place. First of all, we must not be afraid of public support, funded from the public coffers. The market can fund not everything…not American rockets, not Russian rockets, not French rockets. Secondly, the military funds a large part of civilian resources; let us not beat about the bush. If we refuse to accept a dual system, we will have great difficulty in launching the space industry in Europe, given that, as you have seen with Galileo, the pacifism of this House is, at the end of the day, a gift to American militarism. I think that we must also have this set out very clearly in our minds. The Americans said that they do not want Galileo because it is incompatible on a strategic and military level with GPS. Lastly, we must also have a genuine industrial policy. However, I do not think that we are fulfilling these conditions as yet. This is something that I regret, but we must move in this direction if we eventually want the European Union to be the space power that it should be and that it must be if Europe wants to maintain a high level of technology.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I would like to say that I think if we want to move forward in this area, we must strengthen our cooperation with those who want to move in this direction and leave behind those who do not want to. And this is not simply for the sake of Galileo, it is also for the future of a European space policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wanted to speak about space today because this is a subject close to my heart and because I am lucky enough to live in Toulouse, where, as Mr Radwan said, everything is connected to aeronautics and space. Two of the world’s largest sub-contractors in the space industry are based in Toulouse and much of the work of the European Space Agency in France is carried out in the National Centre for Space Studies.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that satellites are used for the protection and observation of our environment, for risk prevention and for the defence of our territory and are playing an increasingly important role in our daily lives. The benefits of a coordinated space policy are therefore important to us and have already enabled progress to be made in cooperation. As several Members have already said, we must now step up a gear and put in place a genuine European policy. As Mrs Langenhagen said, in an area where it has immense potential, the European Union must acquire the resources that make success possible.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the fact that no decisions have been taken on the future of the Galileo European satellite navigation project is a regrettable example of what we must avoid. Considerable investment has already been made and we cannot allow ourselves to take this amount of time before reaching an agreement, because we lose a little more credibility each time this happens. But, I know, as all of us in this House know, that you, Commissioner, are making every effort to bring this project to fruition.</p>
<p class="contents">In March, the Transport Council is due to take a decision on the future of Galileo and Parliament must bring to bear its full weight so that this decision can be reached.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Laeken European Council, the representatives of the Member States pledged to make the common security and defence policy more operational. As the report points out, if space activities are to be intended only for peaceful purposes, this can include military uses for peace-keeping activities, as requested in the amendment tabled by Mr Chichester and Mr Radwan on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">How can it be feasible for the European Union to develop a common defence policy if it does not make available the technical resources for this domain?</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we must draw up a realistic and consistent framework for our space policy. The protection of the environment, the security of our people and the preservation of peace all depend on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is you that we have to thank for your constant reference to religious values in the Convention on Fundamental Rights and for your reclaiming of them. The phrase ‘European values’ is often an empty one. It could, though, be a quite different matter with this report in our hands, because this report means that there is a chance of Europe demonstrating, in a very important area, that we do things differently to the others. We can make outer space a space for peace. Then again, that has a great deal to do with principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we have Amendment No 1, which says: ‘...which can also include a military application for peace-keeping operations.’ Space for peacekeeping operations – one might polemically say, yes, but against whom? Against the little men from Mars, who are on their way here, or for the use – as Mr Chichester has hinted – of a military-industrial complex yet to be created in Europe? That would be devastating. It would be precisely the dependence on the military-industrial complex that so much characterises the last remaining superpower that we would be inviting in through the back door while still talking of European values. That would be Pharisaical! I would very much recommend rejection of Amendment No 1, but the adoption of those following it. Particularly when Christian and religious values are at issue, values of which you, Mr President, have always rightly reminded us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This happened after their own national intelligence service stated that no missile threat from any ‘rogue state’ even exists, at least not for the next ten years. According to the American press, the Republicans in Congress pressured the intelligence organs to change their stance and to create a baseless threat scenario. A powerful missile shield is now being created in response to this figment of the imagination.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, nobody is safe from injustice and from the terrorism which draws strength from this. September's treacherous terror assaults show us where the true threats to security lie. A missile shield will militarise space, since antiballistic missiles operate in space. The result of this will be a renewed arms race, but in response to the USA's example we too are making a small decision on principle here: in our opinion Galileo may be used for military purposes in peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p class="contents">The people of this world need common security and justice which applies to everyone. This must be the main goal of the Union. The hunt for terrorists will never end if we fail to remove the causes of uprisings and civil rights struggles. The demilitarisation of space, which was achieved with so much trouble during the Cold War, is ending without any rational reason. There will always be those who are ready to carry out absurd acts. Is it the case that when the absurd act does not concern individual structures, but the entire world, it becomes more acceptable? When we worry just about our own security, we are sowing the seeds of war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the rapporteur, Mr Alyssandrakis, I welcome this and I also congratulate him on his excellent work as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to strengthen the foundations of its space activities by developing scientific knowledge. The rapporteur stresses the need to develop further the technological basis. In my view, all this involves substantial public support, financial support, although support, other than financial, may be required.</p>
<p class="contents">The Sixth Framework Programme on Research, for which I am the general rapporteur, meets this requirement in part, by making space and aeronautics one of its seven priorities and granting it a budget of just over EUR 1 billion. In my report, I also proposed measures to train researchers and engineers, both in the field of space and in other areas, in order to resolve problems relating to their mobility, which are exacerbated by the physical distance between sites.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point is to mention the dangers of the militarisation of space. There are risks, undoubtedly, but I do not think that we can undertake military activities when our goal is to prevent or to manage conflicts in order to keep or find peace. Nevertheless, our priority must be to develop further the use of space for purposes of general interest and public service. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr Alyssandrakis and thank him for his clear and constructive report, and also to thank all the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, as well as the members of the various committees who have taken part in this debate and who have been involved in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to be able to take part in this debate today and to do so on behalf of the Commission, in place of my colleague Philippe Busquin, with whom we work very closely on the issue of space, especially in view of my responsibilities in this area with the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">The report you are debating today is an important milestone in the history of European space policy, whose development has recently been taken on board by the Community institutions. It is the political support for the work carried out by the Commission and the European Space Agency within the framework of their joint working group, work which is fully described in the recommendations of the motion for a resolution. My colleague, Philippe Busquin, has been working very hard on this project, which I know will go towards fulfilling Europe’s requirements for becoming the most competitive knowledge-based society in the world by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">My speech will focus on three points. The first is the spirit of the European Space Policy, which is part of the framework of a vision of a Europe that takes full advantage of the potential of the knowledge-based economy, especially through the creation of a true European research area, in line with the spirit of the Lisbon conclusions, which should also be the spirit in Barcelona. A Europe, furthermore, that actively encourages sustainable development, which, since Gothenburg, has been one of the European Union’s priorities. A Europe that is willing to involve its citizens more in the decision-making process, thereby giving a practical example of governance. This is exactly where Parliament’s role is crucial, especially in explaining technical issues, such as Space.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these general principles we need to mention two specific aspects: firstly, the will to accept the international dimension of space and our responsibilities on the world stage, providing Europe with the means it needs to be truly independent; and secondly, the concern to work on maintaining peace and to ensure the security of all European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At this juncture, I would like to point out – in response to some concerns expressed by the rapporteur – the resolute nature of the instrument for peace that is the GMES (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security) initiative in the area of environmental monitoring and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is the recent progress made in this field, given that over the last year considerable progress has been made in the area of space policy by means of the communication that you are examining today and also the associated Council resolution. European Union policy has taken account of the strategic importance of space activity for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the specific progress made, I would like to mention two fundamental stages. The first was the creation of a joint Commission and Space Agency task force, which resulted in a second communication. This was presented at the end of 2001 to the European Council, the Space Agency and Parliament. The second stage is the joint preparation of a strategy for the implementation of the GMES initiative. Within this framework, an action plan has been prepared, firstly at European Union level, then at European Space Agency level, with the approval of an additional section at the Agency Ministers’ Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2001, however, certain limitations came to light, for example the lack of results obtained from the last Council of Transport Ministers with regard to the Galileo project.</p>
<p class="contents">I deeply regret that these delays have occurred and I would like to once again state very clearly that, in my opinion, there is no economic justification for calling the viability of the project into question, although what remains, ultimately, are doubts with regard to the political will to go ahead with a project as ambitious as the Galileo project. I hope that these doubts can be allayed in the next few weeks and that by March the Union will have made a positive decision, once and for all.</p>
<p class="contents">The third aspect concerns the future. What, exactly, is there left for us to do? The answer is, a great deal. In order for Europe to fulfil its proper role in this regard, it must establish close cooperation with all parties concerned, especially with regard to a more operational form of cooperation between the Commission and the European Space Agency. In the short term, this involves negotiating a framework agreement between these two institutions to formalise cooperation between them and to confer the role of organising the implementation of the Union’s space programmes on the Agency. An informal ‘Space Council’ will have to be convened at some stage, that brings together the Research Council and the Council of the European Space Agency.</p>
<p class="contents">In the medium term, it is proposed that the Councils of the Union and the European Space Agency, as well as the European Parliament should decide on space policy, on the basis of the guidelines provided by the Heads of State and Government. However, in the longer term and specifically within the framework of the debate that is due to start shortly on the future of the Union, the European Space Agency, and space policy in particular, must also be reflected in the Treaty itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Before drawing my conclusions I would like to make some comments on a number of recommendations outlined in the Alyssandrakis report. I would like to focus specifically on the issue of frequencies. A European coordination mechanism is being set up in this field in the form of a task force in which national political leaders will participate in the area of regulation. Another issue is that of full convergence between the report by the think tank’s task force and Parliament’s point of view, with regard to the need to carefully study the situation of competition on a world scale and to adopt appropriate measures, especially with regard to launch pads. We are also very interested in the idea of organising an international conference to explore opportunities for cooperation. As Mr Alyssandrakis is well aware, we are already cooperating very closely with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, generally speaking, the Sixth Framework Programme should make progress in the direction proposed in various recommendations, because for the first time, the subject of space is one of the priorities of this framework programme, but also because the European Space Agency will, for the first time, be able to participate in the programme as a partner with full rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the report that you are going to adopt represents a substantial and powerful boost for the efforts to implement an authentic European Space Policy. The success of such an undertaking requires the mobilisation of all of those involved and strong support from all of you here today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say – along the same lines as some of the other speakers, such as Mr Savary and Mr Caudron – that we cannot block the necessary capacity and presence of the European Union with regard to space technologies on the pretext that certain types of project could have a dual usage. It has been clearly stated that the objective of the GMES initiative is peace, and that the initiative is not financed from budgets, nor from funds with military financing and uses. In fact, quite the opposite is true, and this holds for the Galileo project too.</p>
<p class="contents">Simply avoiding taking part in the space race for the sake of peace will not prevent space, which is already partially militarised, from becoming more so. We must have a firm will to be in space with the criteria of the European Union in mind: to see space used for peaceful purposes for the benefit of mankind as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
