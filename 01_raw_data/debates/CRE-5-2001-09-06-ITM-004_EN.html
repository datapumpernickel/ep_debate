<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, we are being asked to discuss directives about breakfast at the end of the morning. It is a little late, but I am still going to attempt it.</p>
<p class="contents">I would first of all like to point out that this is the second time that we have been consulted on this issue. In the previous legislature, Parliament gave its opinion on the Commission’s proposals on the simplification of vertical directives on sugar, honey, fruit juices, milk and jams. The Council took a great deal of time to finalise the case and finally made significant changes to the Commission’s initial proposals. This is why we are being consulted again today.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore remind you that the idea was to simplify the directives. The point of view of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is certainly compatible with this objective, but it also consists of not abandoning quality requirements in the name of simplification, and above all not compromising on good consumer information. All the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, a large proportion of which came from the rapporteur, have this aim.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the consensus in the Council obviously limits our room for manoeuvre, as we are simply being consulted, that is to say that following our vote today, the Council will, at the end of the day, be completely free to decide. Nevertheless, I think that the amendments succeed in improving the texts from the point of view that I just specified: quality of products and correct consumer information.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to review the various directives in order to give the main elements of them. First of all, on sugars, there is a small problem of definition. The Council, quite rightly, has defined a sugar that is being increasingly used, fructose, but it failed to give a definition of what it calls brown sugar. Parliament’s amendment therefore asks for a definition in the texts. A deadline needs to be imposed, but the Commission needs to propose a definition. That seems elementary.</p>
<p class="contents">The second case, that of honey. This is a sensitive case insofar as honey is a high quality product, usually produced on a small scale, with which there have been many marketing problems in previous years, inasmuch as we often see mixtures of honeys and also honeys coming onto the European Union market whose quality is not guaranteed. We therefore need to be vigilant on definitions and labelling. The Commission proposes adding a new category of honey, filtered honey. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy proposes that we do not accept this proposal, as filtered honey is in fact a honey whose floral origin cannot be checked. Most of the time it has lost the pollen that allows this to be checked, which prevents the product from being well defined and goes against a guarantee of quality for consumers. We therefore propose that we do not accept this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to harmful substances that may be found in honey for industry or baker’s honey, we think that it should be forbidden for them to be present in honey. We are of course talking about lower quality honeys, which are used as raw materials in certain preparations in the agricultural and food industry, but there is no question of accepting the presence of harmful substances. There is therefore an amendment from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">The third case, that of fruit juices. I think that the majority of the amendments are aimed not at making major changes to the proposal from the Commission and the Council, but rather at clarifying the texts and preventing them from going off course. I will explain: we do not feel that a non-exhaustive list of treatments and substances authorised for production, as it is envisaged, is satisfactory. A positive list should be given. We therefore ask the Commission to put forward, within a certain period, a positive list of filtration adjuvants, precipitation agents and absorption adjuvants. A positive list means that substances that are not on the list are forbidden. We think that this is clearer, in the end, and more positive for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">An amendment also asks for fungicides not to be used to preserve fruits to be used to make juices, but for only preservation by chilling to be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fourth case, that of milk, there are no proposals for modification. We think that the text proposed to us is quite satisfactory. For jams, I personally reintroduced an amendment that was not accepted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but which I hold to. It concerns not accepting the general use of a chemical flavouring in jams and marmalades, that is vanillin. It does not strictly do anything apart from altering the taste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thyssen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, it is about five years ago that the Council consulted us on the proposal to simplify seven vertical directives on foodstuffs. The aim of those proposals was to simplify the existing legislation, which contains far too much detail, or to replace it by directives containing only the essential requirements. In that way, they would be easier to implement and better correspond to the horizontal directives. This is a commendable effort which is in line with the expectations of both consumers and those who are involved in other ways. We, the PPE-DE Group, are keen to lend our support in this connection.</p>
<p class="contents">We have established that the Directive on cocoa and chocolate products, which also originally formed part of this package and which had to undergo the lengthiest legislative procedure, namely that of co-decision, was the first one we managed to complete. As for the five other directives of the package of seven, the five we are debating today, we will ultimately require more than five years to complete the simplification procedure. We do wonder if we should not aspire to faster working methods and other decision-making methods, for we do not believe that that is what the public wants.</p>
<p class="contents">The PPE-DE Group would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work. The delay is certainly not due to him, but due to the fact that the Council has fundamentally changed certain components, thus necessitating fresh advice from us. On behalf of the PPE-DE Group, I can say that we are in agreement with the report as it emerged from the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. That is the case for all components of the package, except for fruit juices. On these, our view differs slightly from that in the report, but that was also apparent in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I do not believe, therefore, that I need to go into any more detail here regarding the reasoning, motives and strands of thought behind that difference of view.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I do not want to conceal the fact – and I should like to devote the rest of my speaking time to this – that we in our group, further to these issues arising, have held a serious debate on the issue of whether it is really up to a Parliament to discuss such detailed measures with 626 Members. This is creating problems for us. Parliament is being slated for this from outside. That does not mean that we underestimate the importance of food legislation. We realise that the detail is important in this connection, but we do wonder whether, with the material being at such a high technical level, we really are the people best placed to take the decisions and whether we should inconvenience 626 MEPs with these kinds of far-reaching, technical measures. The question we asked ourselves is: should we not move towards two kinds of derived legislation, one on which Parliament deliberates and another which, surely, should be entrusted to the executive? This discussion has certainly not reached its conclusion, but I should welcome a discussion which includes groups other than the PPE-DE Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have been referred back to us simply because there are some changes to the comitology procedure. I note with satisfaction that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has no objections to the revised procedure. It is, however, proposing new textual changes to the draft directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the directives is to simplify rules governing composition and labelling. We should therefore avoid complicating matters. Political agreement has been reached on this issue after long and arduous negotiations and we should therefore avoid reopening the negotiations at all costs. I agree with changes that add clarity to texts but do not change the substance. One case in point is the inclusion of the definition of brown sugar. This would be an added protection for consumers. In relation to fruit juices, the proposed changes to the treatments and substances would be more appropriate within the horizontal legislation governing these treatments. The suggestion to introduce three new product names for fruit juices is not in line with proposals currently under discussion on the Codex. Furthermore, they will only serve to reopen the entire debate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that substantial changes, if adopted by this House, will achieve anything. They will only serve to delay the procedure. If that happens, it is the consumers who will be the losers in the end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we then turn to purely technical aspects such as those addressed by Mr Lannoye, the complications increase. We find ourselves in agreement with his report, except for the point raised by Mr Thyssen.</p>
<p class="contents">However the point I want to make is not about the actual merit of the report, but rather about an evaluation that this Parliament needs to carry out over the next few months on the future legislative method. We also found certain points in this report where we have either aggravated the situation or intervened in legislation already dealt with in the course of the last two months, and here I am thinking, for example, of problems relating to water. Coordinated production of legislation can, I think, only be helpful to this institution. Another aspect I want to bring up is the excessive regulation to which we subject our legislative process, which is not reflected in our Member States. In the Member States a whole series of areas are dealt with through the method of circulars.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the report we drew up last year with the Commission, we will have to think very carefully about those issues, because I do not think a consumer who is buying honey is immediately aware of whether it is honey produced in beehives or filtered honey, even if the label is clear. As our task is to be impartial and we need to produce legislation that is comprehensible to European citizens, perhaps further thought is necessary over the next few months. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are increasingly advocating information and clarification for consumers. Responsible, adult consumers, getting information from product labels, are meant to decide for themselves what they buy. Strict, clear, unambiguous regulations, the thinking behind which is clear to all, must be enacted. Descriptions such as ‘juice’, ‘fruit juice’, ‘nectar’, ‘fruit juice from concentrate’ or even ‘contains fruit’ make it difficult for consumers to assess a product's true quality or know how it was produced.</p>
<p class="contents">It was in 1975 that the Fruit Juice Directive first introduced consumers to the designation ‘fruit juice’ or reinforced it, and consumers have got used to it. ‘Fruit juice’ and ‘fruit juice from concentrate’ are in the final analysis one and the same product. The designation ‘fruit juice from concentrate’ refers only to the manufacturing process and not to the ingredients, which must of course be the same. The additional designation ‘with concentrates’ tends in my view to confuse. Product designations must be clearly defined, simple and comprehensible. We must prevent additional descriptions which are not absolutely necessary, as confusion is no protection for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the proposed Amendments Nos 18, 19 and 25 make the current legal position stricter in an unjustifiable way, particularly for the juice industry, and I believe they should be rejected. Fruit to be sold fresh in markets, in other words for consumption, may be treated with fungicides. Why, then, not fruit for juice production? In exactly the same way, the criteria of the EU Drinking Water Directive must suffice for the water which has to be used in the preparation of fruit juice. I would ask you therefore, ladies and gentlemen, to vote objectively and purposefully to set a directive on course which will help the consumer and which manufacturers will be able to implement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I share some of Mrs Thyssens' reservations about what we are being asked to do here and the degree of expertise with which we do it. Mr Lannoye knows he has my respect, but I have to say with some regret that I fear we are repeating some of the debating errors of the chocolate directive and the determination to rechristen some products.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lannoye's amendments have caused confusion in the name of purity when we come to the issue of honey. I agree with him about fruit juice and I certainly salute his motives. But there are a number of Member States which use filtered honey extensively to remove insect debris, grains of sand and pollen fragments. I have heard no convincing argument that this damage of the product adds unwanted material and indeed there are other amendments before us today which call for the removal of organic and inorganic material from some honeys. The Council had arrived at a sensible position on this and I have seen no evidence – and I have checked back with our own Food Standards Agency – that there are any legitimate concerns about content. There are other ways of tracing the origins of honey, as well as the pollen content to which the rapporteur has referred.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would like to look at what a number of Member States call ‘baker's honey’, which is to be redefined, if the rapporteur has his way, as ‘industrial honey’. There is no such thing. I would like to think this was an unwitting translation error but this derogatory phraseology is probably not accidental. By just putting a noun with an adjective you cannot always make sense. If I were to describe Mr Lannoye, whom I hold in esteem as an ‘industrial Belgian’, it would be a meaningless phrase. We should use a real description understood throughout the Community, not an invented one. This is not a product only fit to grease the wheels of industry. It is a product that people know and have confidence in and it is safe for consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission’s proposal is sound and does not require amendment. In particular, I welcome the double definition of juice from concentrate and fruit juice. It helps to keep the consumer better informed. Consequently I cannot support Amendment No 39, deleting the Commission’s text. I do support Amendment No 30 dealing with the subject in greater depth and referring back to Annex 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, I totally reject Amendments Nos 18, 19, 23 and 25. The first of these concerns a ban on the use of fungicides in treatments after gathering. It has to be borne in mind that fruit gathered in Europe is in principle destined for the fresh fruit trade. The decision on which fruit will be sold fresh and which will be processed is only taken following selection by quantity and size.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 97/41/EC has already set a maximum limit for residue in the case of fresh fruit, based on detailed studies to ensure consumer safety. I believe this Directive applies equally to juice, fresh fruit, juice produced in the home, or packaged juice. Treatment after gathering is required to guarantee optimum storage, transport and distribution conditions. I should like to reiterate what I said earlier. A substance may not be harmful in itself, it depends on the amount used. Regarding the quality of the water added to concentrates, Directive 98/93/EC refers to the quality of water for human consumption, including water used by the food industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 23 calls for a list of authorised substances to be drawn up. It does not make sense to specify additional substances over and above those referred to in Directives 89/109/EEC and 90/128/EEC on materials and objects liable to come into contact with foodstuffs. This would restrict the juice industry’s capacity to adjust quickly to technological developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They also involve a great deal of uncertainty. This report should achieve greater clarity, and Mr Lannoye has evidently put a great deal of effort into it. I believe, however, that too much exactitude and too many details can also be dangerous, and with this in mind I can only support what was said by Mrs Thyssen: here, and also in our work generally, we should distinguish more and more between political statements and technical considerations. We are also overstretched in many respects, not through our average IQ being so low, but simply because the specialised technical knowledge cannot be present, because simply too much is presupposed and we then also have difficulty at some point in deciding what is lobbying and what is meaningful activity. I also believe that we should be careful when deciding on the details of labels, so that we do not, through the sheer compulsion to regulate – as for example with fruit juices, where, however, we have now reached a compromise – end up leading the consumer astray with duplicated explanations and elucidations. If we carry on that way, even wines will soon have to carry their chemical composition on the label, and then the marketing of wine will no doubt be far less straightforward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to be able to thank all those who have contributed to reaching compromises – in the field of fruit juices, on the subjects of fungicides, water adulteration and the juice and concentrate issue, as well as on aromas – and hope that, in the problematic area of honey, it is impossible to conceal the product's origin. I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, when voting, to pay careful attention to this as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The higher production costs associated with the effort and the quality guarantee must, however, be clearly acknowledged in labelling.</p>
<p class="contents">There are currently, depending on whether they are free of concentrate or made from concentrate, two major categories of fruit juices, each of which correspond to the nature of specific products and a particular production process. In terms of labelling, current practice does not enable consumers to clearly distinguish between these two categories. In order to remove this source of confusion in the mind of consumers as to the actual nature of the product that they are buying, the Finnish Presidency has proposed introducing two simple, clear and objective definitions. The term ‘fruit juice’ would be reserved for juices without concentrate, while, according to them, juices made from concentrate should be named for sale purposes in accordance with their characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, consumers looking for a more authentic and more natural product will easily be able to find it on the shelf under the clear name ‘fruit juice’, knowing that they are prepared to pay the price corresponding to the specific qualities associated with this product, while consumers inclined towards a more standardised and cheaper product will be able to turn with full knowledge of the facts towards a juice made from concentrate without any ambiguity about its nature and particular characteristics. We, think, Mr President, that defining these two categories of juice, corresponding to two different names, represents real progress in consumer information, and that is why we support it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Along with previous speakers, we believe that the Council’s proposal represents definite progress because it establishes a clear distinction between fresh fruit juice and concentrated juice. This is a welcome development as it provides consumers with full information on two products with different characteristics produced in very different ways. We cannot therefore support any amendment aimed at blurring or doing away with the distinction established so clearly in the Council’s text.</p>
<p class="contents">Further, we cannot accept the amendments aimed at ending the use of fruit from the fresh market. This is what would result if we agreed to ban treatment after gathering. The use of this fruit makes it possible to provide the consumer with a healthy product, manufactured to high standards of quality and food safety. It is also a way of utilising surplus agricultural production so that large quantities are not allowed to rot and pollute the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we shall support the Council’s proposal and vote in its favour. In our view, the majority of the amendments tabled in committee do not serve to clarify or improve the situation. Instead, they cause further confusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Swoboda is making a mistake and I would ask you to consider it carefully. Parliament did indeed make a slightly contradictory decision yesterday, I repeat a slightly contradictory decision. We adopted the Commission proposal on the transit system by a clear majority of 303 votes to 253. The proposal says that the previous upper ceiling is to be abolished. Parliament approved this by a clear majority.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, item 4 has been included because of a <span class="italic">faux pas</span> by a number of colleagues. However, there is still no material contradiction here because we also call on the Commission in item 4 to maintain an upper ceiling until the ecopoint system expires. In other words, we clearly decided in the legislative act to adopt the Commission proposal. If the Council agrees, and I hope that it does, then all will be well. The second call in item 4 is a call for the Commission to reflect. What the Commission does in this case, whether it proposes a new upper ceiling or no upper ceiling, is up to the Commission. We did not, as you will see if you read the second clause, call for the old upper ceiling; we said the Commission might like to consider setting a new, reasonable upper ceiling. However, this <span class="italic">faux pas</span> was carried by a majority. All that means, however, is that the Commission has been asked to reflect and submit an opinion to Parliament once it has done so. Parliament's clear position was, is, and remains – and in this respect there is nothing to correct, Mr Swoboda – that we approved the Commission's position yesterday by a large majority and I should like to confirm as much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
