<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Seixas da Costa,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been requested, on behalf of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union, to state our position to this Parliament on the current political situation in Austria and its consequences for relations between that country and the Union’s other Member States. First of all, I would like to make it clear that the statement made by the Portuguese Prime Minister on 31 January, on behalf of three other countries which are also Member States of the European Union, was made in this specific context. In other words, a common political position was adopted by the Heads of State and Government of fourteen countries, which Portugal presented on behalf of all of them. The text of this joint statement has a clearly defined scope and purpose: the bilateral relationship between each of these fourteen countries and an Austrian Government which now comprises members of that country’s Freedom Party. Let me remind you of what this statement said.</p>
<p class="contents">1 – The governments of the fourteen Member States shall not initiate or accept any official bilateral contacts at political level with an Austrian Government which includes the Freedom Party.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">2 – Austrian candidates for posts in international organisations will not have the support of these fourteen countries.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">3 – Austrian ambassadors in the Union’s capitals will only be received in the technical sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that over the last few days, the reasons which have led the fourteen states supporting this statement to adopt it have become clear. Basically, the view these states share of the political situation in Austria led them to conclude that the possible inclusion in the Austrian Government of a party such as the Freedom Party could bring about a change in respect for the common values which the Member States of the European Union are committed to safeguarding.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware of the public statements made by Jörg Haider and of some of the ideas on specific policies that his party has advocated. I do not think that I need to remind you about his ideas exonerating the Nazi regime, his attitudes towards foreign and immigrant communities, or to point out that this populist nationalism is reminiscent of another era.</p>
<p class="contents">Our common understanding is that this party’s position clearly runs counter to the values that we hold to be fundamental to Europe and which in fact form the frame of reference which the Union has been promoting in its external relations, both with regard to its forthcoming enlargement and in the context of its common foreign and security policy. It could be said that the present situation is a result of the people of Austria exercising their freedom of expression, which must be respected, and that any stand on this subject might be tantamount to interference in that country’s internal affairs. First of all, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, no one is threatening the existence of a democratic government in Austria or questioning the electoral reality behind the results of the recent elections. Those elections showed – and this also needs to be emphasised – that the great majority of Austrians are still not in favour of Mr Haider’s party. What we regret, and take issue with, is the fact that the solution opted for gives a share of political power in that country to a party whose leaders have not given the slightest guarantee that they will safeguard the fundamental principles Austria has committed itself to respect, defend and promote.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Austria has every right to choose the government it wishes, but we also have a right and duty to state our opinion on any political choices which we feel infringe Austria’s international commitments. Today this applies to Austria, but tomorrow it could apply to any other country in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Let me repeat that point: this applies to Austria today and it would apply tomorrow to any Member State of the European Union. On the other hand, as we all know, human rights, fundamental rights issues, the great principles of democracy and of the rule of law, the rules for protecting minorities and combating racism, xenophobia and intolerance are no longer issues to be discussed purely within a country. All the more so when that country belongs to a community of states for which these concerns represent the very heart of its project for civilisation. The Europe that we want to build and strengthen is not a purely economic project – it is a community of values and principles which may act as a base for political union and for the establishment of a great area of freedom, security and justice imbued with the values of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Applause</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we therefore feel that we have the right and the duty to tell our Austrian friends, as other countries outside the European Union have indeed done, that its choice of government will inevitably have consequences for our future relationship with them, as long as Mr Haider’s party forms part of their government.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the tangible consequences of this, about which the Commission’s statement yesterday gave a few clues, the European Union will try to continue its work, whilst strictly respecting the Treaties and of course paying particular attention to the way in which the new Austrian Government acts. The Community framework is a special area, governed by very specific political and legal rules, which means that it will also be given special treatment. We therefore want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>  <span class="italic"> Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission met yesterday morning and as an independent body and with the joint will of all the members of the College, it made political decisions of the utmost importance. It already stated yesterday that it shared the concerns expressed by 14 Member States of the Union, concerns that have been reiterated here by the representative of the Presidency. Today, on behalf of the entire Commission, I can repeat these concerns before you. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, allow me to emphasise the Commission’s political role at times such as these.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, like Parliament, is a supranational institution of the Union, and for that very reason it has no bilateral diplomatic relations with the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely at times when the continuity, consistency and upholding of the values of the Union seem to be threatened that the Commission’s political role becomes stronger and more apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that the Treaty of Rome does not contain any clause providing for the voluntary withdrawal or the expulsion of a Member State. This is because the logic, the very assumption underlying the extraordinary achievement<span class="bold"> </span>that is the European Union is that when each State becomes a member of the Union, it accepts its fundamental principles completely and forever. Moreover, the Treaties set out precise mechanisms for ensuring that these principles are respected. </p>
<p class="contents">From this viewpoint, the Commission would not be performing its role properly if it were to interrupt the working relationship it maintains with Austria, and with every other Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, when one of its members is in difficulty, the whole Union is in difficulty. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The duty of a strong supranational institution is not to isolate one of its members, but instead to permanently bind it to its deep-seated values. The Commission will do its utmost to ensure that this is done.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, it goes without saying that the Commission will continue to keep a close eye on events in Austria. Indeed, the European Union would not survive without the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. These are the foundations of the Union. These principles are the <span class="italic">raison d’être</span> of the Union and are the result and reflection of the formal commitment made by all the Member States to respect the rights of individuals and of peoples, regardless of their beliefs, origin or circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">These principles form an integral part of the rule of law, and the Commission, which is the guarantor of that rule of law, will be relentless in upholding them. We will bear down heavily on even the slightest breach of the rights of individuals or of any minority.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe, as a Member of Parliament from one of the applicant countries said to me, is a union of minorities, and as such, it calls for everyone’s deep respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to make a few more brief remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Founded over 900 years ago, Bologna University, my <span class="italic">alma mater</span>, is the oldest university in the world. On the walls of one of its most beautiful halls you can still see the coats of arms of students and professors who chose that university, so many centuries ago, as a place of learning. There are over 7000 coats of arms from the whole of Europe, ranging from Transylvania to England.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe already existed then: an area whose intellectual confines were unaffected by the frontiers and limits of the politics of the day; a community of shared values, ideals and knowledge. However, the fabric of European history has not only been woven with cultural interchange, the expansion of knowledge and the sharing of a robust core of common values. Alongside the university coats of arms, there are war memorials in every small village or town in Europe, which bear witness to the tragedies of our continent.</p>
<p class="contents">European history has been punctuated over the centuries by an unremitting sequence of wars and conflicts. Europe, a cradle of civilisation, has given rise to the most terrible atrocities ever known in human history. In recognition of this, as the first act of my presidency, I chose to visit Auschwitz, in order to say loud and clear, in the silence that is proper and fitting for such a place of memory, that Europe has not forgotten, and to repeat that the Europe of today and tomorrow is, can only be and will always be a union of freedom, law, security and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Freedom, law, security and peace: this is what the European Union was and what the European Union is. This is what the most extraordinary, bold and successful political achievement of the century that just ended has been able to guarantee its citizens. This is what the united Europe wishes to offer, in the century that is now beginning, to those who are preparing to join it.</p>
<p class="contents">This afternoon, at this very moment, I should have been at the Université Catholique de Louvain to receive, together with the Prime Minister of France and the Director­General of the World Health Organisation, Mrs Brundtland, an honorary degree.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be arriving a little late at that ceremony, but there is no more fitting way of honouring a university which is one of the leading symbols of European learning than to come here, before Parliament, the supreme expression of popular sovereignty, in order to bear witness to my own passionate commitment, and that of the entire European Commission, to defending those principles which form the foundations of a united Europe.</p>

Feelings have run high in our group’s debate – I freely admit this and regard it as a sign of how strong our group is – and no problem or issue has ever produced so many requests to speak as there have been today in our group. I would like to thank all those who spoke with such resoluteness of purpose.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">So as to leave you in absolutely no doubt on one point: the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and of the European Democrats is united in its criticism of many of the statements made by the Leader of the FPÖ in Austria. We condemn the <span class="italic">faux pas</span> he has made in the last few days, especially those against the French President, Jacques Chirac, and the Belgian Government. We categorically reject the things he has said.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We, the PPE-DE Group, champion human dignity, the state under the rule of law, democracy and freedom, and we defend these principles and values across the political spectrum.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Democrats, who form a key element of our group – and a great many people are probably unaware of this – evolved from the opposition to the totalitarianism of National Socialism, which was every bit as inhuman, but also to the totalitarianism of those despisers of mankind, the Communists.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and of the European Democrats, we also represent today the values of the founding fathers of European unification – Robert Schuman, Alcide de Gasperi, Konrad Adenauer and Winston Churchill, and there were many others – and the values of the founders of Europe are our values, even today in the year 2000. These principles are also the yardstick we use for assessing the activities, dealings and words of the Member States and also the governments to which we belong. At this point I would say: we have faith in our Austrian friends in the Austrian European People’s Party. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that the European People’s Party, together with Alois Mock and Wolfgang Schüssel – one was the Minister for Trade and Commerce and the other was the Foreign Minister – was the party that did the most to pave the way for Austria’s entry into the European Union. We recall how in 1998, which is not very long ago at all, everyone here in Parliament spoke in positive terms of the Austrian Presidency, and the conduct of Wolfgang Schüssel, the Leader of the ÖVP, here in this Chamber, spoke of passion and commitment. The people of Austria have now voted and I believe we have nothing to gain from chastising the electorate. Nor should we forget that there were in fact negotiations with the SPÖ. I regret that they proved unsuccessful, but why is this so? Because the trade union orientated part of SPÖ was not prepared to lend its support to the promises Chancellor Klima made…</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right, loud heckling from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">..., to wit, a redevelopment programme for the economy and finances. That is the truth, and no matter how loud your protests, you cannot sweep this aside. We anticipate that a government under the leadership of the ÖVP, if it comes to that, will represent and uphold the values and principles of our European People’s Party, and these principles constitute an unequivocal declared belief in the dignity of all human beings and in tolerance towards all human beings. Above all, they are the logical continuation of a policy of European unification, which the Republic of Austria has been pursuing in an exemplary manner for decades. We will assess the Austrian Government’s dealings, if it comes under the leadership of the ÖVP, in terms of the extent to which the state under the rule of law, democracy and freedom are guaranteed, and we would expressly like to thank you, Mr President of the Commission, and the Commission as a whole, for not waiting until today to issue an intelligent and balanced opinion in observance of the Treaties of the European Union, but doing so as early as yesterday. We are right behind you when you regard yourselves as the guardian of the Treaties, and so let us tread this path together. This is what we expect and have to say as the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and of the European Democrats. We want a Europe that upholds the rule of law, a Europe that embraces peace and tolerance. We do not want there to be isolation within Europe, rather we want to bring the peoples of Europe together, so as to enable the future of our continent in the twenty-first century to be one of freedom, democracy and peace. </p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, President of the Commission, President-in-Office of the Council, the Group of the Party of European Socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the European public. Let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we wish to express our total support for, and our solidarity with, the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values, and not just the political force, which we have all built together. In any event, these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the Austrian Freedom Party. The Europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults which have been directed at the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also at the Socialists, who are European citizens as well, because, at the moment, the Austrian Socialists are being described as traitors to their country. I will say one thing. For many years I was a traitor to my country; at least that was General Franco’s view.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">President Guterres was also a traitor in Salazar’s eyes, and that is something that I believe should also be stated and defended by the PPE-DE. I also believe that the Commission, or President Prodi, has acted as a guardian of the Treaties. However, I would remind him that, during his inaugural debate, he described the Commission as a European government. A government must have more nerve and more courage. That is what I am asking President Prodi for at this moment.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect to a Commissioner as effective as Mr Fischler, and given that we have heard contradictory comments, depending on the translation, with regard to a possible request by President Prodi for the resignation of Mr Fischler, I would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Madam President, we wish to send a very clear message to the Austrian people. This is an appeal to the majority of Austrians who have not voted for Haider, who have voted for the clearly democratic options, committed to Europe, and I must point out that Mr Schüssel may have been Minister for Finance, but Chancellor Vranitzky also contributed to Austria’s integration process. We should not be so politically partisan. The accession of Austria to the Community was a joint venture. We all took part in it, not just one group. Therefore, Madam President, I believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reflect, because this type of menace, which we have suffered before in Europe, may not only harm Austria, but it may also spread, and I say this bearing history in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, apart from the apology which Mr Schüssel has made, offering us all kinds of guarantees, as did Chamberlain and Daladier in 1938 in Munich, I would like to know whether the PPE intends to implement measures in relation to the Austrian People’s Party, if it goes ahead with this mad project.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if we do not stand up to this unnatural alliance, I can assure you that we can forget the European Union’s main objective – enlargement – because, if we were Czechs, Slovenes or Hungarians, what would we say, faced with a neighbour who judges us on racial grounds and does not want us to enter? I therefore think that this is a great day for European politics to commence. We support the Council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment. This is the first time in the history of the modern European project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstreaming of a party of the extreme right. That is deeply disturbing.</p>
<p class="contents">The FPÖ contends that if one reads their literature and their programme, there is much in it that one could share. That may be, but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we Liberal Democrats had with the Austrian FPÖ in our Liberal International family.</p>
<p class="contents">As early as 1986, we had cause to believe that Mr Jörg Haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism. In November of 1991, after a long internal debate in Liberal International and many visits to Vienna to discuss issues, we suspended the FPÖ from membership and in July 1993 we expelled them.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We expelled them then and we continue to reject what Mr Haider stands for now. Let me share what we learned in that long experience. There were many in our ranks who said “read the text”. There were many more in our ranks who said “read the subtext”, “ look at the context ”. Words in politics can be incendiary, can be inflammatory, or can be conciliatory. We found that Mr Jörg Haider, as a wordsmith, has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia. He is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability. That is why this debate is important – to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism, something profound is happening in Europe today.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the Austrian people. We respect the rights of the Austrian people to their own democratic process. We defend the rights and constitutional prerogatives of the Austrian people, but we here in the European Parliament have the duty to recall our fundamental values as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty – the values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. Every right-thinking person in this House believes that these are universal and indivisible without regard to colour, class or creed. We must promote and defend those rights, all the while saying to the people of Austria: our quarrel is not with you.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say with regard to the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it. It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept Mr President-in-Office, that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it. I share with President Prodi a preference for the Community method and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty. Article 7 talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breaches of our fundamental values. We must find a way as institutions to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance. Then we can work together by the Community method to root out this cancer within our midst.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say Madame President some words to Mr Schüssel. Mr Schüssel is a man with an honourable record in European politics. He now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger. Mr Schüssel – you are assuming a very serious, personal, national and European responsibility. That responsibility, which you Mr Schüssel now take on, is to respect the letter and the spirit of the European Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Madame President, this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. On this continent, of all places, with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost, we have to insist that today’s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State. It is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as Europeans countenance turning the clock back.</p>

For the first time, the European Union is facing the possibility of having representatives in the Council of Ministers and here among us of a party which obviously holds views and puts forward legislation contrary to the values of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall make three comments on this matter, to illustrate the gravity of the problem. I believe, personally, that this is the first stage, if it does actually take place, in the inclusion of extremists in governments becoming quite commonplace. I also believe it gives an extremely negative political message to the vulnerable democracies which are candidates for membership of the European Union and which are going to join us.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I feel, finally, that this is a case of political decline of the European Union as such and it therefore also sends a negative message outside the Union, when we are speaking in the name of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people have said that we were interfering in problems internal to Austria. Some people have said that we were stigmatising the Austrian people and that we were effectively putting words into the mouth of a future government. Is it really putting words into someone’s mouth, if we pay attention to what a political leader has been saying for many years, when it shows an obvious tendency to go against everything that we want? We are not putting words into someone’s mouth or stigmatising the Austrian people if we send a friendly message, saying: friends, beware of what may soon happen in your country and what may contaminate the whole of Europe: not a radical change – I think Mr Haider is too intelligent for that – but a gradual erosion of democratic rights, a slow erosion, by cultural contagion, and that is extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Let me thank you, Madam President, for your contribution on behalf of Parliament. It was both pertinent and politically intelligent.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to thank the Presidency of the Council for the firm, pertinent and moderate statement it has made.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Finally I should like to address the party which, whether we like it or not, is the target of our comments: the PPE/DE. I would like to address Mr Poettering and also, indirectly, Mr Martens, a compatriot and former colleague. I have heard, Mr Poettering, that you have been following events in Austria. I would rather have had you anticipate them and, particularly, condemn, on behalf of your party, the very principle of an alliance with people who practice verbal violence, who stigmatise the weak, who hold xenophobic views and who refuse to condemn the Nazi regime.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering, I do not doubt your concern for democracy but I believe that you are making a serious political mistake. And, to paraphrase one of my renowned fellow Belgians, one of the founders of Europe, Paul-Henri Spaak, I shall say that it is not yet too late for you, but now is the time to change your mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has certainly previously known situations where there were people in a Member State government whose ideas and actions were in contradiction to the guiding values of the Union. However, with Haider and his men, we would see the extreme right, openly racist, anti-Semitic and xenophobic, promoted to the rank of co-ruler of our Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Going along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testifying, albeit unwillingly, to the respectability of a political force which is not respectable. It would mean making the unacceptable commonplace on the scale of Europe as a whole, it would mean making nonsense of the European institutions’ solemn proclamations on the fundamental values which unite us and which we demand, rightly so, of applicants for membership.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we support the spirit of the statement made by the presidency and the 14 Member States, as well as that of the President of the European Parliament, insofar as, unlike the lacklustre and ambiguous statement made by the Commission, it aims to make people get the measure of the danger and to provoke a response.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there can be no question of casting opprobrium upon the people of Austria. Any action which can be taken must, in our opinion, serve the twofold function of proscribing Haider without, however, isolating Austrian society.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Democrats in this country now need our support more than ever. The great joining of forces in protest in Vienna on 12 November last year must now undergo developments suited to the new situation. We must have dialogue with them and join forces with them, stand at their side in order to offer the people of Austria some alternative prospects.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must ask ourselves: how did we come to be in this position? Certainly, in the first instance, as far as Austrian political leaders are concerned, it is a matter of answering this existential question for the future of democracy, starting with those who have just taken the inordinate risk of giving the extreme right a boost. But, beyond that, no one, including the European Union, can, in our opinion, be exempted from asking themselves what grounds there are for permitting an unscrupulous demagogue to exploit the frustrations and fears generated by policies in which too many sectors of the population are disregarded. This debate is now before us, but each and every one of us, male and female, is going to assume their responsibilities without delay.</p>

Instead, we have been forced to debate the formal, substantial errors that have been made in the last few days. </p>
<p class="contents">We are astonished by the political naivety of people who, with thoughtless words, have bolstered Mr Haider’s position in Austria and made the Union look ridiculous, riding roughshod over Article 7 of the Treaty by announcing unconstitutional measures. </p>
<p class="contents">We have never before seen such serious, clumsy<span class="bold"> </span>interference in the internal affairs of a Member State. Of course, we cannot violate the founding values of Europe, and in this regard, the Italian Prime Minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty: he mentioned the Treaty of Copenhagen, which I, like you, have never heard of because it does not exist. Maybe he was referring to the Treaty of Amsterdam, Article 6 of which lists certain principles and Article 7 certain procedures,<span class="bold"> </span>in order to establish that a Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6. However, up till now, Austria has committed no serious or persistent violation. Apart from amounting to interference, the statement by the Presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for. </p>
<p class="contents">No political cohesion has so far come about, not even in the fight against organised crime, or in defence of the victims of genocide; we do not have a currency that is even remotely stable or an economy which really does combat unemployment and poverty; but it only took one minute of iconoclastic fury to destroy the Union’s credibility. Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government. Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin’s grandchildren be forgiven for everything? </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the right) </span></p>
<p class="contents">It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this. This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">So many things set us apart from Mr Haider – as we have often written – including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region. However, we already knew this. However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union’s democratic role. </p>
<p class="contents">We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour<span class="bold"> </span>upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights. We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union. This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement<span class="bold"> </span>and not clearly defining roles and tasks. </p>
<p class="contents">We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics. And these are the consequences! Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations<span class="bold"> </span>with other peoples. </p>

Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach. In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria. There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them. And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court. We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.</p>
<p class="contents">We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter. We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country – Austria – corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States. We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country’s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice…</p>

My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one’s own past, and the stability of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly. The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image. This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office. This is the citizen of a state’s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy. When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We were offered three ministerial posts – you can read it for yourself in the newspapers – the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here! When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day. The FPÖ party is established in Austria’s political landscape. The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments. What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ?</p>
<p class="contents">There is prejudice at work here, which – without going into our programme – is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle. I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust. Shame on you Mr Bertinotti! You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda. </p>
<p class="contents">Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist! On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did. Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose. The attacks against Austria’s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people. That is why we are indebted to the Commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">The new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy, the rights of the opposition, commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour….</p>

Austria is a stable democracy; one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary. Austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing unusual about what is happening in Austria: there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections, in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found. There will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition. The Austrian People’s Party, which I represent here in this Parliament, used to be and still is a party that has consistently spoken up for the integration of my country into the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values that is the European Union, and likewise its basic political principles of deepening and enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our Member States as to the way ahead for Austria. Our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present. Our country was not just the first victim of the Hitler dictatorship, many people were perpetrators too, although I refute any suggestion of collective guilt.</p>
<p class="contents">The ÖVP played no small part in helping Austria find its way into the European Union. My country’s place is not outside the European Union but in it …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">…, with all the rights and commitments that this entails! Any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto, and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media. A declared belief in human rights, democracy and the rule of law, in an honest reappraisal of Austria’s role in the past, in passing on information on the gravest crime against humanity in the 20th century, the holocaust, will also be reflected in the fundamental accord underlying a future coalition government between the ÖVP and FPÖ.</p>
<p class="contents">My party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of European politics and continues to be rooted in the European community of values!</p>

Not even Mr Sichrovsky’s web of lies or Mrs Stenzel’s words of appeasement can do anything to change that. For the day has dawned: two irresponsible politicians, consumed with a lust for power, are selling Austria’s image, political role, and to some extent even its economic interests, down the river!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause, heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">They are trading this in for a head of government’s position and for membership of a government. They are just as prepared to take on board the fact that Austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one, as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens. I believe – as do many who for years have campaigned against Haider and his brand of politics, and especially my colleagues in the Social Democratic delegation in this Chamber – that the various measures announced by the international community, insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives, are grave and also inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, my criticism – and I freely admit this – my rage, is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so, Messrs Schüssel and Haider and their parties, …</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and that includes their representatives in this Parliament. Mr Poettering, it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as I am, albeit for different reasons, for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions. You are having to defend a certain Mr Schüssel, you are having to consort with Schüssel as he is today and who, as I understand it, was recently told not to come to the representatives of the Christian Democratic party’s summit meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">The argument that Mr Poettering himself used has come into play, i.e. that it would only be possible to deprive Haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system. However, in my view, he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this, into our political system, and into the Europe of today, than any other extreme right-wing movement. Anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices, whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism, who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations, and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from National Socialism, has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the Conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured. That is how the wolf – albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the ÖVP – is sustained rather than kept in check. I understand that Europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government. However, by the same token, there is another Austria, the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the FPÖ having any involvement in government, and who will continue to demonstrate against this government. I urge you to support this Europe and to support and help this Austria!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The more powerful this Europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the Europe of today, the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism. For Europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy, or even against a relapse into barbarism. Please support the Austrian people against this government!</p>

We see this, now that the government of one Member State is being joined by a party which, as is known, does not respect all these values. I would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the Council was justified, as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the European Union, meaning this is also a matter for the Council and not merely an internal affair of Austria’s.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever. It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding. It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration. As important is the fact that Austria’s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country. We know that most Austrians respect these values. They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria. Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time. I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy. I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider’s party. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States’ involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans. Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary. This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe. We are talking about us, not Austria. We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes – xenophobia, racism – but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with<span class="bold"> </span>nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat. The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation. Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past. Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak<span class="bold"> </span>on this,<span class="bold"> </span>making the value of the presidency’s position even more apparent.

We are debating nothing less than the presence in a Member State’s government of a political force whose doctrine and principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases of the Union enshrined in its founding Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">A simple reading of chapter 4, article 1 of the Austrian Freedom Party’s manifesto is enough to make any democratic conscience shudder. The view that ethnicity is the defining factor of a nation and the claim that one ethnic group has superiority over others, as is written here, revives old ghosts of the century which we have just left behind, which some historians have described as the century of horrors; horrors which the unacceptable philosophy behind Mr Haider’s manifesto has stirred up once again, to our amazement.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course Austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a Member State. However, that is not the problem. The question is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State which includes such a party. Our answer to this crucial question is no.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Leaving aside strategic and tactical considerations, leaving aside possible exonerations based on other people’s behaviour and above and beyond party and electoral interests, the Spanish delegation of the People’s Group of this Parliament, in full agreement with the Spanish People’s Party and the Spanish Government, clearly expresses its full agreement with the statement of 31 January by the Portuguese Presidency of the Council.

History is a compendium of events which could have been avoided. Therefore, Madam President, the Union and the Assembly must send an unequivocal message, rejecting of the tiger of intolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add one more mistake to the long list of abdications, renunciations and opportunism which mark Europe’s past and for which we have paid such a heavy price.</p>

The one and only significance of the European Union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the <span class="italic">coup de grâce</span> to any ideal of humanism within the heart of Europe, and which is still highly topical today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not true to say that, when a government forms an alliance with neo-Fascists somewhere in Europe, this is merely a question of national sovereignty. For this Union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances. It is a Community that is destined to exist, in which, when the main thing is under threat, when values are under threat, all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us learn the lessons of the past. In the thirties, when Adolf Hitler was democratically elected, although with a minority, many people thought that it was not as bad as all that and, Mr Poettering, in France, a number of men and women, on the right wing but perhaps of other political persuasions too, thought, ‘Better Hitler in France than the <span class="italic">Front Populaire</span>.’ They put their own petty squabbles first, and the rest is history.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make a rapid, strong and united response. I would have liked to hear your discussion with the Austrian President, Mr Poettering. We are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance. So our response must be rapid and strong. Of course, the Treaty provides us with a barrier when things become intolerable; I was almost going to say ‘irreparable’. History has taught us that Fascists start to blow hot and cold: using heated words first, in populist, xenophobic speeches, and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually, poisoning them, until the day they start to take action. And when that day comes, it is too late. So our Treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late, but we are not at that point: today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point. We must therefore find a political solution.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the Council proposals in this, while deploring a certain lack of strength, a certain spinelessness, on the part of the Commission which will, however, have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis, with determination over time, since Fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy, they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end. Our response must be rapid. If today we do not staunchly support the Council, then history will judge us, saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the Munich Agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let there be no doubt about it: we decline with thanks a Europe which develops into a kind of “big brother” and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one Member State or another in a Stalinist way and using Stalinist methods. </p>
<p class="contents">European democracy and Austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a Belgian Government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party, which was condemned by the court, to the post of European Commissioner. </p>
<p class="contents">Today, we thank the Austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within Europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate, and the background to it, reinforced the point that the Council, the Commission and this Parliament itself are dominated by Socialists.</p>
<p class="contents">My delegation of 37 Conservative and Unionist Members from the United Kingdom reject absolutely the underlying philosophy, programme and tone of Austria’s Freedom Party. We share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history, in particular World War II, but also its policies on enlargement, on immigration, on race and its attitude to the European Union itself. We were also outraged, however, at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny, the terror and the excesses of the former USSR. Even today, surely it is high time for the Party of European Socialists to break their fraternal links with China’s Communist Party.</p>
<p class="contents">Not a word was said by these same EU governments about coalition governments involving fellow-travelling communists in French or Italian governments, or in German state governments, or even the British government’s willingness to promote those with terrorist associations as ministers in Northern Ireland today.</p>
<p class="contents">This, Madam President, is the hypocrisy of the left.</p>
<p class="contents">So we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards, especially of the British government and the other largely socialist heads of EU governments and include that of the United States. We should recognise, however, that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results. This requires action to address the underlying causes, including an examination of the electoral process itself. That should be our task, not political posturing.</p>

Its aim was to combat the forgetfulness and the evil in today’s society which takes the form of xenophobia and neo-nazism. It would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite, at this time, into the institutions of the EU, a xenophobic party which flirts with Nazi ideas. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations. We demand of the candidate States and of the countries with which the EU cooperates under the Lomé Agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours. We must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned. That is why we are reacting against this carry-on in Austria. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened. We are at a watershed in the history of the European Union. The Union is not only an economic community but also a community of values, something which we take seriously. Something has happened.

It is the day of the first debate of European political life. And this is not pure chance. I feel that today’s meeting is not a meeting of Europe, our institutions, with Austria or Mr Haider’s party. It is the meeting of Europe with itself, with its <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>, with the reasons why we are here in this Chamber. This Chamber was not made for goods, it was not made for money. This Chamber, and the European institutions, were build to uphold values, morality and a certain spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">In the twentieth century, we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk, and morality, values and the spirit which I mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name: nationalist glorification, populism and the concept of racial superiority. The fact is that it is enough to read the manifesto of Mr Haider’s party, the FPÖ, to find nationalist glorification, populism and racial superiority in every chapter. Reading only one sentence which my friend, Mr Vidal-Quadras, has previously mentioned, “The nation is defined by its location, culture and race, locally, ethnically and culturally.” Well, we cannot accept such statements. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If Europe has any meaning, and – my friends will pardon me telling them – if Christian democracy has any meaning, if the history of Christian democracy has any meaning, then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and, whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again, must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reason why I feel that the European Parliament, which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the Council or the Commission, must pay tribute to those people in the various States and European institutions who had the courage to say no, and it must say, Madam President, that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit, and in clear terms declare, without prevarication, its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in Austria, recalling the statement made on the day of the Munich Agreement by a great French Christian Democrat who said that, if you are going to have to say no, then the best time to do so is right at the beginning.</p>

The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too. Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything. </p>
<p class="contents">The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values. He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness. He is a dangerous man. </p>
<p class="contents">The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders. Values should take precedence over power. We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria. In fact, we were shaken by it. We are extremely disappointed. As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives. We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty. We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right. If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed. </p>

Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself? Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here? Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days? From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider. Who would want this to happen?</p>
<p class="contents">Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics? Europe is a community of law. Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold. One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did. It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take!</p>

<p class="contents">First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate – and I use some of the words employed – to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission’s opinion. I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld. There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all. And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone, therefore, who invites Franz Fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is Austrian, should examine their own motives in the context of a debate, which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world. I say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague, Franz Fischler.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I also say, Madam President, that the understanding of the presidency, the Portuguese presidency, for our position, was absolutely demonstrated in the clearest terms by Mr Da Costa when he said, and I quote him, that ‘Portugal and the other Member States want to ensure that the working of the Community machine is not affected by the current situation’. That surely is in everyone’s interests. In order to ensure that the Treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the Community machine, we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday. We will continue to do that, Madam President, without fear or favour. That is our duty. It is also a matter of conviction.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point is this. We understand the context of this essential debate. There are several people here who like myself for many years past have become familiar with Herr Haider’s offensive statements, the xenophobia of many of his policy elements and the strategy that he has developed of alternating aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes on successive days. We understand that, and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of Nazism.</p>
<p class="contents">And, when we recall that, like many others on all sides of this House, my and my colleagues’ instincts are naturally aroused. However, the Commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct. And that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning. That is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law. Without fragility, without complacency, without ambiguity, but in the service of the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its people. We will continue to do that with energy and with consistency and as Mr Cox said in the debate, ‘necessarily with acute vigilance’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
