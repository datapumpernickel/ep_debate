I think it is useful to recall the background to the current situation in that country. It is now ten years since the murder of Mr Ndadaye, its first democratically elected President. Since then, Burundi has been ravaged by civil war. The war amounted to a confrontation between ethnic groups. Sadly, it resulted in almost 300 000 deaths.</p>
<p class="contents">A peace process is currently under way. Initially, this was led by the President of Tanzania, Julius Nyerere, and later by Mr Mandela. The terms of the process provide for a cessation of armed conflict. This was to be followed by the various stages of an electoral process and transition to democracy. An equitable power sharing system was to be established, together with a rotating Presidency passing from Hutus to Tutsis every 18 months. All these arrangements are contained in the August 2000 Arusha Peace Agreement which resulted in the present transitional government.</p>
<p class="contents">A delegation from the Committee on Development and Cooperation visited Burundi between 22 and 27 June of last year. On 9 July 2003 the President of Burundi appeared before the Committee on Development and Cooperation. On 8 October an agreement on effective implementation of the cease-fire was reached between the Government and the main faction of the so-called Forces for the Defence of Democracy led by Pierre Nkurunziza. Unfortunately, armed confrontations between groups such as the FDD and the FNL have continued.</p>
<p class="contents">The African Union has dispatched the African Mission In Burundi peace-keeping force known as the AMIB. It consists of 3 000 soldiers from Ethiopia, South Africa and Mozambique. The force is tasked with assisting in the disarmament and demobilisation of rebel soldiers and with their reintegration back into society. In addition, if peace is maintained, it should be easier to for humanitarian aid supplies to reach displaced persons and the population in war-torn areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The last of the AMIB soldiers arrived in Burundi last Sunday. The force is financed by the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Mozambique. Nonetheless, there appear to be financial difficulties over keeping it in the field. At the same time, the problems in the south of Kivu are ongoing. Confrontations are still taking place and they represent a threat to peace in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union suspended aid to Burundi in January 1997. Aid was reinstated, however, following the response to the peace negotiations. EUR 48 million was granted for a rehabilitation programme aimed mainly at supporting the return of displaced persons and demobilisation. The programme also aimed to facilitate justice and reconciliation. In addition, institutional support amounting to EUR 2 million was awarded to the Ministry of Economy.</p>
<p class="contents">A further EUR 150 million was allocated at the Paris Conference in 2001. This included an ECHO programme for the return of Burundian refugees from Tanzania supported by UNHCR.</p>
<p class="contents">European Union funds amounting to EUR 285 million are currently available to Burundi. Additional funds will be allocated under the ninth EDF. We would like this resolution to serve as a reminder to the authorities in Burundi that they need to involve women in the peace process. We believe women have an important part to play in the latter. We also encourage neighbouring countries to support the peace process in Burundi. Finally, we hope to be able to rejoice that peace has come about in this small country in central Africa. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For a long time, in this region, the land of the great lakes, we have seen very violent conflicts, even going as far as genocide and mass expulsions, which, if we merely apply short-term remedies, will only keep on recurring. That is why it matters that we should start by clarifying terminology, for the words that we use here are often not the same ones that are used in the region itself. We talk in terms of armies, parties, or refugees, but these are, as a rule, ethnic groups appearing in the guise of an army, a party or as refugees. What matters in the first place is that some sort of stable balance be established between the ethnic groups, with it being ensured that all of them participate in political life and are represented in the armed forces, in the administration and, as the amendment so rightly puts it, in the justice system above all. This is where it is very important that we should proceed with tact and sensitivity, rather than adopt a schoolmasterly and accusatory role, for ethnic misunderstandings and prejudices led us Europeans, too, to spend centuries smashing each others’ skulls in, and such things are still going on in Europe today. We really do, then, have to approach this task with the proper sensitivity and humility; we cannot expect people who were doing terrible things to each other only a few years or months ago to be able, within only a few months, to behave as if nothing had happened. That is why we need this process; although we must waste no time in getting on with it, we need sensitivity, we need time, and we need to be present. That is why we need civil servants, lawyers and also officers from the armed services to act as advisors to both sides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ethnic opposition is constantly intensified by the leaders of armed gangs, official or unofficial, that were created and supported, it must be remembered, for decades by the former Belgian colonising power and by the French tutelary power. The resolution provides a great deal of moralistic and paternalistic advice for the Burundi leadership, the leaders of the factions and its neighbours. Yet more than advice is needed, as the European powers have an overwhelming responsibility for what has happened and what is happening in Burundi, just as they have a more general responsibility for all of Africa, of which Rwanda and Burundi are to some extent the sad symbols.</p>
<p class="contents">They have an overwhelming responsibility for having ruined Africa through the trafficking of slaves, through colonialist pillaging and then through another form of pillaging, which continues today. While Parliament provides moralising advice, the major British, French and Belgian capitalist groups and many others continue to take their stipend, even from the poorest countries, and the little information that filters through from many parts of Africa where ethnic conflicts and mining riches go side by side show that it is very rare to find a situation where behind the local warlords there are no capitalist groups trying to get their hands on the riches the land has to offer. Rather than improving the fate of the local population, these riches are the cause of its misfortune. I am well aware that material aid, even a great deal of it, would not be enough to overcome all of the problems that are an extension of the past. However, if Europe wanted to, it could provide sufficient aid to allow the refugees to return, provide the Burundi people with acceptable housing and living conditions, and enable them to build infrastructures, hospitals and schools, thus creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution does allude to aid, in particular for the economic reconstruction of the country, but it gives much more attention to the financing of African forces working to restore and maintain peace and the despatch of a mission of European senior military officials to meet their counterparts in the Burundi regular army. Yet in neighbouring Rwanda some years ago, the presence of French senior military officials not only did not prevent the genocide but actually encouraged it and perhaps even armed the butchers. Thus, even if this resolution had some effect, it would certainly not wipe away the traces of blood that the presence of major European capital has left in Burundi and more generally in the African continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Meantime armed groups unlawfully kill, maim, abduct and torture civilians in pursuit of their political aims.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, armed belligerents in Burundi continue to recruit, at times forcibly, child combatants. As was agreed last December, and has already been mentioned here, it is imperative that Burundi enacts a stable and real cease-fire between government and rebels as a precursor to a meaningful and lasting peace.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Green EFA group have also called for judicial and army reform, as provided for in the Arusha accords of 2000, and an end to impunity for those who continue to perpetrate human rights abuses. We also invite the government to set up a truth and reconciliation commission, as has been called for by so many in civil society. We call on the government to ratify the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise that Burundi is in need of help from the international community, especially financial aid for the economic reconstruction of the country, for the maintenance of peace and the promotion of a legitimate functioning government. This is a challenge that the EU must rise to. But we must also be aware of the fact that little is being done to stop the well documented flow of arms that fuel conflicts and cause massive human rights abuses – not just in Burundi, but in so many other parts of the world. This is something that must be a priority for the EU, we cannot allow arms to be sent to countries where they are causing such massive human rights abuses. We should not be involved with arms in the first place, to be honest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To rebuild national unity and reconciliation after those long years of civil war, it is vital to ensure that people, individuals and communities who suffered gross human rights abuses are acknowledged and provided with reparation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I support the creation of a truth and reconciliation commission, of the kind set up in South Africa or Sierra Leone for instance. It will allow cases of extreme violations of human rights committed by all parties to be identified and investigated. It also provides victims with support to ensure that their dignity is restored and that healing and rehabilitation can occur.</p>
<p class="contents">Bringing the accused to trial under the legal, judicial process strengthens the rule of law and is vital in breaking the cycle of vengeance created by widespread rapes and killings committed with impunity. A truth and reconciliation commission would also raise awareness of human rights and provide the basis for peace-building and sustainable reconciliation of the communities of Burundi. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This Protocol is in our eyes an important step towards consolidating the peace process in Burundi. It shows that many of the local actors are prepared to respect the Arusha Agreement as a framework for the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Like the author of the resolution we are discussing this afternoon, we are also concerned about the exclusion from the process of the last rebel group, the FNL, and we feel that it is important to continue to encourage all initiatives to launch the negotiations between the FNL and the transitional government in Burundi.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we done so far? For the most part, we have supported the peace process as far as possible, deploying a number of instruments to ease the conflict and promote reconciliation, including food aid, financial contributions and the despatch of observers from the African Union. Pending the establishment of the facility to support peace, we are preparing, in collaboration with the African Union, an emergency project to maintain peace in Burundi, which totals around EUR 25 million. Naturally, we hope that the entire donor community will stand alongside us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working towards the economic reconstruction of Burundi with a rehabilitation programme, totalling just under EUR 50 million, which is designed to ensure the physical rehabilitation of the economic and social infrastructures that have unfortunately been destroyed by the civil war, as in other parts of Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">In August, we signed an indicative national programme with Burundi, as part of the ninth EDF, which amounts to around EUR 70 million, part of which is naturally allocated to the restoration of the political institutions in the transitional phase. Therefore, in our view, support for the peace process and a substantial contribution to the reconstruction of the country are the two objectives that the Union must continue to strive towards in order to support the little progress being made as regards the peace process in that country, which sadly continues to be troubled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
