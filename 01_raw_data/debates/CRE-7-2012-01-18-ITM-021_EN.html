The Presidency is very well aware of the concerns which have been expressed by Members of this House over some aspects of the legislation recently adopted in Hungary, including the new constitution. Let me be absolutely clear: all EU Member States must comply with the rules of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This goes for Hungary as it goes for any other Member State. If there are any doubts whether a Member State’s laws are in accordance with the EU rules, the Commission should examine and analyse the situation thoroughly. This is in the interest of all Member States, and that is exactly what the Commission has done in Hungary. Action is being taken.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency fully supports the Commission’s role as the guardian of the Treaties. We appreciate the thorough analysis the Commission is undertaking. The concerns that have been raised about the recent developments in Hungary must be treated with the seriousness that the situation deserves. We all share a strong interest in Hungary living up to its application under EU law and, in the process for determining whether this is or is not the case, being fair and thorough.</p>
<p class="contents">Rule of law cuts both ways. Member States’ compliance with EU law must be ensured, but the process must be based on a solid and fact-based analysis and there should be a dialogue with the Member State. We therefore welcome the fact that the Commission has issued its legal assessment of the Hungarian laws. It is on this basis that appropriate decisions and the next steps should be taken, in accordance with our rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has expressed a number of specific concerns and has taken steps to ensure that the Hungarian legislation is brought into accordance with EU law. Therefore, it has decided to launch infringement proceedings on three issues: the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges, and the independence of the data protection authority. At the same time, it is sending a wider information request to the Hungarian authorities on the issue of the independence of the judiciary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency supports these actions. We of course expect Hungary, like any other Member State, to comply with the EU Treaties and laws and it goes without saying that the respect of EU law, including the Treaties and the values enshrined in the Treaties, is the basis on which the EU is founded. It is the duty of all Member States to act in accordance with these Treaties. I therefore expect that Hungary will meet the obligation it has accepted as a Member of the European Union, and I am aware that the Prime Minister of Hungary has sent a letter to the President of the Commission. I hope that this letter, and the work being done also in the debate today, will ensure that a solution is found to this very serious situation.</p>

<p class="contents">This is an extremely sensitive matter, where I believe we have to be clear on values, firm on principles, fair on method and sensible on communication. The Commission has been closely monitoring developments related to the new Hungarian constitutional system since the beginning of 2011. We were in contact with the Hungarian authorities during the preparation of the draft ‘cardinal laws’ implementing the new Constitution – raising our concerns over the compatibility of these laws with European Union law. Similar concerns, among others, were raised by the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Following an initial technical analysis, the Commission urged the authorities in Hungary to modify the draft laws. Unfortunately the Hungarian authorities did not take into account all the Commission requests. These concerns were then expressed at the highest political levels in December, through two letters from myself to Prime Minister Orbán and letters from Commission Vice-Presidents Rehn and Reding. Moreover, we made it clear that the issue of the independence of the national central bank needs to be addressed before we can start formal negotiations on the requested EU-IMF financial assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Following adoption of the cardinal laws by the Hungarian Parliament on 30 December, the Commission immediately conducted a full and swift legal analysis of the final versions of these laws and their compatibility with the European Union treaties. Following this legal analysis, the Commission yesterday agreed to launch three infringement procedures. We have sent three letters of formal notice relating to the independence of the national central bank, the retirement age of judges and prosecutors and the Data Protection Supervisory Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also asked for further explanations concerning the independence of the judiciary. On this issue we expect additional clarifications by the Hungarian authorities. Should those clarifications not satisfy, or should they fail to provide a proper answer, the Commission will not hesitate in taking further action on this very important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">These decisions reflect the special responsibility of the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, to provide a sound and thorough legal analysis, and its quasi-jurisdictional role in this respect. Moreover, these measures are part of a sustained and determined effort by the Commission to ensure full observance of European Union law by the Member States: the letter of the law and also, importantly, the spirit of the law.</p>
<p class="contents">The proceedings decided on yesterday by the Commission will be treated with the highest priority. At this stage, the issue for the Commission is mainly one of the application of European Union law, and we are doing everything in our power to pursue this in a consistent and objective way. However, I insist that we will not hesitate to take further steps if they are deemed appropriate, depending on the formal and substantive replies we receive from the Hungarian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I received a letter from Prime Minister Orbán, reacting to the three Commission decisions. He has indicated to me his intention to modify the relevant legislation and to work with the Commission in the coming days in order to find legal solutions to the issues raised. The Commission will continue its efforts with the Hungarian authorities to explore the various ways of complying with European Union law.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there may be issues at stake that go beyond the matters of European law that have been raised. These other issues should also, I believe, be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council of Europe is currently considering other points of Hungarian legislation which are under its remit. The Council of Europe’s Venice Commission could play an important role in this respect. Both Vice-President Reding and I have discussed this with Secretary-General Jagland, who has conveyed his full support for the approach the Commission has taken.</p>
<p class="contents">This leads me to the more political dimension of this situation – something that we are also discussing today in this Parliament in its evident capacity as a political body. In fact, beyond the legal aspects, some concerns have been expressed regarding the quality of democracy in Hungary, its political culture, the relations between the government and the opposition, and those between the state and civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly appeal to the Hungarian authorities to respect the very principles of democracy and freedom and to implement them: not only in terms of norms but also in practice and in the political and social life of the country. These are matters where political judgment is more difficult, and sometimes – let us be honest – ideologically polarised. But I believe that all democratic political forces have an interest in working together for the consolidation of a Hungarian democracy.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to call for the legislation in question to be modified and made compatible with European law. Above all we will continue to urge the Hungarian Government to act in a responsible democratic manner and in the best interests of all Hungarian citizens. In fact, yesterday, on a further matter which raised political issues, Vice-President Kroes again sent a letter to the Hungarian authorities expressing our concerns regarding media freedom. For it is only through a legally stable environment, based on the rule of law, democratic principles and fundamental rights, that the confidence of citizens, partners and investors can be gained and maintained. In times of economic crisis this is more vital than ever – apart from being, of course, a question of democratic principle.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, I believe, that the message sent from this debate in the European Parliament to the Hungarian people is that we want Hungary to go on being a respected member of the European Union. This should be a debate not against Hungary but for Hungary and with Hungary. We are asking the Hungarian authorities to correct points that raise concern. We do not want a shadow of doubt on the democracy of any of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have the highest regard for the Hungarian people: their history, their culture, their record of fighting a totalitarian regime as embodied in their struggle against Soviet troops in 1956. We therefore call on the Hungarian Government clearly to demonstrate its commitment to the principles of democracy, freedom and the rule of law.</p>

It is always a pleasure to address a parliament, because no matter what an institutional system is like, it is in parliament where democracy is at work, and it is the parliament that is the heart of democracy. I myself share this opinion, and that is why I have been a member of parliament since 1990. Thank you, President Schulz, for providing me the opportunity to be here today. I am grateful to the Danish Presidency, which did not object to, but was in fact in favour of my being here, and I would also like to thank President Barroso for his encouraging words.</p>
<p class="contents">I came here to you today because I had been informed that you were intending to discuss Hungary. I thought it appropriate to be at your disposal, so that you may learn firsthand about the intentions of the Hungarian Government. In the present situation, where there is already a tension due to the European economic crisis, the increased attention focused on Hungary justifies my presence.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me tell you that I am not surprised at the increased interest shown in Hungary. Our country has undergone a comprehensive, deep, magnificent and exciting reform over the past one and a half years. The reform was justified and urgent. In 2010 our country was on the verge of economic collapse. A country of 10 million people was supported by less than 3 million taxpayers. There were more people living off state funds than from the economy. There were no legal sanctions against the operations of paramilitary organisations. Our country stood at the brink of economic collapse and tragedy. We undertook an enormous amount of work in the past one and a half years, and we are proud of that work. Although we still have to face plenty of serious economic difficulties, for the first time Hungary’s budget can be considered stable and in compliance with European norms. We are in the process of reducing our sovereign debt, and our balance of payments is showing a long-term positive result. We have outlawed and eliminated paramilitary organisations, and as a result Hungary now offers protection to all minorities, including national minorities, the Roma, as well as Jewish minorities, and the Hungarian Government will continue to protect these minorities in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Over a period of one and a half years we have enacted a new constitution, 25 cardinal laws and 339 other laws, which makes a total of 365 laws in one and a half years. We implemented structural reforms and reorganised the governmental system, the system of municipal governments, public administration, the justice system, education, health care, taxation and public contributions, the pension system and the social security system. We reorganised everything that was generating sovereign debt in Hungary. This naturally entailed the injury of interests, namely of lobby interests, business interests and the interests of major power groups in business. You need only think of the bank tax or the Hungarian crisis tax imposed on major corporations.</p>
<p class="contents">We were the last of the formerly occupied countries to enact a new constitution in place of the Communist one adopted in 1949. I would like to make it clear to you that the reform and reorganisation of Hungary took place on the basis of European values and principles. We drew upon both the good practices of the EU Member States and the fundamental documents of the European Union. Considering the extent and rate of the transformation I, together with everyone else in Hungary, consider it natural for disputes to emerge.</p>
<p class="contents">Today I sent a letter to President Barroso. In that letter I expressed my opinion that the issues raised by the Commission can be remedied in an easy, simple and swift manner. I anticipate quick results from our meeting scheduled for next week. At the same time I would like to inform Parliament that none of the passages which were sent to us by the Commission and with regard to which legal objections have been raised so far concern the Hungarian Constitution. Notwithstanding what newspapers publish, there has not been a single objection to the text of the Hungarian Constitution as adopted on 25 April. We adopted the constitution on 25 April last year. The Commission has raised objections regarding two of the temporary provisions related to the constitution, and I am at their disposal in order to remedy these two deficiencies, but I would like to point out that thus far no one has expressed any doubts of a legal nature in respect of any passage of the Hungarian Constitution. I am convinced that this is as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to you for allowing me to explain all this. I ask you to kindly continue to support in the future, in the spirit of European values, the major transformation and restructuring that we are in the process of completing in Hungary. Hungary is counting on the European Parliament’s support. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You then took the reins of a country that was in a poor state both economically and in terms of corruption. This was one of the reasons for your unprecedented success in the general election.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hungarian people elected you with a clear mandate: to make a break from the political direction of the past, and to reform the country, as you have just said. This is what you undertook to do. Hungary was the last central and eastern European country to have kept its 1949 Stalinist constitution. The reform of the constitution was debated and adopted by the Hungarian Parliament, which also voted in the 30 ‘Cardinal Laws’. Criticisms were made over several of these laws, and doubts were raised as to their compatibility with European Union law. The only way to find out whether these criticisms and doubts are justified is to defer to the judgment of the European Commission, as guardian of the EU treaties. My group defers wholly to the Commission’s judgment, as it always does in situations of this nature.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, as President Barroso just mentioned, the Commission issued Hungary with formal notice to amend three areas of its constitutional reforms within one month. Yesterday also, the Hungarian authorities said they were prepared to address the Commission’s requests, and today, at his own initiative, the Prime Minister has proposed to answer questions from Members of this Parliament directly.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, these are serious, weighty matters we are dealing with. We are talking about democracy, the rule of law, and Europe’s values. The members of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), at least in their capacity as the largest majority in this House, uphold the principles of freedom and democracy. Mr Orbán, I am sure, will prove to us that he also adheres to these principles and values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some of us will certainly be of the opinion that the Commission could play a more active role in evaluating the situation. However, I do not want to call that into question here. I am grateful to you for what you have said, Mr Barroso.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Orbán, this is not the first debate that we have held. You should not be surprised that we are discussing Hungary or, rather not Hungary, but what your government is doing. There have been complaints about some new laws, but these are important laws. They concern the independence of the data protection authority, the judiciary and the national central bank. This may even relate to the independence of the legal system as a whole. I am not intending simply to criticise the individual measures, but rather the spirit that lies behind them. You say that this is a reorganisation on the basis of European values. However, European values include democracy and changes of government. You want to prevent that from happening. You even want to continue exercising power in Hungary after a change of government. We are criticising the spirit that you represent.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Daul, I am deeply disappointed by your statement. You said nothing about the spirit behind these moves. After all, Mr Orbán is the Vice-President of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). You should finally take the initiative. You are in a better position even than the Commission to tell Mr Orbán what is right and what is wrong with his policy. It is time that you did this.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What makes me particularly sad, Mr Orbán, is that, like me, you know many people who fought against National Socialism. They were imprisoned. Then they fought against communism. Now they are affected by your measures and they are saying: Why did we fight for freedom only to find that it is being taken away from us bit by bit? Mr Orbán, you must talk to these people. Listen to the people in Hungary if you do not want to listen to the Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, President Buzek spoke about the great achievements of Václav Havel. Take Václav Havel as your example. He always fought against communism and in support of freedom.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Mr Orbán and the representatives of the Hungarian Government, I would like to thank you once again, also in my role as rapporteur for Croatia, for helping Croatia to join the European Union. However, you know as well as I do that Croatia with an Orbán government would not have been able to join the EU because it would not have met the criteria. You should at least make sure now, Mr Orbán, that Hungary fulfils the criteria.</p>

If we have to discuss the basic values of the European Union, I do not think it is a good thing to have the type of reaction we have seen today.</p>
<p class="contents">I have here a little document listing in total 30 breaches of the Treaty, fundamental questions and serious concerns in relation to Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty. These breaches, questions and concerns relate to the new Hungarian Constitution, the independence of the Hungarian judiciary, the new media law, the independence of the data protection supervisor, the position of the Hungarian central bank, the new church law and a lot of other issues, as well as the ‘cardinal laws’ that have recently been published.</p>
<p class="contents">Let there be no misunderstanding: I did not make this list myself. It is simply the summary of all the facts and all the complaints that you can find in official letters from official international authorities and official international organisations – the President of the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council of Europe, the Commissioner for Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the Venice Commission, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund, the US Secretary of State. I did not add to this list all the complaints from other organisations, such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, or from the civil society representatives who are protesting in the streets. It is only the summary of official letters from official organisations that have complained. So saying that there is no major problem today in Hungary astonishes me.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday the Commission launched infringement procedures in relation to three questions. Let us be clear, Mr Barroso: there is more at stake. The issues that have been tackled today are mainly technical ones, and I know there is also an important letter, which you mentioned, that raises other questions. What is necessary here is not a debate on technical issues, as we had at the beginning of the year. This is about checking the conformity of the constitution and cardinal laws with the European values that are enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty: democracy, the rule of law, freedom of religion, freedom of expression and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, besides the role that the Commission is playing with these infringement procedures, this House also has a responsibility under the Treaty to take action. That is why I am calling on all Members – not the right against the left or vice versa – in the Committee on Civil Rights, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) to draw up a report, based on Article 7(1) of the Treaty, stating ‘yes’ or ‘no’ – and it can be ‘no’ – on whether there exists a clear risk of a serious breach of our values. That is what we have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">May I end with a personal message to you, Mr Orbán. Let us recognise, first of all, that you did a fantastic job in the past, together with so many other dissidents, in beating Communism and dictatorship, but I am afraid you are on the wrong path at the moment. Listen to what your comrades of the past are saying to you today. I shall repeat now an open letter sent to you a few days ago by your former colleagues, dissidents György Dalos, János Kenedi and György Konrád. They wrote to you that Hungary is an ‘example of what may happen wherever there is a concentration of crisis tendencies’ along with ‘authoritarian means and a policy of nationalistic isolation’. They end the letter by saying that it could be a good idea, Mr Orbán, to react sharply when someone wipes his shoes on liberal democracy, even if that someone is an old dissident…</p>

According to all the European newspapers, both right- and left-wing, there is a problem in Hungary. Yet here, the Hungarian Prime Minister and this Parliament’s right wing are telling us that there is no problem in Hungary. We must be completely schizophrenic.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put this simply: the European Union is not a doormat for people to wipe their feet on. It is a shared home that we are building together, Mr Orbán. Yesterday, in Hungary you issued a press release in which you said, ‘I am going to go to Strasbourg to defend Hungary’s honour against attacks from the international and European left’. Let me tell you this: Hilary Clinton belongs to the European left; Angela Merkel belongs to the European left; Alain Juppé belongs to the European left; so welcome to the club! What is going on in this debate is purely for show, in my opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Orbán, you come here and you tell us that you have done all you can to change the constitution, which was a Stalinist constitution; and Mr Daul, your party’s spokesperson in this House, tells us that it was a Stalinist constitution. This means that this whole Parliament, including you and the whole lot of us, are utterly crazy, because we admitted a country with a Stalinist constitution into the European Union. You are completely crazy! It is not possible. How can you have done this? Shame on us!</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr Orbán, at the time when you, together with your country and your party were about to become part of the European Union, I did not once hear the conservatives say, ‘wait until we change the Stalinist constitution before we go into the EU’. I never heard that. So why not stop this nonsense.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the country is taking a new direction. However, when you say new direction, this could mean the right direction or the wrong direction. We are here to tell you that you are going in the direction of Hugo Chavez, Fidel Castro, and all the other totalitarian and authoritarian governments of this world that we all fight against, together with you; only you are not strong enough to fight when it comes to Mr Orbán.</p>
<p class="contents">I will give you three examples that affect me personally. The Mayor of Budapest, who belongs to the same party as Mr Orbán, has just appointed as a theatre director in Budapest a person who not only has contacts with the extreme right, but also a long history of antisemitism, and claims to be part of a group of Hungarian intellectuals of whom Viktor Orbán, when he was plain ‘Viktor’, said on leaving a theatre: ‘we will never support this intellectual’s nationalistic, antisemitic attitude in Hungary’. And now, these people are being brought back into the mainstream, with the <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> party’s approval.</p>
<p class="contents">If you disagree with me, let me suggest a very simple solution: let us follow Guy Verhofstadt’s suggestion and send a delegation via the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, under Article 7 of the Treaty, to find out why homeless people in Hungary are afraid; why intellectuals are afraid; why people from my family and other Jewish people I know in Hungary are afraid today; and why the spirit of your new constitution is that of a Hungary of the past, which frightens many Hungarian citizens. You may have a majority, but the minorities have the right to live in your country without fear, Mr Orbán. Therefore, if you are so sure of yourselves, and sure there are no problems with Hungary’s democracy, we should make use of Article 7, and see what kind of report comes back. If you are right, I will apologise; and if you are wrong, I will ask you to apologise to me, my conservative fellow Members, because if we are strong, we will even fight our own families if we have to, for the sake of freedom and democracy. It is easy to say that it is always other people, but when it is one’s own family that goes off the rails, it is the courage of those who fight for freedom that stands out, not that of collaborators.</p>

Not only left-leaning but also respectable conservative papers were full of stories about Hungary. Sadly, all serious reports were negative. Hungary is suffering from a double crisis: an economic and fiscal crisis as a result of the government’s irrational and at times openly dishonest and destructive policies.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a legal and political crisis as a result of the new basic law and a series of cardinal laws approved in a hurry. The Commission has realised that something has gone seriously wrong in Hungary, but I call the attention of the European institutions to the fact that it is not only the law on the Central Bank data protection and the judiciary which violates the common values and legal rules of the EU: the legislative frenzy last December resulted in a carpet-bombing of the rule of law and the system of checks and balances.</p>
<p class="contents">All non-governmental state institutions have had their autonomy stripped away on a systematic basis. The new legal set-up has restricted the jurisdiction of the constitutional court, the ombudsmen and the competition office. It has emptied out the budget office and made a mockery of the court of auditors and media supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">Leaders of all state institutions have been appointed by the ruling party and will stay in office well beyond the mandate of the present government. Their term in office is secured by cardinal laws. To add insult to injury, many laws were approved without the slightest chance for the parliamentary opposition to influence their content.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislative drafts arrived at the last minute as individual initiatives inhibiting public debate and professional control. The old constitution, which was not a Stalinist one, was modified ten times in a period of one and a half years to avoid scrutiny. The first president of the constitutional court called this practice a destruction of the constitutional culture. The aim of this rampage was stated by the Prime Minister, who said in an interview last summer that he intends to tie the hands of the next ten governments.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result of this legal carpet-bombing, Hungary may become ungovernable for a long time. German papers labelled the government as ‘Rechtskonservativ’. It is a mistake. This regime nationalised the mandatory private pension system, trampling the sanctity of private property underfoot. Having destroyed the trust of investors it was not able to reduce public debt; it wasted 10% of GDP and had nothing to show for it. Pain and suffering was inflicted upon the people without any reason and result. Depositors now take their savings to Austria in droves. Populist and nationalist policies damage the interests of Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">We true conservatives expect Europe to help us defend the rule of law and fight for the restoration of democratic institutions in Hungary. We know that it is our struggle and only the Hungarian people can bring about democratic change. Rest assured we will continue the fight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it really democracy, the rule of law and human rights that we are talking about?</p>
<p class="contents">A Prime Minister of a Member State has travelled here to provide some explanations. This is unusual enough to be a noteworthy event, and we would be delighted by it if we did not think that it would be exploited for purely domestic political ends.</p>
<p class="contents">What exactly are we talking about today? We are talking about a constitution that was rushed through in a few weeks by a government taking advantage of the huge majority it gained in the national parliament: a majority which everyone knows is artificial.</p>
<p class="contents">This constitution was passed in April last year and came into force on 1 January this year. In the meantime, over 300 laws have been passed, 30 of which are ‘Cardinal Laws’ dealing with matters of some importance, to say the least, from the point of view of so-called ‘EU values’. These are matters such as the independence of the judiciary, certainly Mr Barroso, but also the threat to freedom of expression and media pluralism; the definition of nationality; abandoning the republican structure of the State; compromising the separation of Church and State by parading so-called ‘Christian values’; promoting a very narrow view of the family; challenging the status of minority groups, especially homosexuals and Roma people, and freedom of the unions. It is a long list, and no doubt I have forgotten something. The European Parliament alerted the Commission in July last year, Mr Barroso, but we had to wait until December before you became concerned about what was happening in Hungary, only to announce that we should keep an eye on the independence of Hungary’s central bank. A fine demonstration of what EU values really are!</p>
<p class="contents">The proceedings that were initiated yesterday are therefore not sufficient to deal with the problem, any more than the answers coming out of Hungary are. Fascism is knocking at Europe’s doors once again, in the shape of nationalism and fear mongering, taking advantage of the social consequences of the economic and financial crisis, which the European institutions are daily proving incapable of handling. We should indeed remember the past: but the whole of the past. At least within this Chamber, let us not allow history to stare in disbelief. Let us really help supporters of democracy in Hungary. No-one is manipulating them, Prime Minister; they are simply daring to believe in values that, as Aung Sang Suu Kyi reminded us this week, are universal: the values of democracy and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, those days are gone forever, but the fact that today the European Union is trying to use the institutions of the Union and financial pressure to restrict, once again, the free democratic choice of the Hungarian nation borders on a historical paradox. This time the Hungarian nation must defend its freedoms, its democratic elections and sovereignty in internal affairs against the attempts of transnational corporations that the European Commission represents in relation to Hungary. The issues of the constitution and free media legislation were only a pretext for attacking the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán and his right-wing government, because they are rebuilding their country with courage after the terrible era of Communist governments and their post-Communist government heirs, because they have had the courage to impose taxes on banks and international corporations, because they had the courage to mention Christianity in their constitution, a beautiful national tradition, and the traditional concept of family, as opposed to left-wing political correctness, which shines in the salons of Europe.

In that case I am happy to see that you are present, and I am happy that you can hear what I am saying, namely that on my own behalf, and on behalf of the <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> Party and Hungary, I protest against the allegation of anti-Semitism. Jews in Hungary do not live in fear. It was Viktor Orbán’s first government that introduced the Hungarian Holocaust Memorial Day, and yesterday we – he himself – launched the Wallenberg Year in Hungary. If the Jews have something to fear it is not Viktor Orbán, nor his Government. Hungary is a democracy and protects minorities. We strongly object to such insinuations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I am a European, a member of <span class="italic">Fidesz,</span> and a Hungarian democrat. I was a young lawyer when I began my fight for freedom against a dictatorial Communist regime. This freedom we did achieve. It is thanks to this that today Hungary is a European democracy. To this day <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> has always stood up for this freedom, no matter what you might say. Today Hungary is a democratic Member State of the European Union and abides by the EU’s rules. If the Commission says that Hungarian law is in conflict with EU law, we listen to its opinion and change the law. We demonstrated this over the recent period. In the case of the Hungarian media law we did so within a few weeks. We are disciplined, dedicated members of this Community and wish to remain so.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Hungarian people are astounded to read and hear what the foreign media have to say. They do not recognise their own country. We know that you, too, have read such reports. Recently a renowned French journalist who had written an article about Hungary was asked by a Hungarian television channel to describe how the article came to be. The journalist replied that he was not familiar with Hungary or the present situation, but had simply been given background material and had been asked to write an article. The article was naturally full of falsehoods and second-hand information.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the attacks against Hungary are an indication that there is a task we here in the European Parliament and in the European Union have failed to fulfil, namely to acquaint ourselves with each other. You do not know Hungary. The accusations that are largely published in newspapers and other media are untrue. We can provide evidence regarding every single point. We are at your disposal should you so need. You do not know us. You do not know that in 2006 the Socialist Government brutally assaulted peaceful commemorators with mounted police charges and rubber bullets aimed at their eyes, that in 2006 tens of thousands of people demanded before the Hungarian Parliament every day for weeks that the Socialist Government which had lied to their faces resign. You should, however, learn about the immense efforts Hungary is making. Viktor Orbán has already told you what these were. There has been a compete transformation of Hungarian public administration and the Hungarian state.</p>
<p class="contents">You claim to be Europeans and democrats. Europeans and democrats listen to others. They do not make a judgement before even conducting the investigation. This is what we are asking of you. Conduct the investigation. Become acquainted with us, and it will become clear to everyone that Hungary is a democracy where the rule of law is respected, and that Viktor Orbán’s Government has not weakened, but in fact reinforced it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Orbán Government fully deserves the sharp criticism, but such criticism also casts a shadow over my country. I am aware that when the European Commission is trying to make the Hungarian Government see reason it by no means intends to offend or even less punish the Hungarian people, and this is the way it should be. Still, even though the Hungarian Government has taken some measures that go against European values I find it excessive for anyone to call Viktor Orbán a Hugo Chavez, a Putin of the Puszta or a dictator. It is true, unfortunately, that we can no longer call him a true democrat either, but even the Hungarian Prime Minister is entitled to personal dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask President Schulz, President Barroso and the Danish Presidency to make it clear to Hungarian citizens that the EU is not dictating or issuing commands, that this is not Europe’s style. The European Union is not an external power; after all, we Hungarians are part of this Community as well. We, too, make up the Union. As with every family, in the European Union it is customary, or even a moral obligation, to warn a family member who has strayed from the right path. Such straying hurts the member concerned the most, but it also harms the Community as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">If in Hungary people are worse off, can be stripped arbitrarily of their acquired rights and their pension entitlements, and if millions of workers are punished while the rich are rewarded by a tax system cemented by a two-thirds majority, then it is mainly Hungarian society that suffers. Indeed, it is the Orbán Government that is punishing the Hungarian people and not the European Union it condemns. It is first of all in the interest of Hungary and only secondly in the interest of the European Union for Hungary to be once again characterised by a genuine rule of law, true freedom of the press, a responsible economic policy that avoids state bankruptcy and a government that can be removed from office if it has lost the trust of the majority. As a responsible patriot I wish for Hungary to once again be democratic and economically prosperous, and to follow a system of values that is both national and European. This is in the common interest of both Hungarian and European citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The infringement procedure started by the Commission is based on certain EU directives and does not touch on Article 2 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come for this Parliament, directly elected and representing the EU’s citizens, to prove it is capable of sending the right political message. We have received hundreds of messages from across Europe asking for just that. Let us be honest, no accession country would be allowed to join the European Union if the situation were similar to the one in Hungary today.</p>
<p class="contents">To give just a few examples: the parliament has become an annex of the ruling party, which imposes the legislation it wants, not only for now but for the decades to come. A highly respected constitutional court has been transformed into a weightless body. The independence of the judiciary is under severe threat, as the right to appoint judges and to promote them belongs to only one person: the chief of the national judiciary office elected for nine years by a two-thirds majority of Parliament, which in fact means Fidesz. The written press is dominated by self-censorship through the huge fine systems, the audiovisual media is politically controlled and frequencies are conferred in an arbitrary fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">If we add the decisions affecting the economic and financial system, we get a picture of a government which is doing its best to take absolute control of society as a whole. Fighting to secure full respect for fundamental rights and democracy in Hungary in fact means fighting to secure full respect for fundamental rights and democracy in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Three amendments and then the Commission’s comments were withdrawn. Meanwhile, journalists are being stripped of their jobs and radio stations are losing their frequencies.</p>

<p class="contents">Whom did Mr Orbán offend? He mainly offended big capital, because he had to rebuild a bankrupt country following half a century of Communist governments and their Socialist descendants, to put the country back on its feet. To this end, he taxed big capital. I refer to banks, telecommunications and energy companies, hypermarkets. For this, today he is facing a furious frontal media attack.</p>
<p class="contents">He faces the fury of the European Left, because instead of renouncing Christian values, he proudly included them in the Hungarian Constitution. In Hungary, marriage is between men and women, life is protected from conception, and the world finally makes sense. Hungary also faces the fury of Socialists, because Hungary holds Communist crimes to account today, and its constitution clearly states that Communism was tyranny.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, Hungary faces the fury of Russia, because Hungary effectively resisted Russian influence and regained control over MOL - the largest fuel company.</p>

The Hungarian Government has already promised on several occasions to deal with these problems and to make the necessary changes. These are the facts. If we could simply put aside the political hysteria, then we would be able to talk objectively about the situation. I have heard nothing new today from those on the left concerning the facts. Mr Swoboda stands up and says that the judiciary may be independent. Then I hear from Mr Orbán that there was absolutely no criticism of the constitution. Next Mr Verhofstadt says that this is not about individual legal details. It is about the fundamental question of whether Hungary is still democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) stand for law and justice. If anyone has a criticism, they must substantiate it objectively and in terms of its content with regard to the judicial issues and not simply claim that someone has acted undemocratically.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are experiencing in many areas is quite simply an arbitrary approach. If I do not like a specific aspect of the legislation in Hungary, I describe it as undemocratic, radical and right-wing or totalitarian. We in the PPE Group will not tolerate this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that I have been working in this Parliament since 2004. I was involved with the case of Slovakia, which introduced a law banning the use of the Hungarian language there. All of the people on the left who are now getting so angry …</p>

More than anything, it represents values and principles. Similarly, the crisis that is reverberating throughout the European Union concerns not only the euro and its governance, but, also its values and principles, which are being threatened by the uncertainty and fear causing negative reactions against Europe and a resurgence of nationalism.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Europe was not built on nationalist confrontation but, rather, on a supranational effort to subject all of the Member States to legally-binding legislation from which no Member State is immune.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, when the European institutions express their concern regarding the Hungarian reforms they are acting on behalf not only of the 500 million Europeans represented in this Parliament, but also of the 10 million Hungarians represented in this Parliament with regard to their rights as European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">There is nothing against Hungary, certainly nothing against the Hungarian people, not even against the Hungarian Government, which was elected at the polls. There is, however, concern for the rights of Hungarians as European citizens, and a need for this Parliament to convey the message that democracy is not just majority rule, but it also concerns the protection of minorities. I refer not just to ethnic and religious minorities, but also to political minorities who have the right to rotation in government.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, democracy also includes an independent judiciary and the power of the Constitutional Court to control the laws made by legislative power; and a judiciary where the way in which cases are assigned is is determined by a judge established by law. Under no circumstances should there be political interference. Citizens should be guaranteed the right to privacy, with authorities who are independent from the government, and the right of information should be expressed through pluralism of information so that there may be a contrast between opinions and democratic principles may be properly developed.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we in this House who are representing 500 million citizens have the right to hear the Hungarian Prime Minister make a commitment to reaffirm those values to which Hungary promised to adhere when it ratified the Treaties of the Union seven years ago.</p>

Nevertheless, we do have serious concerns. I am intending to link my criticisms to specific points, as Mr Weber has called on us to do.</p>
<p class="contents">You said that no one had criticised the constitution. There are now 25 ‘cardinal laws’, which raise some issues to the level of the constitution because a two-thirds majority is required to change them again. One of these is the flat tax. I am a Liberal and I think a flat tax is an excellent idea. However, it is not acceptable to take a tax policy issue out of the political debate and include it in the constitution. This undermines and impairs the citizens’ democratic right to vote, to choose a different government at the next elections and to bring about comprehensive change. Tax law is a question which must stimulate central political debate and democratic disputes. This situation is unacceptable because it undermines democracy and that is why it is so serious.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, you have said, and this was the point which concerned the judicial system, that this is all about the independence of the judiciary and about facts. The Prime Minister has said that he has done everything possible to consolidate the budget. How can he then reduce the retirement age for around 300 judges from 70 to 62? That will cost the state a lot of money. Of course, new judges will have to be appointed to fill the vacancies. That is all well and good. We have our own ideas about who they will be. I think we understand that very well.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago we expressed our criticism of the media law. We were told that the pluralism of the media was not at risk. Now Klubrádió is being closed down. It has already been closed in Budapest and the frequencies are now being shut down in the countryside. Mr Orbán, you have said that you have written a letter to Mr Barroso in order to discuss the situation calmly and objectively. In the BILD newspaper today you explained that you are yielding to power.</p>

<p class="contents">I know quite a few colleagues from the European People’s Party who are very critical of the authoritarian spirit that Mr Orbán and his Fidesz party have been installing in Hungary. There are people who are really afraid in that country, as Mr Daniel Cohn-Bendit has said: be it Jews, be it critical journalists, be it artists, be it lesbians and gays, be it scientists, be it Roma people.</p>
<p class="contents">Why does not anyone in the European People’s Party speak out about that, if they see it as critical and are afraid of this violation of the European spirit, as Mr Barroso has said, and the violation of the common values which many of us – including Mr Orbán – fought for twenty years ago, before the Iron Curtain fell? Why does not any one of you tell Mr Orbán: ‘We are here to debate with you what you have to change in the constitution and the various laws to do away with this authoritarian spirit that so many people in Hungary are afraid of’? And not just the ideological Left; how about conductors like Mr Adam Fischer or cellists like András Schiff? Why do they not want to play again?</p>

You will be welcomed as a Prime Minister who, unlike others such as our own Prime Minister, is not a servant to powerful lobbies, and perhaps this is why you do not have the favour of international finance, given that it seems to want to tie the financial hands of a free Hungary, denying it the support that is provided without question to every other country in difficulty.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is time to say that perhaps our peoples should be the ones to open infringement proceedings against those who, without a popular vote, have devolved their sovereignty to others, have abandoned their sovereignty, starting with monetary sovereignty, and I invite you to defend your country's monetary sovereignty.

It is the first time we have debated infringement proceedings of this nature in this institution and in the presence of the highest European authorities, including no less than the Prime Minister of the country at the centre of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This unprecedented situation calls for us to assume our respective responsibilities, but also to respect each other’s institutional role. This means that we must respect the role of the Commission to start infringement proceedings and we must support it in its decisions. I would like to tell Mr Alvaro that we must also support the Commission if it decides not to start Article 7 proceedings. We must respect that too.</p>
<p class="contents">This means that we must allow time for the matter to be discussed, and hopefully resolved, between the Commission and the Hungarian authorities, and the declaration of Prime Minister Orbán in this sense is very much to be welcomed. But it also means that we must distinguish between the legal process – the due process – and the public political debate. This House can very well express its political views, but this is not a tribunal and it should not replace the legal and judicial process.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore give time for the legal process to take place and hold back from jumping to conclusions until this process, led by the Commission, is completed. Further action on our part at this stage is not just premature, but could also do more harm than good because it would damage the respect that our institution enjoys with the Hungarian people as much as it would damage the image of Hungary.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us support the Commission in its role as the guardian of the Treaties, let the Hungarian authorities rectify all laws that are found to be in breach of EU laws, but let us give the legal process time to run its course. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe is about dialogue, and this is an opportunity for dialogue, even if Mr Orbán stated that he will only bow to power, and not to arguments. I do hope that he will still listen to arguments as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Communications at home are quite contradictory: on one hand, the Government asserts that only minor technical adjustments are necessary, and on the other hand, it claims that it is the lies of an international left-wing conspiracy against which it is up to the Prime Minister to defend Hungary. Hungary, however, does not need to be defended against this criticism, because it is not addressed at Hungary, but at you and your politics, which alienate our partners, isolate the country and worsen Hungary’s possibilities to assert its interests, thereby boosting the premium on our debt and weakening the forint.</p>
<p class="contents">Hungary acceded to the European Union voluntarily and not because it bowed before its power. It agreed with the EU’s values and with democracy. Democracy, social harmony, and a balanced framework for diversity, the peaceful resolution of naturally occurring conflicts and social unity – these are the things it wished for. This is exactly what is wrong with the basic law: it undermines the independence of the institutions that guarantee the peaceful resolution of social conflicts, and it is therefore not a minor mistake but an attempt on democracy to prematurely abolish the office of data protection ombudsman, to remove the impartial and critical President of the Supreme Court from office, and also to restrict the powers of the Constitutional Court, to stigmatise and criminalise the poor, and to exercise government control over the public media. Without democratic checks and balances we are at the risk of a social eruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister, you may have a two-thirds majority in the Hungarian Parliament, but today 84% of people surveyed are of the opinion that things are awry in the country. Today’s debate is also a test of the independence of the public media in Hungary. Will they deliver a balanced report on this debate? I therefore ask Parliament’s media services to monitor the presentation of today’s debate in the Hungarian public media and to compare it with international media reactions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is actually a test for Europe. This is a question that we have to put to ourselves. Are we willing to defend our common values when it really comes down to it, when those values are under pressure? Can the rules that we have laid down in the treaties, in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, in European legislation, actually be enforced? That is the question that we have to answer here today.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Verhofstadt, the leader of our Group, said, this is not about objections to single measures. It is about the accumulated impact of all those measures together, which justifies the activation of the Article 7 procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I am actually quite surprised at the attitude of the EPP Group, because if it is true that all the allegations against the Hungarian Government are lies and invented by the media, then it should embrace the Article 7 procedure as an opportunity to prove them all wrong. I also hope – and here I am looking at the other side of the House – that we will get the support of the Socialist Group for the proposal of the Liberal Group and the Greens to use the Article 7 procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that this debate should not distract from the fact that there are violations in nearly all Member States of the European Union. Just as the debate on Greece was more about exposing the weakness of the eurozone as a whole, the debate today is not about Hungary: it is about the values of Europe, and whether we are willing to defend them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are taking about is improving the governance of the central bank to achieve more transparency and accountability in cooperation with the government.</p>
<p class="contents">The independence of banks should not be misinterpreted as inaccountability, especially in view of their role in recent financial bunga-bungas. We should not serve the corporate interest of bankers. The solidarity of democracy should prevail over the solidarity of banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore I call for cooperation, not an arbitrary confrontation. One special point: in my country, Lithuania, the Eurosceptics always try to compare the unfortunate Soviet Union – which was no union – with our true union of democracies. We European politicians in Lithuania have consistently refused to accept any such mistaken parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it will not be easy to avoid comparisons with 22 years ago when Lithuania adapted her own independent constitution and was pressured by the Kremlin’s ultimatums to denounce it. There then followed political and economic sanctions, a blockade and finally bloodshed.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission was ill advised in using the word ‘sanctions’ when addressing Hungary on its alleged serious infringements. Our suggestions to Hungary should not take the form of diktats from Commission experts, using Parliament as merely a tool to take action against disobedient Member States.

<p class="contents">I have read in detail a series of reports by prominent journalists' organisations and the facts are deeply troubling for the future of independent journalism in Hungary. Media legislation does not meet European standards on media freedom. Recent events should be the concern of every European citizen who believes in democracy, media freedom and fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">How do you explain, Mr Orbán, that in the course of reallocating frequencies, the Media Council, which does not have a single member drawn from the opposition parties, revoked the licence of Klub Radio, one of the few remaining independent radio stations, and that this very council also sets extremely high financial penalties for the media?</p>
<p class="contents">How do you explain the Minister of the Interior’s recent threats to bring criminal charges against a journalist who published a concerning letter from President Barroso on a blog, claiming it is a breach of privacy, and that this journalist could even receive a lengthy prison sentence?</p>
<p class="contents">These facts may present an extremely serious threat to freedom of the media, creating fear and unease among journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I have this information, it does not surprise me that today the Hungarian media have largely reported on yesterday's warnings from the Commission as if they were no big deal. Today's debate shows just the opposite. We expect you to respect democratic values, as we do throughout Europe, and as the Hungarian people deserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, I will say that the policy you are conducting in your country, Prime Minister, will be fatal for democracy. The laws you have passed contradict European values, and the Treaties. Your concept of democracy is nothing more than mathematics. This can only lead to something akin to what history calls the ‘tyranny of the majority’, which of course is a perverse approach to democracy.</p>

It demonstrated this when it took into account the recommendations made by the European Commission regarding the mass media law. I strongly believe that it will demonstrate this again now with regard to the issues raised in the letter it received from the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hungary, just as in other countries, there is discontent; in this case, discontent surrounding the Orbán government, which has had to take tough economic measures that the Hungarian people has had to bear, in order to rectify the major economic imbalances left by the previous administration. I believe that other countries too would have done well to adopt some of these economic measures. I would give the temporary additional tax on banks as an example, a measure which has faced a huge barrage of criticism in the sector press and in other publications and columns. However, it is a just measure in relation to the irresponsible behaviour shown by banks not only in Hungary, but also in other countries, with regard to lending to the general public. Many of the difficulties which these economies are currently faced with are due to this reckless behaviour. I would like to wish the Orbán government every success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, at the same time, it is not a very promising sign that we are examining Hungary’s democratic system for the third time in less than a year. This calls into question not only the developments in Hungary and the wave of populism it is experiencing, but also the general state of some of our European democracies, where democratic debate is in trouble, when it is not over-simplified or biased.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it is crucial for us to ensure that all members taking part in the European project abide by our shared rules, especially considering that we do not fail to call to order a State that is not adhering to our sacrosanct budgetary rules, as is happening at present.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also unacceptable to dismiss the values that must be upheld before finding the golden key to unlock the door to the European Union, and to take it upon oneself to stop upholding them once admitted to the circle. The step taken by the Commission yesterday in initiating infringement proceedings, which in any event is part of its mandate as guardian of the Treaties, must be acknowledged. However, I think we must not content ourselves with simple adjustments to legal aspects, especially if we will soon have to revisit the Hungarian situation from the point of view of social matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We know where Parliament and the Commission stand, therefore, but what about the Council? With a very few exceptions, there is a deafening silence coming from the Council also.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, my greatest hope, although I am not at all sure that this will happen, is that this debate will send a message to the Hungarian people that Europe, through the Members of the European Parliament today, at any rate, is aware of their difficulties and is not neglecting or forgetting them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the last few days, following an ideological turn to the debate, we have in fact seen the European flag being burned in Hungary. This is a mere taste of what can happen when there is no perception of criticism and a desire to go into detail, but it can spark off populist reactions because it tends to divide those who have fought with good reasons, perhaps different from others’, but in any case for freedom, justice and democracy, from those who do not have a democratic approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I now want to propose a very simple solution, which I will call the ‘Schulz solution', because I am referring to the words that you, Mr President, used in the meeting with our group. You said that attempting to cite Article 7 to criticise a government without looking at the issues in detail and simply accepting and listening to the responses of the government itself actually only produces the effect of making it stronger. You mentioned as an example what happened with the government that had Jörg Haider in the coalition in Austria a few years ago. I think your words were sensible. I recognise this, but I do not wish to manipulate what you said. Therefore I am merely restating them here (…) and asking everyone to think carefully about them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It boils down to the fact that the conservative Hungarian Government refuses to respect fundamental democratic ground rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The new laws threaten the independence of a whole series of democratic institutions, far more than those pointed out by the Commission. Social and human rights as well as the independence of the media are also under threat.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate is not a left-leaning conspiracy against Hungary, which is what Mr Orbán is trying to turn it into. Instead, it is about fundamental democratic values that we should all apply right across Europe, including in Hungary. The Hungarian people deserve better than the autocratic behaviour that Mr Orbán’s government is demonstrating.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the strongest pressure for change should be exerted by the governments of the other Member States. Unfortunately, these are almost all now conservative governments of the same ilk. The fact that Europe’s right had not previously dared to criticise Mr Orbán has led to the situation that we are in now. If the right-wing Hungarian Government refuses to listen, I believe that we should introduce sanctions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The elections prior to Mr Orbán’s victory elected a socialist prime minister whose name history has now forgotten; I myself do not even wish to remind you of it. He announced to his parliamentary group, to his citizens, to his co-citizens and to all his European partners that he had told clear lies throughout his election campaign. At that time, I never saw – as far as I know, though I should like to be corrected, if possible – the whole of the left in this House calling for a debate on the situation in the country during that period.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing is certain: Mr Orbán was not new to politics in last year’s elections. He has been in politics for more than 20 years and has already been prime minister before. When the Hungarian people give him a clear two-thirds majority it is because, essentially, they want reforms and it is these reforms that the prime minister is making at the moment.

I would like to say to some speakers that even if a party was really elected by two-thirds of the people entitled to vote, it still has a specific responsibility in a democratic system to ensure that the political minority can present its views in the media and that the political minority is personally represented in the media, in the judiciary and in other areas. This is a principle which lies at the heart of democratic systems and it is a tragedy that this is not happening.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have to hold this debate today, and it is a good thing that we are doing so, is not just a result of the way in which the Hungarian Government is acting. It is also because the Council was not able in the past in the case of Hungary and in other situations to take up a clear position and to put the European values centre stage. It is also the fault of the European Commission, which has so far failed in its role as guardian of the Treaties. In the case of the independence of the judiciary, it is not about checking whether the change in the upper age limit for judges is in line with the anti-discrimination directive, instead we need to evaluate the entire package. Is the assumption justified that in future only members of a certain party will be represented in certain areas?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in the current difficult situation and in order to overcome the major challenges which face us, we need all the Member States and all the citizens of the European Union.

We met in Warsaw and talked not only about how to overthrow Communism; we talked about Europe and about the future, about our future in Europe. We talked about Mr Orbán’s dream that Hungary would become a European state. Hungary is a European state, and, in my opinion, Mr Orbán is a democrat and a European.

With these values we have united Europe and established peace in Europe. We have a particular duty to safeguard these values, especially at a time of crisis when they are placed under particular pressure.</p>
<p class="contents">The developments in Hungary are very worrying at this time in particular. Nationalistic forces with Viktor Orbán at the forefront are threatening to undermine the foundation of the rule of law and break with the threefold division of power. I am therefore extremely pleased that the Commission is now taking Hungary to task over this. The Commission’s criticism is currently directed at the Hungarian Government’s supervision of the national bank, the judiciary and the data authorities. At a time when elsewhere in Europe we are raising the retirement age, Mr Orbán’s government intends to reduce the retirement age for judges – an initiative that critics regard as an attempt to tailor the composition of the Constitutional Court. We must not ignore the fact that there is also discrimination against minorities like the Roma and homosexuals either, nor must we forget the attempts by Mr Orbán’s government to control the press. What about women’s rights? I can assure Mr Orbán that I will keep an eye on the Hungarian abortion legislation in future after reading the new Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">A true democracy includes respect for minorities and allows room for a critical press and an active opposition. Many Hungarians are currently demonstrating against the government’s conduct and by no means approve of its policies. The many citizens who are fighting for democracy and legal certainty in Hungary deserve our solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need only remember what has already been mentioned here, namely the events of the autumn of 2006 in Budapest, which the Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg also deemed a serious violation of freedoms, and yet back then you were not so sensitive about freedoms because it was a Socialist government you would have needed to condemn. This is what I, together with an increasing number of people in Europe, call double standards, and in response to those who bring up the issue of compliance with the accession criteria, well, a great many old Member States would today fail to comply with those criteria, if for nothing else then for the lack of protection afforded by them to minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Twenty years after Hungary’s democratic transition we have finally reached a point where we can set our legal system right and make it European. This is demanded by the present economic situation, and to an even greater extent by the majority of Hungarians, because our fundamental laws were unable to undergo renewal even in a period of 20 years. For all that time judicial decisions took years to be delivered, hundreds of pseudo-churches unrightfully received state subsidies, minorities lacked parliamentary representation, and votes did not carry equal weight due to disproportionalities between electoral districts. You do not agree with some of these legislative provisions and the Commission is expecting amendments on certain points. This is understandable as this is their job, as long as the opinions are based on facts; however, what is not acceptable is that you make judgements on the basis of an unfounded press campaign and press rumours, mention words such as dictatorship and call into question the free democratic rights of Hungarian voters.</p>

This is why I am surprised at my colleagues from the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) who are defending their party position without putting forward too many arguments, rather than the objective European position. The events taking place in Hungary are obviously at odds with European values, but the problem is even bigger than this.</p>
<p class="contents">Other countries, such as Romania and Bulgaria, have similar processes which are perhaps not as extreme, but also do exist. As a result of this, the measures which will be adopted by both the European Commission and European Parliament will be of paramount importance in indicating to anyone wishing to follow this path that this option is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Many examples on this point can be given. The last presidential and local authority elections held in Bulgaria were an example of how democratic elections should not be run. This observation appears in the report from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. It is a fact that the media in Hungary, Bulgaria and Romania are dependent on their governments. It is also a fact in Bulgaria that absolute party pressure is exerted on independent regulators, where staff at all the independent institutions were obliged to submit their resignation and be replaced by faithful party officials.</p>
<p class="contents">Pressure is exerted on the judicial system in these countries as an everyday occurrence. Investors are abandoning these countries not due to the economic risk, but rather to the political risk. These are issues which must be examined in the European Union. They have come about specifically because they conflict with European values. The fact something is legal does not mean that it is just.</p>
<p class="contents">Many governments have gone down the legal route and applied repressive measures, including in Bulgaria’s history. This is why measures must be adopted by both the Commission and Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have been a member of this Parliament for several years, and I challenge anyone to find a precedent to a debate such as this, where two opposing factions are railing against a country. I think that this could constitute a dangerous precedent. I say this to you, Mr President, as yesterday you made a fine speech in which you guaranteed Parliament’s independence and purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">We are committing an outrage against a country’s sovereignty, because the process of European integration is a delicate, judicial and institutional issue in which sovereignty has to merge with a supranational element, and this sovereignty achieved for freedom – and we have all recognised the achievement of Mr Orbán and his country in winning this deserved place in Europe – has not, as Mr Szájer rightly said, allowed us to listen to each other.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been invectives against a country relating to generic and sketchy issues, and to information from the media, some of which, to tell the truth, I did not know about. Mr Orbán has said that there is a constitution, and transitional and provisional laws that will lead to a result which will be difficult but is the one naturally hoped for, because the past, the battles and lack of freedom the country has suffered have put a lot of pressure on civil society, the political forces, democracy, the government and the parliament.</p>

However, this economic crisis cannot be used as an excuse for stirring populism which is detrimental to European democracy because it is precisely this populism which provides the basis on which regimes are formed with obvious discretionary traits.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Hungary, we have expressed on more than one occasion in this House our concern about the restrictions imposed on press freedoms, state institutions, the political opposition and on citizens’ rights. I would like to tell you, Prime Minister, that your extremist rhetoric also poses a threat to stability in the region due to the implications for ethnic coexistence in the neighbouring countries. I would welcome it if Prime Minister Orbán would tell us here today to what extent he approves of and encourages the demands for autonomy which come enthusiastically from members of the political group he belongs to, the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats). We have strived for the last 20 years to join the European Union and create stability in the region. I believe that you, Prime Minister, must continue this work and not reward and offer a platform to those who promote ethnic hatred, because our region, Prime Minister Orbán, cannot be allowed to become the powder keg of Europe again.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the sixth day that mass demonstrations are taking place in dozens of Romanian cities, with thousands of citizens demanding the resignation of the president and of an incompetent, provocative government which repeatedly displays signs of antidemocratic abuse, taking advantage of the European Union’s guilty passive stance.

This makes him to a certain extent a trendsetter and we should use this as an opportunity to invite the governments involved in future treaty infringement proceedings to take part in discussions. This does not have to be in plenary; it could also be in the relevant committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that here we have a government which is open to criticism and which has promised to make changes to rectify the issues that have been identified as being incompatible with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>. It has already done this in the case of the media law. I think it is also important for us to remember how this government’s predecessors behaved. I recall, as other Members may do, the famous pack-of-lies speech made by Mr Gyurcsány. This makes it clear why the response was a two-thirds majority in the elections. Because the people who moved in these circles, as far as I am aware, were always very elegant and eloquent in handling our media and spoke several languages, they were also able to convey a picture of the country which, in my opinion, was a distortion of reality.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the three points, I have a question for the Commission concerning the national bank: When does it become a legal requirement for the central bank to be independent? I thought that had to be the case when a country joined the euro area. This implies that there is no obligation beforehand. Therefore, it is a political question as to whether or not a few structural changes are made on the way to joining. My specific question is therefore as follows: When does this obligation begin?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as the independence of the data protection ombudsman is concerned, I would like to ask the Hungarian Government to compare its rules with those of other European countries. Institutional independence is an important value and this also involves only being able to replace the head of the institution in an exceptional situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I do not have any detailed information about the government’s intentions in reducing the retirement age from 70 to 62. However, I am certain about one thing and that is that a left-wing government with the same intentions would have celebrated this measure as a major socio-political feat and as a means of making way for the younger generation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">‘Orbán’ politics is testing the desire to combat authoritarianism, xenophobia, populism and the suspension of democracy. This model is not unique to Hungary.

This is the fault of Europe’s institutions.</p>

Just a few hours later, the Hungarian Minister replied to this letter by means of a 19-page mail.</p>
<p class="contents">Having read all that, I get the feeling there are two ways of looking at things. However, what is clear is that, as the guardian of the Treaties, how the Commission sees things will prevail in a debate like this. I also note that, in recent days and weeks, the Hungarian Prime Minister, Mr Orbán, and other representatives of Hungary have said that they are ready and willing to comply with the Commission’s verdict and to take part in the infringement proceedings. Objectively speaking, that is what is at stake, and not much else.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the rest, people are behaving as if something very sinister and terrible was going on in Hungary. Why? Because of some appointment or another that might become Central Bank policy. Is this really a massive violation of the human rights of the entire Hungarian population? Although in this case highly political, does the appointment of the data protection supervisor really equate to a violation of human rights of millions of Hungarians? I do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is reason to believe that such problems exist, we need to take a closer look at matters. That is what the Commission is doing. The Commission will tell us what its findings are and we will act accordingly, working alongside it more likely than not. However, acting as we are as if the most sinister totalitarianism were on its way back, under the pretext that some laws do not tally with Community law, this all seems a bit over the top in my opinion and, Mr Cohn-Bendit, you know this too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, however, we finally had the chance to continue the heated debate about Hungary on a democratic footing. Yesterday the Commission specified the three subjects in respect of which it expects the Hungarian Government’s cooperation in legal form as well. In response the Hungarian Prime Minister, demonstrating his commitment to democracy, came here to respond personally to the questions raised. It was up to us, to Parliament, to grow up to this task and to provide a framework and control for this dialogue. Today we therefore had the opportunity to conduct a debate that was about factually based arguments instead of seeking to induce hysteria. However, we seem to have missed this opportunity. Today it was demonstrated that many left-wing Members are more interested in continuing a campaign of accusations reminiscent of show trials than in a rational resolution of disputed matters. Today it once again became clear that the left-wing would rather strew false accusations all over this House than go through the trouble of learning the facts. Today it became apparent that many left-wing Members still hope that the democratic decision made by two-thirds of the Hungarian voters can be overruled in Brussels or in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the left-wing is attacking Hungary’s sovereignty and the popular government of the country, but we would do well to remember that in doing so they do the most damage to the common European idea. The left-wing hopes that it has found a Europe-wide model to weaken the popular model and that it can profit from this, but it is once again mistaken, because in truth what it does serves exclusively to fuel radical parties. Today, when the EU is going through the severest crisis in its history, this is unforgiveable irresponsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But a very similar path is being followed in Romania, and both situations closely resemble the patterns of the Berlusconi era in Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">In Romania we are facing an authoritarian populism that is altering the rule of law, concentrating power in the hands of the President. The mantra of this right-wing populism is the same in all cases. Its leaders believe that, since they won elections, they can do whatever they like with the constitutional structure of their country to tell the majority their mission is accomplished: <span class="italic">‘les jeux sont faits’</span>. Populist leaders everywhere have the same targets: the parliament, the constitutional court, the judiciary, the so-called Leftist press.</p>
<p class="contents">It is outrageous to see a government in Romania using the police and the secret service to intimidate political opponents, restrict civil liberties and falsify elections. At the same time, public television has become an instrument of government propaganda and the Romanian press is considered a threat to national security, like terrorism and organised crime. It is equally outrageous to see political elections in an EU country organised by a body with a military structure like the spatial telecommunications service under the orders of Băsescu.</p>
<p class="contents">Thousands of people are demonstrating in the streets of every Romanian city against their government and to defend their basic rights. We should stand united, using all the instruments we have to counter this threat to the very foundation of our Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are not talking about the economic situation in Hungary. We are also not discussing the previous communist regime in Hungary. We are not talking about either of these things, nor about the financial crisis or other subjects. In fact we are talking about the fact that Hungary, as a member of the EU, has moved away from being a state under the rule of law. That is what this is all about and there is no doubt that Hungary has done away with the values of the European Union using legislation. That is the other factor compared with other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not only the independence of the central bank and of the judiciary which has been abolished. We need to remember that the general right to take legal action has also been removed. The highest judges are no longer the guardians of the constitution. That is scandalous and it primarily affects the individual right to take legal action. All of these things represent a violation of EU values. The only question which we need to discuss today is: What are we doing? In contrast to other speakers, I am not calling for treaty infringement proceedings to be instituted, as the Commission wants. Instead, I would like to see Article 7 applied, because this situation involves a clear risk of a serious breach of the fundamental values of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, some have continued to protest, showing that they are in bad faith, have no interest in hearing what you have to say, and are motivated by ideological reasons alone. It is no coincidence that those protesting today are the children and grandchildren of the regime which in 1949 imposed the constitution that you and your government have finally removed. Perhaps even here there are those who miss it.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also learned that one of the problems some Members are concerned about is the retirement age of judges in Hungary. Should we have a special session on this? Should we look at the retirement age for judges in all the Member States? The logical consequence of this is that we should apply the penalties of Article 7 to countries where they retire before the age of 62, whereas countries where they retire after the age of 62 are democratic.

This was preceded by the granting of Hungarian citizenship to minorities, but this would not be out of the ordinary if the Hungarian citizenship were granted on the basis of someone’s permanent residency, family ties or work in the country. But the citizenship is granted on the basis of a purely ethnic principle, and this ethnic principle is causing destabilisation across the region. I firmly believe that the Commission, too, will soon have a problem with this. I am surprised that my colleagues from the EPP have not noticed this, because it is an atmosphere of nationalism that is prevailing in Hungary today, and it is a nationalism that is fixated on the past, on the 19th century, rather than dealing with matters in a positive way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the current Polish Government is so enthusiastically inclined toward the Union’s institutions, the Commission simply turns a blind eye to discriminatory practises even though they violate fundamental values of the European Union.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Vice-President of the Commission. </span>− <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, honourable Members, we have just had a lengthy debate on the situation in Hungary and in Europe. As is generally the case in parliamentary debate, a number of different views have been expressed. I am sure, however, that we do all agree on one thing: we all want Hungarian legislation to be in harmony with the European Treaties and laws as well as the values that they convey.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that the Commission has acted, focusing objectively, independently and responsibly on its own powers, in accordance with its quasi-judicial role and its role as guardian of the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Having adopted this approach after lengthy discussions with political leaders last year and the year before, the Commission decided to initiate three infringement proceedings, using a fast-track procedure, based on the Treaties, European legislation and the case law of the Court. In addition to these three demands, there has also been a preliminary letter of formal notice relating to the independence of the judiciary. I have taken note of several questions on this matter and I would like to tell you on what basis this letter was sent.</p>
<p class="contents">An independent judiciary is vital for implementing the Union’s law. According to the principle of effective jurisdictional protection, every citizen has the right to an effective remedy before an independent court. This is a general principle of EU law, which is also regularly used in the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Given its importance, this principle was enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and it is for this reason that the Commission wants to know, among other things, whether or not certain provisions of the new Hungarian law on the organisation and administration of courts, and the premature termination of office of the President of the former Supreme Court, affect the independence of the judiciary</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there has also been a lot of questions regarding media freedom. You will be aware that Ms Kroes, the Vice-President of the Commission, who has great concerns about this issue, is acting within the limits of her powers. Just yesterday, Ms Kroes sent a new letter to the Hungarian Government on the matter of media freedom. She reminded it of our European rules and asked the Hungarian Government to work towards this.</p>
<p class="contents">One third and final matter – and I think this is also really important for the future work of Parliament – is the speech made by M Jagland, the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, regarding that institution’s areas of jurisdiction: electoral law, religious freedom, the independence of the judiciary, freedom of press. It might be worth working with the Council of Europe on areas within its jurisdiction. Mr Jagland also proposed referring the whole matter to the Venice Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where we are up to. We now need to get to work on these issues. This morning, my staff was contacted by the Office of the Hungarian Minister of Justice. Without delaying further, we are going to get round the table and discuss specific texts. We also know that, next Tuesday, the Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, will meet the President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, to discuss the letter and spirit of Hungarian legislation in relation to EU rules.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have said many times, the ball is in the court of the Hungarian Government. Rapid changes would be in the interests of Hungarian citizens and the European Union. The only thing I can say then is ‘let’s get to work and sort things out!’</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with a quote from President Barroso, which perfectly sums up how we must continue our work: </p>
<p class="contents">‘I believe we have to be absolutely clear on the values, firm on the principles, fair on the method and sensible on the communication’. </p>

Many important issues were raised during this important debate. As President-in-Office of the Council, I have taken note of all your comments and concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The line of the Presidency remains the same: all Member States must comply with EU law. The question is now how to ensure that Hungary’s legislation is in accordance with Community law and principles in a process that is as fair and effective as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said to begin with, the concerns about the developments in Hungary must be treated with the seriousness that the situation deserves. I am convinced that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, will fulfil its role. The Presidency strongly supports the work done by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also my clear expectation that the Hungarian Government will ensure that the legislation recently adopted complies with EU law, and I welcome the statement by Prime Minister Orbán today that the issues at hand will shortly be resolved. The Presidency is looking forward to that happening in the interests of Hungary and in the interests of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I wish to express my thanks for the support of those of you who stood up for Hungary and spoke as its friends.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to assure Mr Swoboda, who in his speech expressed his concerns about a Hungarian political ‘crop rotation,’ that I spent 15 of the last 20 years in opposition. Earlier I had been in government for four years, then I lost, and now I am head of government once again. You can rest assured that if there is one person in Europe who is in favour of political competition then it is me, and in this you can always count on me.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to Mr Verhofstadt I must say that the statement he read out was accurate, but there is one fact he omitted at the end. It is true that the statement was written by former anti-communist dissidents, but the fact he omitted is an important one. These people were members of the leading committee of the liberal party, and were therefore partisan, and the party in which they worked has lost the trust of the Hungarian people to such an extent that at the last elections they did not even reach the five per cent threshold required to make it into parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, due to the lateness of the hour allow me to forgo correcting every one of the unfortunately numerous factual mistakes that were made, and I therefore only ask those who made comments and criticised or accused Hungary and the Hungarian Constitution to please be so kind as to read that constitution. It is an exceptionally valuable document and one can find several novel things in it. The protection of minorities, the protection of sign languages, environmental protection, opposition to GMOs – these are all things that I believe are worthy of consideration by any European country.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I also had the impression that this debate, which was about Hungary, had a European aspect as well, and was an ideological debate of sorts. People like me, and our political community, must accept that unfortunately the ideals we represent do not enjoy majority support in this House either. Our ideals are undoubtedly Christian and based on personal responsibility; we find national sentiment to be an important and positive thing, and we believe that families are the foundations of the future. It may be that a great many people believe otherwise, but that makes our position no less a European one. It may be that with this we are in a minority in Europe, but this position is no less a European position, and we are free to represent this conviction. You may disagree with what I will quote now, but I personally profess Schumann’s view that there will either be a Christian democracy in Europe or there will be no democracy at all. This, ladies and gentlemen, is a European position.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards concrete details, allow me to avoid having the same debate here that we will have to conduct with the Commission on the specifics. I would only like to mention two concrete points here. We have no conflict with the Commission over the independence of the judiciary. The retirement age of judges is not a matter of the justice system but of the new pension system. Hungary was ruined by an unmanageable pension system riddled with exceptions, and we therefore made the decision to introduce a single and general age limit for civil servants. We raised the age limit of police and military personnel, as theirs was below the new limit, whereas we lowered that of others, and to us this is therefore not a matter of the justice system but a matter of the pension system, and we will gladly consider the position of the Commission. We are ready to accept all the comments made in respect of the independence of the National Bank but one. At this point there remains only one point in this matter where we are in sharp conflict with the Commission. The Commission is asking us to refrain from having the President of the National Bank and the members of the Monetary Council swear an oath before parliament and on the constitution. I suggest that we think this over. Other than that, it seems to me that we are of the same opinion in all matters. Whether we will need to concede on this latter issue – I ask that we leave that discussion to another time.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the old and the new constitution, ladies and gentlemen, I would only like to point out that the old constitution was incapable of protecting the country’s assets, and plunged the Hungarian people up to their necks in future debt. It failed to protect competition, which resulted in the Hungarian economy being ruled by monopolies and cartels. The previous constitution failed to protect the environment, which as a result decayed and deteriorated, and the previous constitution also failed to protect civil liberties, as it did not protect civilians against the arbitrary use of police force and allowed paramilitary organisations to keep minority groups in fear. The new constitution remedies all these deficiencies, and I am convinced that it does a good job at remedying them.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, allow me one last comment. We Hungarians believe that what makes Europe Europe is its culture. In our view the foundations of European culture are goodwill and benevolence. There have always been and there always will be disputes in Europe, but as long as the arguments in these debates are specific, reasonable and sober, and as long as we assume the other party’s good intentions we will always be able to find a way to resolve these disputes. It grieves me that in today’s debate I was on many occasions presented not with arguments and concrete facts, but with absurd factual errors, vehemence, rage and prejudice. I am convinced that accusations made without knowledge of the laws under discussion are unbecoming Europe, as are judgements motivated not by common sense and objectivity but partisan rage and vehemence. We Hungarians, and I myself, believe in these principles, and it is these principles that guided us to the European Union, and we ask everyone to return to the European way of resolving disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Hungary was, is and will be a land of freedom fighters. As a 1 000-year-old European nation we expect everyone to show us the respect and European manners that we accord to all nations. Should any of you have doubts, feel free to visit Hungary, acquaint yourselves with us; acquaint yourselves with the Hungarian people. Thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Please allow me to give you some information. It is certainly correct that Christianity has a place in your country, in your constitution and in Europe. However, as a Catholic and, at the same time, as President of a multireligious, multiethnic, multinational assembly of parliamentarians, I would like to say one thing to you. Europe is either Christian or it is not. That is as it may be. However, it is quite clear that Europe must be pluralist or else it will fail. I believe that it is important to explain this in a House of this kind.</p>

<p class="contents">I would like to make a few brief comments. I am pleased that you are prepared to admit, at least to a certain extent, that you have made mistakes and that some of your laws need to be amended. The laws which require amendment are important ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, why are we occupying ourselves with the subject of Hungary? Because we love Hungary, we love the people who live there and it is an important country. You underestimate this. You underestimate the importance of Hungary and of the development of Hungary for democracy. That is the decisive issue. We are not criticising Hungary, but your policy. The President of this House has already said this and I would put it even more strongly: do not misuse religion for political purposes. Whatever our religious conviction is, we combine religion with tolerance. Religion without tolerance is not acceptable, whether it is Islam or a Christian religion. This is the decisive factor.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you spoke about the family. We all belong to families. As you are well aware, my family comes partly from Hungary and partly from the Czech Republic. Therefore, my family is Europe. I would be pleased if you could recognise that your family is also Europe. This is how it should be. The family of the Hungarian Prime Minister should be Europe. That is what I am fighting for in this Chamber and what we are fighting for in Europe.</p>

It is not a disease being a liberal, Mr Orbán, as you would suggest. You yourself were a liberal, for a long time, before becoming a nationalist when you started supporting other views. I do hope that Mr Konrad is a liberal. I hope that Mr Kenedi is a liberal, he is a great historian. These three characters are great Hungarians. There is no need to start saying that because they are liberals, what they say is bound to be partisan. I have not heard one single argument against everything that has been said today. The only argument was about the 62-year old rule: ‘Pension costs are too high and that is why the pension age is being lowered’. That is the argument put forward today. In other words, no argument.</p>
<p class="contents">What really is important is what the Commission said, because, if I understand it right, Commissioner, other infringement proceedings may be brought, as well as the current three. If the letter does not receive a satisfactory reply, the Commission will go one step further than three infringement proceedings.

You may believe that we have a negative attitude to Hungary, but that is not the case. Do you believe that I would have risked my life and my freedom to help illegally in the fight against the communists and to bring information sheets to Hungary out of hatred towards Hungary? There is no country in the world which is populated only by freedom fighters. Not France and not Germany, Italy or Hungary.

It has not been clearly shown which provisions of the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights have been violated by Hungary, or which precise provision of Hungarian law should be censured. Only the Commission has indicated three more precise areas for investigation. I believe that in this regard we need to have faith in the Commission and in the Hungarian Government and Parliament. However, there is an underlying issue that needs to be brought to light. Attacks continue to be made on the Hungarian Constitution, but no one has the courage to indicate the real reasons why a certain European radical left-wing is supporting a campaign of denigration against a country which has great merit in the fight for democracy and freedom. What is disturbing about the Hungarian Constitution is the reference to Christian roots, recognition of human dignity from the moment of conception, and statement that the family is a natural state based on marriage between a man and a woman. I do not believe that these three aspects conflict with European values. In fact they are an exemplary description of the foundations of such values, which should be taken as a model by all of European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The not-too-distant past has shown us the danger that arises when these two factors come together: poverty caused by recession and nationalist tendencies. European history still bears the burden of totalitarian regimes whose actions recklessly crushed people’s destinies. The European project, founded on democracy, the rule of law and the protection of fundamental rights, is being undermined in Hungary by the recent decisions adopted by the government to amend the constitution arbitrarily. A state which claims to be democratic cannot curb fundamental freedoms, cannot gag the press and cannot restrict the independence of the central bank. Unfortunately, Hungary is not the only state where the government is violating citizens’ rights. In Romania, thousands of people are currently out in the streets protesting against the abuses and incompetence of the Băsescu regime and to protect their constitutional right to elect their leaders by a free vote during early elections, at a time when the current government no longer represents them. It is the European institutions’ duty to punish such abuses severely to avoid history repeating itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hungary’s case is not unique in the European Union, yet we are treated with increased attention whatever we may do. The debate has shown quite well that left-wing speakers are rather lacking in terms of factual accuracy, which, however, does not seem to disturb even their leading orators. It is a fact that over the past two years there has been a reform in my country of such a magnitude that it should have been undertaken already at the time of Hungary’s democratic transition. This is exactly what the voters authorised the Government to do. I can sympathise with those who have suffered grievances, but the methods through which they seek recompense are unacceptable to me. If I recall correctly, when we acceded to the European Union we did not choose to completely surrender our country’s sovereignty in all matters, but to fulfil our jointly undertaken commitments. I indicated already during the debate on the presentation of the Danish Presidency programme that putting Hungary in a pillory will not bring about a satisfactory resolution of the euro area debt crisis. If we were to spend as much time on crisis management or the protection of the euro as we are spending on Hungary, we may already have succeeded in resolving our problems. It is unbecoming that in this period of European crisis we are looking for scapegoats and in the meantime divert attention from the fact that another intergovernmental agreement is about to be concluded in complete disregard for the Community method. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They wanted a democratic state sharing European values. Unfortunately, Hungary is not heading in this direction and is not alone in this in Eastern Europe. The argument for reforms in Hungary revolves around the new constitution. The fundamental law was amended after 1989, marking an almost radical move away from the 1949 version. The argument that this constitution needed to be changed because it was Stalinist does not stack up in this context. Hungary is going through major changes. It is not possible to talk about reform when democratic principles are being violated. A series of laws have been adopted, targeting the whole judicial system and the independence of the central bank. They are moving Hungary away from European values. Similar scenarios can also be encountered in Romania and Bulgaria. In times of crisis, populist arguments which actually provide the basis for such governments cannot be accepted. I have said it before and will repeat it: regimes that move away from democracy must be brought up for discussion at European level. Romanians, Bulgarians and Hungarians must be protected from politicians of the likes of Orbán, Băsescu or Borisov. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the only Roma Member of the EP, I firmly reject such accusations and I would like to remind everyone that Fidesz was the only European party to send a Roma MEP to the European Parliament and three Roma representatives to the Hungarian Parliament. The government prioritised developing an EU-level strategy for Roma inclusion, the successful adoption of which was appreciated by the vast majority of this House. Prime Minister Orbán signed an unprecedented cooperation agreement with the National Roma Self-Government, presenting quantified and clear targets, and Hungary was the first to submit to the Commission its comprehensive national strategy for Roma inclusion. I was therefore astonished that some of my fellow MEPs stated without the slightest evidence that Hungarian Roma are afraid. There is of course a significant anti-Roma sentiment throughout Europe, but to blame it on a government that has been in office for less than two years is another example of the political misuse and abuse of the Roma issue, which I firmly reject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, not all the provisions included in the new constitution clearly comply with Europe’s principles. The independence of the central bank is one of these fundamental principles. I am convinced that the procedure begun by the Commission will lead to legal clarity on this issue. I welcome the fact that Viktor Orbán, Hungary’s prime minister, has found time to visit the European Parliament in person and discuss the new constitution with MEPs.

What is the reason for a Central European EU Member State whose conservative government successfully filled the EU’s Presidency last year becoming so important? I find the barrage that has been levelled at Hungary for some time now unacceptable from a political and even from an ethical standpoint. The unfounded and overly politically motivated accusations directed by this House at the Hungarian Government should be rejected. In the present economic and social situation which is marked by a crisis the EU should offer support and a reliable background to its own Member States. It is therefore inappropriate to launch political attacks against a Member State that has come to be in a difficult economic situation. Hungary has undertaken to comply with the legislative amendments urged by the European Commission, because it considers respect for EU values and the Community legal order to be essential. It is only those who do not know the country and its leaders who call this fact into question. The oft-mentioned principle of solidarity should apply to all Member States equally. The use of double standards should be condemned in all such cases. A significant majority of Hungarian voters support the right-wing conservative government to this day. The left-wing and liberal media, engaged in an unprecedented campaign against the Hungarian civic state, remain silent about this, and also for example about the peace marches organised in support of the government. An equitable judgement – this is what the seasoned democracy of Hungary deserves and expects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Weakening the independence of a central bank may breach the provisions of Article 130 of the TFUE, which provide that when performing their duties, central banks shall not receive instructions from governments of Member States, and these in turn agree not to influence members of the former’s governing bodies. However, we must not forget that the EU is a community of sovereign states, which have the right to self-determination within the limits of the commitments made in the Treaties. In case of doubt concerning the compatibility of national legislation with the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, there is a procedure according to which a Member State may submit its interpretation. We should appreciate the open communications strategy of Prime Minister Orbán and his willingness to listen to the arguments of the European institutions. The main focus of our recent discussions has been the debt crisis, but we must not forget about the values upon which the European Community was built. In this context, attention should be drawn to the fact that while some so vigorously criticise Hungary for violating the Treaties, at the same time we are dealing with attempts to undermine the primacy of European law through intergovernmental agreement, and there is no similar debate regarding this issue, even though objectively it is equally important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One can always find one-sided justifications for different measures that the government is taking and the methods it is pursuing, but at the moment these justifications do not reflect the democratic values that we stand for as Europeans. It seems that Mr Orbán has forgotten that democracy is not only the rule of the majority, but also the respect and protection of the minority. It is also important to understand that Hungary, as a Member State, has an obligation to follow the principles enshrined in the Treaty of the European Union and thus have its legislation adhere to the TEU, the TFEU and other international treaties and obligations. I sincerely hope that Mr Orbán can comprehend our reservations and will act accordingly to re-route Hungary away from becoming an autocratic country and back onto the track of democracy.

Viktor Orbán once fought against communist totalitarianism; Hungary is now part of the Union and there are fundamental values to be respected. The European Union fights for democracy and human rights worldwide. What is the logic in supporting the Arab revolutions, on the one hand, while allowing a Member State to undermine its own democracy.

Nor is there much evidence of moderation or reason in what is being marshalled against Hungary; it adds up mostly to wild exaggeration and hyperbole. But this campaign, this onslaught against Hungary is not without its unintended consequences. Opinion in Hungary does not recognise itself in the distorting mirror and it resents what it does see.

The Commission gave Hungary one month to implement changes. The procedure initiated by the Commission concerns only part of the problem with which Hungary is struggling, and includes breach of European legal provisions. In addition, the Hungarian democracy has a clear problem relating to respect for minorities, rights guaranteed to the opposition, and media pluralism. I am grateful to Hungarian society for so vocally expressing its views and opinions, and sometimes criticism, which I listen to attentively. It is not possible to ‘bind’ matters of public debate, such as tax policies, by basic law, even if they are the best solutions. The public has a right to seek changes in relation to such matters. Democracy is the rule of the majority, but minorities must also be respected, and therefore we should all take a close look at the Magyars and put pressure on their rulers to go back on these changes, which are harmful to democracy.

The Prime Minister of Hungary should not have to act as an advocate of his country, which has been put in a pillory, but should be among us as a guest of honour of the European Parliament. However, I am convinced that not so far from now there will come a time when, as Havel, he too will be greeted in accordance with his merits as a prominent personage of the Hungarian democratic transition. Those who are trying to put Hungary and the head of its government, Viktor Orbán, on a wall of shame, have no idea about the period and nature of the fight against the communists who clawed their way back into power twice after 1994. It is, first of all, Viktor Orbán and his <span class="italic">Fidesz</span> Party to whom the imperishable merit for rising up from a defeated position and making the communists fall once and for all in an act comparable to a second change of regime belongs. In today’s Hungary the post-communist regime that was vetoed by a two-thirds majority of Hungarian voters continues its rear-guard struggle against the national public will and seeks to make the efforts of a democratically elected Orbán Government impossible in both the internal and the foreign political arena. I am quite familiar with the anatomy of counter-revolutionary communist restoration from Romania’s case. It is an indication of the maladjusted condition and moral crisis of the European Union, which is beset by a complex crisis, that instead of far-reaching solidarity and support it exposes a Hungary ruined by socialists and pseudo-liberals to infringement procedures and undeserved prosecution. I am worried for Europe, and I am worried for Hungary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
