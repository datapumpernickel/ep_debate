As regards the possibility of financing the costs of prevention and treatment, the Council is examining, in the frame of the Financial Framework 2007-2013, a Commission proposal for a new EU Solidarity Fund Regulation. The proposal includes the possibility of contributing towards the costs incurred by actual expenditures in the event of a pandemic under certain conditions, including the costs of vaccines and antivirals.

Its implementation is largely a national responsibility with the European Commission monitoring progress and reporting regularly to the European Parliament and the Council on developments throughout the Union, while encouraging in a wide range of related areas the necessary conditions for SMEs to fulfil their vital role in the relaunched Lisbon process, namely the creation of jobs and more growth. For example, to complement the Charter, the Entrepreneurship Action Plan addresses a wider range of entrepreneurship-related issues to promote entrepreneurship across Europe.</p>
<p>During the UK Presidency, several of the main policy priorities are of immediate relevance to the implementation of the Charter and will assist in driving it forward. Economic reform initiatives include implementing the recommendations of the Sapir and Kok reports; promoting the knowledge society; strengthening the Internal Market; improving the business climate; and supporting national labour market reforms foreseen in the Lisbon Strategy. Better regulation activities include delivery of the Commission’s Better Regulation Agenda of March 2005; stronger impact assessments on new EU legislation, increased business input into the legislative process and simplification of legislation.</p>
<p>Many of the key legislative dossiers currently under debate will have a strong impact on small enterprises: in particular the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research (FP 7), Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), access to finances under the Basel-II agreement, to name but a few.</p>
<p>Moreover, the meeting of the Competitiveness Council in October 2005 will address entrepreneurship issues including a new initiative on the Centres of Enterprise competition, the Commission’s communication on entrepreneurship education and learning, and industrial policy issues. The November meeting of the Competitiveness Council will address other areas of direct relevance to the Charter, namely CIP and FP 7.</p>
<p>In addition, the UK Presidency is organising several major events of special importance for small enterprises, such as the High Performance Workplaces Conference, the Risk Capital Conference, and the Social Dialogue Conference. (For information on these events, the Honourable Member is referred to the UK Presidency Homepage http://www.eu2005.gov.uk.).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0601"></a>

<p>The EU and its Member States are working actively to counter the greenhouse effect and the resultant climate change. That is to be welcomed, but regrettably we also need to increase our preparedness for the climate change which we know will come about. The effects of climate change will include greater numbers of fires and floods. The number of diseases - for example malaria - is expected to increase too. New preconditions will probably apply to handling of food: for example, it is thought that problems connected with salmonella will worsen.</p>

<p>(EN)The Council shares the Honourable Member's view that there are several challenges to be met when addressing climate change, its likely impacts and vulnerabilities as well as ways and means of addressing those impacts and enhancing adaptive capacities.</p>
<p>Determined and consistent mitigation efforts are required to keep the requirements for adaptation at a manageable level. In fact, planned adaptation is more cost-effective than reactive stand-alone adaptation and this can often be achieved through integration of adaptation aspects into planning and implementation of sectoral actions. Reducing vulnerability and strengthening adaptive capacity is best achieved through general development efforts.</p>
<p>However, the EU has envisaged a need to enhance adaptation efforts through some specific actions by the international community; such actions could be aimed at increasing awareness of adaptation requirements, strengthening the international and national knowledge base and disseminating this knowledge. The resources available for specific adaptation actions will be limited and as such should be used wisely in an enabling and catalytic way.</p>
<p>The UNFCCC is the framework for international efforts to tackle the problem of climate change and, in practical terms, it should promote wide understanding of climate change, its impacts and responses. Efforts to mobilize additional adaptation funding should be largely focused on mainstreaming adaptation aspects into general development funding and on mechanisms outside the UNFCCC purview.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0625"></a>

<p>The plan of action adopted by the G8 leaders identifies a range of activities to promote research, information exchange, and cooperation on energy efficiency, renewable and other clean energy sources, adaptation to climate change and illegal logging.</p>
<p>The aim of the G8 is to build a political momentum that in the wide range of public, private, local, national and international bodies that must align their efforts if the world is to keep a stable climate. The action plan sets no specific targets and commits no new funding. Those discussions will take place inside a properly constructed and legitimate multilateral forum.</p>
<p>At Community level, significant progress has already been made over the past year and is under way in areas identified in the G8 communiqué, as well as in several others, in terms of the adoption and implementation of a number of key common and coordinated policies and measures. Examples are the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the Directive linking project-based mechanisms to greenhouse gas emissions trading, the Council Decision for monitoring Community greenhouse gas emissions, the Directives on the promotion of electricity from renewable energy sources, and on co-generation, the Directive on bio-fuels, the Directive on the energy performance of buildings, the proposal for a Regulation on fluorinated gases, the proposal for a framework Directive on eco-efficiency requirements for energy-using products, the proposal for a Directive on energy end-use efficiency and energy services.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the European Union will actively participate in the first meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol in Montreal, in conjunction with the eleventh session of the Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change Convention, at the end of this year, aiming to build the widest possible international consensus on the issue of combating climate change.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0608"></a>

<p>(EN)The Council recognises that trade liberalisation in itself is not sufficient to combat poverty in developing countries. In order to achieve economic growth, sustainable development and poverty reduction, trade and development policies need to be better integrated through the development of national poverty reduction strategies. Coherence in the interventions of multilateral organisations, working in partnership with other donors and developing countries is essential to ensure more effective poverty reduction.</p>
<p>In November 2002 the Council adopted conclusions on the Communication on Trade and Development, and in may 2005 the Council adopted Conclusions on the EU contribution to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) where it reiterated its firm commitment to provide support to developing countries to enable them to seize trading opportunities, in particular by assisting them in integrating trade into their national development strategies and securing the necessary domestic reforms.</p>
<p>In fact, financial support for trade-related assistance has been stepped up since the Doha Ministerial Meeting of November 2001. Total commitments over the period 2001/03 have reached € 2 billion. Special attention has been devoted to the improvement of developing countries’ capacities in the field of sanitary and phytosanitary requirements. Another focal area has been to improve the negotiating capacity and the ability of developing countries to formulate and implement coherent trade policies, to engage in the negotiation of Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs) and to participate in the WTO work, in line with the EU’s commitments at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002.</p>
<p>In the light of the efforts to simplify the Community's instruments regarding External Relations, however, it is unlikely that an additional dedicated budget line would be useful. Aid for trade facilitation needs to continue to be integrated fully into Community country programmes, agreed with recipient countries, within the relevant external assistance Instruments (e.g, Neighbourhood Partnerships and Development Co-operation).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0611"></a>

<p>In their Declaration on the Ratification of the Constitutional Treaty, the Heads of State or Government underlined the validity of continuing with the ratification processes. At the same time, they agreed to include a period of reflection that will enable a broad debate to take place in each of the Member States, involving citizens, civil society, social partners, national parliaments and political parties. They considered that in this debate the European institutions will also have to make their contribution, with the Commission playing a special role in this regard. The results of this reflection will form part of an overall assessment of the situation by Heads of State or Government in the first half of 2006. The Heads of State or Government also decided that the timetable for the ratification in different Member States would be altered if necessary in response to the recent developments and according to the circumstances in the Member States.</p>

<p>(EN)From the locust crisis in 2004, the European Union and its member states has been actively contributing to palliate the famine in the Niger Basin. EU aid has been offered through Community and Member State contributions. In September 2004, the Commission channelled € 25.5 million through the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) for the anti-locust campaign in Senegal, Chad, Mauritania, Mali and Niger. Following the United Nations appeal in May 2005, the EC launched a € 4.6 million emergency decision for Niger together with a € 2 million decision for Mali, which had already received a 1.2 million package for food security operations. In early July, the Commission launched a second humanitarian decision for Niger, in the amount of € 1.7 million to support the food distribution efforts of the World Food Programme targeting the most vulnerable populations. Member States have also offered substantial contributions to palliate the food crisis in the region. In late July, the Commission’s humanitarian aid department sent an assessment team to Niger to evaluate the situation in the light of the operations already ongoing, and to facilitate coordination among all humanitarian actors, whether or not they are being financed by the European Commission.

<p>(EN)The Presidency of the Council convened an extraordinary Justice and Home Affairs Council on 13 July 2005 in response to the London bombings. This led to the adoption of a Declaration in which the Council condemned the terrorist attacks on London. Besides strengthening its commitment to combating terrorism, the Council Declaration also gives immediate priority to building on the existing strong EU framework for pursuing and investigating terrorists across borders, in order to impede terrorists' planning, disrupt support networks, cut off any funding and bring terrorists to justice.</p>
<p>Among the various actions/measures mentioned in the Declaration, those concerning the financing of terrorism are considered to be priorities. The most important is the formal adoption of the Third Money Laundering Directive, which is scheduled for later this month. This Directive will be extended in scope to cover not only money laundering but also terrorist financing, and will in addition be widened to include certain persons, institutions and activities currently excluded. Another important tool is the Regulation on controls of cash entering or leaving the Community, which will enter into force shortly. The Regulation aims at supplementing the Third Money Laundering Directive by providing a common system for cash controls at the EU's external borders. Finally, the Commission has recently presented a proposal for a Regulation on wire transfers ensuring full traceability of all international wire transfers. In order to avoid unintended and undesirable consequences of constantly stricter and more comprehensive CFT measures, all three legal acts have thresholds to avoid unnecessary interference with legitimate small-scale transactions. Moreover, the Third Money Laundering Directive is based on a risk-sensitive approach allowing authorities to adapt their efforts to the level of risk, thereby not only avoiding overloading the administrative system with low-risk cases but also protecting the right of citizens and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to carry out their legitimate business in a competitive environment.</p>
<p>Member States are committed to the speedy adoption of the above-mentioned legislation and to implementing it in their national framework as soon as possible, and in any case within the given deadline. The Presidency also intends to make the funding of terrorism one of the main topics for discussion at an informal meeting of the Finance Ministers later this month and may subsequently take additional initiatives. The Council will continue to assess whether further measures at the European level are necessary and will present a enhanced Action Plan for combating terrorism to the December European Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0636"></a>

<p>(EN)On several occasions in recent years, the Council has reiterated the strong commitment of the European Union to the fight against terrorism. The serious terrorist attacks which occurred in 2001 in the US, in 2004 in Madrid and last July in London have put these concerns at the top of the political agenda.</p>
<p>As regards the Joint Investigations Teams, only a few investigative teams have been set up to date. In 2003, in order to facilitate the use of the Joint Investigation Teams, the Council adopted a Recommendation on a model agreement, intended as a comprehensive but flexible model adaptable to the particular circumstances of each case.</p>
<p>In July 2005, the UK Presidency suggested and Member States approved the proposal for the designation of national experts on Joint Investigation Teams in each Member State. The initiative creates a network of national expert contact points for the purpose of sharing best practices and giving advice on the practical and legal matters. They should facilitate the work of police and judicial authorities in the setting up of Joint Investigation Teams. A first meeting of those experts will be hosted by Eurojust and Europol in November 2005. In addition, the Presidency has asked for Member States to submit information to them concerning Joint Investigation Teams that have been established up to now so all can have a clearer sense of how the Framework Decision is being operated.</p>
<p>To facilitate the exchange of information between all law enforcement authorities, the Council is considering a Swedish legislative initiative of June 2004 on serious offences, including terrorist acts.</p>
<p>The Council has set out its intention to reach an agreement on it by December 2005.</p>
<p>The Council also agreed in its Declaration of 13 July 2005 to adopt by September 2005 the Decision on the exchange of information and cooperation concerning terrorist offences. That Decision will repeal Decision 2003/48/JHA of 19 December 2002 by extending the scope of exchanges of information to all stages of criminal proceedings, including convictions, and to all individuals, groups or entities investigated or prosecuted for, or convicted of, terrorist offences.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0638"></a>

<p>First inconsistency - in the White Paper entitled 'Prospects for the EU in 2005', the UK states that the financial perspective must cover the needs of the new Member States. In its document entitled 'Financial Perspective - Why 1% is not realistic', the Commission explains that 1% of GDP entails a huge cutback in funding for Bulgaria and Romania as well as for the full integration of the 10 new Member States. Nor will the 1% enable an agreement to be reached to ensure financial balance between the 25. Second inconsistency - the strengthening of competitiveness urged by the UK Presidency is incompatible with its 1% proposal.</p>

<p>In the light of the recent events in London, where four British-born young men were ready to carry out a suicide terror attack, we should ask ourselves what led to this and what kind of brain-washing incitement was influencing those individuals and communities.

It is to be hoped that, by the time this question is discussed, the French Globecast (providing the feed - via an up-link in Europe, and thus falling under the jurisdiction of Article 22a of the Television Without Frontiers Directive) will have done the same.

<p>(EN)As the Honourable Parliamentarian is certainly aware, at its heart, the Lisbon strategy promotes the idea of a positive interaction between economic, employment and social policies. It aims at promoting a model of sustainable development for the Union which raises the standard of living of all European citizens by combining economic growth with a strong emphasis on social cohesion and the preservation of the environment. In so doing, it stresses the need to improve EU level coordination mechanisms in order to foster consistent and mutually reinforcing policies in the economic, employment and social areas.</p>
<p>While robust economic and employment growth is a vital precondition for the sustainability of social protection systems, progress in achieving higher levels of social cohesion is, together with effective education and training systems, a key factor in promoting growth.</p>
<p>In this context, the latest Joint Commission and Council report on social protection and inclusion, in the framework of the application of the open method of co-ordination (OMC), stresses that the measures taken by Member States mainly aim at preventing early departure from formal education and training, facilitating the transition from school to work, in particular of school leavers with low qualifications, increasing access to education and training for disadvantaged groups and integrating them into mainstream provision and promoting lifelong learning, including e-learning, for all. Many recognise the need to invest more, and more efficiently, in human capital at all ages.</p>
<p>Eliminating child poverty is also seen as a key step in combating the intergenerational inheritance of poverty. Particular focus is given to early intervention and early education in support of disadvantaged children and enhancing income support and assistance to families and single parents. Several countries also put increasing emphasis on promoting the rights of the child as a basis for policy development.</p>
<p>The Joint report does, however, stress that a lot has still to be done both at national and EU level to achieve the overall aim of the social inclusion process. In particular, Member States should strengthen the mainstreaming of social inclusion objectives across all EU policies, make greater use of the OMC's potential to contribute to effective delivery and ensure that Structural Funds continue to play a key role in promoting social inclusion.</p>
<p>The forthcoming evaluation process, to take place in 2005, should focus on delivery in order to prepare for a new cycle of the OMC after 2006. The Member States and the Commission should particularly assess how national strategies can be made more effective by the use of targets, benchmarks and indicators, better links with economic and employment policies, effective monitoring and evaluation provisions and the use of the structural funds. The extent to which national strategies have been able to involve local and regional government, social partners and other stakeholders, and to contribute to raising awareness about poverty and social exclusion should also be assessed.</p>
<p>The issue of youth employment has already been the subject of a thorough debate at the informal meeting of the Ministers of Employment and Social Policy in Belfast, on 7-8 July 2005, during which Ministers agreed on the urgent need to implement specific measures. The annual Social Inclusion Round Table, which will be held in Glasgow on 17-19 October, will concentrate on the key priorities set out in the Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion, in particular as regards youth employment and training. In addition, the European Social Fund Conference in Manchester on 14 October will examine how the Fund is supporting national policies to promote employment opportunities for all.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0654"></a>

<p>(EN)In relation to the specific examples of environmental legislation mentioned by the Honourable Member of Parliament, the situation is the following:</p>
<p>The Presidency understands the importance of impact assessments being carried out in line with the agreed interinstitutional objectives of better regulation in future. These issues should be further explored between the three Institutions in the ongoing work under the Interinstitutional Agreement, with a view to reaching agreement on a methodology for such impact assessments.</p>
<p>The draft Directive on batteries and accumulators was chosen as a pilot project for an impact assessment of possible substantive amendments by the Council during its first reading. This impact assessment was carried out during the second semester of 2004 with the support and guidance of the Dutch Presidency. The Council's common position was formally adopted in July 2005. The Council does not foresee another impact assessment on this legislative proposal. Concerning the draft Directive on bathing water, which has reached the stage of conciliation, the Council does not envisage carrying out a specific Council impact assessment.</p>
<p>On the basis of experience gained, negotiations have been initiated within the high-level group with a view to establishing common principles at the Parliament, the Council and the Commission. A text was examined at the last meeting of the group and should be approved shortly.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0655"></a>

<p>I have received various requests for help from members of the public and professional associations who are most concerned about professional international lorry drivers from Spain who are imprisoned in appalling conditions – notably in Morocco – for being used without their knowledge as mules for smuggling goods and/or trafficking illegal substances or materials. The fact is that lorry drivers currently do not have the means to check the goods in their holds. They are arrested at borders and charged as though they alone bear the responsibility for transporting the material in question. Once the drivers are imprisoned and the lorries are impounded, most companies keep quiet and end up abandoning the drivers, who have to deal with the situation alone.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of this? Does the Commission know whether the situation has occurred or is occurring at other external EU borders, what the extent of it is and whether other drivers are affected? How does the Commission think that drivers’ rights and the presumption of innocence can be guaranteed? What practical steps – i.e. sealed cargo, the validation of road freight convention documents, or voluntary checks – could be taken to prevent illegal freight transport? How might the assistance provided by EU delegations to drivers imprisoned abroad be improved and made more effective?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)Firstly, to the Commission’s knowledge, there is no international legislation in relation to carriers’ liability for smuggling of drugs. Neither is there any legislation at EU level covering this matter.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of this issue but it is not in the position, at this stage, neither to ascertain the extent of the situation nor to know to what degree other drivers are affected.</p>
<p>In respect of the powers of the Commission, it should first be emphasised that it is unable, either in third countries or the EU, to intervene neither in individual cases nor in the day-to-day running of the national criminal justice systems.</p>
<p>However, nationals of the European Union who find themselves in this type of situation in a third country benefit from the protection of the Consul of their Member State of origin. If the national has no representation from his own country he can benefit from the protection of a Consul of any other Member State as a consequence of Article 20 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>In relation to the protection of the individual’s rights and the presumption of innocence, two Conventions are applicable. Within Europe, the 1950 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (commonly known as the ECHR) sets forth a number of fundamental rights and freedoms. These rights are mirrored at international level, notably in the 1966 United Nations (UN) Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The UN Covenant is relevant in respect of Morocco which is not a party to the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The ECHR, in particular Articles 5 and 6, guarantees the rights of individuals who find themselves subject to criminal proceedings. Furthermore, the provisions of the 1<span class="sup">st</span> Protocol number to the ECHR on protection of private property and the relevant case law, are also pertinent where a vehicle is seized and confiscated.</p>
<p>In terms of the practical steps, this is certainly something that can be examined further. Indeed for several years now the European Commission has been engaged in constructive dialogue with industry in this area. A Carriers’ liability round table takes place ever year at which this subject may be brought up.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0565"></a>

<p>(EN)The promotion of human rights worldwide is an important aspect of EU foreign policy. It is a matter of identity for the EU. The Commission systematically raises human rights issues with all its partners. Not one country in the world, including EU Member States, has a perfect human rights record; therefore no State should be immune from international scrutiny.</p>
<p>India is no exception to this principle. The 2004 Commission Communication on “A Strategic Partnership with India” and the draft EU-India Action to be endorsed at the upcoming EU-India Summit include explicit provisions on human rights. The EU-India partnership goes beyond shared political and economic interests – it is also value-driven. The Commission takes the view that the EU and India, as the world’s largest democracies, should be able to address all human rights concerns in a frank and open manner. This is the mark of a mature relationship.</p>
<p>The EU Troika and India have, since 2003, held regular consultations on human rights in New Delhi. During these consultations, the EU has consistently emphasized the importance of the pursuit of justice with regard to the events of Gujarat and encouraged the Government of India to provide rehabilitation and support to the communities affected by violence. It has welcomed the decision of the Supreme Court of India, in August last year, imposing a review of several hundred complaints and judicial cases related to the Gujarat events. It also welcomes the Indian Government’s intention to introduce legislation aimed at preventing discrimination and violence between communities. Given India’s commitment to democracy and rule of law, The Commission is confident that those responsible for the atrocities committed in Gujarat will be held to account.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0568"></a>

<p>The documentary ‘Darwin’s Nightmare’ by the Austrian director Hubert Sauper, currently being screened in France, raises many questions regarding the management of European development funds in Africa.</p>
<p>In the space of a few years, intensive fishing of the Nile perch, an EU-subsidised activity, has ravaged a whole ecosystem by progressively killing off all the others species of fish, and destroyed the traditional fabric of society around Lake Victoria. The fish no longer end up on local stalls, but are taken to factories, from which thousands of carefully filleted portions are flown daily to Europe. At the same time, the press reports famine in Tanzania and food aid, and the situation described in this film is terrible.</p>

<p>(FR)The Nile perch was introduced into Lake Victoria, together with four species of tilapia, in the 1950s. This has led to a profound change to the ecosystem of the lake. The large-scale fishing of the Nile perch began in the 1990s with the establishment of several fish-filleting factories by private companies.</p>
<p>The European Union was involved in neither the introduction of the Nile perch into the lake nor in the establishment of these factories and has had no involvement, therefore, in the intensive fishing of this species. According to the information available to the Commission, the documentary referred to in the question does not make any such allegation either. The only connection established by the documentary between the fishing of the Nile perch in Lake Victoria and the cooperation activities of the European Union in the fishing sector in Tanzania – which was unfortunately out of context and hence misleading – relates to European assistance for improving the production conditions and health controls for the fisheries products of local small and medium-sized businesses. Tanzania is one of some 60 African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries benefiting from this sectoral programme, which is intended to improve access for ACP countries’ fisheries products to the world market and hence to reduce poverty.</p>
<p>The fishing industry around Lake Victoria provides jobs for more than half a million Tanzanians. There has been a considerable change to the incomes of the local population over the last two decades. The large-scale exporting of Nile perch – a fish which has incidentally never been part of the local population’s traditional diet – has unquestionably improved the standard of living of local communities living beside the lake and is in line with the principle of sustainable development since it assists local small and medium-sized businesses.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0572"></a>

<p>That regulation does not provide for an exception for ‘local passengers’. Instead, it applies to all passengers whether in transit or not who are subject to a delay or cancellation of a flight.</p>
<p>In the event of cancellation, passengers have the right to compensation, under certain conditions, as well as assistance (food, and accommodation if the proposed alternative flight is on the following day) and the possibility of reimbursement or re-routing to the final destination according to the passenger’s choice. An air carrier is not obliged to pay compensation if it is able to prove that the cancellation is due to extraordinary circumstances which could not have been prevented.</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 16(2) of the Regulation, passengers may now have recourse, if necessary, to the national control bodies with particular competence for dealing with their complaints and disputes with air companies. It does not therefore fall to the Commission to take a position on this case at this stage.</p>
<p>The Commission is careful to ensure the application of this regulation by the Member States and monitors that application by the airlines. In this regard, and given that it is important to ensure uniform application of the regulation throughout Europe, the Commission has just opened up infringement procedures against certain Member States who are late in implementing certain provisions of this regulation. These countries have not yet taken the steps necessary to establish the sanctions to be imposed on air companies in the event of infringement. France is not one of these Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 21 June, the Stockholm City Court ordered the editor-in-chief of the newspaper Expressen to pay a fine because the newspaper had published advertisements for gambling and betting activities legally operated in the UK. It is not an offence for a Swedish citizen to become a customer of the companies concerned but it is an offence to promote, in Sweden, participation in betting activities offered in another Member State. The relevant legal provisions (Article 54 of the Law) apply only to the promotion of foreign betting activities etc. and they apply regardless of the legality of those activities in the country of origin and regardless of whether the country of origin is another Member State. When provision was made for introducing the offence, the Council on Legislation (Lagrådet) advised that there was such a significant risk that it was contrary to EC law that it should not be implemented, unless it could be shown that the ban on the promotion of foreign gambling in Sweden, and therefore the proposed provisions defining such activity as an offence, did not constitute inadmissible discrimination. The editor-in-chief requested the City Court to obtain a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Communities, a request which the City Court dismissed. Instead, he was found guilty of an offence.</p>
<p>What steps will the Commission take to ensure that the Swedish courts request a preliminary ruling in this important matter, which has never been put before the Court of Justice before, and how will the Commission address and remedy the discrimination to which the Swedish provisions obviously give rise?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)In response to the Honourable Member’s question the Commission should first state that its services has not received this complaint regarding the advertisement of gambling and betting services in Sweden. The Commission is willing to examine the matter on the basis of further information, but it does not have the power to instruct the Swedish authorities to put the matter before the European Court of Justice. It is however important for Member States to note that the Court of Justice has consistently held that gambling services are covered by the Treaty provisions guaranteeing freedom of establishment and cross border service provision. The Court has specified that restrictions may be justified by imperative requirements in the general interest, such as consumer protection and the prevention of both fraud and incitement to squander on gaming. It has also ruled that restrictions based on such grounds and on the need to preserve public order must also be suitable for achieving those objectives, inasmuch as they must serve to limit betting activities in a consistent and systematic manner.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware of the problems in general in the internal market in relation to the provision and promotion of gambling services. It is for this reason that the Commission has commissioned a study on the gambling and gaming sector in the EU. The study will look at a wide variety of such services and will also report on the various laws applicable in the Member States. The Commission has not decided whether or not to take action in this field, but can say that it expects the results of the study to assist us all in better understanding the issues involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0583"></a>

<p>The assessment of the operation safety status of the plant is a matter for the United Kingdom competent authorities. It is worth noting in this context that the respective EU legislation, Council Decision 87/600/EURATOM of 14 December 1987 on Community arrangements for the early exchange of information in the event of a radiological emergency, does not oblige Member States to report such incidents.</p>
<p>The Commission was informed by BNG about the exact amount of leaked liquid as well as the amount of uranium and plutonium it contained. According to that information, it had escaped from a fractured pipe into a thick-walled concrete cell (secondary containment), which was specifically designed to handle the event of failure of the primary containment. The information also holds that the event has neither caused harm to any individuals nor led to the release of radioactivity to the environment.

<p>(EN)Cookies, adware and spyware, and similar types of software are regulated in Art. 5 – 3 of the e 2002/58/EC. Under this provision, accessing any user’s terminal equipment like a PC or a mobile phone, or storing information on that equipment is only allowed if the user is given clear information about the purpose of such activities, and if the user is offered the right to refuse it.</p>
<p>However, a distinction between “good” and “bad” software programmes in line with recital 25 of the ePrivacy Directive has to be made. Devices such as cookies for instance can be a legitimate and useful tool to analyse the effectiveness of website design and advertising, or to verify the identity of users engaged in on-line transactions. Therefore, when such devices are intended for a legitimate purpose, their use is allowed on the condition that users are provided with clear and precise information, and with a right to refuse it. The situation is different for malicious software, which purpose is in essence to harm a computer system or its user. These forms of malware are clearly banned by virtue from the ePrivacy Directive.</p>
<p>As it is generally the case with EU Directives, the choice of remedies and penalties – and enforcement tools - lies with the Member States. However, in February 2005, the Member States have gone further than the ePrivacy Directive by adopting the ‘Framework Decision on Illegal Attacks against Information Systems’. Under this framework, spyware-related activities such as illegal access and interference with information systems have to be punished with criminal penalties of no less than between 1 and 3 years of imprisonment, and no less than between 2 and 5 years if committed by organised crime.</p>
<p>However, legislation is not enough and may only produce expected results if combined with other measures such as complementary enforcement measures, industry cooperation including standardisation, research activities resulting in efficient technical countermeasures, and better-user awareness. As far as enforcement measures are concerned, the EU has a Contact Network of Spam Authorities (CNSA) that aims to ease enforcement cooperation between national authorities on spam and related issues. The last meeting of this network was mainly devoted to spyware – often spread via spam – and the challenges it represents for enforcement authorities and industry.</p>
<p>Spam, spyware and adware are just examples of many security threats which risk undermining the value of the Internet and electronic communications. The Commission is therefore planning to propose a Strategy for a Secure Information Society that would help making electronic communications networks safer from fraudsters, harmful content and technology failures, and increase trust amongst investors and consumers. The Strategy is likely to focus on combining and updating the instruments available, including raising awareness, need for self-protection, support to targeted research, alignment of policies among the Member States on a voluntary basis, and encouraging industry self-regulation.</p>
<p>Another big step to improve Internet security was taken by the Commission in 2004 when ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency, was established. The Agency has already hired its first staff and developed its work programme. In August 2005, ENISA established itself in its headquarters in Heraklion in Greece and will soon become fully operational.

<p>The Commission will continue to support this exemption in its discussions with the government of Sri Lanka, as it is urgent and necessary to remove all the existing obstacles to the rapid delivery of aid. It wants to stress the fact that this exemption should be granted by local authorities which should indeed keep control of the whole exemption period.

<p>(EN)The promotion of human rights is a pivotal aspect of the EU’s action, both in the context of external action – through the Common Foreign and Security Policy and development co-operation – and in the internal context.</p>
<p>Decision-makers involved in human rights policy-making and execution already have access to a wide range of documentation and support, from Commission sources and elsewhere. This includes, for example, briefings by human rights experts within the Commission, which regularly draw on the information set out in the human rights fact sheets (these are updated by Heads of Mission for most third countries every year). It also includes publicly available material such as the EU Annual Report on Human Rights - to which the Commission makes a major contribution each year - and the extensive information available on our website. In addition, EC officials regularly access the reports on human rights issues which are available from external sources, such as the United Nations Treaty Bodies and Special Rapporteurs, the Council of Europe and non-governmental organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.</p>
<p>As regards information on situation of fundamental rights in the European Union and its Member States, the Network of Independent Experts on Fundamental Rights, set up by the Commission at the request of the Parliament, presents both an annual report and thematic report and opinions on specific issues related to the protection of human rights in the Union. Furthermore, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia delivers data on phenomena of racism, xenophobia and anti-Semitism at EU level. Along the expertise of the EC officials, this information serves the decision-makers when dealing with matters relating to human rights situation in the Union and its Member States.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Rights Agency, the establishment of which the Commission proposed on 30<span class="sup">th</span> June 2005, would contribute to defining of the Union fundamental rights policy by data collection and analysis in this field. The Agency would in the first place concern itself with the situation of fundamental rights in the EU and in its Member States when implementing Community law as well as in those candidate countries which participate in the Agency.</p>
<p>The Fundamental Rights Agency may also have a contribution to make in terms of the EU’s insight into the human rights situation in third countries: the Commission proposal of 30<span class="sup">th</span> June 2005 envisages that the Commission may request information and analysis on the fundamental rights situation in countries with which the Community has concluded an association agreement or an agreement including a human rights clause, or with which the Community has opened or intends to open negotiations regarding such agreement.</p>
<p>The Commission is therefore confident that, not only are decision makers receiving the appropriate information on human rights, but that the sources of such information will only become richer in the future.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0605"></a>

Even if, in many Member States, we have made considerable progress regarding certain aspects of equality, much still remains to be done in order to get the better of problems such as trafficking, violence committed by men against women, wage discrimination and differences in the preconditions for good health - problems which should not exist in Europe in the 21st century.

<p>(FR)The current framework strategy for equality between men and women covers all Community policies and encompasses all initiatives within a single framework by using a combination of instruments: legislation, funding by means of programmes and the Structural Funds, the development of specific actions, gender mainstreaming, social dialogue and dialogue with civil society. It focuses in particular on five strategic objectives: equality in decision-making processes, in social rights, in civil life, the changing of roles and stereotypes. The strategy pursues two horizontal strategic objectives: equality in external relations, including development, and equality in the enlargement process.</p>
<p>The strategy expires at the end of 2005, at the same time as the action programme that it underpins. They will be extended until the end of 2006 while we await the implementation of the PROGRESS programme which will ensure the funding of gender equality actions from 2007.</p>
<p>Even though a lot of progress has been made in numerous Member States in many areas in relation to equality, inequalities remain in all fields, as demonstrated by the annual report on gender equality presented by the Commission at the Spring Summit.</p>
<p>In its Social Agenda, the Commission announced that it will present a new communication on future developments of the gender equality policy when the current framework strategy comes to an end.</p>
<p>At the meeting of 7 June 2005 with representatives of the European Parliament, the President of the Commission confirmed the presentation of a new communication to take over from the current framework strategy. This communication will be the roadmap to follow and will discuss actions aimed at achieving equality between men and women in all fields with a view to achieving the objective of the growth and employment strategy and contributing to the implementation of the Beijing Platform. This roadmap will deal with the main obstacles remaining in terms of achieving gender equality and will identify the strategic actions for responding to future challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission is in the process of drawing up this roadmap. Discussions are under way amongst the different services of the Commission. The Commission is also in contact with the interested parties, in particular the Advisory Committee on gender equality. The work of Parliament and the discussions held between the Commissioner responsible for employment, social affairs and equal opportunities and Parliament during July also make valuable contributions. This communication is expected to be drawn up over the coming months and will be presented at the beginning of 2006.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0606"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission understands from the recent discussions in the Parliament, especially during the latest meeting of the Committee on International Trade, that the question of the Honourable Member relates not only to trade facilitation, but also to trade related assistance in general.</p>
<p>As regards the concerns underlying this question, the Commission, at Gleneagles, has made a commitment to increase trade related assistance, including related infrastructure aspects, to €1 billion a year.</p>
<p>Development cooperation funding is based on a comprehensive policy and programming approach involving a dialogue with all the beneficiary countries and regions. The Commission believes it will be able to implement trade related assistance, particularly in the area of trade facilitation, as part of this integrated approach. In this context, the Commission recalls the considerable amounts already financed in the field of trade related assistance within the framework of existing instruments, amounting to some €800 million per year over the past five years.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while acknowledging that in some situations a separate budget line could increase the visibility and flexibility of the Commission’s trade related assistance, the Commission believes it will be able to accommodate adequately the concerns underlying the question without such a separate budget line.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0613"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission shares the concerns of the Honourable Member. Indigenous people ‘account for just 2% of Colombia’s population, but they suffer disproportionately from human rights abuses and threats from illegal armed factions. They also represent a disproportionately high number of displaced people.</p>
<p>For this reason, the Commission already allocates an important share of its co-operation funding in Colombia to projects directed at the indigenous community. In 2005, this funding is valued at a total amount of € 24.6 millions or 15% of the budget earmarked this year for Colombia. There are twelve projects, financed by four different budget lines: decentralised cooperation, European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, (EIDHR) cofinancing for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and bilateral cooperation with Latin America. The actions are implemented through local and European NGOs, indigenous organisations and state entities and benefit the indigenous population directly, for example, the Nasa and the Guambianos of the Cauca region, the Emberas, the Awa, the Inga and ethnical groups of the Colombian Amazonia.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to support projects benefiting indigenous communities in Colombia. Full account is taken of the indigenous perspective when defining strategic documents such as the Country Strategy Papers and guidelines for local calls for proposals. It also forms part of the Commission strategy to promote human rights as a transversal issue of the EC cooperation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0614"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission manages the community budget funds in the context of the existing political guidelines. On the issue of the reinsertion of armed groups, raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission‘s position is based on the conclusions of the EU Council of December 2004. This links EU support to demobilisation to the adoption of a comprehensive legal framework in conformity with international commitments and which takes into account the right of the victims to truth, justice and reparation. The Commission uses financial and technical controls to ensure that funds are actually directed to what they have been earmarked for.</p>
<p>On 22 June 2005, the Colombian Congress adopted the so-called “Justice and Peace” Law providing for a legal framework for the demobilisation of illegal armed groups. The EU has not yet had the opportunity to fully assess this law.</p>
<p>Regarding the EU funds allocated to Colombia for aid to uprooted people, these are used to support projects for the socio-economic reinsertion or relocation of uprooted people in their land of origin, and to facilitate their integration in their host communities. The Commission is working with a variety of partners, including both the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and non-governmental organisations (NGOs), to implement its work programme. In this context, the Commission uses different types of internal and external controls to monitor the use of these funds. Additionally the Uprooted People projects in Colombia were positively evaluated in January 2005, as part of the evaluation of this budget line’s global implementation.</p>
<p>The Honourable Member further refers in her question to a pilot project implemented with the “Instituto de Bienestar Familiar de Colombia”. This pilot project is currently financed through bilateral cooperation resources (ALA budget line) and not through the thematic budget line for uprooted people. It is part of a larger programme, managed by el ‘Instituto’, supporting street children in different Colombian cities. In this framework, children that have been affected by the conflict (i.e. internally displaced children, former child soldiers, children in risk of recruitment, and former gang members) are also receiving assistance.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0631"></a>

<p>According to a recent Eurobarometer survey on passengers' rights (1 July 2005), only 35% of Europeans appear to be aware of their rights and obligations linked to the purchase of tickets and contracts concluded with transport companies. As a rule, the main reasons discouraging Europeans from travelling within the EU, apart from lack of information (44%) and high prices (30%), are connection problems between different modes of transport (26%), difficulties in buying tickets (25%), unreliable information (20%) and lack of frequency in the transport services on offer (17%). In the light of these figures, how does the Commission view the situation? Given the need to enhance the mobility of European citizens and European tourism, does the Commission envisage taking specific measures and initiatives to inform European consumers of their rights as users of transport services? Does it support the suggestion of creating, for instance, a single European ticket for combined travel within the boundaries of the EU, or establishing a European travel information service?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR)The data from the survey published in the Eurobarometer mixes all modes of transport together. The Commission is aware of the differing situations amongst the various modes of transport, in terms of information provided for passengers and in terms of the protection of the rights themselves. So far, the European Union has focussed its efforts on the air sector. In addition, the Commission has presented a proposal for a regulation on the protection of international rail passengers which is currently at the negotiation stage within Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p>As indicated in Communication <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2005&amp;nu_doc=0046">COM (2005) 46</a> of 16 February 2005, ‘Strengthening passenger rights within the European Union’, the protection of users of others modes of transport remains to be guaranteed. This protection cannot be effective unless implemented at Community level, particularly given the size of the sector and the level of use of these other modes of transport by the European public.</p>
<p>To this end, this year the Commission has already launched an independent study on sea transport. It has also launched public consultations on long-distance road transport and will do the same shortly for sea transport. The aim is to assess the current situation and to improve and guarantee the rights of passengers in other modes of transport, following impact assessments.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this year, the Commission carried out a media campaign to accompany the entry into force of Regulation 261/2004 on the rights of air passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights. The notice indicating passenger rights is currently visible in most European airports and the number of demands from passengers for their rights to be respected has increased considerably.</p>
<p>When the proposal for a regulation in the rail sector is adopted, the Commission intends to launch an information campaign similar to the one carried out this year for the air regulation with a view to informing rail passengers of their rights.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission has provided the citizens with letter boxes through which they can ask the Commission for information about their complaints. A gradual increase in the number of passenger complaints involving modes of transport other than air transport has been noted. The Commission responds to all of the letters that it receives from citizens and provides them with all the information available relating to their cases.</p>
<p>As already stressed in the White Paper on the European transport policy for 2010<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>: ‘The implementation of integrated ticketing systems (…) must be encouraged in order to facilitate transfer from one network or mode of transport to another’. In the above-mentioned communication, of 16 February 2005, the Commission stated its intention to encourage meetings between representatives of air and rail companies with a view to obtaining a voluntary commitment from them to create integrated ticketing systems. Furthermore, the Commission is currently examining the possibilities for improving intermodality between rail and air transport, in particular through the development of integrated ticketing.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission is aware of the increasing concern that arises from the analysis of demographic trends which shows that the ageing of the European population is likely to last for several decades. This phenomenon can in part be attributed to increasing longevity and it is reinforced by the falling birth rates that can be observed in most EU countries.</p>
<p>The Commission is also conscious that demographic trends will also have a strong impact on different aspects of our economic and social life, including on families. Therefore it becomes vital for the EU to anticipate, manage and promptly adjust to demographic changes, bearing in mind that, in the area of family policies, Member States remain solely responsible for their policy decisions.</p>
<p>To support the debate on these issues, the Commission published in March 2005 a Green Paper on "Confronting demographic change: a new solidarity between generations"<a href="#defann_55_1" name="refann_55_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which looks at the management of demographic change and the European Union's role within that.

<p>As a follow up, the Commission organised on 11 and 12 July 2005 an international ministerial Conference to draw the attention of all stakeholders, including governments at all levels, social partners, civil society and the academic world, to the challenges posed by demographic change. This event represented a first step in the process of reflection aiming to develop a comprehensive strategy for promoting a new solidarity between generations within the European Union.</p>

<p>The EU suffers every year from numerous fires that destroy hectares of forest, especially in the southern Member States and notably in Spain. Despite this, the Community's anti-forest fire strategy remains ineffective, thanks largely to the lack of coordination between the different administrations involved and between Member States at national level. The lack of a harmonised policy and the low level of funds available for prevention are undermining the effectiveness of the fight. The preventive measures set out in the rural development regulation are insufficient and do not guarantee coherence between the actions undertaken. The Commission's proposal on the future EAFRD (European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development) does not improve the legislation in this area: indeed, it worsens it by eliminating the aid granted to farmers for creating firebreaks. The latter measure was, unfortunately, agreed by the Member States, including Spain. Since fires constitute the biggest threat to forest conservation in the Union, can the Commission state what concrete measures it believes should be implemented with a view to remedying the existing shortcomings, in the context of the new European Forestry Strategy?

<p>(EN)This question, first of all, provides the Commission with an opportunity to express its sympathy and solidarity with all the citizens of the Union, in particular in Spain and Portugal, who have suffered from the devastating impacts of forest fires which have taken place this summer. The Commission’s thoughts especially concern those who have lost members of their families.</p>
<p>The Commission agrees that preventing and restoring damages caused by forest fires continues to be a challenge for both the EU and national or regional administrations. The Commission disagrees, however, with several statements of the Honourable Member, such as for example indication of a lack of coordination of the efforts on EU-level, worsened aid conditions or secondary importance of forest fires for the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to underline the roles and actions of the different bodies involved in these issues.</p>
<p>In 1998, the Member States agreed on a EU Forestry Strategy. The Strategy also contains elements addressing forest fire prevention as a priority issue.</p>
<p>Member States had to establish forest fire protection plans.</p>
<p>The EU co-finances prevention measures under the forest focus regulation and in the area of rural development policy. In the latter case the measures must conform to the national forest fire protection plans.</p>
<p>The Commission supports the Member States in the implementation of efficient fire prevention initiatives. Nevertheless, the Member States have to design the appropriate measures and to implement them in a coordinated way.</p>
<p>To be more precise: the forest policy in the EU is largely a national competence and is dealt with using the principle of subsidiarity and the concept of shared responsibility. Therefore, the main role of the Community institutions is to help Member States in implementation of their national policy concerning forest-fire prevention and restoration after forest fires.</p>
<p>Although forest policy falls under the national responsibility, the Commission is aware of the problem of forest fires and has developed several instruments and initiatives to help Member States in their efforts to prevent and fight forest fires. There are instruments, also under the Common Agricultural Policy, that can be used for forest fire prevention.</p>
<p>The Rural Development Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 provides specific support possibilities for restoring forestry production potential damaged by fire and for introducing appropriate prevention actions. There is no maximum limit to the amount of support granted. Member States can include these measures in their rural development programmes and allocate the necessary funding in function of their priorities and needs. In Spain, for example, the total budget allocated to forestry measures for the period 2000 – 2006 amounts to approximately € 820 million. This figure does not contain the measure of afforestation of agricultural land.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to emphasize, that it will continue these forest fire prevention activities also after 2006. Following the political agreement reached in the Council on the Rural Development Regulation for the next programming period, the conditions for the implementation of this measure remain unchanged.</p>
<p>The Commission’s most recent instrument covering also the field of forest fires is the Forest Focus Regulation (2003-2006)<a href="#defann_57_1" name="refann_57_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which allows to monitor and to implement forest fire prevention measures as well as to detect the reasons for their frequent appearance. The overall EU budget allocated to the area of forest fires within this regulation amounts to € 9 million for the period 2003-2006.</p>
<p>It is also possible, under the Community mechanism to facilitate reinforced co-operation in civil protection assistance interventions<a href="#defann_57_2" name="refann_57_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, to co-ordinate the mobilisation of the necessary operational resources to provide prompt support to a country in case of severe forest fires.</p>
<p>In addition, already in 2001-2002, in the framework of the Community Action Programme in the field of Civil Protection, the Commission co-funded a project (co-ordinated by Greece) aimed at improving dispatch for forest fire control. The project gathered operational dispatchers, decision-makers and researchers, who shared experiences and worked at identifying common practices in order to improve the knowledge and prediction capability on the effectiveness of the firefighting forces sent by dispatching centres.</p>
<p>Furthermore, under the 2004 Call for Proposals in the field of Community co-operation as regards Civil Protection, special priority was given to the organisation of workshops intended to enable fire-fighter trainers to learn lessons from accidents involving fire-fighters while combating fires – in particular forest fires - and to draw recommendations for future training that could be used in all Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, as regards the present forest fires, the Community – through its civil protection mechanism established in 2001 – was able to provide rapid assistance to the fire fighters in Portugal. Within less than 24 hours after the request arrived in the Monitoring and Information Centre of the European Commission, several Member States, notably France, Italy, Spain, Germany and the Netherlands provided helicopters and waterbombers to combat the fires. This assistance was coordinated and facilitated by the Commission´s civil protection unit and significantly contributed to get the situation under control.</p>
<p>The EU Forestry Strategy of 1998 must be mentioned as an overarching framework for the Community action in the field of forest policy. Protection of forests against fires in the Strategy is treated as an important issue. The Commission in 2005 has presented a report on the implementation of the Strategy. The issue of forest fires is an important part of the report. In addressing the current unresolved problems and emerging issues, the report has proposed to develop an EU Action Plan for sustainable forest management and review the present co-ordination mechanisms relevant to forests and forestry at the Community level. The EU Forest Action Plan will provide a coherent framework for the implementation of forest related actions at Community and Member States level and will serve as an instrument of coordination between the different Community actions, as well as between Community actions and the forest policies of the Member States. The Action Plan will be developed, and later implemented, in close cooperation with the Member States. The Commission believes that forest fire prevention and restoration after forest fires will play an important role in the Action Plan, which is due to be completed by the mid 2006.</p>
<p>And last, but not least: the European Union Solidarity Fund<a href="#defann_57_3" name="refann_57_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> has been established to enable the Community to respond in a rapid, efficient and flexible manner to emergency situations if classified as “major disasters”. Following the huge damages of the exceptional summer 2003<a href="#defann_57_4" name="refann_57_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> it provided € 48.5 million for Portugal and € 1.3 million for Spain. This Fund can only be mobilised upon formal request from the national government of the country affected by a disaster. The application has to be submitted within 10 weeks of the first damage caused. If the Commission considers that all conditions are met, it will propose to the budgetary authority (European Parliament and Council) to make the necessary budget appropriations available.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>To date, 5000 different combinations of tariffs have been recorded for services offered by mobile telephone companies. The necessity of imposing greater transparency in the way prices are fixed now seems to be the only option, in the interests of European citizens. The Commission is being called upon daily to take the measures required to protect European mobile telephone users properly. Does the Commission intend to take action to resolve this particular problem by publishing detailed tariffs of the services offered by mobile telephone companies, broken down by Member State? Furthermore, what mechanisms are used to regulate this matter at Community level and what further harmonisation measures are planned and within what timescale?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)There is indeed a huge variety of prices for mobile telephone services, and while this can be confusing for the consumer, it also allows consumers to find a tariff package that suits the way that they use their mobile phones. Some people use the phone mostly during the day time; others make most of their calls in the evenings. The strong competition between mobile phone operators means that there are tariff packages to suit almost every type of user.</p>
<p>In general, this variety is far better than the old type of ‘one size fits all’ tariff that could be very expensive for certain users. It has contributed to the current widespread take-up of mobile phones in the EU.</p>
<p>As far as regulation is concerned, under the Universal Service Directive [2002/22/EC] Member States have the duty to ensure that transparent and up-to-date information on applicable prices and tariffs is made available to end-users. National regulators may specify the content, form and manner of the information to be published, in order to ensure that end-users have access to comprehensive, comparable and user-friendly information.</p>
<p>Information about mobile tariffs is in general published and available. In many countries, consumers have access to guides on choosing mobile tariffs, for example via interactive web-sites, where consumers can find the cheapest package that suits their usage profile.</p>
<p>However, there is one area where the Commission is concerned about high mobile tariffs, and that is the area of international roaming charges. The Commission is taking measures which will improve transparency and help consumers to make an informed choice. This is because, for most consumers, roaming is an infrequent event and does not normally figure in the decision as to which domestic network to select. People using their phone abroad need to know how to minimise their usage costs.</p>
<p>The Commission will start publishing, from autumn 2005 onwards, a special website listing samples of international roaming retail tariffs of operators in all EU Member States.</p>
<p>This website will give information on typical rates that the consumer can expect for a variety of destinations. It will also provide links to other websites, such as operators’, where the consumer can get more information.</p>
<p>Passing on such price signals to roamers will serve to increase the pressure for mobile operators to compete aggressively for roaming traffic on their network.</p>
<p>At the same time, the Commission will be undertaking a review of the functioning of the regulatory framework during 2006. This will be an opportunity to see how the rules on price transparency have worked in practice, and to consider, in the light of a public consultation, whether they need to be changed.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0649"></a>

<p>(EN)The Doha Development Agenda (DDA) train is on track, although not moving as fast as the Commission would wish. Negotiations will need acceleration immediately after summer. Not all the “negotiating wagons” are moving at the same speed: there is satisfactory progress on negotiations concerning Trade Facilitation while negotiations in the areas of Non Agriculture Market Access (NAMA) and Agriculture move slowly but in the right direction. Other key issues like antidumping and Services are not moving as they should. In order to get to a successful Hong Kong Ministerial there is need for all wagons to move at the same speed.</p>
<p>It is indispensable to continue to push forward on agriculture. The right balance between the various interests at stake should be found, both in developed and developing countries, across the 3 pillars and related issues. Clearly this has to be done on the basis of the objectives of the Doha Declaration and of the July 2004 framework agreement, including their development goals. Before the summer recess there was the emergence from G20 of three key proposals on the three main pillars of agriculture. G20 emerged as effective middle-road negotiating group. G20 proposals are creating good positive basis for further substantial progress in the next three months. In market access, G20 proposal has forced participants to clarify their positions and to state their objectives more clearly than before. The EU can work on the basis of G20 proposals. Its ideas have been positively received by the delegations we have talked to. The EU has shown flexibility on market access. Less good news on the other two AG pillars: much little time has been devoted to export support and domestic support. On domestic support, those who need to reform have not said how they would do so. There is no indication on what they will do. Key principle stated in the July framework is: parallelism + comparable movement in all three pillars. This has not happened. The EU has done reforms and is pursuing them further: the sugar reform is one example. On export support, some progress has been made on export credit, limited progress on STEs, no discernable progress on the question of food aid. No progress on GIs despite its importance for EU, especially in market access for processed agricultural products.</p>
<p>On Non Agriculture Market Access (NAMA) in industrial goods (this covers textile and clothing), prior to the summer break negotiations have been focussing on trying to find a compromise acceptable to all WTO members on a tariff cutting formula. It was not possible to find an agreement but there has been substantial movement and convergence by most delegations towards a Swiss formula. Recently there have been encouraging signals from some Developing Countries that they could accept a Swiss type formula that should result into real market access opening. The EU on its part has clarified its readiness to make substantial tariff cuts. The formula that should emerge should be simple, its consequences easy to assess and must not create disparities between countries with the same level of development. The EU hopes that negotiations in September will be on the basis of one or the other of the Swiss formula proposals that seem to have attracted large support. Moreover, there are several other important issues like preference erosion, NTBs (Non-Tariff Barriers), etc … These issues cannot and will not be neglected, but the starting point remains the tariff cutting formula and its impact on different participants.</p>
<p>On Services, the picture is unsatisfactory and gives rise to serious concerns. Despite the EU substantial offer, the number of revised, improved offers still falls far short of what is needed and most of those submitted so far do not provide for new market access opportunities. Indeed, in most cases they do not even reflect existing levels of liberalisation! This situation is unsustainable and must be corrected by Hong Kong. For the EU, services are crucial for the overall balance of the DDA. For Hong-Kong, modalities with a similar level of specificity in services as for agriculture and NAMA have to be achieved. The bilateral request-offer method of negotiating has not generated meaningful results. As suggested in the recent report of the Chairman of the Special Session of the Council for Trade in Services, complementary approaches to the negotiations should now be explored, at plurilateral and multilateral level, as mentioned in the GATS and in the negotiating modalities of 2001, in order to ensure that there is a substantive outcome in services in the DDA. The EU must live up to the ambitious objective set at Doha and repeated in the July 2004 package, thus firmly attaching the services wagon to the DDA train.</p>
<p>In conclusion, all WTO participants have to be ready to make difficult political choice and the Commission is prepared. Last year, the EU proposed the elimination of export subsidies and it reformed on domestic support. On market access the EU is moving in the G20 direction; it has contributed positively in NAMA, the Antidumping and Services negotiations. Other developed countries as well as certain Developing Countries are called upon to make similar movement on issues which are difficult for them such as domestic support on agriculture, mode 4 in services, antidumping. In Services: there is a need for real domestic political lifting in developed and developing countries. On NAMA: Important political decisions need to be taken and there is a need for all to move. As a general conclusion, the Commission still believes that it can make it for Hong Kong across the board, provided that (a) all major participants, including the EU, set the example and make the difficult political choices between now and September, and (b) that it changes its working methods.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0650"></a>

<p>(EN)The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member on the importance of promoting a European civic identity, including through education and culture.</p>
<p>In the field of education, the Commission currently provides explicit support for European integration activities at university-level via the Jean Monnet Action. The purpose of the Jean Monnet Action is to enhance knowledge and awareness on the European integration process via teaching, reflection and debating activities at academic institutions. Under the Jean Monnet Action, the Commission is co-financing projects on themes such as “Culture and Identity in European Integration” and “Europe and the European Idea: History, Culture and Perspectives for the Future”.</p>
<p>Taking up the proposal by the Honourable Member, the Commission will explicitly include the theme of “European citizenship, European culture and European history” as a priority in its next call for proposals under the Jean Monnet Action. Universities will thus be invited to submit applications in this field for new teaching activities (such as Jean Monnet Modules and Jean Monnet Chairs) and for research and conference activities leading to publications.</p>
<p>Also in the field of education, universities are encouraged within the Socrates/Erasmus Programme to develop modules which seek to promote the European dimension in the curriculum across a wide range of disciplines in order to provide a significant proportion of students with a European perspective on their specialist subject areas. The Commission co-funds the development of such modules which should aim to raise the students’ awareness of European culture.</p>
<p>As regards cultural policy, the Commission submitted in July 2004 a Proposal for a decision of the Parliament and the Council establishing the Culture 2007 programme (2007-2013), that will replace the “Culture 2000 programme” from 1 January 2007 onwards. The general objective of this programme shall be to enhance the cultural area common to Europeans through the development of cultural cooperation between the creators, cultural players and cultural institutions of the countries taking part in the programme, thus contributing to the emergence of a European citizenship.</p>
<p>Finally, it has to be mentioned that the Commission has recently proposed a new programme “Citizens for Europe” to promote active European citizenship for the period 2007-2013. Among all the dimensions of citizenship, the “Citizens for Europe” programme deals with the very foundation of citizenship, namely the feeling of belonging to a community, the awareness of a common identity, enriched through its diversity and based on common values, history and culture.</p>
<p>In the context of its "plan D", the Commission reserves the possibility to take other initiatives in the sense desired by the Honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0651"></a>

<p>(EN)A new additional gas supply route from Russian sources to Northern Continental Europe and possibly up to the United Kingdom is a priority project in the transeuropean networks energy (TEN-E) guidelines<a href="#defann_61_1" name="refann_61_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Three main corridors’ options are currently discussed:</p>
<p>From Russia via the Baltic States to Poland, Germany (“Amber”),</p>
<p>From Russia via Belarus and Poland to Germany along the existing Yamal Pipeline (“Yamal II”).</p>
<p>An off-shore pipeline from Russia directly to Germany via the Baltic Sea (“North European Pipeline ” – possibly with branches to the Scandinavian and Baltic States).</p>
<p>The TEN Regulation with its modest budget allows in the energy sector mainly co-financing of feasibility studies. Under the Call for Proposal TEN Energy 2004, a study proposed by Poland has been selected for funding to investigate the feasibility of the two alternative projects “Amber” and “Yamal II”. For both routes, it includes investigations of technical, economic, financial, legal and market issues and the impact on the environment. The aim is to provide the basis for a Decision as to which of the two on-shore alternatives is more advantageous taking all relevant aspects into account. The study is managed by the Polish Oil and Gas Company and supervised by the Polish government. The maximum total costs are estimated at € 1,824,000 to which the Commission intends to contribute 50%. The final Commission Decision on the funding is still pending but expected to be made shortly. For the North European Pipeline the Commission was prepared to fund studies concerning the off-shore route but the contract did not mature.</p>
<p>For any project to be realised it is important that:</p>
<p>The countries concerned (for the Amber and Yamal II project in particular Poland) confirm their strategic choice and inform the Commission of their joint commitment to the project;</p>
<p>A firm commitment on starting and end date is given;</p>
<p>Within the EU-Russia dialogue these projects are addressed at the appropriate level, namely at governmental and industrial levels (where the construction Decision is made).

<p>(EN)The rights of children have become an increasingly central concern of the Union's social inclusion process, the Open Method of Coordination on poverty and social exclusion (OMC). One of the core objectives underpinning the OMC stresses the importance of access to rights ("promoting access to resources, rights, goods and services") and the objectives specifically mention children ("to move towards the elimination of social exclusion among children and give them every opportunity for social integration").</p>
<p>Member States have given a high priority in their National Action Plans on poverty and social exclusion (NAPs/inclusion) to the issue of child poverty. Indeed, working towards the elimination of child poverty has emerged as one of the key policy priorities for the social inclusion process over the next years. This message was reinforced in the Presidency's Conclusions at the Spring European Council in March 2005 which identified child poverty as the area on which the European Union and the Member States should focus within the context of their social inclusion policies.</p>
<p>The importance of a rights based approach and the valuable framework provided by the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child has been emphasised in the successive analyses of the NAPs/inclusion (2001-2003 and 2003-2005 for EU15 and 2004-2006 for EU10) undertaken by the Commission. This approach is the one to be followed by the Commission in preparing its future Communication on the rights of children, within the context of its work towards a “Pact for the Child” with a view to advance the promotion of children’s rights in internal and external EU policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0656"></a>

<p>(EN)To date there are no Community recommendations or rules on road signs indicating directions towards towns having different names in different languages.</p>
<p>Road signing is generally addressed in the “Convention on road signs and signals” of 8 November 1968 (the Vienna Convention). In particular, in Annex 1G, referring to ‘Direction, position or indication signs’, it is stated that, for signs reporting names of places, it is recommended to show place names in the language of the country, or subdivision thereof, where the localities referred to are situated.</p>
<p>However, further more recent works and reports for the harmonisation of road signing have been managed at European level. In the Final Report of Action START on “Standardisation of Typology on the Trans-European Road Network” issued by the Transport Infrastructure Committee of the Directorate General of Transport in 1994, it is recommended to mention the names of a town in two languages when significant differences in this name exist in two languages.</p>
<p>In addition, Article 14 of the above-mentioned Convention recommends that the inscription of words on direction, position or indication signs, in countries not using the Latin alphabet shall be both in the national language and in the form of a transliteration into the Latin alphabet reproducing as closely as possible the pronunciation in the national language. Moreover, a sign shall not bear inscriptions in more than two languages.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0657"></a>

<p>Will the Commission change its attitude towards Vojvodina - an attitude which violates Community principles? It clearly does so because the Commission and the Commissioner in person have said they know that the ethnic minorities living in Vojvodina, especially the Hungarians, are constantly exposed to physical violence and non-physical abuse merely on account of their not being Serbs. This being so, and in the light of other incidents which similarly indicate ethnic cleansing, the multiethnic character of Vojvodina, which has survived for 1000 years, and its traditional cultural diversity are manifestly in danger. Despite this, the Commission is prepared to open negotiations with Belgrade on a Stabilisation and Association Agreement.</p>
<p>Moreover, Interreg III/A does not recognise Vojvodina as a European region: indeed, adopting a similar line to Belgrade, it undermines the possibility that Vojvodina might regain its full and genuine autonomous status, of which Milosevic stripped it in 1989.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN)The Commission attaches the greatest importance to the multi-ethnic character of Vojvodina. It has been following with concern the ethnically motivated incidents that have occurred in Vojvodina. While not indicating an “ethnic cleansing”, these incidents are revealing symptoms of how the traditionally good inter-ethnic relations may be endangered by the difficult legacy of the Milosevic regime.</p>
<p>The attitude of the Commission towards the situation of the minorities in Vojvodina is strictly guided by the political criteria embedded in the Stabilisation and Association Process (SAP) for the Western Balkans counties. In the Report issued last April on the preparedness of Serbia and Montenegro to negotiate a Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with the EU, the Commission analysed the progress made over the last years by Serbia and Montenegro in meeting in particular the SAP political criteria. In this context, the Commission has also looked into the situation of the minorities in Vojvodina, by taking into account the outcome of the Parliament fact-finding mission to Vojvodina of last January as well as the views expressed by the Council of Europe and the OSCE. The Commission underlined the belated and insufficient reactions of the authorities to the ethnically motivated incidents. It took note of the steps undertaken by the authorities to address this issue and stressed the need for further efforts.</p>
<p>The Commission has concluded that overall the political criteria are sufficiently met at this stage for opening SAA negotiations. It has, however, stressed the need for Serbia and Montenegro to continue its preparation by making further significant progress in a number of areas, including the protection of minorities. This approach was endorsed by the Council of Ministers on 25 April 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission is continuing to monitor the respect of minority rights in Vojvodina in the context of the Enhanced Permanent Dialogue with Serbia and Montenegro. At the last meeting held in Belgrade on 7 July 2005, the Commission urged the authorities to implement the recommendations issued by the Parliament after the fact-finding mission to Vojvodina. It expects the authorities to investigate thoroughly any ethnic incident and to promote effectively good inter-ethnic relations, notably by taking measures in the field of education, police and judicial reforms.</p>
<p>As regards the position of Vojvodina under Interreg III/A programme, the Commission would like to underline that this programme does not define the concept of “European Region”. Interreg III/A is meant to support cross-border regional co-operation on the internal and external borders of the European Union and, in the context of the New European Neighbourhood Policy, Vojvodina is eligible to this kind of support. Obviously, it is not for Interreg programme to deal with the restoration of the statue of autonomy that was taken away by Mr Milosevic. Nevertheless, the Honourable Member can rest assured that the Commission follows closely the political and legal aspects of this issue, notably in the context of the revision of the Serbian Constitution.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2005-0658"></a>
