On several occasions, I, like others, have been deeply concerned about the unilateralism of the United States. The list is a long one, covering collective security, human rights, development and environmental protection. What type of proposal should be made with regard to trans-Atlantic relations just a few weeks away from the Dublin Summit? Would not the best ‘service’ the Union could do for this partnership be to display a critical attitude with respect to American views in several areas and, especially, to take the initiative in different directions?</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking first of all of the distressing situation in the Middle East. Mr Prodi has described the assassination of the Hamas leader as an illegal and irresponsible act. I also heard, and duly noted, what the Council said at this morning’s debate. However, just a few days since the green light was given by President Bush to continue with the policy of occupation and division of Palestinian territory, when is Europe going to decide to take the courageous initiatives that are required and that it has the means to implement: suspend the EU-Israel agreement, insist that an international protection force be sent, and convene an international conference involving in particular the protagonists of the Geneva agreement?</p>
<p class="contents">In Iraq, the blinkered attitude of the Bush administration, producing daily human tragedies, should mean, in this area too, far greater involvement of the European Union so that a real transfer of sovereignty guaranteed by the UN can take place as soon as possible. This critical attitude is again of relevance with respect to the American plans for the Middle East as a whole, attempting to impose a ‘democracy kit’ from the outside, mainly to guarantee American economic and strategic interests as defined by President Bush. Finally, the needs of the war on terrorism cannot be used to justify a drift towards discriminatory security. Also, I am concerned about the statements made by the Council and the Commission today, going back over Parliament’s rejection of the transfer of air passengers’ personal data.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from clearly essential security measures, observing the rule of law, the response to terrorism must not ignore its causes. Taking the initiative within the IMF or the WTO with a view to alleviating inequalities throughout the world could, again, be a useful European contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, let there be no misunderstanding: this would be a dialogue between partners that hold fundamentally different views on a number of crucial issues, some of which I should like to mention.</p>
<p class="contents">At the heart of Europe's safety strategy is conflict prevention and preventive involvement. Crucial to the Bush strategy is armed preventive attacks. The EU's objective is to reinforce the United Nations; that of the United States is multilateralism <span class="italic">à la carte</span> via the UN, if possible and if it suits Washington and not via the UN if it does not. The EU's ambition is to stop the distribution of weapons of mass destruction. Officially, that is also the line taken by the US, but at the same time, friendly regimes, including Israel in Palestine, are being protected, while the US itself continues developing what is called mini-nukes. The European Union is in favour of the International Criminal Court with a view to reinforcing international law. The United States is making every effort to make life for the Criminal Court as difficult as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is a civil superpower or, rather, it could be, if it were to concentrate more on improving the points it is good at, or could be good at. These points are conflict prevention, reinforcement of multilateral organisation, trade – fair trade if it were up to my group – and military action, under the UN flag, only if that proves to be unavoidable.</p>
<p class="contents">In Iraq, the United States learnt the hard way that it cannot solve the problems of dictatorial regimes and terrorism without the help of the United Nations and Europe. However, let there be no mistake: that applies just as much to the European Union. That is why it is best for Europe to adopt the policy of joining forces with the United States where at all possible, but it should not shrink back from being uncooperative should this prove necessary. Not because idealistic politicians think so, but because our citizens expect Europe to speak with one voice and act assertively in order to restrain the United States if necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was again brought home to me in a telephone call I received from Baghdad on Monday evening. My Iraqi informer is directly involved – in the Ministry of Education, no less – in the reconstruction of his home country, multifariously ruined Mesopotamia that is Iraq. He was very harsh in his criticism of the United States and the European Union. If the transatlantic partners do not finally join forces emphatically in a military and economic sense for a better future for Iraq, this could well backfire at some point. What does this urgent appeal from Baghdad mean in practical terms?</p>
<p class="contents">It means that NATO must pacify Mesopotamia, preferably under a UN mandate, and that there must be a generous Marshall plan in order to neutralise the pull of radical groupings. Personally, I should like to warmly back this appeal within the Council and the Commission. That is the only way for the European Union to prove itself a solid partner to the United States. It is the only way for the European institutions to prove that they want to carry political responsibility for a world which appears to be ripe for the assault by the forces of the ultimate evil of terrorists for whom human life does not count, irrespective of whether this involves the life of Iraqi fellow-countrymen, fellow-believers or that of Spaniards. According to the Bible, a divided house will not stand. That applies <span class="italic">a fortiori</span> to the European Union itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has led to much tension within the present European Union. It looks as if this tension is set to stay, certainly initially, following enlargement. That is a very sad conclusion because I am convinced that Europe is mistaking its enemy. After all, the debate is not about how Europe can provide a counterweight for the power of the United States, but about the question of how we can best fight international terrorism. In my view, terrorism can only really be tackled by means of transatlantic solidarity and collective action. That is why the political leaders in Europe have an important role to play. More specifically, this Parliament should underline more emphatically how much Europe stands to lose in the event of continuing tension and how much it stands to gain from actual cooperation with the United States. With this message, I bid the European Parliament farewell. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was indeed a memorable occasion, though I did not know that we were in Mr Roche's constituency. Of course, we were very well received and the hospitality was superb. Thank you very much indeed, Mr Roche.</p>
<p class="contents">The spirit of your remarks and of Commissioner Patten's shows that, despite the enormous difficulties we have had in transatlantic relations in the past few months, a great deal could be achieved at this EU-US Summit if we have sufficient courage to do so. The remarks made give me some encouragement that we can make real progress.</p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns the question of the joint study – which you mentioned, Commissioner – looking at the economic aspects. I warmly welcome that because, if we can look at the remaining barriers to trade, we can aim for a barrier-free transatlantic market. Perhaps you might have the courage to say that this should be done within a ten-year period. That would genuinely galvanise communities on both sides to overcome the remaining obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point, perhaps as important, is that we should look at the broader framework of transatlantic relations. As you have said, Commissioner, so many subjects form part of this agenda: the environment, foreign policy, industrial and social policy and, as we have seen, PNR data as well. It now needs a new framework to take these into account and, in particular, bring the parliamentary dialogue into the broader framework of the relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the fact that you wish to carry out an independent review. I hope this wish will be shared by our American friends as well, so that at the EU-US summit next year, when we have the incoming administrations, we would be able to pave the way for a broader agreement, possibly a partnership agreement, to be struck between the EU and the US perhaps by 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you very much for your comments. I wish you well, President-in-Office, and hope that, when you come to Dublin, we will have a statement to set out the future of the relationship which both Europeans and Americans can recognise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Looking at our report, our declaration, our motion for a resolution, I see three major political themes: the strengthening of the United Nations, the situation in the Middle East and the fight against terrorism. In all three of these – when considered realistically and not just optimistically – there are major differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Where strengthening the United Nations is concerned, I do not see any change in emphasis in the USA’s policies. If we are now to really get the United Nations more involved in Iraq, then we have to be very careful about it, for it must be the United Nations in reality, rather than the United Nations acting as something like an extension of the occupying powers in that country. In that event, they will be sucked into the same maelstrom of violence and retaliation as the Americans have been.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that there is, in the region itself, nothing left of the loudly-trumpeted initiative for a new Middle East. I wish we could join with the Americans in getting right down to the root causes and devising an overall strategy for the Middle East, which cannot, to be sure, focus on Israel and Palestine alone.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think there are still serious differences where anti-terrorism is concerned. Today, I listened to Commissioner Patten – as always, it was a pleasure to do so – and I agree with many of his arguments. He is wrong about the way I voted, but he is right about much else. We have to be very careful about this, and it may be that we have to go to the outermost limit of what is legally feasible in order to have a real defence against terrorism, but what is essential is that we combat its causes, and there are, as before, great differences in the ways in which Europe and the United States of America go about doing that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I share this view. Perhaps more emphasis should be given than has been given in this resolution to the fact that one of the aspects of this dangerousness is the policy of unilateralism and, above all, the new American doctrine with regard to unilateralism. I believe that this aspect is largely lacking in the motion for a resolution. This is why we support most of the amendments submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall take three extremely relevant examples of expectations with respect to the EU. In the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, we actually heard Messrs Burg and Abed-Rabbo yesterday. There was a very explicit request that the European Union and the ministers of foreign affairs should give far more support than they have in the past to the Geneva initiative. There was also a request that the European Union should be proactive in the support of independent organisations, under international control, in Palestine. These points should be clearly stated in our draft resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like the European Union to give more consideration to international studies. Some have been quoted. A report was published this summer under the aegis of the International Labour Organisation making practical proposals relating to good economic governance and the rules with respect to globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">If we do not understand that, as has often been said in this House and as Commissioner Patten has also often repeated, the struggle against poverty is one of the fundamental aspects of the war on terrorism and if we do not follow the recommendations of international reports to which we ourselves contribute, we shall lose all credibility. It is this type of message which the Bush administration must also be made to hear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

China, with six times the population and covering a much larger area, produces just 3%. Russia now ranks below Switzerland in terms of gross domestic product. What I mean to say by this is that the United States clearly enjoys a position of unprecedented political and military hegemony.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also fair to say, however, that the US has achieved this on its own merits. I believe we must conclude that, if Europe wants to fulfil all its potential, we must do so in loyal cooperation with the United States. This loyal cooperation does not mean that Europe has to issue a blank cheque; Europe has its own positions in relation to the death penalty, the International Criminal Court, the Kyoto Protocol, extra-territorial laws and trade policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also bear in mind that relations between the European Union and the United States are based on common values, on a shared history, and I believe it is important that we do not forget that the trans-Atlantic link is in the European Union’s genetic code and in a shared passion for freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe it is important not to forget that there is an extraordinary degree of interdependence in the economic and commercial fields. Four-fifths of the new investments made in Europe today come from the United States and we must not forget that the 15 current Member States of the Union invest more in Texas, the home State of President Bush, than Japan invests in all 50 States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to express my agreement, Mr President, with a fortunate phrase by Commissioner Patten, which I often use in my speeches, which is that everything we want to achieve as Europeans we will be able to achieve much more easily if we cooperate with the United States and I am sure that the United States can achieve what they want if they cooperate with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the proposal to launch a transatlantic marketplace is the brainchild of the Transatlantic Policy Network, consisting of multinational corporations, neo-liberal think tanks and politicians in this House. It has never been the subject of a proper public debate, even though it will be the biggest deregulation project ever undertaken. We do not believe it is in the interests of ordinary people.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I want to urge the Council to raise with US colleagues the issue of Iraq and in particular the recent massacre at Fallujah – and I do not use the word massacre lightly. Images of the US military's handling of the uprising in Fallujah have shocked the world. More than 600 Iraqis have been killed or injured in the last two weeks by US bombing and ground operations, and yet EU Member States have failed to condemn the US military actions. Maybe they accept the reassurance of the commander of US Marines that his men are 'trained to be precise in their firepower'. However, over 350 of the dead in Fallujah were women and children. In the light of US military use of unjustified and disproportionate force, and given the high death toll in this siege, I call on the Council to raise its human rights concerns in this transatlantic dialogue and to call for an independent commission of inquiry into the US military actions in the Fallujah region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There must now be a dawning realisation on the American government that unilateralism is simply not the way forward if we are to address the serious problems which confront the international community. It is now clearer than ever that the American government did have a plan to rid Iraq of the evil dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, but that it did not have, and does not have, an exit strategy from Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the root of the political problem which now faces us. Multilateral systems have a greater success and lay claim to greater legitimacy in upholding respect for the rule of law in relations between states. Effective multilateralism means a commitment to work with others to resolve the root causes of conflict, to promote respect for human rights and to create the machinery for resolving differences by peaceful means. A rule-based international order and strong international institutions, such as the United Nations, are of fundamental importance if international problems are to be tackled.</p>
<p class="contents">Multilateral cooperation is in the interests of us all and most particularly serves the interests of smaller states which, lacking military power, must rely on building support for a strong rule-based system. We have placed our faith in the multilateral regime for disarmament and in non-proliferation treaties and agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Iraq has certainly strained relations between many countries in the European Union and with the American government. The real question now is how best we can rebuild relations between the European Union and the United States of America. We should remember that when it comes to European-American relations there is much more that unites us than divides us although that does not mean that we do not have our differences. We have our differences over the Kyoto Protocol, we have our differences over a number of trading issues, but we are in a stronger position to promote the rule of law and to promote democracy when the European Union and the American government can work together as opposed to working in different directions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should be the norm as often as possible in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that, on this occasion, the draft resolution produced by the Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, Mr Brok, makes much of the matters of security and defence which would justify, if necessary, a reassertion of the transatlantic links, which became extremely stretched at the time of the Iraq crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the eve of our next plenary session, which will witness the implementation of the enlargement approved today, it would be appropriate to repeat what we already stated in April in the context of the own-initiative report on European defence policy, the conclusions of which have been taken up by our treaty partners and will, I hope, result in positive decisions when the Intergovernmental Conference has completed its deliberations.</p>
<p class="contents">What did we say then, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Patten? We said it was a good idea quite simply to repeat that NATO is still today a fundamental guarantee of transatlantic stability and security and that this is why it makes sense to strengthen the capabilities of both NATO and the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind, ladies and gentlemen, that we Europeans are partly responsible for the unilateralism of which we accuse the Americans so much, quite simply because we have been refusing for years to share with them the burden of defending our common values. This is why I am pleased about the commitment in this respect, recently reaffirmed by our Parliament and by the Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In these dangerous times it is vitally important that democracies should come closer together and that any differences should be minimised. I am encouraged by much of the positive and constructive language in the resolution before us and I am particularly pleased that the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy adopted my amendment calling for the establishment of a transatlantic single market by 2015. We must now work to turn that aspiration into a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a pity therefore that an otherwise good resolution is spoilt by some sniping against the United States or a subtext that has little to do with transatlantic relations and more to do with the obsessive movement towards some sort of European state.</p>
<p class="contents">The integrationalists clearly visualise just two interlocutors in the transatlantic relationship, the US and the EU. The ambition is also for the EU to speak for the European countries in NATO and the UN. Indeed, in the objectionable draft European Constitution there is a requirement that the new EU Foreign Minister should present the EU case in the UN Security Council in certain circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">As a United Kingdom representative, I cannot accept that the European Union should represent us in our dealings with the United States on defence and security matters. For over fifty years NATO has provided the forum where the nations of Europe and of North America have discussed the great security issues of our time and agreed on necessary action. Difficulties arise when other institutions come into the frame. It is misleading our own citizens and our allies to suggest that the development of an autonomous EU military capability has anything to do with reinforcing NATO or is motivated by the desire to work in close partnership with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">I see no willingness among many EU Member States to contribute more military resources to the defence of the democracies and there is a lack of political will to deal robustly with the security threats that we face. We have no wish to see the EU as such involved in defence policy. We welcome rapid progress in the creation of a transatlantic single market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Parliament is well aware of how vital the transatlantic relationship is. Indeed, I almost signed up for Mr Van Orden's presentation when he said that all sniping should stop, but I unfortunately part company with him on his portrayal of the new Constitutional Treaty. That is a debate for another time. He is right that it is all too easy to fall into the trap of sniping at the transatlantic relationship, and at the Americans in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We know about the shared history of Europe and North America, how the history has been shaped and how it has shaped the values we both share – Mr Collins made that point. All too often, however, the <span class="italic">differences</span> between the United States and Europe make the headlines. It is time to promote the positive element of the relationship and to look at what we can achieve together, rather than continuously to focus on those issues on which we cannot agree. We should consider how we turn the ideas we share into a common reality. That is the challenge that faces political leadership in Europe and in the United States. Like all close partnerships, we do not agree on all issues at all times. Even the happiest marriages occasionally have points of disagreement. We must, however, work to maintain our dialogue and to cooperate in areas of shared interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Suominen was right to say that finger pointing is neither attractive nor productive. I would certainly agree with that view. When Mr Collins pointed out the benefits of an effective multilateralist approach, as seen from Europe's viewpoint, he did so without the necessity that some people feel to attack the American viewpoint. He simply put forward the fact that there are two different viewpoints and proposed that we should work to produce a synthesis rather than to generate disagreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that we are working successfully with our United States partners across a full range of foreign policy issues, trade issues and economic issues in a sprit of partnership. There certainly are – and will continue to be – areas of disagreement. The reality that so much that we do in this relationship is positive should not be obscured by the disagreements of the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder mentioned the Marshall Plan. It was very interesting and timely that he should do so, because we need to remind ourselves that if it were not for the extraordinary generosity of the United States and the Marshall Plan, where would Europe be and where would this Union have been?</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming EU-US Summit in June is vital. It is very important in terms of the relationship and it is important that we share views, discuss differences and identify more clearly the areas of cooperation. The Irish presidency is working hard to ensure a successful summit. That is not to suggest that we are supine or that we would not agree occasionally to disagree on issues – of course we will. However, we in the presidency will do all we can to steer the relationship back onto a positive and productive track.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to mention, because a number of Members made this point, that what we say in Europe is amplified in the USA, and that what we say here is very frequently misportrayed over there. I am often shocked when I am in the United States at how often Europe is misunderstood and sometimes misrepresented. However, I have no doubt that visitors from the United States listening to our debates must sometimes be mystified as to how the United States is perceived, misunderstood and misrepresented here in Europe. As politicians, we have a responsibility to inform our citizens about the positive aspects of the relationship, notwithstanding the fact that there are occasional blips in it. In the past that relationship has been incredibly positive and I believe that will continue to be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">One speaker made the point that this was a good debate to have and a good time to have it. I agree.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Members for their contributions, in all their diversity. While it will not be possible to follow all the advice that has been proffered simultaneously, I feel it important to say that the presidency has listened very carefully to what this House has had to say on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to urge the House to support this resolution, for, as the debate has shown, we have to strengthen transatlantic relations in such a way that they are no longer founded only upon NATO and security policy, but that we will be spreading them more widely and deepening them. The Council Presidency will support this, and so, I am sure will the Commission. The idea of the Transatlantic Marketplace is certainly a matter of very great importance, and so it would make sense if the EU/US Summit were to convene a group of experts to carry out, over the coming months, the studies that will be needed to enable us to get more involved in this project. Its significance is not merely economic; it will have a direct effect on the deepening of transatlantic relations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, though, it has to be said that my committee – unlike the lead Committee – actually takes the view that we should welcome the outcomes of the Commission’s negotiations on air transport, to prevent matters being made more difficult at this present time for people travelling back and forth, and that, here too, we should seek a practical approach in order thereby to strengthen relations even in the age of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
