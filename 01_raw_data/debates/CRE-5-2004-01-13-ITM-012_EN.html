<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I assume that you want me to say something – I used to speak your language, but I have not done so for about 40 years!</p>
<p class="contents">I have come to the House this evening to make two declarations: the first is on the Services Directive, which the Commission decided upon this afternoon; the other is a short announcement on behalf of the Commission, and in particular of my colleague Mr Solbes, on the strategy for economic policy coordination and surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall start with the Services Directive. It is with great pleasure that I can announce to you today that the Commission has adopted a proposal for a directive to create a real internal market in services. It is an ambitious but balanced and gradual proposal, which aims to set service businesses free of legal and administrative barriers to the development of cross-border activities. It is potentially the biggest boost to the internal market since its launch in 1993. It will improve the competitiveness not only of the services sector but also of the whole European economy, including the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is a major element in getting the Lisbon Agenda back on track. It is the result of a long process launched by the Commission's Services Strategy in December 2000. It addresses the internal market barriers identified in the Commission’s Report on the State of the Internal Market in Services in July 2002. The European Parliament was involved throughout the process and adopted supportive opinions on both these documents. I am therefore delighted that I can come to you first and present our proposed solution today.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal responds to the European Parliament's call for a comprehensive proposal to ensure free movement of services by means of applying the country of origin principle, administrative cooperation and, where strictly necessary, harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive is comprehensive in that it covers all the services that are at present unable to benefit from the internal market because of legal or administrative barriers. It covers both the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. It will benefit a wide variety of services, including professional services, business services, security services, environmental services, distribution services, travel agencies, hotels, restaurants and entertainment, as well as health services. Only those services that are already covered by wide-ranging specific EU law, such as financial services, telecommunications and transport, are excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make it easier to establish a service business in another Member State, the proposal will cut red tape through a large-scale administrative simplification process. A number of restrictions on establishment, such as nationality requirements or 'economic needs tests', will be abolished. In addition, Member States will be obliged to set up electronic procedures and make available to service providers single points of contact dealing with authorisations and other formalities. Unnecessary authorisation procedures will be screened and removed; remaining authorisation schemes will be made more transparent and predictable, being based exclusively on objective criteria known in advance. Other restrictions, such as requirements that limit the number of outlets per head of population, or fixed tariffs, will also undergo a transparent process of screening and mutual evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make it easier to provide services across borders, the proposed directive aims to implement in practice the country of origin principle, whereby once a service provider is operating legally in one Member State, it can provide its services in others without having to comply with further rules in those 'host' Member States. In order to underpin this principle, the proposal provides for enhanced administrative cooperation between Member States and for some basic, harmonised, EU-wide quality requirements. It will, for instance, require appropriate professional indemnity insurance for services giving rise to particular risks.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive recognises the specific nature of the regulated professions and the particular role of self-regulation and calls on professional associations to establish European codes of conduct on professional ethics. It is complementary to and fully compatible with the proposed directive on the recognition of professional qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to make it possible to use services offered in other Member States, the proposal also clarifies and strengthens the rights of users of services. It therefore makes it clear that those rights prevent Member States from imposing restrictions such as requiring authorisation to use services (for example of architects or builders from other Member States), or discriminatory tax rules making services from other EU countries more costly. The proposed directive clarifies the rights of patients by setting out, based on the case-law of the European Court of Justice, the conditions under which national social security systems must reimburse the costs of medical care received in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed directive seeks to create more cross-border service activity, which will give businesses new opportunities in new markets, so that they can grow and create more jobs. Increased competition will also be likely to reduce prices and help to disseminate best practice and encourage innovation. In particular, SMEs will greatly benefit from the improved legal certainty and increased opportunities for cross-border supply. The effect on the economy as a whole will be higher competitiveness and more and better jobs. Therefore, the proposal needs to be adopted, written into national law and implemented as quickly as possible. This means that it must get the highest political support from all the institutions involved.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware that, unfortunately, this proposal arrives too late to achieve first reading in this Parliament. However, given that it meets the European Parliament's request for a comprehensive approach to create a true internal market in services, I trust that Members will give it due consideration and start to discuss it in order to provide a sound basis for the new Parliament's work and show the way to the Council of Ministers. That is what I would like to say on the directive on services.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, very briefly, on the other subject, I should like to say that the Commission has decided today to challenge the Council conclusions in the European Court of Justice. This challenge will, however, concentrate exclusively on procedural elements and will not touch on the country-specific economic surveillance aspects of the Council conclusions. More details are available in a document literally just made public, with the reference number IP/04/35. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been following the development of this very closely. As the Commissioner was kind enough to say, the Commission has taken notice of a number of reports we have made. I was the rapporteur for the last round, and we are currently working on a new single market report.</p>
<p class="contents">So we will have a chance to go into detail, and I agree with the Commissioner that it would be highly desirable to start the debate in this Parliament. I hope that my committee will be able to do that so we can start consulting a wide range of interests in this extremely comprehensive proposal. It is also absolutely essential to start the progress of this through the Council. The political points I want to make to the Commissioner tonight, and on which I would like his comments, concern the Council more than anything else. I am pleased to see that we have one representative on the Council benches. It is disappointing that there are not more. As the Commissioner said in his statement, the crucial factor in getting this to work will be the willingness of the Council to accept the basic principles of the internal market: a 'country of origin' principle for supplying cross-border services, the mutual recognition of conditions of establishment and sensible behaviour as regards grasping some of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not need to remind the Commissioner – although he may wish to refer to it – that the Council's record to date in dealing with these issues has, frankly, been deplorable. The sales promotion mutual recognition directive – which is an integral part of this – has been with the Council for 15 months. Under the Commissioner's proposal we face the position where we will be able freely to establish marketing agencies in other countries, but they will not have a common set of principles. I would like to hear the Commissioner's views about how he is going to work with us to get the Council to accept a serious timetable for dealing with these issues and how it is going to perform its part of the packages on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">Colleagues, if we do not have the support of the Council we will get nowhere. This is the crunch time for the internal market. Unless the Council comes to terms with this proposal, then it is not serious about Lisbon and not serious about the internal market. Frankly, the Council's acceptance of this directive is the biggest challenge that the whole Lisbon proposal faces. The Council must get on with it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The euro – let us admit it for once – has achieved far greater stability in the five years that we can look back on than the Deutschmark did. On the other hand, the euro is a difficult currency, for it runs alongside not one but fifteen national finance and economic policies, has an ‘open-door’ policy, and is still a young currency. It is therefore especially important to enforce Article 104 of the Treaty and the associated Stability Pact rigorously, and the eight countries and their citizens who have done their homework have a right to expect this. That is why the Commission is acting properly by clarifying these rights and enforcing budget discipline. That in itself serves to boost confidence in this new currency. We still have a lot of work ahead of us. Thank you for this decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the proposal on services. It is a great pity that it does not cover financial services. Unless there has been a last-minute change, these have been left out of the general proposal, which is unfortunate because the general principles of country of origin and mutual recognition, which are found in the service proposal, are applicable in financial services, and it would have been good to have that reinforced by their inclusion in this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The main thing I want to comment on is the Commission's decision today to take the Ecofin Council to court over its suspension of the Stability Pact. This is a serious row, and it has just got a lot bigger today. It is a graphic illustration of the problems you inevitably get when you try to run a single currency across 12 different countries. Those tensions will continue and only get worse, because it really is impossible to run a single economic policy which suits every single one of those 12 economies. Those tensions will get more – not less – significant with the expansion of the eurozone and with the enlargement of the European Union. I hope there is a satisfactory resolution to this problem, but at the moment it is another serious blow to the euro's credibility that the rules are not being enforced by the ECOFIN finance ministers. We were told that these rules were fundamental to making the euro work, the Commission is being forced into this drastic action and the wrangle is set to go on for a great deal longer.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the circumstances we have seen today, it is no wonder that people in the United Kingdom, Denmark and Sweden are all saying a big 'no' to the euro. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, I thank the Members that have put questions to the Commission. First, I should like to deal with the subject of the services directive. I will then move on to the other subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank Mr Harbour and Mrs Villiers for their support for the directive, or at least for what I said about that directive in general terms. Mr Harbour said quite frankly that approval by Parliament is all very well, but what about the other half of the legislative body in the Union – the Council? He is quite right in saying that the Council – not only on the issue that he mentioned, but others as well – has been laggardly. That is very bad. Sales promotion, the example quoted by Mr Harbour, is only one example: there are others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Harbour asked for the Council to accept a serious timetable. I wish I could achieve this. As Mr Harbour knows, the Commission is very powerful, but it is not powerful enough to force the Council to stick to a timetable. We are in the hands of the presidency. Mr Harbour can count on the Commission to impress upon the Irish presidency that it should do some serious work on this. However, when all is said and done, the presidency presides and the Commission plays the role of the Greek tragedy chorus: it looks on, but there is not much it can do but say 'Woe!'. Nevertheless, we will chivvy the Irish presidency along, and tell it to get on with the job.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Villiers complained that financial services are not included. The reason for that is that we have a very elaborate framework for financial services, as Mrs Villiers knows better than almost anyone else. The financial services action plan, with its 42 measures, is now well on its way to completion. We did not want to muddy the water or go over the same ground again, and that is why, as with some other fields that are regulated by other legal instruments, we thought it better to exclude financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Stability and Growth Pact, and the fact that the Commission has decided to challenge the decision of the Council in the Court of Justice, Mr Mombaur said that the Commission must insist on budgetary discipline. The Commission certainly does that: that is why we are going to court. I am pleased that on the whole – if not across the board – Parliament supports the Commission in that endeavour. The Commission believes that we live in a community of law. The Stability Pact is an agreement between parties and an agreement between parties is the law between parties, and that law must be upheld.</p>
<p class="contents">I said earlier that the proceeding the Commission would like to start in the Court of Justice will concern procedural aspects. We do not think it is the proper role of the European Court of Justice to tell the Union how to formulate economic policy. Therefore, the Court will focus on procedural aspects – the areas where it believes that the Ecofin Council has gone astray.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I should like to point out that procedure and substance form a whole. It is for the Court of Justice to decide where the Member States – or the Council – have gone astray. I hope that will happen soon. We do not want this procedure to drag on for years. We hope that a fast-track procedure can be followed so that we will receive the opinion of the Court in the autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Villiers repeated her well-known song in pointing out that she is against the euro or, at any rate, that Britain should not join EMU. I will not enter into a debate on that now. I know that fools rush in where angels fear to tread, so I will not get mixed up in the UK debate on the euro. She also said that 'inevitably' – that is the word she used – these problems arise when there are 12 countries without one over-arching economic policy that is followed by all 12. I beg to differ. Twelve countries have signed up to the Stability and Growth Pact. If, and as long as, they do what they signed up to, there is no problem about 12 countries following different economic policies. As long as their budget deficits are below the famous barrier of 3%, I do not see what more we need. No doubt the Commission will come up with more proposals along those lines. That is my answer to Mrs Villiers on the point of the link between sovereignty in economic affairs and deficits in fiscal policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
