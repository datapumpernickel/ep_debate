We have followed with concern developments in the fundamentalist Islamic forces’ attempts to split Chechnya away from the Russian Federation. We are categorically opposed to any form of terrorism and we support the fight against terrorism in every country in the world. I believe that the territorial integrity and sovereignty of every country is an inviolable and fundamental principle.</p>
<p class="contents">However, for several months a war has been raging in Chechnya which none of these arguments can justify. I spent over six years of my life in Russia and have very close ties with that country. So I feel it all the more that Russia is totally overreacting in its use of military force in the Chechen conflict. I find it totally unacceptable that we are witnessing violations of international humanitarian law by the Russian army.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of deep regret and profound concern to me that militaristic thinking has now again taken hold in Russia. It has long been recognised that military might never permanently resolves any conflict, and this needs to be remembered now. It is high time that this war ended and that a political solution to this conflict was found, no matter how difficult and complicated that might be.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an enormous effort is required to restore this devastated region for the people who have lost all their possessions in the war and to make it habitable once again. In the long term, this is the only way to remove this focus of conflict. My Group supports this motion for a resolution, and we consider it essential that this Parliament, in conjunction with the members of the Russian Duma, should seek means of restoring peace in Chechnya without delay.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mary Robinson obtained limited access. She was not allowed to meet the Russian President and was treated in a most humiliating way. </p>
<p class="contents">In her report to the UN’s session on human rights in Geneva, Mrs Robinson reported on individual testimonies concerning very serious crimes which had been committed in Chechnya. The witnesses she had met had told of murders of civilians, summary trials, executions, rapes, torture and kidnappings. Domestic affairs can never be pleaded as an excuse for atrocities of this kind. We have a global responsibility to defend basic rights. Abuses of these cannot – must not – be seen as internal matters. The UN’s High Commissioner must continue to be supported in his work. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has, on a number of occasions, expressed concern about the situation in Chechnya. We support the Council of Europe’s decision of last week to suspend Russia if no appropriate measures are taken. For a liberal, considerations of trade and short-term benefits cannot come before the defence of human rights. We would therefore react vigorously to these atrocities, but we also see it as very important to cooperate with democratic forces in Russia and with the new government. We therefore hope that we can organise a joint delegation from the European Parliament and the Russian Duma to travel to Chechnya and, there on the spot, engage in discussions, conduct investigations and bring about a dialogue. We presume that Russia will be of assistance and allow the delegation to travel freely. We also hope that the EU can eventually contribute to a reconstruction programme in the region.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A guerrilla war is being fought without the civilian population being spared, in fact, the civilian population is also suffering the dreadful atrocities that can occur in wartime.</p>
<p class="contents">The first war in Chechnya may have evoked sympathy from us as a battle for autonomy and independence and setting things right in their own territory, but we now have to say that, although this war really ended quite well for the Chechens, the intervening period was not used to best advantage and Chechnya became a country of complete chaos, where kidnapping was commonplace and where the citizens were no longer safe. At one stage, Chechen generals even invaded Dagestan, an action which merited absolutely no sympathy whatsoever. This illustrates that there are various movements within Chechnya. On the one hand, there are the military who tend to play the Afghan card or count on Iran for support. The other two groupings seek more of a political solution. One of them is seeking a solution more in terms of what we in Western Europe would also wish to achieve and the other is again seeking to strengthen relations with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the President of Chechnya has limited control over the troops in his country. We are pleased to hear that Maskadov does not support the actions of his military. We are also delighted to hear that the Russians are at long last admitting to the fact that Mr Putin is contacting the Chechen authorities indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also noted hat the Council of Europe has adopted a position in this regard. We know from the Russian delegation that was here until yesterday that this has hit them exceptionally hard and we spoke about it with them in detail. We have also heard that there is the possibility of a joint parliamentary delegation undertaking a fact-finding mission on an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> basis under the best possible conditions with a view to looking around the territory of Chechnya wherever it sees fit to do so. A mission of this kind must take place soon and I believe it is important that in the resolution tabled on the basis of the liberal text, an amendment is included to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we support an exceptionally brief resolution in that regard, perhaps even the briefest ever made in this House, consisting of the first two recitals of the liberal resolution, followed by the recital in which the decisions of the Council of Europe are mentioned. We shall vote against Article 1 because once again it involves support for this statement and we could substitute a better statement of our own. We shall willingly support Article 2 of the liberal resolution and then Amendment No 2 as well which refers to the joint parliamentary delegation which may be more useful in the future, because it is the future that we must concern ourselves with here. The delegation will have to examine what can be done to preserve the defence of human rights in the region, but also examine what we can do in the future to help Chechnya become a democratic constitutional state. Who knows whether with help from the European Union and Russia, a Stability Pact for the Caucasus region can ever be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, for these reasons we support this resolution, which initially was not to our liking, but which, at the moment, provides the best basis for a statement from this House.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition, my colleague, Mr Swoboda, will also say a few words about the reasons behind this war.<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>There is a very broad consensus within this Parliament condemning both the war against civilians in Chechnya and the terrorism which started in Chechnya, and this same consensus applies to the desire to maintain good and special relations with Russia. On the other hand, we are determined not simply to stand by and watch whilst Russia violates one international convention after another in this war in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the proposal from Mr Lukin, the Co-President of the Interparliamentary Delegation of the European Parliament and Russian Duma to send a fact-finding mission to Chechnya to gather information on the ground. We want to make use of this information at a later stage, that is after the delegation has returned, as the basis for a major debate in this House, involving the Council and the Commission, and leading to the adoption of a really well founded resolution. For this reason and this reason alone we, the Group of the Party of European Socialists, urge you not to adopt a motion for a resolution today – which would in fact bring the total to seven – and instead wait until we have the information we need for an in-depth debate resulting in a joint resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must also say that we do not share this kind of silence on the part of the European Parliament which is spreading to all these issues like a low mist which obscures everything. We have even noted that the Council of Europe itself is showing more courage than this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in Chechnya is shameful, the crushing of a whole people, and it is also shameful that this House has had to listen to ‘Mr CFSP’ talking about issues such as ‘the proportionate use of force’ or recommending that the Russian authorities lessen the intensity of the conflict. What is a proportionate use of force in a case such as Chechnya? What proportion are we talking about? This is unacceptable. What is meant by lessening the intensity of the conflict in Chechnya? Perhaps stopping the massacre of women and children? Perhaps stopping the bombing of hospitals? Please explain this to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we still believe that there is sufficient reason to suspend the partnership and cooperation agreement on the basis of the human rights clause.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by saying that I fully agree with what Mr Cohn-Bendit said in this House: in this Europe and this World which we want to build, let us have no more masking of attacks on entire peoples on the grounds of their being internal matters. We have had enough of excuses of this type. There is no such thing as internal affairs in this world we want to build. Either we have human rights or we do not have human rights.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Just now we heard about the issue of maintaining order. The history of the twentieth century is littered with strong men who used secret services and other means to create chaos so that they could then present themselves as a force for law and order. Let there be no mistake, we should not let Mr Putin get away with that. We must not allow the people of Chechnya to become victims of a genocide motivated principally by raw materials interests. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we want to show our solidarity with our colleagues on the other side of the River Ill, with our colleagues in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, who have taken a courageous step and who we should not lag behind in fighting for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we would like to demonstrate our solidarity with the Russian people, because the war in Chechnya is threatening to become an instrument of nationalism, which will be used to lever out the rule of law and freedom of the press, which are still very weak in Russia, and to turn the clock back in that country. Anyone who wishes to defend the Russian people must work to ensure that attempts to remove press freedom, as evidenced by the Babitsky case and by many other cases, do not succeed, and that Russia continues on the path towards greater freedom and towards closer links with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we must say a resounding ‘yes’ to steps against these wrongdoings and why we believe that it is important for representatives of this Parliament to visit Chechnya as soon as possible, following the example of the Council of Europe and the UN Commissioner for Human Rights, Mrs Robinson. This joint delegation needs to set off without delay. It would be a great step forward if this succeeded. And, as I have already said, it is vital for us to make it crystal clear that we back human rights for the people of both Chechnya and of Russia. We wish to help both peoples and both peoples have the right to advance towards freedom and towards taking their proper place in the international community.</p>

I therefore support everything that has been said here about condemning the barbaric war being waged by Russia, which is a war that recalls the darkest days of the Soviet Union. What we want to see is a new Russia, not a seamless transition from the Soviet Union, but a new Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, it very much remains to be seen whether the new President Putin can guarantee this, certainly on the basis of what we have seen so far. So there is no alternative to condemning this war and saying that although we certainly condemn terrorism we regard Russia’s reaction as being totally disproportionate, inappropriate and unacceptable. That is what we should condemn. But we should not fool ourselves into imagining that in this case we simultaneously want to achieve something important for peace in Europe and throughout the world as whole, that is to say a dialogue with Russia and ultimately a partnership with Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Russia is only accepting this in words, not in deeds. That is why I think it is important that this interparliamentary delegation exists. It is the job of the Council Presidency and the Commission, whilst at the same time defending moral values and condemning this war, to endeavour to ensure that we support those forces which are all too poorly represented in Russia, but who nevertheless wish to pursue a European path, a path towards a European partnership, a partnership with the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the formula we need: condemnation of the war and a visit by the delegation, after which we must take whatever steps are necessary. And if those steps have to be harsh ones, then we should, in full awareness of the facts, not shrink back from taking them.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last few days the Commission and the Member States have held several meetings with their Russian counterparts: the ministerial troika with Mr Putin and Mr Ivanov on 7 April in Moscow, and the Cooperation Council with Russia, last Monday in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">During these discussions, we have reiterated our main demands: cease-fire and political dialogue, access for, and presence of, international and humanitarian organisations, and independent inquiries into any human rights violations. All these demands are also in the European Parliament’s resolution and the recommendation from the Council of Europe’s Parliamentary Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">As the European Parliament has emphasised, the Russian authorities have failed to respond satisfactorily to these requests. All that can be said is that Mr Ivanov finally accepted the European Union and ECHO embassies at the last Cooperation Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent discussions in the Council of Europe, the Committee on Human Rights in Geneva and this Parliament reflect growing concern amongst the European public. For our part, we support the United Nations Human Rights Commissioner, Mary Robinson’s request to Russia to set up a broad independent committee of inquiry into any violations of human rights, based on recognised international criteria. Last Monday’s General Affairs Council stressed the importance of maintaining an open and frank dialogue, including on this subject, with the Russian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We think Russia should pursue implementation of the partnership agreement in terms of its elements – I do mean all its elements – and provide more concrete results than we have at this stage.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
