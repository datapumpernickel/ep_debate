I would be obliged, if he were willing to accept as an oral amendment: ‘for a vote of approval by 5 May or at the latest by the end of the life of this Parliament". This would allow us a bit more flexibility.</p>

We were unaware of these amendments yesterday evening when we debated this, so I was not able to give any verdict or comments then. The motion for a resolution on which we have to vote in a moment was introduced by the Foreign Affairs Committee as a complement to its report on KEDO and with the express aim of making a justified attempt to dispel suspicion in this most isolated state of North Korea and to bring it closer into the international community. The three rapporteurs for the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Budgets and Research were involved in this. We were eager for contacts and meetings and to see how these might be brought about, how we might find ways of perhaps creating mutual trust, including contacts between our two parliaments. We had to forge links which would make dialogue possible. As convinced democrats, we naturally found many things to criticise, and the amendments tabled by the ARE Group are clearly based on criticism. But I have to say that the motion for a resolution did not set out primarily to be critical. We were very much aware that if we could not establish better links with North Korea, if we could not persuade North Korea to join the international community, we would have to expect a humanitarian and perhaps even a security disaster of enormous proportions. The motion for a resolution was drawn up very carefully by the Foreign Affairs Committee and with input too from the draftsmen, Mr Ford and Mr Brinkhorst. So I would urge you not to adopt the amendments tabled by the ARE Group and to maintain the motion for a resolution tabled by the Foreign Affairs Committee unchanged and in its entirety.</p>

Basically I was very much in favour, but there were two points I could not accept. The first is that this resolution leaves the road open for this so‐called Committee of Experts, which has indeed done well here, to go on working for ever. It is quite simply a mistake on the part of Parliament to bring in outsiders instead of assigning these tasks to the Committee on Budgetary Control. That is the first reason. The second is that I find the resolution far too weak. We could have taken a much more vigorous and definite approach since this was after all an affair in which Parliament has finally shown a bit of muscle, which could have been reflected more strongly in this resolution.</p>

<p class="contents">Fortunately, this is not the case, and I very much want to pay tribute to the four years of work done by the Santer Commission, which carried out all of the political programme that Mr Santer presented to Parliament. Moreover, we cannot deny that it was Mr Santer"s Commission that took decisions and measures designed to clean up the Delors heritage of administrative and other anomalies. The Santer Commission does not deserve to be described by the independent experts as irresponsible when it comes to supervising its own administration.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly regret that it was a female Commissioner who failed to act as a decent politician and face the consequences of her actions and her evident favouritism in time by resigning. She has set a bad example which is detrimental to all women involved in politics in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I did not vote against the resolution. I abstained, because it does salvage something by calling for a reasonable timetable for appointing a new Commission. Nonetheless, I was not able to vote in favour because there is a lack of balance in paragraph 2 with its overly positive assessment of the extremely arbitrary conclusions reached by the Committee of Experts, which unfortunately has been asked to continue its work.</p>

Nevertheless, I do not think Parliament has exactly covered itself with glory. It would have been better had we had the courage in January to call on Parliament to take matters further towards their logical conclusion. I believe that in future we must not just call for the restructuring of the Commission but also become more self‐confident vis‐à‐vis the Commission ourselves. Let me give an example: in my opinion the way in which the Commission fobs us off with our written questions is quite appalling! Some of what it puts in its answers is ridiculous and I really wish that the President of the Commission, but also the Bureau of Parliament, would make it clear to the Commission that we expect proper answers and indeed answers which stand up in law against the Commission. We do not want information we already know!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would really like to see a rigorous investigation into whether there really was any indirect party funding. I hope these reports will be made public before the European elections so that we can give the taxpayers the opportunity to make it clear who they are choosing. In short, I believe that Parliament should not just accept the way it is treated by the Commission, which is why I emphatically ask the Bureau to seek to ensure that in future questions to the Commission are answered in more precise and exact terms.</p>

It should refer to the resignation of the members of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the substance, I would point out that most Members of Parliament have failed to learn the lessons of recent events both in relation to the replacement of members of the Commission and the Committee of Experts. Concerning the replacement of the members of the Commission, it was a mistake to reject our Amendment No 20, which recommended that none of the Commissioners should be reappointed. The Committee of Experts" report is actually very clear. It condemned the collective responsibility of the Commissioners themselves and also of the Commission as an institution, both the present Commission and the preceding one.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting paragraph 7 of the resolution, most Members of Parliament have shown that they have not learned from this report and, above all, from the many statements made by the experts since then. Things should have been sorted out once and for all, and a special interim Commission brought in, made up of management experts, with the task of providing a remedy, just as the independent experts provided a diagnosis.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Committee of Experts, it was wrong to give it until 1 September to produce a report. We have tied down the next term of office; we have refused to let the committee look into the way Parliament works. Once again, the powers of the European Parliament have been whittled away.</p>

It has indeed done good work, but I voted against this Committee of Experts at the last vote too because I am convinced that there is no legal basis for that committee. This has been confirmed by various opinions, for instance that of Siegbert Alber, a former Member of Parliament who is now Advocate‐General at the Court of Justice. He too took a clear stance and said there is no legal basis for this so‐called Committee of Wise Men. That is why I could not vote in favour.</p>
<p class="contents">But I must also say that there were some very good things in this resolution, not just that it calls on the Council to lay down a procedure which enables individual Commissioners to be called to account but also the fact that it reproaches the Council for failing to assume its responsibilities to some extent, for it should already have taken a position on several occasions, which it did not do; in the end it was mainly thanks to the work of the Committee on Budgetary Control and this Parliament that we saw any movement at all here.</p>

The idea is to avoid embarrassing issues being displayed for all to see during the campaign for the European elections. Is this really the democratic behaviour called for in the resolution?</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, we challenge the majority position of this House, which claims that the solution to the crisis lies in giving the European Parliament greater powers. This is nothing but a political hijacking exercise orchestrated by the federalists. In substance, this supposed remedy would not cure anything; in fact it would do quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Before clamouring for increased power for Brussels, we should first ask why fraud has occurred. We would then see that European federalism, which is all of a sudden being proposed as a cure‐all, has from its earliest days been the very cause of the wrong we are condemning.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, fraud has developed because an ivory tower has been built in Brussels, cut off from the people, with vast sums of money passing through it and with direct supervision by the Member States still not allowed.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, according to the Treaties, the European Parliament does have control over the Community budget. But despite all the obvious irregularities this had never really worked. Now it has at least been put into practice once, thanks to the diligence of the Europe of Nations Group. So much the better. But this welcome development proves neither that the European Parliament is the best instrument of budgetary control, nor (in fact, even less so) that it fulfils the fundamental conditions for becoming the high assembly of a federal Europe, sweeping away the main powers of the national parliaments at a stroke.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament is not the best instrument of budgetary control because in fact it is hand in glove with the institution it is supposed to supervise, namely the Commission. The European Parliament dreams only of extending its power, and to achieve this dream, it knows that it needs to extend the sphere of Community activity, which is what the Commission spends most of its time doing as well. The two institutions are hence allies pursuing the same goal. And throughout its whole existence, the European Parliament has never condemned the most flagrant irregularities committed by the Commission, including recently – just a few months before the current scandal blew up – the commitment of expenditure without any legal basis at all. It eventually took the tireless work since last January of a few MEPs, unintentionally put at an advantage by the blunders of the federalist group chairmen, to trigger an event which Parliament for the most part did not actually want to happen at all: the Commission"s resignation.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know very well that because of their very structure the European Parliament and the Commission play into each other"s hands, and that control can only come from outside, from the Council and the national parliaments, whose powers should be increased. It seems hard to believe that France pays an annual contribution to the Union, yet its MPs do not have the right to say ‘no" when the budget is put to the vote or to check for themselves what becomes of taxpayers" money. Until these obvious points are understood, all that will happen is that spurious controls will be introduced in Brussels and wrongdoing will continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Parliament does not fulfil any of the conditions required for it to become the high assembly of a federal Europe. We should not lose sight of the fact that Europe is not a nation, but an association of nations, and that this essential character provided the justification for its unique institutions, where national sovereignties play a pivotal role and must continue to do so. In particular, the European Parliament, a specialised assembly, may be of use in carrying out specialised tasks, but never in the general exercise of sovereignty. It does not represent a European people. In practical terms, in budgetary matters for example, we cannot see the French agreeing that their taxes should be decided by a majority of Germans and Spaniards. Nonetheless, these are supposed to be the ‘European people", the vital bedrock of ‘European democracy".</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, if we wish to put a stop to fraud and mismanagement in the European institutions, we should not hide our heads in the clouds. We should not make the even greater mistake of suggesting that extra powers be transferred to Brussels in the guise of democracy, an artificial democracy which would soon bring renewed disillusionment. The ‘off‐the‐peg" federalist ideas which have blocked all proper solutions over the past few years should not be allowed to get a new lease of life in a different form, after the collapse of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, during the campaign for the forthcoming European elections, we should advocate the only effective solutions: reestablishing the Member States" control over Brussels, subordinating the Commission to the Council and giving the national parliaments the right to see how their citizens" money is being spent.</p>

We too take the view that a caretaker Commission must be appointed as quickly as possible for the remainder of the outgoing Commission"s term. We cannot have this Commission which has resigned remaining in office for a further nine months. That would do nothing for the Union"s authority and credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we would have liked to see a number of points in the joint resolution which were not in fact there. For that reason, we tabled a resolution of our own and did not put our names to the joint motion. A major aspect which is not dealt with is whether or not members of the outgoing Commission should be appointed to the caretaker Commission. We do not think that the new caretaker Commission should include any members of the present Commission, because the work of the committee of experts is not yet finished. All kinds of new cases of fraud may yet come to light. If the committee"s further investigations show that certain Commissioners are free of all blame, we have no objection to them returning to office in the next Commission term from 2000 to 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect not clearly spelled out in the joint resolution is the remit of the caretaker Commission. The next nine months must be dominated by a radical clean‐up of the administrative and financial systems and the improving and modernising of the financial management. The caretaker Commission must do no more than that. There is no need at all for it to implement all manner of lofty plans for the further building of Europe, accompanied by a further extension of the Commission"s remit, and certainly not in the next few months.</p>

<p class="contents">It was precisely because the Commission felt strong, in fact too strong, that it allowed itself to make major management errors, even going so far as to withhold ‘important documents from Parliament", according to recital B of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Because of an error stemming from the Treaties establishing the European Union, the Commission has far too great a role to play. This institution, which through the very way in which it is appointed is the least democratic in the Union, should go back to playing the role which is normally given to an administration: carrying out the orders of the highest political authority, the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The founding fathers of Europe created the Commission following the model of the ECSC"s High Authority, because they did not have faith in democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should turn the current crisis to our benefit and let good sense prevail. In a democratic system, the Commission must be the Council"s executive and nothing more than that.

We should also express our appreciation of the political work undertaken by the Commission during its term of office. It now falls to the Council to accept its political responsibility, as Parliament did in December by refusing to grant discharge for 1996, and appointing a Committee of Independent Experts to investigate irregularities which had come to light. It is essential for the Council to resolve the institutional crisis resulting from the resignation as quickly as possible. The potential dangers of the crisis do not lie in the resignation itself, nor even in the reasons for it, but in what could follow, depending on how the Council chooses to deal with the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">On the pretext of the mismanagement and lack of financial control revealed in the report by the Committee of Experts, the Council could be tempted to put forward a President lacking in political standing. It could also use this opportunity to weaken the Commission and restrict its competence. If the Council does react like this, nothing will have been gained from the crisis and it will have negative consequences for the future of the European Union, which would be particularly unfortunate given the crucial stage we are currently at. That is why I voted in favour of the resolution on the resignation of the Commission. The resolution sets out the course the Council should follow as it seeks to appoint a new Commission. It also clearly expresses Parliament"s conviction that this crisis must serve to strengthen the political and democratic nature of the European Union. And this calls for a stronger Commission. A strong and effective Commission is most certainly needed and it must be appointed according to the provisions laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, that is to say, it must enjoy democratic credibility. Only then will the new Commission be able to assume the role of guarantor of the common interest of the European Union allocated to it in the Treaties, and become the driving force behind the European integration, taking us closer to the global Europe we are striving for.</p>

On the grounds of nepotism, the Commission had no alternative but to resign, and in the light of the mismanagement, the Commission's future role needs to be reviewed. In future, the number of tasks assigned to the Commission should be reduced. Part of the Commission's present work could be carried out more effectively by the Member States themselves. The Commission should not concern itself with detailed regulation in areas where it lacks the necessary national authority.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we do not support the resolution when it calls for a strong Commission for the European Union. In spite of this, however, we have decided to vote in favour of the resolution.</p>

This negligence, which endangered the health and lives of millions of Europeans, has not been punished. The European Commission has not been censured.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, today, a report by five people representing no‐one but themselves, yet nonetheless elevated to the status of ‘wise men", led to the resignation of the European Commission on 15 March 1999. The reasons are well known and have been known to everyone for years: nepotism, serious irregularities, ‘fraud", ‘lack of control of the bureaucratic administration" and other oligarchical excesses, which have been condemned here by Jean‐Marie Le Pen"s Front National members for the last three legislative periods.</p>
<p class="contents">The lessons of this resignation are as follows: </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Parliament has now confirmed, after years of fighting in the budgetary arena to establish its power, that it is becoming the main institution of European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as they have been toppled by a report by five experts appointed by the dozen members of the European Parliament"s Conference of Presidents, it would seem that the twenty members of the Commission have come up against a structure even more oligarchical than their own. It is certainly true that in cases of government by the few, there is always a smaller inner circle of decision‐makers.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it has been made clear that sovereign tasks, such as aid to Eastern Europe or the southern Mediterranean, cannot be entrusted to private companies and profit‐making agencies, which is unfortunately what the Commission has been doing since the days of Jacques Delors.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultra‐liberals, always quick to demand the dismantling of nation states and their public administrations, have provided proof here that the State in the French tradition offers far more guarantees of morality than the private American‐style administration.</p>
<p class="contents">The two most heavily implicated Commissioners were Socialists, which simply confirms at Community level the iniquities of González, Mitterand, Craxi, Roland Dumas, Augusta"s Belgian Socialists and other corrupt forms of socialism seen in social democrat governments at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, today"s resignation, and above all the reasons for it, confirms the fact that the European Commission cannot be the government of Europe. It is a high‐level administrative secretariat which should be brought back within the strict limits laid down in the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">European power should be wielded by the intergovernmental structure formed by the Council of Ministers, supervised by Parliament as the representative of the people.</p>

The rapporteur believes that the Commission should carry out a feasibility study into whether this can best be achieved by introducing a common student card or by a European logo on existing cards. We agree with the content of the report and its conclusions. Regardless of the method chosen, we nevertheless feel that it is important to extend the system to students outside the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we would point out that we do not support some of the reasons given for introducing a student card in the future.

One of the major triumphs of European cooperation since the 1950s has been the opportunities it has created for young people to travel, work and study anywhere in the EU. Travel to Manchester airport on any day and you will see hundreds of young people putting the free movement of people into practice. The excellent University of Salford in my own constituency has also taken full advantage of the opportunities offered by Europe by developing exchange programmes with partner institutions across the EU. A European Student Card would make it even easier for students from the North West to forge ever closer unions of their own with their continental colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Labour Government is determined to ensure that student cards will be needed by as many people as possible in the future. If Britain is to become a high‐skill, high‐wage economy, then higher education must be opened up to as broad a cross‐section of society as possible. That is why the Labour Government has created the University for Industry, which plans to offer 1 million courses a year by 2004. This high‐tech university will promote life‐long learning and make higher education accessible to those who might not normally have the opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is all in stark contrast to the Tories, who always preferred to put tax‐payers" money into private schools for the few rather than universities for the many.</p>

<p class="contents">But let me turn now to my oral explanation of vote. Even at first reading of this report, we voted for the new Leonardo II programme. We did so because the principle of lifelong learning must of course be supported and must be implemented by means of practical measures.</p>

Against a background of fraud and mismanagement in the Leonardo da Vinci programme, which were decisive factors in the resignation of the Commission, it would indeed be a challenging task to take a decision on the second phase before the problems caused by financial mismanagement have been tackled. Immediate efforts are required to step up controls, evaluation exercises and reporting procedures, as well as openness and transparency. In the meantime, a decision on the programme should be postponed.</p>

<p class="contents">Moreover, I fully agree with the rapporteur that in addition to setting up a committee of senior police officers we should also establish a multi‐disciplinary group made up of heads of police, customs and other law enforcement authorities so as to bring about genuine operational cooperation as swiftly as possible.

<p class="contents">A secret register of wanted persons in which criminals, victims of crime and witnesses will be registered and which will include information about political views, race, sexual tendencies and religious affiliation is to be set up.

On the procedural side, apart from the fact that we are discussing this report here in Brussels rather than in Strasbourg, where budgetary matters should be discussed, I would point out that in recital B of the report adopted by a majority in Parliament, we welcome the conclusions of the informal European Council in Berlin, which actually takes place tomorrow and the day after. I am afraid this reflects not just a straightforward timetabling error but also the fact that very often we pre‐empt what goes on between the institutions. This proves that the way the European Union works leaves something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">On the substance, I am astounded by what is said in paragraph 2 of the report, on the one hand, and then in paragraph 3, on the other. In paragraph 2, we say that the budget for the year 2000 should safeguard the prerogatives of the European Parliament. This is an unfortunate illustration of the fact that very often most of the Members of the European Parliament think in terms of conflicts of competences and powers, far more than they consider straightforward budgetary arguments or the interests of the taxpayers in Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are these interests taken into account when we point out in paragraph 3 that the European Parliament has observed budgetary discipline over the last three years, because it adopted a budget below the level of the preliminary draft budget. And when we say that we have, together with the Council, recognised the need for rigour, we are forgetting that on each occasion we have increased the Council"s budget. The rigour is not, therefore, equally distributed between the two institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be advisable, for example, not to carry over unused appropriations which, as indicated in paragraph 10, amount to 243 %, 142 % and 110 % of commitments. Genuine rigour should be exercised in the European Union – an effort required of the Member States as well.</p>

I am pleased that this is mentioned in the report, even if that is not where the emphasis lies. One has to ask oneself if we have got our priorities right when we choose one‐sidedly to support energy development and do not at the same time at least help the starving people of North Korea. Not so very long ago, the Union decided to provide food aid for Russia. We supported that as well. An official request from North Korea for the same kind of help has been pending before the Commission since the summer of 1997. Hitherto, the Commission has said that surplus stocks of beef and veal were not earmarked for food aid and that it is not the right kind of aid from a nutritional point of view. However, I must say that I find it totally incomprehensible that we are investing huge sums of money through Euratom for power supplies while leaving meat to sit and rot in surplus stores, when we could in fact be helping starving people in North Korea.</p>

There is an imminent risk of North Korea continuing its nuclear weapons programme at an underground facility at Kumchagri where they have the technology and knowledge to separate plutonium from the new light water reactors. There is also a strong possibility that they are continuing to develop rocket technology, as has happened in the past, with sales to third countries and the launching of missiles.</p>
<p class="contents">Considering the serious economic situation and the food crisis in North Korea, the focus of assistance should obviously be humanitarian support and building up the resources to meet, amongst other things, their basic energy requirements. In this context, it is clear that their antiquated and centralised nuclear power capability is a totally unsuitable future energy source. If we are to help them, then it must be in the development of renewable sources of energy on a decentralised basis.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a risk that the KEDO Agreement will lead to nuclear proliferation. The European Parliament should therefore not be party to the agreement. Consequently, we voted against the report in the final vote.</p>

However, in this explanation of vote we should like to make a point which we regard as important. The wording in paragraph 16 to the effect that refugees should be ‘looked after in a culturally similar country as far as possible" is unfortunate, as it might be taken to mean that refugees are not welcome in other countries with different cultures. In our view, refugees should clearly have the same opportunities to seek asylum, regardless of their own or another country's specific cultural orientation.</p>

At recurrent intervals, the Kurds living in Baghdad have been ordered to leave and forced to flee to Iran, and these are mostly women and children. Many of the men have been imprisoned by Saddam Hussein's regime in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In Turkey, the government and army are waging a war of aggression against the Kurds in the south‐eastern part of the country. Imprisonments, disappearances, executions and torture are an everyday feature of Turkish warfare, with thousands of villages burned down and millions of refugees made homeless. The EU has a special responsibility because of the customs union it has signed with Turkey, whereby the Turkish Government gave its word that it would strengthen democracy and respect freedom of expression and human rights. This it has not done. On the contrary, the situation has deteriorated and the flow of refugees increased.</p>
<p class="contents">A solution must be found to end the appalling crisis that mainly affects the Kurds in Iran, Iraq and Turkey. The Council of Ministers should organise an international peace conference, to be attended by representatives of the UN, the OSCE, the EU, the USA, the governments of the countries concerned and the Kurdish parties and organisations. A major goal of the conference should be to secure greater Kurdish regional autonomy in the area, guarantees of democratic rights for Kurdish people, and the recognition of their Kurdish identity and culture.</p>

Although this phenomenon was previously restricted to what we used to call, not without contempt, banana republics, over the last twenty years or so it has tended to spread to our own Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore urgently necessary to establish an international political counterweight in order to restore a proper balance of power between economics and politics, a balance which today is heavily weighted in favour of the former. An in‐depth reform of the United Nations system would really make sense here, without affecting the primary duty of the Security Council, which is still to keep the peace between nations. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that, like the European Union, the Security Council lacks a head and an arm.</p>
<p class="contents">On an economic and social level everyone agrees that we need a mechanism for coordinating the international institutions. In the same vein, it would be desirable to set up a global agency for the environment and sustainable development, bringing together the various United Nations agencies which deal with these issues that are so vital for the future of mankind.</p>
<p class="contents">In all cases, the activities of the international institutions should be made more transparent and legitimate. This is why I particularly support the idea of introducing a parliamentary dimension into the United Nations system.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we are voting on today is ambitious. It is just as ambitious as the founding fathers of the European Union were when they reached the conclusion that there was no other solution but to unite the peoples of Europe if they wanted to stop them waging war on each other.</p>

It is also unique in that it has an almost universal membership – virtually every country in the world belongs to it. In our view, the UN should have effective diplomatic instruments at its disposal and be capable of exercising preventive diplomacy and giving early warnings in respect of potential conflicts. On the other hand, we do not think the UN should have at its disposal a rapid action force with military capability, and so we cannot support paragraph 8 and Amendment No 3. We also have reservations concerning paragraph 29, which contains a proposal to amend the UN"s Charter so as to enable it to intervene in national conflicts.</p>
