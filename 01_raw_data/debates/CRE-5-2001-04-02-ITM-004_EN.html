<p class="contents">The Commission has notified this communication within the context of the wider action plan for financial services drawn up in application of the decisions by the European Council in Lisbon on the unification of the European financial and capital markets. Unifying these markets will help to complete the single market. Τhe last European Council in Stockholm revisited this issue, calling for the action plan to be fully applied by 2005 and for all interested parties to make every effort to achieve a single stock market by the end of 2003. Investment services are, without doubt, an important tool, perhaps the most important tool to the working of the stock markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, every initiative in this context, such as that contained in the Commission communication which it is my honour to present to the House, has been stamped urgent by the European Council. The Commission communication is not a legislative text. However, it is, nonetheless, of crucial importance because it paves the way for the reforms needed so that, when the time comes for a legislative proposal, and I believe it will be soon, Parliament will be prepared to adopt the necessary amendments to the original directive quickly and, I trust, almost unanimously. I think that this will give us a chance to prove the speed and efficiency of our legislative procedure which, unfortunately, has been thrown into doubt recently by certain reports, such as the Lamfalussy report.</p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Members, the economic policy objective of the Group of the Party of European Socialists is not, nor has it ever been, purely and simply to distribute income and wealth more fairly and reduce inequalities in society. Along with this objective, which forms the nucleus of our policy, we have always endeavoured, and we still do, to strengthen the productive base, because goods need to be produced before they can be distributed more fairly. With these thoughts in mind, the Socialist Group firmly supports the completion of the single market and the unification of the financial markets in Europe. We believe that progress on these fronts will strengthen the productive potential of the European economy, to the benefit of one and all. We also believe that the market cannot use its autonomous and automatic procedures to create the changes needed for the purpose. Self-perpetuating change in market institutions often traps the economy in an unproductive situation, creating monopolies and safeguarding the interests of the few at the expense of society as a whole. Political intervention is therefore required in order to shape the frameworks needed within the economy, so that the market can be liberalised and can return a real productive result.</p>
<p class="contents">It is exactly this sort of reforming intervention which I have the honour of recommending in this report on upgrading the directive in question. The original directive, in 1993, was intended to promote the unification of the markets and fight national protectionism in the provision of investment services. The mainstay of the directive was the mutual recognition by all the Member States of the operating licences which any one Member State issued to investment service companies, the famous European passport. The idea was an inspired one, but it was thwarted in practice by the fact that each Member State had the facility to attach different operating rules to the provision of these services. The fact that, under the original directive, the investment company no longer needed to file 15 applications and obtain 15 licences, but only needed one licence in order to establish anywhere in Europe was, without doubt, a step forward, but it lost much of its impetus because each company had to deal with 15 different legislative regimes on the ground. This situation acted as an important national regulatory barrier to the unimpeded movement of investment services and the unification of the European markets.</p>
<p class="contents">I now recommend to you, and I am delighted that the spokesman of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mrs Kauppi, agrees with this proposal, that we dismantle this barrier and impose the force, not of 15, but of a single regulatory regime, namely that of the Member State which issues the licence. We shall have taken a big step towards the single market once certain aspects of the investment services sector are unified, especially once clearing and settlement of share purchases and sales have been unified.</p>
<p class="contents">In the United States, which can teach us a great deal about these matters, one central clearing house acts for the whole country. In Europe we have many more than one. Given that clearing services have huge potential for economies of scale and hence for reducing costs, which are much higher for us than in the USA, it would be a good thing if the directive helped to unify these functions. It cannot, of course, insist that the stock exchanges merge, but what we can do, and what I suggest to you, is that contracting parties should have the right to choose the clearing and settlement system which they prefer, even if it is different from that of the stock exchange on which the transaction was conducted. By strengthening competition as part of the procedure of stock exchange mergers being promoted by the euro, there is hope that, in the end, the companies with the lowest costs will prevail, rather than the companies with the strongest monopolistic links.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the directive should monitor the constant changes being driven by technological progress. Today, the regulated markets are no longer infrastructure-type organisations; they have become commercial companies, while numerous large, highly computerised stock exchange companies have metamorphosed from intermediaries on the market into internal share markets. The regulations need to be adjusted accordingly. Many of the rules on the integrity of the markets, such as rules to combat insider trading, need to be extended to the internal transactions of these companies, while other rules, which at one time only related to companies, such as rules governing customer relations, should also apply to stock exchanges. This question is difficult to broach, but it is, perhaps, one of the questions which we should regulate in general terms, leaving the details of application to the regulatory authorities of each country or of Europe, where there are any.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to stress that the Socialist Group supports the unification of the financial markets, the aim of which is to strengthen the investments needed to achieve full employment in Europe. It certainly does not support, in fact it is most certainly opposed to, the speculative fever of stock exchanges, which can cause catastrophic, explosive conditions in the real economy, which is why we are calling on the Commission to present its proposal on safeguarding the integrity of the markets as quickly as possible. Of course, we do delude ourselves that a regulation will do away with speculation at a single blow. However, we do at least want stronger principles of commercial honesty, precisely because speculation increases the temptation to act dishonestly, now that the stock exchanges are increasingly consolidating their pension function in our society. The limits within which European stock exchanges are fed from workers’ pension funds cannot but be much stricter than in the days when stock exchanges were simply casinos for the rich. Strengthening discipline and the proper functioning of the stock exchanges are one of the most important projects in the action plan for the investment markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This communication was so skilfully drafted in fact that we in Parliament were able to reach consensus both in the Committee and here in the plenary sitting. There was not a single amendment made to my report, which I am very happy about.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 11 of the investment services directive needs to be revised to remove the legal uncertainty that prevails nowadays in the European investment markets as well as overlapping and conflicting rules. Factors of uncertainty such as these hamper the success of the internal market and result in considerably increased costs, which European investors ultimately have to pay. We must ensure that all investors have the opportunity to participate in the internal investment services market, safe in the knowledge that European legislation will provide the appropriate freedoms and, if required, adequate protection. My report proposes that any clarification of Article 11 will work best if the country-of-origin principle is applied to all investment services provided across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of professional investors, it will be possible to switch quickly to the country-of-origin principle, but, from the consumer’s point of view, applying the principle still requires greater harmonisation of the conduct of business rules that affect them. This is very much under way in FESCO. Complete harmonisation is not a prerequisite, however, for the country-of-origin principle to also be applied to retail sales of investment services for the small investor. This solution would, at the same time, be consistent with the electronic commerce directive, which was passed last spring, and which Member States are under an obligation to adopt as part of their own legislation by 1 January 2002. If these two directives do not work on the same basis, the position of customers purchasing investment services electronically will be different from that of consumers who purchase their services through traditional channels. The basic idea behind the classification of investors is that different investors need different kinds of protection and, on the other hand, are entitled to demand greater freedoms as their experience grows. European legislators must ensure that a lighter conduct of business regime should apply to professional investors than to small investors, who need more legal protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Restrictions on the freedom to provide services can only be sustained when they are applied in the interests of the general good. For example, for transactions between professional investors rules for the general good should not be required. Restricting the market for reasons connected with the general good is not, as a rule, possible either. Any interpretation of Article 11 of the directive on investment services must in any case be consistent with Articles 3.4 and 3.5 of the electronic commerce directive. The host country may thus only restrict the free movement of services to protect investors on a case by case basis and in compliance with a special procedure and a list of specific conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, my report contains reservations with regard to the three categories of investor, as proposed by FESCO. Rules that are too strict may make it needlessly difficult for investors in the middle category to operate in the internal market, especially as we are giving them the chance to opt-up to higher protection, if they so wish. There is also a degree of uncertainty regarding what categories will be entitled to benefit from the country-of-origin principle. The Commission should clarify this and propose that, in principle, all who have opted for the level of protection intended for professional investors, that is to say, a lighter level of protection, should always be able to benefit from the country of origin system in cross-border services. Another issue which merits further consideration on the part of the Commission is the application of rules for marketing and advertising. The current ISD already states that the right to market services in the internal market can only be restricted for reasons connected with the general good. Despite this, many Member States have included advertising rules in their conduct of business rules. This may lead to rules that overlap.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the proposal by the Lamfalussy Committee that the revision and updating of the ISD would, in many respects, be an ideal example of a legislation project where the new procedure proposed by Mr Lamfalussy could be applied. The problems in the present ISD have mainly led to difficulties of interpretation, so it will be important to ensure the amended directive is implemented consistently at national level, to achieve a successful result. Just to have a good and relevant directive will not be enough. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Madam President, I welcome and support both the reports we are discussing today. They are excellent and I congratulate both the rapporteurs on the hard work that they have done on them. It is vitally important to get the investment services directive right because the rewards will be an increased return for savers and cheaper products for consumers. But the ISD, I am afraid, symbolises much of what is both good and bad about current EU legislation. It is a good idea in theory but it has not yet delivered in practice. It has produced a single market on paper, but not yet a single market in reality. It was supposed to have made it possible for a firm or a company complying with its own home rules to have a passport to trade anywhere across the European Union. It has not delivered that in practice because of differences in interpretation between Member States, because of differences in enforcement between Member States and because of poor implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">It is really unacceptable that almost eight years after adoption there are still some Member States trying to work out how they are going to enforce this directive. The result has undermined both the country-of-origin principle and the principle of the single passport, because operators still face multiple, overlapping and sometimes conflicting sets of rules when they trade across the European Union – just the problem which the ISD was supposed to tackle.</p>
<p class="contents">This is really a textbook case of where the single market legislation has not actually delivered. We have an increased administrative and bureaucratic burden, which still leaves different firms facing over 15 different legal systems and rule systems. The conduct-of-business rules have been used by Member States to impose their own host-state rules where they are neither necessary nor desirable and I would include the UK in that. These conduct-of-business and advertising rules have been used to protect markets rather than consumers and the Commission should clamp down strongly on that.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the call in the two reports to move to a country-of-origin principle for conduct-of-business rules, for advertising rules, for retail investors and for wholesale investors. I hope the Commission will take note of what Parliament has said because where the Commission can be criticised in its upgrade is that it is too tentative on these vital issues. We should have a country-of-origin approach underlying this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not see why we cannot trust consumers to pick a product from other Members of the European Union and to be protected by the financial services authorities of those other Members of the European Union. Consumers are receiving proper and appropriate protection from different countries which have been in this very close relationship now for almost 50 years. It is vital to ensure that we are consistent with the e-commerce directive, and a country-of-origin approach will be consistent with the e-commerce directive if we adopt it in the ISD.</p>
<p class="contents">Any exception to the country-of-origin approach, whether in the ISD or in the e-commerce directive, should be strictly interpreted, narrowly interpreted and should be eliminated as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Minor updates to the ISD are, of course, welcome but above all we need a change of culture. The Commission has been far too tentative in enforcement. It is unacceptable that for many years many countries simply failed to distinguish properly between professional and consumer investors as is required by the ISD. I would like to see the Commission make full use of its enforcement powers to make sure the current version of the ISD is enforced properly by every single Member State and indeed that the next version of the ISD is also properly enforced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The removal of obstacles in the Member States with regard to financial markets is essential in the Europe of the euro and will enable us to take advantage of all the opportunities offered by the existence of the single European currency. Allow me once again to repeat the comparison I have made before. What we are now undertaking in the financial and monetary field is what we undertook ten years ago with the establishment of the European single market for goods and services, ensuring the general freedom of movement for capital, workers and goods. We have set a timetable: 2005, and our fellow Members’ proposals, I believe, move in the right direction. They support the Commission’s proposals, they highlight the need to meet the timetable and, at the same time, they offer and indicate specific aspects. With regard to the report by Mrs Kauppi, I believe that paragraph 16, on the mechanisms which have been applied and proposed – and which the Commission has already implemented – to resolve cross-border extrajudicial disputes relating to financial services, is essential to overcoming possible problems at Member State level. This system and this concern also appear in Mr Katiforis’s report. I congratulate both of them on their work and I repeat that we support them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Karas (PPE-DE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly, I am pleased for both rapporteurs that their reports have met with such broad approval, not only in the Committee but also here in Parliament. It shows that we are all of the opinion that an accelerated process of change on the internal European financial markets must also have consequences for our political work. Of course, this was also highlighted in the report by the Committee of Wise Men on European securities markets regulation chaired by Mr Lamfalussy, which we will be debating later on this week.</p>
<p class="contents">A second piece of evidence for this change is the exponential growth in the volume of shares, of over 30% each year between 1995 and 1999. This is of prime importance, owing to the strategic significance of well-functioning financial markets for increasing economic prosperity in the EU. When the investment services directive is upgraded, three aims must be taken into account simultaneously: firstly, speeding up market integration; secondly, improving the level of protection afforded to investors, and thirdly, market stability. On the one hand this benefits the markets and on the other it protects investors. In this way, financial stability will be safeguarded in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Two further points, which have also already been mentioned, are of concern to me here. Firstly, a fully operational European passport needs to be created for investment firms. In order to use this opportunity and remove the existing obstacles to its introduction, we urgently need to move over to the country-of-origin principle. For major investors this should happen as quickly as possible and for small investors – Mrs Kauppi has already referred to this – the same principle applies but transitional arrangements will probably be necessary. An additional issue in this context is the harmonisation of conduct of business rules, which is a prerequisite for a healthy internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">My second concern is that there should be genuine competition between stock exchanges and trading platforms. To make fair competition possible an appropriate and efficient system of supervision needs to be set up. This should avoid competition being determined and thus distorted by differing rules and the ensuing hunt for the more favourable regulatory framework.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a trend towards ever increasing investments in securities – we also talk about this in connection with pension funds – and that is why I would recommend speedy adoption and implementation, hopefully before 2005. This too would be in line with the Lamfalussy report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They reflect a very large measure of agreement. It is good to hear that speakers have supported these two reports. The Commission has also taken cognisance of these two reports with great pleasure.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well-known that the investment services directive is the bedrock of the EU legislative framework in the field of securities markets. That directive defines common regulatory parameters for investor protection and orderly markets. Five years after its entry into force it is now time to test its roadworthiness. The Commission believes that the judgment must be mitigated. While there have been significant improvements, cross-border provision of investment services continues to be dogged by legal uncertainty and impediments. More fundamentally, the securities trading environment has undergone seismic shifts which pose new challenges for EU regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the timely and coherent responses of the European Parliament to the two communications on the investment services directive. The reports provide clear pointers for the Commission when it prepares its proposal for a modification of the ISD which is due for adoption by the end of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now mention a few specific points which are contained in the report prepared by Mrs Kauppi. The most immediate and tangible objective of the ISD remains the provision of a single passport for investment firms. The Kauppi report cogently addresses the principal hurdle to be overcome, which is the overlapping and conflicting national rules for conduct of business. The approach outlined in the communication in Article 11 has been constrained by the inherent ambiguity of the provision and the absence of relevant jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice. Despite this, the communication sends a clear message, that the cross-border provision of investment services to professional investors should already be subject to home country conduct-of-business rules alone. The definition of professional investor put forward by the Commission on the basis of a consensus reached between national supervisors and FESCO represents a useful starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">Before mentioning some elements which are specific to the report prepared by Mr Katiforis, perhaps I could mention a few aspects which are common to both reports.</p>
<p class="contents">The forthcoming revision of the ISD provides an opportunity to clarify the conditions under which firms and investors engage in cross-border business. The Commission is convinced that the approach advocated by both reports is the only one consistent with a single market. Furthermore, it will ensure that both on-line and off-line provision of investment services will benefit equally from the country-of-origin principle of the e-commerce directive. The challenge is to reach this goal in a manner which offers sufficient safeguards to the retail investor. The ISD communication suggests that this requires some further convergence of conduct-of-business and advertising rules for retail investors. The Commission is hopeful that such convergence can be achieved within a relatively short time-frame.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to a few points which are specific to the report prepared by Mr Katiforis. The Commission believes that inter-exchange competition and the emergence of infrastructures for cross-border trading of securities raise important new regulatory issues. These are not adequately addressed by the current ISD. The Katiforis report cautions against sweeping changes at this time. The Commission is acutely aware of the need to do no harm and of the risks of acting at a time when markets are in a state of flux. However, profound changes in the organisation of the trading infrastructure and increased involvement of household investors in equities investment call for fresh thinking. The Commission agrees with the Katiforis report that clarification of ISD provisions relating to exchanges and trading systems should concentrate on the risk to market integrity. The Commission also agrees that the primary focus of attention should be equity markets where retail investors are more exposed. Mr Katiforis, in his speech, said that he wanted a Commission proposal concerning the integrity of markets as soon as possible. As he may or may not know, the Commission is in the last stages of preparing a proposal on market abuse. That will hopefully be made known in a few weeks time.</p>
<p class="contents">A strengthened ISD will not in itself prevent the sizeable market corrections that we have witnessed in recent weeks. However, a revised ISD can help to contain market excesses by promoting transparency, protecting integrity and ensuring that investment firms always act in the best interests of their clients. Moreover, it can ensure that these protections are enjoyed by investors throughout the European Union, regardless of the origin of the security which they are purchasing or the exchange on which that transaction is executed. Without such a framework, the Lisbon objective of a single integrated capital market, which we all want and need, will remain a dead letter.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now provide a more specific reply to two points raised: the first being criticism of the agreement reached within FESCO on the definition of professional investors, and the second a reply to what Mrs Kauppi said about the link between this issue and the Lamfalussy report.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first issue, criticism of the FESCO definition of professional investors, as yet no legal content has been given to the concept of professional investor by the European Court of Justice. The FESCO agreement represents a first informal attempt to establish a collective European view on this concept and it should be welcomed as a valuable first step towards clarifying this important operational concept. The Commission is, of course, aware of widespread concern that the FESCO agreement is overly restrictive in determining which investors qualify automatically as professionals. This deprives many large and sophisticated investors of the benefits of operating under a single, that is, home-country, light-touch supervisory regime. Nevertheless, given the prevailing uncertainty surrounding the term ‘professional investor’, the Commission believes that the wisest course of action is to make use of an approach which has won support from all national securities authorities. The proposed approach to the definition of professional investor, as set out in both reports, would seem to offer additional advantages from the perspective of a properly functioning single passport. The Commission will study these proposals carefully when preparing the revision of the ISD.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the matter of the interface between this proposal and the well-known Lamfalussy blueprints, the Commission notes the observation made by Mrs Kauppi in her explanatory statement that the revised ISD is – I quote – "a prime candidate to be adopted and implemented according to any new approach which may be agreed in the light of the Lamfalussy reports". The Commission agrees with that view. The ISD communication clearly states that the lack of capacity to issue legally binding guidance on implementation of ISD provisions has been one of the principal factors contributing to the shortfalls and uneven implementation which have bedevilled the ISD. In view of its increased scope and complexity, a revised ISD is likely to suffer even more from such defects: hence the importance of the Lamfalussy report for this issue as for a number of other ones.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, may I once again thank both rapporteurs for the important work they have been doing. May I also thank other Members of this Parliament who have intervened, in particular Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Karas. The Commission would like to assure Parliament that it will act accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
