The Commission's proposal allows for global payments of up to EUR 1 000 and abolishes the complicated application procedure for small farms.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development support this proposal but feel that EUR 1 000 is rather low and have proposed that this limit be raised to EUR 1 500, thereby allowing about a third of all farms in Europe to apply for global payments. Of course, this varies from one country to another. I think Mr Cunha will be addressing this point. In Portugal the proportion is, of course, much higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We also suggest that the provision in Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation No 1229/99 requiring environmental standards to be observed should also apply here. What we do not want is for global payments to small farms to be used to make savings. If a farm claims global payment, it is not entitled to increases to compensation payments under Agenda 2000 as years go by, because global payments are based on past payments. This means that these farms are not entitled to increases, which is why we suggest a 20% increase in global payments.</p>
<p class="contents">It could be argued that this 20% increase would also be justified by revising payments directly in line with increases. We take the view that this is rather too complicated, but we do not want small farms to be punished by this regulation when payments are made. You know all about the arguments in connection with premium payments: large, rationalised farms in Europe, wherever they may be, receive a very large sum of money for their labour force. Given that such a small sum is paid to small farms, which also need a labour force, I think that the Commission should not be looking to make savings from this labour force and from these farms.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Fischler, you have proposed or rather considered that farms of this size could perhaps receive up to EUR 5,000 in future under the second pillar in that, because of how they are managed, these farms help to shape the countryside in the ecological and social sense, provided that they observe certain environmental standards. We should not therefore be looking to make savings with this regulation and from these small farms by excluding them. Otherwise we would have to advise these farms not to claim global payment, because they are of course entitled to full payment – this does not repeal the law – if they do not opt for global payment. This could lead to a situation in which this measure, which we feel is reasonable, is not taken up by small farms because they say, no, we want the full payment, even if it is only a very small amount. However, because it is such a small amount and because it only affects small farms, which basically do a good job in the countryside, you should reconsider. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact the experience we now have of implementing the CAP is that in practice it marginalises small farmers, defined in this proposal as those who have received less than one thousand euro per year on average over the last three years. First, because aids per hectare or per head of livestock made up only a tiny part of the income of these farmers, who often have no more than five or ten hectares of arable land or half a dozen animals. Secondly, because as a rule small farmers have to do the same amount of paperwork as is required for 10, 50 or even 100 times as much aid; sometimes they have to fill out a dozen different forms every year to get a sometimes ridiculous amount of aid. In other words, the small amount of aid for these farmers added to the paperwork involved means that the great majority of small farmers do not feel at all motivated to apply for the aid to which they are entitled.</p>
<p class="contents">While this assessment of the proposal being debated is positive in principle, I should like to make three observations: the first is that I think the change approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to raise the threshold from one thousand to fifteen hundred euro seems reasonable, as it will include potentially a third of the farmers in the European Union and more than two-thirds in some countries, like mine. It is a cautious but realistic start, which I think is both reasonable and important. In addition, the change also approved here to increase the level of aid over the last three years by 20% is important in my view, in part because this level has not yet stabilised following the Agenda 2000 reform, and it is also yet another incentive for small farmers to apply for aid. Certain aids, however, have still been left out, such as those for olive oil, bananas, tobacco, potato starch, etc., and I hope that these too will be included in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the principle of uncoupling aids from farmers’ productive options has some potential, but it cannot lead to the abandonment of the requirement for a farmer to have some effective production. Otherwise we might be encouraging absenteeism.</p>
<p class="contents">My third observation is that in future we will have to consider another scale of aid for small farmers, who should receive a relatively higher rate of aid than large or middle-sized holdings, or else this aid will be ineffective. This is fundamental. Aid to small farms cannot be calculated at the same basic rate as other aids. We will also have to have new bases for allocating aids, since basing them on an average amount received over the last three years excludes those small farmers who grow products that are not eligible for aid, but which from the standpoint of multifunctionality should also be entitled to it, like the others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The proposal recognises that in many instances the administrative costs of managing and processing the aid do not match the amount of aid that these small-scale farmers receive. According to the Commission’s own data, 23.2% of farms receive direct payments of less than EUR 1 000, the amount set by the Commission as the maximum to be received under the simplified system. However, 48% of farms receive less than EUR 2 000 and, as has already been pointed out, there is a great deal of variation within the Member States. This indicates to us that if we want the simplified system to be effective, the maximum amount should be increased to EUR 1 500, as approved by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, we feel that it is unacceptable for any change to the management and payment system to be financially detrimental to those farmers with the lowest income capacity and who receive a lower percentage of aid. We therefore support the rapporteur’s proposal that single global payments, which are calculated on the basis of the actual payments received in previous years, should be increased by 20% to compensate for the increase in future payments outside the simplified scheme. This will prevent discrimination and the possible negative financial effects that this proposal could have on small-scale farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish this initiative, which seems to be an experimental one, every success in its implementation and I hope that the Commission will continue to put proposals to us that move forward in the sense of simplifying the system and the management of agricultural policy, which is essential for achieving greater transparency, bringing Community policy closer to the European people and helping them to understand it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The CAP aid schemes needed simplifying. Despite the simplifications, we must guard against the risks of spoiling them or reducing their effectiveness. In this context, what is surprising in the Commission proposal is the lack of detail in the scope of the measure and the fact that the Commission is relying on the accounting network to evaluate it. The value of the Graefe zu Baringdorf report thus deserves recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">I would recall that I prepared a report and later Mrs Redondo prepared another which proposed statistical treatment of the EAGGF (Guarantee Section) payments to provide us with accurate information about the implementation of the CAP. The Commission did not accept it at first, but then agreed to move in that direction. I believe that if we had done that we would today have much more precise information about the subjects we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the subject in question, I think there are certain finer points that have to be taken into account with regard to the Commission’s initial proposal: the granting of aid without making it conditional on keeping up the activity runs the risk of deteriorating the economic fabric and creating a system of patronage in the sector, which over the last ten years has seen the loss of 30% of holdings and over 25% of jobs. There may also be problems with this system regarding its ability to differentiate between aid for small-scale holdings and that for part-time farming.</p>
<p class="contents">In these conditions I believe that what Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has done is of enormous value and has the support of my political group, and I would just like to say that we should have liked even more to support Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s initial proposal in its entirety and not as it ended up, as a result of the vote in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. In any case, we shall be supporting his report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the Commission proposal to introduce, on a trial basis, a simplified system for the payment of direct income support to farmers. Although the scheme initially will apply only to farmers in receipt of small payments, it is nonetheless an indication of the willingness on the part of the Commission to respond to requests from this House, and indeed from national governments, for a simplified and less bureaucratic system of administering EU support for agriculture. Since farming systems on most family farms are broadly similar, the principle of averaging payments over a three-year period seems to be reasonable and fair</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission should clarify the procedure in relation to the application of penalties within that averaging system. The proposal will result in less paperwork for farmers and a more cost-effective system for administration by national governments. I support the Agriculture Committee's view that the upper limit should be increased by 20%, and agree with many of the comments made earlier by Mr Cunha. I hope that the maximum number of eligible farmers will opt to participate in this scheme and that the experiences gained will lead to its extension to other farmers in the future. Given that many small family farms are under pressure and that there is a reluctance on the part of young people to take up farming as a career, I believe that the upper ceiling should be at a level that will encourage small-holdings and those dependent on farming for an income to continue operating.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the qualification has an environmental requirement. There has been an enormous improvement in the environmental profile of the rural of countryside, resulting from farmer participation in the rural environmental protection scheme and the environmental requirements of a reformed CAP. This is a very useful proposal that certainly should be encouraged, and I thank the Commissioner for bringing it to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this sense this move is a very fundamental one. When travelling anywhere in the EU, talking to farmers, the first and only thing you hear is that bureaucracy, vast amounts of paperwork and the associated difficulties are creating a very negative picture for farmers. This is a very important issue especially as far as the smallest farmers are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long term the scheme should be developed so that rural development activities are linked to it. The scheme should also include an expansion bonus, even now in its initial stages. It surprises me that the Commission is working on the basis of a policy whereby growth in income under the scheme would be set at a fixed level rather than being index-linked. The rapporteur has correctly intervened in the matter and pointed out that there is an opportunity for raising support outside the scheme by virtue of the agenda solution. I see this as a very important point. To make the scheme attractive also to farms attempting to improve production, our committee’s proposal on raising the level of support is justified. The level can be discussed but the principle especially on this matter is very important. For this reason this trial, which at the moment is experimental and temporary, should receive widespread support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the scant information contained in the report and from the farm accounting data network, 23.2% of the farms in the network are paid less than EUR 1 000 per annum in direct aid. The actual figure is much higher if we take account of farms outside the network, which are obviously small holdings, meaning that far more than 23.2% of all Community holdings receive a mere 1.4% of total direct aid. This item of information, which the Commission deliberately omits, proves that statements by senior Commission officials to the effect that the supposed aim of the Community budget and direct aid is to iron out inequalities between the rich and poor farming regions of the European Union and between large and small holdings are pure hypocrisy. As a result, 20% of the large farm holdings in the European Union receive 80% of Community subsidies, as the former Commissioner, Mr MacSharry discovered to his surprise and, unfortunately, the situation is getting worse.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the way in which direct aid is distributed benefits large farm holdings at the expense of small farms, thereby constantly increasing the income differential between rich and poor farming regions and between large, capitalist-style holdings and small, family-run farms, because the way in which direct aid is distributed is helping to wipe out small holdings and because the Commission proposal makes no attempt to get to the nub of the problem, the members of the Community Party of Greece will be voting against the Commission proposal and the parliamentary report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Simplification of the direct support scheme has become essential, and so it is important to make progress in this field, even if only experimentally. Parliament’s report improves the Commission proposal by broadening the scope of the simplified scheme to include farmers who get up to 1500 euro per year and also increasing aid by 20%. However, given the characteristics of the agricultural sector in Portugal, we would have preferred the threshold of the scheme to be put at 2500 euro, as Friedrich Wilhelm Graefe zu Baringdorf had proposed, which would ensure that many more Portuguese farmers would enter the scheme. I therefore regret the proposal by Arlindo Cunha to reduce this threshold to 1500 euro. Yet we must be careful that this simplified scheme is not used by the Commission to achieve other objectives, that is, in connection with a reform of the CAP: clear conditions for access to the simplified scheme must be defined in collaboration with the national governments with a view to guaranteeing that agricultural activity is maintained. In any case, I support the report presented by Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Honourable Members, the Court of Auditors complained in its opinion on the Agenda 2000 reforms that the authorities in the Member States disburse relatively modest sums in aid to a relatively large number of farmers at considerable administrative expense. Quite a few Member States have expressed similar views at working party meetings chaired by the Agriculture Directorate-General.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal is the Commission's answer to these complaints. It should make life easier both for the national authorities and, more importantly, for the farmers who are entitled to use this simplified system in future. The most important advantage for the farmers is that they will have to fill in fewer forms and the conditions which they must meet in order to obtain aid will be much simpler. For the national authorities, the time needed to process applications and carry out controls will be cut.</p>
<p class="contents">I am hugely in favour of simplifying the common agricultural policy. This proposal is a first step in this direction; it is something completely new and, having concentrated in the past on simplifying provisions which then prove to be difficult, complicated or too expensive to apply, this is a new approach, although we shall certainly continue to work on simplifying provisions already in force.</p>
<p class="contents">As numerous aspects of the small producers' regulations have yet to be tested, we must ensure that this is an endeavour which can initially be implemented up to 2005. This is also why the Commission has deliberately limited the scope of the regulation to a specific selection of direct payments and set a relatively low ceiling in order to preclude any risks and ensure that it stays in the Court of Auditors' good books.</p>
<p class="contents">This regulation will be evaluated before the trial period ends and I sincerely hope that this evaluation will then form the basis for a more comprehensive, more ambitious, long-term solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the individual proposed amendments. The environmental requirements in Regulation 1259/99 will continue to apply because they are already covered in the regulation, meaning that Amendment No 1 is redundant. The 20% increase to payments proposed in Amendments Nos 2 and 3 will, I think, cause problems. First, the regulation would no longer be without any impact on the budget and we would have to reckon on additional costs of about EUR 100 million per annum.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the sole purpose of the proposal is to find a simpler way of getting current aid to farmers. May I also point out that farmers can, in any case, opt to use the average of the last three years or the previous year as a basis. It is true that, to an extent, we are in a transitional stage. However, this transition has closed today for all surface area premiums. As far as beef premiums are concerned, there will be a further increase next year. I can confirm that. If a farmer really feels that he would lose money here, then he is entitled to file a normal application again this year and not to join the global payment system for another year. In other words, it is not the Commission's intention to disadvantage farmers. Nor is there, however, any justification for increasing premiums through the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept the suggestion in Amendment No 4 to raise the proposed ceiling above EUR 1 000 but will have to reject Amendment No 5. The decision to apply this system must be taken at the trial stage at national level when the Member States are given the opportunity to apply the small producer regulation on a regional basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You said we would need another hundred million. According to the calculations in your proposal, the payments affected here – if I remember correctly – represent 1.6% of all payments. In other words they are minute. As Mr Pesälä said, we were not looking to increase premiums, we were just trying to keep things simple. If the Commission makes sure that it adds the additional premium increase for the farms to the global payment system, then we would be satisfied. We are not trying to increase premiums through the back door, even though these holdings are sorely in need of an increase. That is another kettle of fish, however. To make savings here is out of order, however. Given that you were so quick to work out or to get someone to work out the figure of one hundred million for you, then we would be most interested to know how much would be saved if the premium was not increased. Because that would represent a saving and a reduction in premiums to the detriment of these small farms and I think we should prevent that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we understood the proposal, there would be an across-the-board increase of 20%, which would generate considerable additional costs here. As I have already said, all increases in premiums under Agenda 2000 are covered here, with the exception of the last increase which is due to be applied to the beef sector on 1 July. All the others have already been included; and the increase in the beef sector next year will not be 20%, it will be around 10%. So if a farmer – and he has the choice – feels he would do well to wait another year before opting for global payments, then he can do so, and then this beef farmer would enter the global payment system a year later. He has that choice and will not be disadvantaged as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is not to make so-called savings and no such insinuation should be made; our objective is to make people's lives easier here while guaranteeing budgetary neutrality. For the rest, as I said, this first step is a trial and once it has been applied for three years <span class="bold">–</span> no even sooner, because we want a sort of midterm review; in theory we can check whether or not things are working out once it has been up and running for a year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
