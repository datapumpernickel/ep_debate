<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Read </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span><span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, first of all, can I say that the Parliament and the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee recognise that the implementation of universal service is at a very early stage and I hope that my criticisms, as set out in the report, will be taken in that spirit.</p>
<p class="contents">I want also to remind us all that the European Parliament's support for the liberalisation process of telecommunications goes hand in hand with the introduction and implementation of universal service. It is very clear that market forces cannot, at least in the short run, deliver on universal service. If this does happen through market forces in the next year I shall be the first to congratulate and draw attention to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, as the text of my report makes clear, there is a lack of information from the Member States on which to assess progress. I give some examples: there is a lack of truly harmonised national data, there are failures to achieve uniform tariffs across an operational territory. It is particularly disappointing that in half the Member States there has been a substantial rise in rental charges for the residential consumer. Of course, this weighs particularly heavily on the infrequent user, often elderly, housebound, who cuts down on telephone calls. It is important, too, to draw attention to the disabled users. Remember in the voice telephony directive, the Parliament placed great stress on the rights of disabled users to access to telephones, both from a social point of view and also from the point of view of being able to gain work often from home. Disabled users on the whole in the Community still do not benefit from satisfactory, special arrangements. Indeed, the general trend seems to be that there is a penalty for residential users. Although charges have come down they have come down disproportionately in favour of international calls which of course heavily favour the business user. I am not being critical of those reductions in charges but I am drawing attention to the unsatisfactory skew against the residential user.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to draw particular attention to Paragraph 9 in the report which talks about the lack of definition of affordability by the Member States. Without that definition of affordability it really does deprive consumers of a sound legal base with which to defend their interests. I know how hard the Commission worked on getting the balance right between being over‐prescriptive from the point of view of directives and allowing Member States some discretion, but it does rather shake one's faith in the amount of discretion that is left to the Member States when on something as basic as the definition of affordability there really has been comparatively little progress.</p>
<p class="contents">After I had drafted this report, BEUC, the European Union consumers' organisation, produced their own analysis on the implementation of the voice telephony directive. Like me, they recognised that it is comparatively early days. Nevertheless, the evidence contained in the BEUC report and the lack of satisfactory evidence supplied to the Commission give some cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end on a personal note because I think the views of consumers in this field across the European Union really are important. I tried to change my telephone. Formerly a British Telecom consumer I switched some 18 months ago to Ionica, a company that sadly has now gone out of business. I transferred my number, as my colleague Mr van Velzen laid down and as the Commission rightly proposed. When I now try and change to a cable company I am told that number portability is not possible. If I want to keep my own number my only choice is to go back to British Telecom, the old public monopoly. It was a salutary lesson for me that, in spite of all the efforts of the Commission and the efforts of the Parliament, in practical terms it is still very rare to find true effective competition at local level for the domestic consumer. I very much hope that the Commissioner will accept this report with its criticisms and I hope that it will strengthen his arm and those of his officials in making greater and speedier demands on the Member States to truly implement a universal service in the telephone field.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Camisón Asensio </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by paying tribute to the wonderful parliamentary work undertaken by the rapporteur, Mrs Read, during the preparation of this report. I must also say how pleased I am that almost all our amendments – eight in total – were adopted by the Committee on Economic Affairs. These amendments were of great importance to us. Amongst other issues, we called for increased social support for the most vulnerable users – the less able – the dissemination of information to consumers, due consideration of the needs of low‐income users and a halt to the current discrimination against residential consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Given our commitment to the aim of putting a genuine information society in place as soon as possible, we are also delighted that this initiative represents a further step towards the implementation of agreements concerning interconnection arrangements, making preferential tariffs for schools, libraries and other educational institutions a reality. I am of course referring to the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">We remain concerned that the European Union has not yet adopted a uniform approach to providing a sensitive response to the needs of the disabled. Even now, one Member State is proposing to make free access to directory enquiry services available only to the visually impaired. Another has so far failed to put forward any proposals. I am aware that reduced connection charges and free specially adapted equipment are available in many Member States. I recognise that substantial progress has been made, but the final goal, the ideal, is yet to be achieved. In addition, if we are serious about making the European Union increasingly cohesive, a determined effort is urgently needed to put in place the facilities which should be available to consumers in less populated areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Universality of service in the telecommunications sector must be further promoted. I refer not only to take up but also to improvements in the quality of the service offered. For instance, we should press for an across‐the‐board reduction in the waiting time for connection to the network or for supply, and of the time taken for repairs to be carried out. Equally important are improving accessibility to services and the regulation of costs, particularly as regards implementation of the option of spreading payment, types of prepayment, and less distressing disconnection procedures. The introduction of reasonable rates for selected calls and provision by the operators of a range of service packages tailored to the customers" needs should also be considered.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, this report certainly represents a significant step forward, but a lot of ground remains to be covered.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ribeiro </span> <span class="bold">(GUE/NGL).</span> – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, a motion for a resolution from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy is now before us, relating to the first monitoring report on universal service in telecommunications. In this motion, Mrs Read has given us an excellent opportunity to reflect on the changeover from what were public services originating in the public sector to the so‐called universal service to be provided by private companies.</p>
<p class="contents">Our worst fears and expectations have been confirmed. The promises and commitments made have not been fulfilled. The liberalisation and privatisation of the sector has not led to the fall in prices for the economically weakest users which universal service should have provided as a result of the much vaunted virtues of competition. On the contrary, the most powerful users economically speaking, namely multinational firms, have benefited from the change, and the private operators which have come to dominate the sector have even been able to obtain other lucrative benefits through the public financing intended to mitigate the change, contrary to the spirit of universal service, not to mention the public service obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the current competition in mobile telephony, in addition to causing changes in social behaviour, has altered the parameters of the telecommunications market. However, this cannot justify the rises in rental charges and the increased costs of local calls, even to the extent of creating perverse situations where prices for currently competing products are increased in order to assist the introduction of new and more lucrative products.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal and Portugal Telecom – and it is impossible in many respects to determine whether the latter is the original or copy of other telecom services – appear, in this process and in this monitoring report, to be in a rather unsatisfactory situation from the point of view of social balance and justice. These elements should be inherent in universal service if this is not just to be an attractive way of dismantling the public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal is participating in the global tariff increase and is one of nine countries which have increased rental charges. It is also, with Germany, one of only two countries which have increased installation costs in addition to having created the activation charge which particularly penalises the poorest users. This monitoring report therefore also provides a way of assessing something which is much more than just a name – ’universal service" instead of ‘public service" – it is a whole philosophy which is self‐revealing as it has shown how commitments which were used as justification or even a pretext have been sidelined or even ignored.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Crowley </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, I too would like to join with my colleagues in welcoming the report by Mrs Read. In particular it now gives us an opportunity to look at the question of liberalisation and its effect on the universal service question.</p>
<p class="contents">What is common to all the public utilities across Europe is the fact that they were originally established to ensure there was a social equality with regard to the distribution of services. Whether one looked at telecoms, post office services, water supplies and so on, there was this idea of universality. No matter what part of a country one lived in one got the same level of service at the same cost as everybody else. Because of the advent of liberalisation and greater competition, which I welcome, let me hasten to add, we have also learned of some of the mistakes that can be made by just having a headlong rush into liberalisation. There must be some restrictions and some controlling mechanisms and methods with regard to that liberalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of my colleagues have already touched on the points. I would like to deal with four particular points: firstly, ensuring that there is no cherry‐picking of the most profitable and easily serviceable areas of telecoms. Secondly, dealing with special facilities for the elderly population, particularly in this year, the International Year of the Elderly. When we look at the increase in the numbers of people who are over 55 years of age in the European Union there is a social necessity to ensure them ease of access to telecommunication networks at very low cost, sometimes at no cost at all. To give you one example, in Ireland telephone line rental for people who are on the old age pension is free. Next, the disabled. Because the new technologies which have been brought forward do offer new opportunities for communications and for greater interaction of people with disabilities and the wider community that should be encouraged and given at a lower rate. Finally, with the Internet now being presented to us, we must ensure that this resource is tapped for the greater good not for exclusivity.</p>

I also support the amendments that are designed to take account of these new factors. We must, for example, be absolutely rigorous in ensuring that disabled people are given access to service models that meet their special needs. The development of public access to the Internet, in schools and libraries for instance, is an extremely important matter to which this and other Parliaments ought to devote more attention in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The information society must not lead to wider social disparities. If access by part of the population to the information media is denied or obstructed, stark differences in education levels will result, and these could create a glaring inequality of opportunity in the job market.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Rübig </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the liberalisation of the telecommunications sector was a pioneering strategy which not only represented another step from the single market towards a European domestic market, but also had a significant dimension in terms of employment. This development was referred to when we assessed the implementation of the reform package. The information society is currently responsible for every fourth new job in the European Union. For that we owe our thanks to the Commission, and especially to Mr Bangemann.</p>
<p class="contents">The Read report makes the accessibility of the basic services at acceptable prices and standards of quality a prerequisite of our support for the present liberalisation process. I would like to go further than that. The provision of a universal service can ultimately be a logical result and product of liberalisation. What exactly are the universal services? They are generally held to comprise a minimum range of telecommunications services of a certain quality that can be made available to all users at reasonable prices. This includes access to standard public telephone services, such as 999 calls, directory enquiries and special facilities for people with particular disabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject is therefore important in terms of the general confidence which the European technology of the future must enjoy. It is also clear that in many areas, market forces cannot be given free rein from the outset. That is why the concept of affordability is such a topical issue these days – and rightly so. The affordability principle means that the Member States set geographical average prices, price ceilings and so forth. One of the important aspects of this mechanism is the scope for easing unreasonable burdens on providers of universal services. But I do support the Commission when it says that such measures can only apply until the market is competitive enough to exercise effective price control itself.</p>

It is integral and indispensable to the information society which Europe increasingly wants to join and it is the gateway to a global market of which the European internal market is the vanguard.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are several points to be considered. Firstly, there is a great disparity between tariff trends in terms of installation costs and rental charges and between the costs of local, regional, national and international calls. Some countries have low costs, others have high costs, but this report does not give a clear and comparative view of the costs of using the European telecommunications networks in the various Member States. We believe that the more open the telecommunications market becomes to competition from the private sector, the more responsible it will be for regulating itself and for ensuring a minimum harmonisation of the European tariff system.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is clear that users on low incomes and the more peripheral and isolated regions are the sectors most prejudiced by the current tariff regimes. This is an aspect often neglected by the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the use of the Internet has exploded, and it is now being adopted by individuals, companies and institutions. However, it is in no way accessible to everyone and it is far from forming a basic instrument for the promotion of solidarity and equal treatment. Negotiations on creating an Internet card or code are continuing but the Internet remains outside the universal service in telecommunications.</p>
<p class="contents">We totally agree with the adoption of measures which will allow special tariffs to be granted to schools, libraries and other equivalent institutions and to charitable and non‐profit‐making organisations. Public access to the Internet must be regarded as a personal right and as a strategic position in the fight against a new form of emerging illiteracy which will afflict all those in the future who have not mastered the use of the modern information technologies or who do not have access to them.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. – (DE) </span>Mr President, may I express my sincere thanks to Mrs Read as well as to everyone else who has contributed to this discussion for their comments. The Commission is trying to find sensible solutions to this diverse set of problems. The report we have presented is not entirely up to date, because it cannot yet cover the implementation of the voice telephony directive in its amended form. In other words, when we present another updated report this year as part of our task of evaluating the implementation of the existing directives, we shall be far better able to deal with some of your questions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, I should like to focus especially on four questions that have resurfaced in this discussion. First there is the question how the Member States have established what affordability means. Some Member States, anticipating the amended voice telephony directive, have already introduced more stringent measures to protect consumers. Amongst other things, there are price‐monitoring and prepayment systems, particularly in the field of mobile telephony. Six Member States – Denmark, Germany, Spain, France, Finland and the United Kingdom – have already notified us that they have transposed the amended directive. We expect that Belgium, Greece, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden will shortly announce similar measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As one speaker said in the course of today's discussion, affordability depends to a great extent on income levels in individual Member States. These vary widely. Average incomes in some areas are three or four times the average income in another. For that reason we are really relying on the Member States, in accordance with the solidarity principle, to take greater responsibility in this area than we could take ourselves. What we shall be able to do, however, is to provide details in the new report of the progress that has been made in implementing the stricter consumer safeguards.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question relates to support for low‐income users and disabled users, as well as for occasional users. We have recommended special tariffs for such users precisely because we wish to counteract the first adverse effects of liberalisation that we, like others, expect to occur. We have now managed – and Mrs Read knows this, as do her colleagues who have spoken on this subject, because they have all been studying these things – to achieve quite considerable reductions in mobile call charges this year, which incidentally has had a knock‐on effect on standard call charges for fixed‐network subscribers. Moreover, the amended voice telephony directive provides for special tariffs for low‐income users, price ceilings and affordability criteria in Article 3 and prescribes special measures for disabled users and users with special social needs in Article 8.</p>
<p class="contents">This, it should be said, has now been transposed into the national law of five Member States – not just of France, as the report stated, but also of Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United Kingdom. The new report will show us how things have developed from there. The Commission, like Parliament, is anxious to ensure that the new legislation is actually benefiting these groups of users.</p>
<p class="contents">How should the operators of the universal service be chosen? The Commission has no objections to any system that ensures the provision of a convenient, cost‐effective universal service. The services may be put out to tender, but they may also be based on a cost calculation, prices then being fixed to cover only the net cost of the service. That is why we do not wish to come down on the side of any particular process.</p>
<p class="contents">The final question concerns the widening of public access to the Internet and especially the use of the Internet by public institutions. We have always said that this is absolutely crucial to the development of the information society, and we are now gratified to note that competition has developed among service providers, as a result of which interfaces have become more user‐friendly and charges have been reduced. That is not the case everywhere, Mr President, and Mrs Read was right to criticise this state of affairs. The root of the problem has been the so‐called rebalancing of tariffs, whereby the relatively cheap local calls have become more expensive while the price of the relatively expensive trunk calls and international calls has been reduced; since Internet access is obtained through a local number, it initially became more expensive than it had been.</p>
<p class="contents">But that is now in the past. We have certainly been observing price reductions; special rates for schools and other special tariffs are in no way inconsistent with the rules of competition, and we encourage these as long as the marginal cost is covered. I can promise you that we intend to re‐examine the universal service in connection with the review of legislation scheduled for the end of 1999, and that we shall subsequently communicate the results to Parliament.</p>
