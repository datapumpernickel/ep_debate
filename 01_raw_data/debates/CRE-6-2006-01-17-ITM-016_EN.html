It is the major disasters that occurred a few years ago, involving collapsing mine embankments, above all in Romania and Spain. They were environmental disasters that had huge consequences for the surrounding environment and that also poisoned the water systems.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are our constant environmental problems in which waste from existing and old plant spreads heavy metals and other poisons in our immediate environment. This means that a special directive is needed to regulate waste from the mining industry and other extractive industries.</p>
<p class="contents">When we look at the proposal put forward by the Commission a few years ago and at the proposal on which we are to take a decision tomorrow, there are significant differences. Parliament has definitely helped make this directive better and more forceful. A host of Parliament’s amendments were adopted as early as at first reading, and quite a few have been added at this reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to highlight a number of specific parts of this report as being particularly important. Firstly, rules on embankment safety have been devised to prevent this type of disaster from occurring in the future. The method involving high concentrations of cyanide, used in Romania, is also banned by this directive. There will be clear rules on authorisation and on how this is to take place, and it will be possible to see which environmental problems can be remedied. An absolute obligation is also laid down to respect the Water Directive, whereby no water status deterioration may be caused.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also rules to the effect that the site at which the mining takes place must be rehabilitated. This directive is to put an end to the era in which waste and damaged sites were left behind. So that it might do this, a financial guarantee is introduced for which companies must earmark resources for the purpose of rehabilitating the sites at which they have engaged in mining.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the new Member States, above all Romania but also Bulgaria, we reached a stage during the conciliation when these countries produced declarations in which they undertook not to seek exemptions but instead to respect all the rules of the directive. This is important, especially because Romania has significant problems in this area. When it comes to historical waste, the Member States are required to compile an inventory whereby they have to investigate where there may be historic waste causing environmental problems. Overall, there will be a significant improvement in the environmental situation in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The arguments against these measures have mainly been financial in the sense that the measures would cost companies money. It is important to realise, however, that the environmental costs of rehabilitating the land would be part of companies’ production costs and that this is only right. Not including them in production costs would benefit the less than serious players. A directive such as this favours serious mining companies that accept responsibility for their environmental policy. This directive will also make it easier to produce new environmental technology, enabling the historical waste to be dealt with, and it will provide European industry with an opportunity in this sphere. Last but not least – and most important of all – is the fact that it will benefit the environment and the health of those who live in the areas concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is not, of course, perfect. Directives are very rarely perfect. There are a few aspects of it I should like to have seen given more weight. The rules governing waste not classified as dangerous are weaker than they should be. This is due to the Council, which made changes for the worse to the directive at first reading. I did not obtain the decision I should have liked from Parliament that would have enabled these changes to be negotiated away.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to waste plants, the definition is too weak and too generous towards the industry, and this is in danger of creating certain loopholes. Where historic waste is concerned, there are no clear requirements to take measures for dealing with this. It is important to realise, however, that under the EU’s other environmental legislation, above all the Framework Water Directive, there is an absolute obligation to deal with those cases in which historic waste is seen to lead to water status deterioration. This means that the directive as a whole is still sound. We can be satisfied with the work we have done during the last few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should also like to take this opportunity to thank those with whom I have worked, including the shadow rapporteurs for the various groups whose constructive cooperation I have enjoyed. I should like to thank the officials of the European Commission who, this time, have been excellent to collaborate with, together with the Presidency, which conducted a very constructive conciliation. It has been a simple matter to cooperate with them and to find practical solutions to the various problems we faced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are only a few of us left now, this being the third reading. I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt – our ‘pacesetter’ – who, with expert knowledge and a great deal of energy, managed to maintain the momentum of the negotiations all the way to the Conciliation Committee. Mr Sjöstedt succeeded in never losing sight of the goal, whilst clearly recognising when the time had come for closure and ultimately also for final compromises. I am much obliged to him for this.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on the management of waste from the extractive industries is, therefore, a success for the environment, for enterprises in the mining industry, and thus also for human beings. Environmentally sustainable activity does not just consist in doing nothing and making unspoilt nature the measure of all things, so to speak. Instead, we human beings have been set the – even biblical – task of subduing the earth.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is not characterised by primeval forest and unspoilt landscapes, but rather is known worldwide for its cultivated landscapes, developed over centuries. These should be used by people for people according to the principle of sustainability. Yet all intervention in nature also has concomitant effects; it would not be correct to say that mining has no impact on nature and the environment. Therefore, when assessing all intervention, return must be weighed up against expenditure, benefit against burden. As a result of the positive developments, technical possibilities and heightened environmental sensitivity of today, the yardsticks we use now are different from those we used just 50 years ago. We must put these achievements to good use in the interests of human safety and of preserving the health of our environment. We must also continue to stay on the ball at all times so that we can make use of the new possibilities that will undoubtedly present themselves in 5, 10 or even 20 years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">It was the serious accidents in the metal ore mining sector in Spain and Romania in the last 10 years that induced Parliament to call for this directive. Now that we have it, I think that we are on the right track towards achieving something positive for the environment and for human beings.</p>

At that time my country was not a member of the European Union. Still the Commission and the European Parliament understood the problem and initiated a directive on the management of such waste. Mr Sjöstedt went to the site of the pollution, studied the facts, heard all the witnesses and experts, and then drew up an excellent report. That is what I call a good and responsible job of a politician. His report is based on real facts, on real dangers, and provides us with real solutions. Thank you, Mr Sjöstedt.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group supported the report from the beginning. At second reading, together with other colleagues, I tabled many amendments for stricter regulation. Most of them were accepted by the rapporteur and later by the Conciliation Committee. On water pollution issues, we tried to ensure compliance with other Community obligations, most of which were imposed under the Water Framework Directive. The compromise reached by conciliation is not ideal, but it is acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The financial guarantees must be sufficient to cover the cost of the rehabilitation of the land affected by the waste facility. This is a success for us.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also satisfied with clarification of the closure operation. However, we lost an important battle. We Socialist MEPs wanted the discharge of waste to any receiving body of water to be authorised before the operation. For me, prevention is the most environmentally friendly solution. Perhaps later everybody will understand this principle, not only in this House, but in the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In general we obtained a good directive. Member States, would-be Member States and third countries should respect the new regulatory framework. We have to monitor the strict implementation of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also of major significance for the extractive industries, which will have to bear the cost of implementing it, and it will have a major impact in that it will allow an agreement to be reached and the interests of all parties to be reconciled.</p>
<p class="contents">This directive is worthy of our approval. Nevertheless, like every document it will be subject to changing economic conditions, and we will only discover how effective it is once it has been implemented in practice. Future revisions will provide us with an opportunity to make certain amendments to it. For example, mining waste frequently contains mineral components that should be reclaimed in order to limit the need for further excavations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one will say this about the Directive tabled before us. On the contrary, we succeeded in creating an internationally groundbreaking, milestone regulation. This regulation was created in the aftermath of the mining disaster that took place in 2000 in Baia Mare, Romania, to make sure that the environment and nature do not suffer such pollution ever again.</p>
<p class="contents">When disaster strikes, all we can do is to limit and mitigate damages and pay compensation, but, as we have seen in this case, with little success. Natural environment was destroyed, and so far there have been no judgments passed in any of the damage compensation trials, which have almost stalled.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the directive tabled before us emphasises prevention, which is always a key issue in making our future safe and avoiding environmental disasters caused by human negligence. However, the Directive does not only regulate future mines and their waste material, but also the old, abandoned mines and those that are still operating, often in a deplorable technical condition. As a member of Parliament’s Conciliation Committee, I would like to say a particular thank you for the work of Mr Sjöstedt, Mr Roth-Behrendt and Mr Florenz who took part in the trialogue. On behalf of Hungary, I would also like to thank them for identifying with my concern and proposal, as a result of which we achieved that the acceding Romania and Bulgaria are not applying for transitional exemption from the implementation of the Directive, as demonstrated in their attached statement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Eastern Carpathians hold many treasures, and their extraction constitutes an important economic foundation of regional development. However, extraction should only be performed in a sustainable manner, taking into account the interests of the environment and nature to the highest extent. This is the subject matter of this directive, and this is what it facilitates. I am delighted that I had the privilege to participate in the creation of this regulation, which is so important for our common future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me echo my colleague Mr Olajos, who rightly emphasised that, with this legislative proposal, we have really hit upon an issue that directly affects the safety of the public and of the environment, and thus we are by no means creating superfluous European regulations that, as it were, only serve to burden the economy. In this case, too, of course, a compromise does mean that the regulation gives rise to certain costs, but I believe that these costs are justified and can certainly be borne by industry, since assets as important as human health are at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">A particularly important achievement of the compromise is that financial guarantees are now required to cover the potential cost arising from land affected by a waste facility. Arrangements such as these have to be made in advance, of course, as accidents very often result in mine operators declaring bankruptcy. This means that the funds necessary to at least institute countervailing measures are lacking, and the general public is left to bear the consequences again.</p>
<p class="contents">Various aspects of waste management have also been specified much more precisely, particularly for the eventuality that the operator puts extractive waste into excavation voids during rehabilitation of the site. This kind of rehabilitation requires strict compliance with the legal provisions so as to preclude any soil or water pollution. In addition, operators have to take monitoring, maintenance and remedial measures: for example, they are obliged to collect or treat contaminated water or leachate. It is important that the acceding countries, Bulgaria and Romania, too, make statements pledging to respect the new provisions – let us not forget Baia Mare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
