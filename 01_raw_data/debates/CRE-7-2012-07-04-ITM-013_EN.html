Tomorrow’s decision may seem technical and non-political at first glance, relating to the internal reorganisation of the three courts that comprise the Court of Justice of the European Union; however there is more to it than that.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has been, and continues to be, invested with more and more powers and responsibilities, most recently through the Treaty of Lisbon. Accordingly, the responsibilities of the Court of Justice of the European Union have also gradually expanded. Thus, the excessive workload cannot be attributed solely to the increasing number of cases – in common with many Member States – quite apart from the accession of 12 new Member States. In fact, the number of cases concluded has lagged behind the number of newly received cases for many years. In this context, it becomes clear that the reform of the internal organisation of the Court of Justice will have a major impact on the functioning or the European Union as a whole and, in the final analysis, on the lives of Europe’s citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason it was important for me that all of the participating legislative bodies – including the Court of Justice, which we included in the trilogue negotiations – should cooperate from the start and find practical compromises. We have only partly succeeded in doing this. Let me begin with the part for which we have actually found reasonable compromises, which make the work of the Court more efficient and which will reduce the length of court proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">The key points are as follows: the office of Vice-President is to be established at the suggestion of the Court itself. In future, the Vice-President will relieve the President of some of the burden involved in representing and administering the Court and will attend all Grand Chamber sessions. In addition, personnel structures are to be changed in the Chambers and in the Grand Chamber, which is to consist of 15 judges, so that the Presidents of the Chambers with five judges will also have their workload reduced and it will be possible to share the workload of all judges more evenly.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals in relation to the Civil Service Tribunal are also easy to explain. This Tribunal has always had seven judges. The small number of judges means that, in the event that a judge is absent, for example, due to lengthy illness, the Tribunal as a whole is seriously impaired in its judicial functions. In order to prevent this, an option is to be established whereby judges can be appointed to this technical tribunal on an interim basis. The judges in question are former members of the Court of Justice and they are to be appointed from a list in a particular order, so as to satisfy the requirements in relation to legally eligible judges. These judges can then replace individual judges should they be unable to fulfil their duties. So much for the positive and rational compromises which we have hammered out together and for which I wish to thank all those involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As was stated at the outset, however, we have not been able to bring all the necessary proposals to a conclusion. I wish to emphasise clearly that the reason for this lies not with the European Parliament, but with the Council and the national vanity of the individual Member States. It was suggested that the number of judges in the Court of First Instance should be increased by 12, rising from 27 to 39 judges. This is the right decision in view of the increasing workload of the judges, although the precise number of additional judges required might be open to debate. Parliament is certainly convinced that increasing the number of judges will, in the final analysis, contribute to better jurisprudence for individual citizens and businesses alike.</p>
<p class="contents">From which the Member States the additional judges are drawn should not really matter and appointments should be made solely on the basis of qualifications. After all, the principle of impartiality among judges also applies in the European Union. This, however, is something for the future. We have proposed a fair system for the appointment of judges, with numerous suggestions for how they could be selected. The Member States however, were unwilling and unable to agree to any of these solutions in the Council, which is why we shall not have an agreement to increase the number of judges for the foreseeable future. The motives behind this are purely national in character and cannot be justified in objective terms. I find this extremely unsatisfactory.</p>
<p class="contents">In the future too it will be necessary to ensure that European jurisprudence follows a reasonable timescale. Our citizens and businesses are entitled to that. Excessively long cases, sometimes lasting over five-and-a-half years, represent a violation of our Charter of Fundamental Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights. That is why it is vital that, in view of the present, well-balanced proposals in relation to the selection of additional judges, Member States should finally consider their position and avoid any loss of confidence in the European legal system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me begin by extending my thanks to the rapporteur for her constructive and positive approach to these negotiations. I would also like to pay tribute to the Danish Presidency which was instrumental in ensuring swift progress within the Council as well as the discussion between the two institutions. The good cooperation between the Council and Parliament on these important dossiers has led to a rapid agreement at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important issue indeed. The aim of these two proposals is to increase the efficiency of the work of the Court of Justice as a whole and in particular to allow it to address the increasing volume of cases and accumulated backlog. This is important if we are to ensure legal certainty and reliability.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, of course, fully aware that further work is needed on one important issue. This concerns an increase in the number of judges of the General Court. However, both our institutions are ready to work to ensure that appropriate measures are in place to address this issue by September 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn now to the various elements of the compromise package on which you will be voting tomorrow. The Statute amendments will introduce measures to improve efficiency in the work of the three courts which make up the Court of Justice of the European Union. Over recent years the Court has undergone significant changes in both the volume and the nature of litigation. This is due both to developments in EU law in a range of policy areas and to the enlargement of the European Union. The measures contained in this legislation will enable the Court to cope better with the increasing volume of litigation and improve the efficiency of its work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to three elements in particular: firstly, the establishment of the post of Vice-President in both the Court of Justice and the General Court who will assist the Presidents of each Court in their responsibilities; secondly, the modification of the composition of the Grand Chamber of the Court; and thirdly, the possibility of attaching temporary judges to the Civil Service Tribunal in order to cover for the absence of judges prevented from participating in judicial business for health reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the other elements of the proposal related to the increase in the number of judges at the General Court, I can assure you that the Council is fully aware of the need to address this issue urgently. Nevertheless it is a matter of some sensitivity within the Council. The Cyprus Presidency is determined to find a solution, but we would need to do so in a way which takes full account of the full range of views within the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that we can look forward to the adoption of the two proposals which are the subject of our debate this afternoon. I look forward to continuing the excellent cooperation with Parliament on the outstanding elements of the Court’s proposal and I am certain that we can reach an early and acceptable solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We also take note of Parliament’s intention to hold a debate in the near future on the merits of introducing the possibility of issuing dissenting opinions at the Court of Justice.

We should not finish this today. Instead, we should open the debate on this subject. When starting work on proposals from the Court of Justice and the European Commission we certainly had higher hopes and expectations. We also believed that this work would be relatively straightforward and that there would not be any differences between institutions. Changes to the Court of Justice work practices and the appointment of temporary judges to the European Union Civil Service Tribunal are certainly steps in the direction of increased output by EU courts. However, a key element of this reform was supposed to have been a proposal to increase the number of judges in the general court. Exclusion of this issue from the dossier makes it possible for us to implement all the non-controversial changes, but I believe that this basic issue will soon return. The Council cannot duck this matter, it will have to consider it again and take a decision with the European Parliament to resolve this key issue. It is, after all, no secret that proceedings before EU courts are becoming unworkably long, principally because of the disproportionate increase in the number of cases in relation to the staffing structure of EU courts. We are creating laws in an ever wider area, new countries become members of the European Union, we are thinking about acceding to the European Convention on Human Rights as a Union – all of this will further increase the number of cases.</p>
<p class="contents">We should remember that the right for a dispute to be resolved within a reasonable time is the right of every citizen and is now guaranteed in every Member State. We must provide EU courts with the instruments and human resources that are appropriate to the actual requirements. At present, increasing expenditure on EU administration is highly unpopular in Member States – of course we understand this. However, if the Union is faced with paying large amounts of compensation for cases that take too long, then this will certainly cost the European taxpayer and European institutions more than a few judges. Despite everything I am pleased that we reached a compromise and I would like to thank Alexandra Thein for her excellent work on this dossier<span class="italic">.</span> </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Court of Justice of the European Union is permanently overstretched. This is due partly to the fact that the European Union has been enlarged to include 12 new Member States and partly to the continuous extension of the Court’s powers and responsibilities. In order to enable the effective administration of justice, the code of procedure has been changed so that it is possible to arbitrate in legal cases relating to intellectual property without requiring an oral hearing. Our citizens are entitled to sound procedures that are administered as quickly as possible. The President of the Court of Justice can allocate cases to chambers that have already dealt with similar legal issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the more effective version of the two possible reform proposals has been chosen. The addition of new judges at the Court of Justice will be achieved by changing the statutes according to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon. The reasons for my preference are linked to the effectiveness of the proposed solution, the urgency of the situation, the flexibility of the planned measures and the coherence of European Union law. The Court of Justice considers it necessary to increase the number of judges by 12 to a total of 39. Like the rapporteur, Ms Thein, I do not have any empirical investigations to support the Court’s decision in relation to this specific number. I am fundamentally in agreement with the Court of Justice, however. The nomination of judges is a matter for the Member States. The matter is of such importance, however, that it is necessary to ensure that it is the task of the directly elected Parliament, in other words the European Parliament, to achieve the best possible solution in the interests of our citizens. It is for this reason that the Committee on Legal Affairs should be involved to the appropriate degree in the appointment of judges. It seems inappropriate, however, for the Court of Justice to be required to establish two specialist chambers. It would seem to make more sense to authorise the Court to establish such bodies under its own code of procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you will permit me to wax poetical on such a dry matter, the law and the way in which we frame it is perhaps the most valuable substance from which this Community is woven. The law protects the weak from the attacks of others, from claims to power and from violence. The law regulates the relations between people and institutions, protects freedom, democracy and solidarity. However, access to the law is also key. The law must also be upheld as necessary, by a court of law in cases of doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice of the European Union is increasingly having to deal with larger case numbers. This is hardly surprising in view of the expansion of Community law. Parliament has not closed its ears to the call to increase the number of judges. We have made a number of reasonable proposals for reducing the number of cases, increasing the number of judges and improving the modus operandi of the Court. The proposals have already been outlined by my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say, however, that there is one thing I fail to grasp: Parliament responds to this call and listens closely to what the public and judges have to say, draws up a solution in the trilogue with the Council and Commission, reaches an agreement and, in the end, nothing, absolutely nothing, happens. Why is that? It is because the Member States are unable to agree on how to appoint the judges. I find this unacceptable in this common Europe. I expect a little European responsibility from the Council too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe they represent a good first step towards improving the functioning of the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of the Treaty of Lisbon and enlargement have all contributed to the increasing backlog that we hear so much about, particularly in the General Court. Also, the economic difficulties are adding to the workload. We find an 11% increase in commercial and business-related disputes in 2011 alone. Tax disputes increased by 37 % and intellectual property cases by some 18%. It is essential that the ultimate arbiter of European law works effectively and efficiently in order to provide our citizens and businesses with the utmost legal certainty when transacting across borders. We must bear in mind that, although procedural reforms are able to alleviate some of the delays, it is difficult to deny that structural reforms are necessary in order to properly resolve the burden of cases still outstanding before the Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there have been some rumours circulating that the United Kingdom is in fact blocking this matter going to a vote. That is not the case. We are working on a very speedy basis, moving domestic legislation to allow this to proceed through our Houses of Parliament, so that we can move this here in time for the appointment of the new judges in October this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would first like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done.</p>
<p class="contents">As was correctly stated in the discussion on both drafts, the number of lawsuits is increasing sharply, and in my opinion this is due, among other things, to EU expansion. It is also correctly anticipated that in future the number of cases submitted to the Court of Justice of the European Union for consideration will grow due to legislative changes.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I consider it quite right that we are responding to these trends. I particularly welcome the reform of the Court of Justice, which, among other things, includes the introduction of an urgent procedure for accelerated preliminary proceedings. In my opinion, establishment of the post of temporary judges is also a step in the right direction, making it possible to avoid unnecessary delays when there is a surge in the caseload. This is one of few possibilities for reducing the costs and losses to the parties attending the court, if proceedings are extended due to a shortage of judges.</p>
<p class="contents">For the same reason, I consider the decision to establish the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice to be correct, in the hope that this reinforcement will also allow quicker decision making by the judicial institutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sorry, but appointing additional temporary judges because the permanent team of judges fall ill too often reeks to me of malingering and an abuse of rights. Why do these principal judges fall ill so often that additional judges need to be appointed?</p>
<p class="contents">While on the subject of expanding the General Court, let us not forget, colleagues, that the judges in the Court of Justice of the European Union are the highest paid officials in the whole European Union. In addition, every Member State has one judge each, which is not because of any misguided nationalism, but is down to the need to have an expert familiar with the relevant national law. Increasing the number by 12 means that the burden on some of the judges will increase (those who are still the only judge from a Member State), unlike for the rest.</p>
<p class="contents">Concluding what I said about judges being the highest paid officials, I feel that an increase can only be made in this crisis situation in connection with an overall reduction in the salaries in the Court so that the final bill is the same. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should particularly like to welcome the creation of the office of Vice-President of the Court of Justice, the amendment of the rules relating to the composition of the Grand Chamber, and the possibility of using temporary judges where the president and vice-president are unable to attend.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I have to say that we should – and this is a very important issue – have seized this opportunity to reform the Statute of the Court of Justice to increase its democratic legitimacy. In practice, under the EU legal system, under the European legal system, the courts have the role of setting precedents. It is a role characteristic of common law. They are the builders of European law. That is why we should be concerned about their democratic legitimacy. To that end, I would draw your attention to the fact that it would be very beneficial to allow the publication of dissenting opinions. The mention of examination of this issue is positive, but it is a shame that this proposal – which I made in committee, as a matter of fact – did not include acceptance that there should be transparency on publication of the votes of the Court of Justice, as happens with the supreme courts and constitutional courts of many Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, we urgently need to find a solution that will ensure the proper functioning of all three courts. In line with this objective, it is necessary for us to amend its Statute.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the Court of Justice, it should be borne in mind that the current structure of its Grand Chamber and its rules of operation stem from amendments introduced by the Treaty of Nice back in 2003, that is, nine years ago. Since then, many changes have taken place, including, for example, the accession of 12 new Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The number of cases brought is constantly increasing. Although the productivity of the Court of Justice has improved substantially, the number of pending cases is growing constantly. The Court of Justice clearly lacks the capacity needed to carry out its activities effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">We will clearly agree on the fact that we need to increase the number of judges as quickly as possible, but we must also agree on the means of their appointment. In this respect, therefore, I appeal to the Council in particular to address this issue as a matter of priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I look forward to very constructive cooperation and thank you for your kind words. </p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding let me just say a few words on the question which was raised concerning how the Council is considering dealing with the question of the enlargement of the composition of the General Court. You know that on 20 June, Coreper gave a mandate to the Friends of the Presidency group to continue reflections with a view to identifying possible solutions and reporting back to Coreper by the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a shared objective of the European Parliament and the Council to put in place appropriate measures to deal with the General Court’s backlog by the time of the General Court's partial renewal in December 2013, but we all need to understand that this question is really very complicated and we need some innovative thinking because we need to ensure, on the one hand, the quality of the appointees and consistency with the existing system of Article 255, but we also need to somehow ensure the equal footing, or the equal status, of those new judges with the others. Just imagine that we opt for an equal rotation. Who are those who are going to rotate? Only those twelve, let us say, or all of them? When it comes to any one country, do they have one judge for sure, who is already there, and the new one has to rotate, and his mandate will not be renewable? I am just sharing with you some of the possible questions which we need to find a way to address.</p>
<p class="contents">On behalf of the Council, let me just thank again the rapporteur and all the MEPs on the constructive debate on the reform of the Court of Justice of the European Union and assure you that we are looking forward to the introduction of the new rules this autumn. I am also optimistic that this constructive cooperation with Parliament will continue so that we can find a timely solution to the challenges facing the General Court. It is in the interests of all us to have a properly working Court of Justice in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This still has to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The third estate is often neglected because it is unable to make its voice sufficiently heard in politics. It is reticent by nature. It is essentially important, however. Mr Häfner has underlined its importance for the public at large, while Mr Karim has explained its significance for the business community. I hope that the friendship group established by the Council will not only deal with further internal reforms of the Court of Justice of the European Union, particularly because it has already achieved a major reform that has also contributed to a drop in case numbers and concluded cases. It is extremely important that the principle of the separation of powers should be followed here, and the system as a whole must not be overburdened. The work on the two dossiers has shown that some questions remain outstanding and that we must take a closer look at the Court of Justice in our Committee on Legal Affairs when it comes to the issue of divergent opinions, even though these are not required by the Court, or the establishment of special chambers and technical tribunals.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of questions have arisen during the negotiations and need to be clarified. We were under considerable time pressure because 14 new judges must be appointed in October and I hope that we will have concluded the negotiations on the additional new judges to be appointed before the next appointment of 13 new judges in September 2013.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, as we have saved some time because a number of colleagues have failed to attend, please permit me to present once again the various options for appointing the additional judges. We tabled a cross-group resolution that was never adopted, despite unanimous support, because Parliament changed its Rules of Procedure in the interim. The following proposals are on the table:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the selection takes place in strict rotation and involves all 27 Member States. The second option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the other 21 Member States in strict rotation. Alternatively: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are drawn from the medium-sized Member States in strict rotation. Yet another option: six judges are drawn from the most populous Member States, while the remaining six are selected using the same system as that used to appoint advocates-general. Another possible interim solution would be to appoint temporary judges for approximately five or six years, as suggested by the Danish Presidency of the Council. Thus, there are plenty of solutions available, but the Council needs to agree. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As with Hungary, this is not about a one-time change but about establishing the flexible operation of the organisation, in addition to solving current problems, in order to allow it to adapt to new challenges in the future. The changes primarily concern the following: the composition of the Grand Chamber, the creation of the post of Vice-President of the Court of Justice, the increase of the number of Judges in the General Court from 27 to 29, and the option to appoint temporary judges to the Civil Service Tribunal. We are all aware that an urgent structural solution is needed to rapidly reduce the number of cases pending before the General Court and to limit the duration of assessing cases. In order to ensure the efficient functioning of the justice system, some of the changes need to be brought into effect as soon as possible, before the partial restructuring in autumn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
