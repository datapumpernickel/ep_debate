<p class="contents">On 2 May 2003, the Commission presented the European Parliament and the Council with a Draft Regulation on enhancing ship and port facility security. The purpose of this draft is to introduce these new instruments into Community law, together with the necessary interpretative provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">On 9 October 2003, the Council (Transport) unanimously adopted a general approach to this draft. The European Parliament will abstain from voting on it at first reading on 19 November 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the evident progress made with the work by these two institutions, the Commission hopes that this document will be adopted as quickly as possible so that the Member States are given the opportunity, by no later than 1 July 2004, to fulfil the international obligations into which they have entered within the IMO.</p>
<p class="contents">1 July 2004 is also the deadline for vessels flying flags other than those of the EU Member States. The IMO has no intention of granting more time in which to implement these measures. In common with the United States’ authorities, the Commission agrees with this analysis. In accordance with the relevant regulations of the ISPS Code, it will therefore be possible for any vessel that, after 1 July 2004, does not comply with the safety arrangements laid down in these international instruments to be refused access to any port in a state that is a member of the IMO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The financial risk to businesses that cannot comply with the code is enormous. What about flags other than European flags? Even if our own Member States comply, could there not be a substantial risk that many other ships will not be complying by then and will not therefore be allowed into European ports? Has the Commission tried to make any assessment of the impact on European and even world trade if there is not full compliance by 1 July 2004? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission does not wish to rule any options out at this stage, including the possibility of further legislative measures.</p>

The Commission has also held informal discussions with regional and local authorities, business and citizens' organisations, and enterprises involved in the sector.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Trafficking of human beings</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult for people from third countries seeking refuge to enter the EU. In recent times, we have witnessed appalling disasters in which people searching for a more secure life have met with death beyond the EU's borders. We must stop the trafficking of human beings and those individuals making huge profits from the misfortunes of others. An interesting proposal has been put to the Commission with a view to reducing the market for people smugglers and making the EU more accessible for people from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the Commission's view of a system whereby refugees would be able to apply for a special asylum visa at Member States' embassies and consulates around the world? </p>

That is why we commissioned the study on the feasibility of processing asylum claims outside the European Union against the background of the common European asylum system, published in December 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The study analysed the possibilities of the Europe-wide use of protected entry procedures in regions of origin and examined how such procedures could allow a non-national to approach a potential host state outside its territory with an asylum claim and be granted a permit to enter that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has since noted, in its communications of March and June 2003, that protection capacities in the region of origin need to be consolidated and protection requests dealt with as closely as possible to needs. This might involve regulating access to the European Union by establishing protective entry schemes and resettlement programmes. Such measures could also facilitate more orderly arrival in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Thessaloniki European Council asked the Commission to explore all parameters, in order to ensure the more orderly and managed entry of persons in need of international protection into the European Union and to examine ways and means of enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Before June 2004 we shall be presenting a comprehensive report suggesting the measures to be taken. Meanwhile, the current presidency hosted an experts' seminar in Rome on 13 and 14 October which further explored the European Council's mandate, focusing in particular on resettlement and protected entry procedures. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods of dealing with protection discussed there will be further examined in the report called for by the Thessaloniki Council, which I just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Italian presidency intends that the November Justice and Home Affairs Council should adopt Council guidelines based on the conclusions of the Rome seminar, in order to provide the Commission with the necessary political guidance to prepare the report we shall be producing next June. Parliament will be asked for its opinion after the report has been published. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem with the current regulations governing asylum applications lies not with the regulations themselves and with our letting in too many refugees because, in Europe, we have both the resources and a moral responsibility to receive people in need of protection. Instead, the problem is the people smuggling through which unscrupulous traders entice people to try to make their way in by unlawful routes.</p>
<p class="contents">Our own regulations, which make it difficult to apply for, and obtain, visas, also mean that there are more and more traffickers in human beings. That is not how we should arrange matters. The Council has also produced inhumane proposals for border forces and for free zones in third countries where we should keep refugees seeking asylum. That is not something of which I approve. I believe we should have an arrangement that strengthens the asylum procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">One method is contained in the proposal that has been submitted by the researcher Gregor Noll and about which I have put my question. It is a proposal I believe is well worth examining. I should like to ask the Commissioner what advantages and disadvantages he sees in the researcher’s, Gregor Noll’s, proposal that asylum should be sought in the EU countries’ embassies around the world. It would be interesting to hear the answer to that question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the ways to address this objective is to enhance protection in the region, and to allow people to ask for asylum in the embassy of one of the Member States. As the honourable Member knows, some Member States are already doing this.</p>
<p class="contents">Resettlement schemes are already ongoing in at least five Member States. We are now studying experience gained in this area to identify the advantages and disadvantages involved in order to make a proposal to allow all Member States to use the same scheme.

This authorisation was given after <span class="italic">De Beers</span> made amendments to the original ‘Supplier of Choice’ draft presented to the Commission. A summary of the amended ‘Supplier of Choice’ had been published in November 2002 in the Official Journal and interested third parties were called upon to present their comments. As Mr Corbett stressed, when the Commission authorised the ‘Supplier of Choice’, it committed to monitoring the market and reserved the right to reopen the case should changes in the factual or legal situation as regards any essential aspect of the agreements lead it to modify its present view.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to fully make good its commitment.

<p class="contents">Despite the fact that it has already received some information regarding the specific use of ‘Supplier of Choice’, the Commission does not yet have all the details in this regard. This is why the Commission intends to use the powers given to it by the regulation on the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty in order to collect information that will allow it to adopt a position on the issue, in full knowledge of the facts. In the weeks to come, therefore, requests for information will be sent. When the Commission has examined the information that it has received in this way, it will decide what action to take regarding the case in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I suggest to the Commissioner that this is a remarkable admission to make. It was made in March 1999, just a few months before the launch of the supplier of Trisystem.

I am glad to say that, with Parliament's help, this pledge was announced at the Madrid Donors' conference on 24 October 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">A successful conference, raising more than USD 33 billion from over 70 countries was only the first step towards reconstruction. I remind you that the Commission communication set out four elements that are essential to the success of the reconstruction process: improved security, measures towards a political transition to an Iraqi government, the establishment of a multilateral umbrella for reconstruction, and cooperation on the part of Iraq's neighbours.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen progress on three of these elements, but on security considerably more progress is needed for rapid implementation of the Commission's assistance for reconstruction to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">For 2003 we have two goals: to help bridge the transition from the humanitarian phase to reconstruction, and to support the UN in fulfilling its mandate under Security Council Resolutions 1483 and 1511. The EUR 40 million we have proposed for 2003 is therefore intended to provide for assistance to flow as rapidly as possible to support Iraq via the UN and its specialised agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">I can report that, building on the work done to date by ECHO, a first package of EUR 29 million has been set aside for the UN's work in water and sanitation, health, education, employment and income-generating schemes: all areas in which the UN has been active and where the UN's 4000 local agents are still working. This should be ready for disbursement to the UN by early December 2003. A further EUR 11 million will be committed by the end of 2003 to support the UN's work on local and regional governance, civilian administration, legal and judicial reform, the media and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we have set aside EUR 2 million – on the horizontal demining budget line – to help address the huge problem posed by land mines and unexploded ordnance in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2004 the International Reconstruction Fund facility proposed by the World Bank and the UN in Madrid should be established. We therefore expect to channel the lion's share of the EUR 160 million proposed via this facility to support areas such as social safety nets, institution- and capacity-building, macro-economic management, the strengthening of Iraqi civil society and the protection and promotion of human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">How the Commission decides to divide allocations between the UN and the World Bank will be based on the sectoral experience and comparative advantages of the two organisations. This will, however, also depend on whether conditions in Iraq have in fact improved and on the prospects for implementation by UN bodies, NGOs and Iraqi ministries. The reality is that there are still many difficult question marks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EUR 200 million is money that has, so to speak, been 'vacuumed-up' in the neighbourhood. Thus we are not taking money away from what we can and should do in Africa because of what we are doing in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of what we do in other conflicts is a big question which we do not have time to go into today.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the second supplementary question, I can report that of the total EUR 100 million for humanitarian assistance to Iraq mobilised for this year, we have made a detailed commitment for about EUR 70 million, and expect that most of the remaining money will be committed towards the end of the year. In terms of actual spending and implementation, we have, in spite of all the difficulties, been able to stick very closely to the plan and expectations. It has to be noted that the actual work we are doing there is carried out by local people working for us or for the organisations we use as implementing agencies. We are still able to do something meaningful, but keep a low profile for obvious reasons of security. However, looking at things on a day-by-day and week-by-week basis, the humanitarian effort to date has been a wonderful achievement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Application of the EC-Israel Association Agreement</span></p>
<p class="contents">Press reports have recently stated that Member States have been faced with importers’ court actions challenging Member State moves to recover duty on suspected settlement imports which Israel’s customs authorities have maintained are eligible for preferential treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">Since Community law requires the importing country’s authorities to accept the legally-made determinations of the exporting country’s authorities, is the Commission confident that the Member States can sustain duty recovery against importers’ objections by relying on the fact that Israel’s verification answers fail to satisfy the Member State customs authorities’ requests to specify the locales in which the products in question were actually produced? Has Israel taken the position that its customs authorities’ verification answers are sufficient and must be accepted under the Agreement?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Application of EC-Israel Association Agreement</span></p>
<p class="contents">In the plenary debate of 4 September 2003 on the 'Application of the EU-Israel Association Agreement' the Commission was asked why it has not notified the Member States that the definition of territoriality that Israel applies to determine the origin of all its exports under that Agreement is illegal. Commissioner Nielson replied that the Commission had already done what was asked when it published a notice to importers in November 2001. In that notice the Commission confirmed that 'Israel issues proof of origin for products coming from places brought under Israeli administration since 1967'.</p>
<p class="contents">Did the Commission also confirm 'the existence of certain substantial errors in the application of the Agreements, to the extent that the validity of all preferential certificates issued by Israel are put in doubt'? Does the Commission consider that it has provided information to the Member States that raises doubts about the real origin of all products exported by Israel?</p>

<p class="contents">Does the Commission consider that the notice to importers of November 2001, the information at the disposal of the Member States regarding settlement products and firms, and the provisions of Article 32 of the Association Agreement provide the Member States with sufficient legal and technical means to reliably deny preferences to imports of settlement products and products that contain substantial amounts of settlement-produced components and materials, including products that are commingled with essentially identical products originating in Israel?</p>

<p class="contents">Is the Commission aware that prior to the November 2001 notice to importers, Member States failed to recover duties after receiving verification answers from Israeli customs confirming that the products in question were produced in settlements and reiterating Israel’s determinations that they were entitled to preferential treatment?

Therefore products obtained in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights are not entitled to preferential tariff treatment when entering the EU and proof of preferential origin issued by Israel for those products cannot be accepted by the Communities customs authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">In a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Communities in November 2001, the Commission informed the customs authorities of the Member States and European importers that Israel issues proof of preferential origin for products coming from places brought under Israeli administration such 1967. As a follow-up to that notice, the customs authorities of the EU Member States are screening all imports from Israel in order to identify the unlawfully issued proofs of origin and return the proofs of origin concerned to Israel in accordance with the verification procedure provided for in Article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Israeli replies, in the context of these verification procedures, do not distinguish between production in the settlements and production in the territory of the State of Israel. According to Article 32 of Protocol 4 to the Agreement, entitlement to the preferences is refused if there is no reply to the request for verification within ten months, or if the reply does not contain sufficient information to determine the authenticity of the proof of origin in question or the real origin of the products. It falls within the competence of the national customs authorities to determine, for each and every individual consignment, whether, under those provisions, the elements of fact and law allow refusal of the preferential tariff treatment. Refusal of the preference gives rise to a customs debt which the customs authorities of the Member States must recover, since, under Community law, they are responsible for the collection of the custom duties which are the Communities' traditional own resources.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU takes every opportunity to find a solution to the problem of the imports of products from the Israeli settlements and considers that this issue should be resolved before amending the EU-Israel protocol on rules of origin for the extension of the pan-European cumulation of origin to the Mediterranean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As to the creation of qualified industrial zones in the EC's trade relations with Jordan and Israel, the Commission is at the stage of carrying out a technical analysis and no conclusions have been drawn.</p>
<p class="contents">If an additional question is put forward here, asking why the Commission has not formally proposed the arbitration procedure which is part of all this, I would respond by saying that arbitration is, indeed, a possible measure planned in our Association Agreement in case there are differences in interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission has so far taken the necessary steps to protect the financial and legal interests of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, it should be noted that launching this procedure requires the unanimous assent of the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Community is actively participating in the current Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative with more than EUR 1.6 billion pledged up to now: EUR 680 million on its own claims as a creditor and EUR 934 million as a donor to the HIPC Trust Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission would also like to recall that this participation represents much more than the minimum required by the HIPC initiative. Indeed the Community, as a donor, is a major contributor to the HIPC Trust Fund, accounting for almost 25% of the total resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above its expected participation as a creditor, the Commission has also earmarked EUR 60 million for the settlement of all the special loans that would remain due from least-developed ACP countries, after they have benefited from the full application of the HIPC terms.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also worth noting that most of the EU Member States have announced their intention to cancel 100% of the bilateral debt, beyond the HIPC terms. This means that any further debt cancellation in HIPC countries will relate largely to multilateral institutions, non-Paris Club official creditors and the private sector.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point in time, it is also clear that the HIPC initiative has to be considered as a first important step towards long-term debt sustainability and that it will not be sufficient to ensure the beneficiary countries meet the Millennium Development Goals, especially in countries badly affected by HIV/AIDS. Moreover, the adverse economic effects of HIV/AIDS are now much more clearly recognised than they were when the HIPC initiative was launched, and the Commission agrees that it must consider HIV/AIDS when also discussing long-term debt sustainability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the framework of the EU-Africa dialogue, the issue of Africa’s External debt has been part of the agenda since the Cairo meeting. The Commission has followed up actively the discussions between the Chefs de file (France and Germany) and the African Union representatives. At the latest ministerial troika meeting of the EU-Africa Dialogue, held in Rome on 10 November, which I attended together with the Irish Foreign Minister, it was agreed that discussions and the corresponding report of the issue of Africa's External Debt should be prepared as a matter of priority and that the experts meeting within the enlarged Troika should be held in the first quarter of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has recently launched, as an element of the EU-Africa dialogue, a study on debt relief beyond the HIPC initiative, with the main objective of providing a solid base to assess the situation after the full application of the HIPC initiative. This study should provide key elements for shaping, in coordination with Member States, the Union’s future debt policy. The Commission expects to be able to share with Parliament the results of this study by early next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add that the complexity of doing something with multilateral debt is much larger and makes anything there much more difficult politically in terms of burden sharing internationally, compared to the handling of bilateral debt. Most donor countries that take their responsibility as a donor partner seriously have in fact more or less cancelled all the outstanding bilateral debt. For the Commission it is important to note that our share of all this as a creditor is very limited, basically because we are a grant donor and do not lend money to our partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Many people and organisations would like to see this policy promoted during the Irish presidency. We would also like the Commission to support this. In the UK, the British Jubilee Debt campaign are trying to mobilise politicians to support this.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk in Parliament and in the Committee on Development and Cooperation about trying to help developing countries, it has been recognised that cancelling the debt would be one of the most sensible ways of ensuring that we can actually help these countries. The debt is grossly unfair. These countries are being exploited under false pretences. The only way forward for any just society in this day and age should be to promote the policy that the Irish Government has endorsed.

The bilateral debt is relatively easy for the donors to manage; it is their own decision. The Commission is not in a position to tell individual Member States what to do. We have played a crucial role in the most difficult area, namely taking meaningful action on the multilateral debt, and in doing so we have gone far beyond our role as a creditor.</p>
<p class="contents">What Ireland is doing is fine. However, I have to say that in 1995, when I was the Danish Minister for Development Cooperation, we announced something similar for the least-developed poor countries. My hesitation about broadening the scope of debt cancellation to, for instance, middle-income countries, is based on the consideration that if we do that we will take money from the least-developed and poorest countries and give it to countries that are relatively much better off. That is not so easy to do in practice. What Ireland is doing is commendable and it might inspire other countries to do something similar. However, the Commission cannot tell Member States to do that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The total amount earmarked in the 9th EDF National Indicative Programmes for support to projects and programmes in the field of governance represents around EUR 640 million, corresponding to about 10 % of the overall allocations for the national indicative programmes. Part of these allocations can be mobilised for projects aimed at strengthening the capacity of the parliaments of ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A total amount of EUR 38.5 million is already committed, within existing governance programmes, for specific actions of support to the parliaments of ACP countries. In addition, two new financing proposals, focused on support to ACP parliaments, are scheduled for approval this year: one for Madagascar (EUR 1.9 million) and one for South Africa (EUR 10 million).</p>
<p class="contents">The delegations will be made aware of the possibility of supporting specific activities designed to increase the awareness and information of national parliaments on the implementation of the Cotonou Agreement, if requested by our partner countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the various programmes geared towards strengthening the trade negotiation capacities of the ACP, including the ongoing EUR 10 million and EUR 20 million all-ACP facilities for WTO and economic partnership agreement negotiations, are also relevant as regards the promotion of training and awareness in relation to the role of parliaments in these matters.</p>
<p class="contents">We are encouraging members of national and regional parliaments to participate in various trade-related workshops, seminars etc., organised in this context. The Commission has already contacted the European Parliament in the past with a view to helping them build up a network of ACP parliamentarian correspondents in order to enhance their involvement in trade matters. We are interested in doing everything possible in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">The 9th EDF financial protocol provides EUR 4 million to allow for the participation of parliamentarians from ACP countries in the activities of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which is a key institution of the Cotonou Partnership. A new financing agreement is currently under consideration, using the entire allocation under the current Financial Protocol. It will provide this support over a period of two-and-a-half years.</p>
<p class="contents">The strengthening of the structure of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly, which now includes three thematic standing committees, necessitates additional financial resources to allow for effective ACP participation. To take into account these additional needs, the European Commission intends to propose a decision of the ACP-EU Council of Ministers to increase funds for the JPA to an amount of around EUR 6 Million, in accordance with Article 8 of the Financial Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">All these initiatives should make it possible for national and regional parliaments to access some of the resources needed to ensure their effective participation in cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is always good to hear that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is receiving much-needed extra funding considering the new work – with the committees in particular – that we are engaged in.</p>
<p class="contents">Would you agree with me, Commissioner, that support for parliaments is an area of our governance and democracy activities which has been somewhat neglected in the past? For instance, for the country strategy papers, I can find no evidence that parliaments were consulted in any meaningful way, although civil society and NGOs were quite rightly involved. Joint Parliamentary Assembly parliamentarians are really thirsty for information, particularly on the EDF and on following the EPA negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am interested in the fact that some countries are already putting into their national indicative programmes a priority for parliamentary training and capacity-building, but out of 78 countries, if we are honest only a handful have made that kind of priority clear. I would like to know exactly how we can encourage national authorising officers and others to make this priority clear so we can ensure that accountability of parliamentarians is part of the process that we are engaged in. It seems to me that they do very little challenging of the executive in terms of questioning, financing and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to ask what exactly you suggest that we, as parliamentarians, can do in cooperation with the Commission to ensure that governments make parliamentary activity more of a priority. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If you cannot do it with the help of those friends, then I might not be able to help you either.</p>
<p class="contents">My worry is more related to the weak character of the inclusion, consultation or real participation of parliaments in the debate at national level, and in the decision-making process regarding national strategies. It is a great step forward that we are investing so heavily in engaging civil society, but to create a civilised society, parliaments are necessary, otherwise NGOs tend to see themselves as neo-governmental organisations because they have been hurt and parliaments – and especially oppositions – are kept in the dark. I keep returning to this in my discussions. I always make this point when I am informing our ACP partner countries that now we have this ability to fund NGOs, civil society and non-state actors. However, the role of parliaments should not be forgotten.</p>

<p class="contents">One week after the local elections in Albania, the Central Elections Commission has decided to repeat, on 16 November 2003, the elections in four constituencies (the municipalities of Piluri, Dhermi, Qeparo and southern Himara), citing irregularities during the election process of 12 October 2003, in spite of the fact that in two of the four cases the irregularities cited occurred after the finalisation and certification of the results.</p>

Since you invite oral questions for Commissioners for parts one, two and three, why is it that after the second half hour we did not revert to the first question of part three? Why is it that those of us with questions one, two and three in part three will not receive oral answers?</p>
<p class="contents">I find it a discourtesy to colleagues. If our turn is never to be reached, we should be told to put down a written question to the Commissioners. If we can only have answers from the Commissioners who are available on the day – Mr Monti and Mr Nielson in this case – then why invite questions to any Commissioner? Why have a section, under other questions – part three – which should have had half an hour, and then ignore it? I fail to understand this, and with respect find it a discourtesy to colleagues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you will appreciate, I have had to read the Rules of Procedure, Rule 43, the annexes, the guidelines, the precedents, the history of Question Time, the casuistry and I can assure you that the second part is dedicated to specific questions to Commissioners and they take up one hour, which can be divided between three or between two. When the Commission classifies the questions in the third part, this means that they are not going to be replied to orally.</p>
<p class="contents">If you believe it to be appropriate, and you probably do, we can send out a circular explaining it. There are questions in the second part which are not replied to either because there is not sufficient time and this is not a lack of courtesy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that the third part is not scheduled to be replied to orally. I would state this clearly and it has always been the case. I have had to study this very carefully and for the benefit of the Members, so to speak, we have discussed it in the Bureau and if necessary I will produce some written comments on the Rules of Procedure and I will send it out. But it is not a lack of courtesy.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I am very grateful to Mr Newton Dunn and the honourable Member for having raised the need to clarify this issue. In fact in the Commission there are no specific Commissioners who come to reply to questions in the third part, there are Commissioners who come to reply to the questions put to them and they therefore come to this sitting.</p>
<p class="contents">As for questions of special importance, they are in the first part, classified in a different manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, having explained this, I am at your disposal in case there is any other explanation to be given in writing.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions Nos 50 to 91 will be reply to in writing<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes Questions to the Commission.</p>
