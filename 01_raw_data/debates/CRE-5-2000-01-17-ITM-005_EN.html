Welcome to Parliament! Ladies and gentlemen, we cannot overlook the fact that the benefits of the European internal market are reaped most of all by the wealthy regions, and even there they are not enjoyed by all sections of the population. How long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for, resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions?</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst, in the fifth report on the situation in the regions, unemployment was seven times higher in the poor regions than in the wealthy regions, the sixth report is already talking in terms of it being eight times higher, despite the fact that European structural funds are pouring into the regions. Hence, it will, of course, come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural funds regulation places great emphasis on the call for the funds to be implemented more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the European objectives of high employment levels and sustainable development, to name but a few.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament, but above all the Member States, demanded massive improvements. This was very soon forgotten, however, when the Commission developed the new instrument for the purpose, the guidelines, and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency, concentration, and simplification of administration in the implementation of the European structural funds more binding. Subsequently, the Member State governments referred to the principle of subsidiarity and just wanted to get their hands on the money. And so all that remained of the 1999 Berlin Summit was the indicative nature of the guidelines. However, this at least places the Commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable European objectives to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I may have my doubts as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieving efficiency and increased concentration and in actually putting the European objectives into practice, but it is a fact that the guidelines will be of central importance to the negotiations for the Community development programme. If you want our work at European level to be taken seriously, then you must also take it seriously yourselves!</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past. Now that the programming phases are so far on, there is little point in starting from scratch again. That is why in my report I concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument, with the blessing of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the report assesses the impact of the instrument per se. Secondly, it uncovers the shortcomings in the Commission document. For example, the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds. One searches the document in vain for the central principle, which calls upon the Member States to see that programmes are implemented at local level in conjunction not only with the local authorities and regions but also with local actors, business and social organisations, NGOs, unions, employers’ associations, women’s organisations, citizens’ initiatives and employment initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The question as to why it was left out has not been answered to date. Parliament makes demands here that are of central importance. It expects the Commission to only approve those programmes established on the basis of partnerships of this kind. It surprised me, Members of the Conservative Group, to suddenly find that amendments aimed at dropping the decentralising approach had been produced overnight. All I can say is try taking this to your regions and explaining to your electorate why the European principle of decentralisation is not to be put into practice in the regions. Let me tell you, you will not escape from that one unscathed!</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot have a situation where we agree principles in this House and, when it comes to implementing them, everyone does their own thing again. Incidentally, I would just like to address a comment to the government of my country, where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal Community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the FFH guideline. I believe it is a good thing that the Commission is holding firm here.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to my final point. The guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether Article 1 of the regulation is actually being implemented. I expect the Commission to ensure that the guidelines, which certainly allow for adequate flexibility, are in every sense the benchmark for the negotiations. We represent the European position. In other words, sustainability in transport policy must be taken into account every bit as much as the entitlement of women to a share of financial support, as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution, thus enabling there to be sustainable urban development and truly model projects in rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This is what I expect the outcome of the Community development programmes to be, and I do not expect you to give way on this again. How else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate? Not by continuing to wait and trying to cheat our way through again. We cannot wait. In a few years time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implementing European structural policy because a great many more countries will be joining us and then we will have no choice but to create much improved, more efficient and more concentrated structures. And that will only be the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore expect the Commission to take Parliament’s demands seriously in the course of the negotiations and to actually put the European position into practice here, giving a progressive regional policy a chance at long last. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">A major part of Wales, as you know, has been granted Objective 1 status under the Structural Funds programme. It is quite clear that many people within Wales are looking to the European Structural Funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face. We have seen poverty growing in Wales; and growing still further since 1997. We have seen the gap between rich and poor widen. We are looking, therefore, within the Structural Funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the Principality.</p>
<p class="contents">What is, however, deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of Structural Funds assistance is something that has been, in a sense, a success of the government. It is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that Wales faces. That is why I want to highlight some of the issues that I believe the Commission must have at the forefront.</p>
<p class="contents">We look to the Commission to deal with points in relation to additionality. We are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within UK figures. We look to the Commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects. We look to it to challenge the UK Government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely must be providing the major impetus for Structural Funds expenditure, is involved in the planning stage. Finally, we ask that the Commission ensures that Structural Fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent. Too much of what takes place within this Parliament is not transparent. This is one area in which I believe the Commission can be a very great friend to Wales. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We see it as a very positive sign that, in her own conclusions, the rapporteur has taken account of our committee’s proposal that the Cohesion Fund countries should broaden the research infrastructure by locating universities and colleges in such a way that they would serve those who live in undeveloped regions better than now and make it easier for educated people to remain in their home districts. This will be possible with action on the part of governments, and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter we would like to address, specifically from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have liked the Commission to pay more attention to the effects of services, electronic commerce and the growing use of the Internet, when they were planning the coordination of Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds. Poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood. The rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry, but today those areas might have become a burden, and they may well be poor, meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production, as I might call it, and the production of services, because they are the industries of the future. In my opinion the committee drafting the report has not taken sufficient account of this, so on behalf of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I would draw the Commission’s attention to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as the committee representing energy, we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from Cohesion and Regional Development funds to have been emphasised still more, thus, through a process of coordination, increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to draw people's attention to Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which were agreed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs but not accepted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the past, this Parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment. These amendments also fit in with this Parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action. We hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both Parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment.</p>
<p class="contents">In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking, yet desperately needed. The Commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund. But the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted, as the idea of linking Social Fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the 2000-2006 programme. It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between European Social Fund assistance, which is subject to review after three and a half years, and the Member States' annual national plans for employment. We hope that the Commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to point out, however, that this starting point indicates to us the challenges which face us: maintaining a population in rural areas, given the changes taking place in all types of economic activity owing to agriculture’s increasing lack of importance amongst the various sources of income for rural society. This, as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment, which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity, exacerbates the exodus from rural areas. The consequences do not inspire hope. It is the young people who are disappearing, who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas, all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas.</p>
<p class="contents">This lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs. We have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the European Union. Agriculture only provides 5.5% of employment in the Union. Furthermore, three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the European Union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas, outside of the agricultural sector, in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, heritage conservation, the conversion of businesses, new technologies, services, etc. However, even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive, it is still essential, not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns, but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land, in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set. We want rural areas, at the dawn of the 21st century, to be competitive and multi-functional, both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium, and to bear in mind the conclusions of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the five fundamental issues, which have been only partly taken up by the Committee on Transport, Regional Policy and Tourism in its points 16 and 17.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would ask the Commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because I believe that, for the European Union, maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this work has been carried out extremely well. I would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments – and perhaps there are more of them than we expected – but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing. </p>
<p class="contents">We feel that it is important that the Commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this Parliament, at least in spirit, because at this stage, it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise, and nothing but hot air. </p>
<p class="contents">The truth of the matter though is that we believe – and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted – that the Commission must take account of what is adopted by this Parliament, particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives. </p>
<p class="contents">In our amendments, we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the Structural Funds, the Cohesion Fund and Community initiatives, so that their application should be reflected, in the best and most profitable way, by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are, when all is said and done, the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives, we think that those who generate employment, the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment, that is, businesspeople, must participate in this initiative. Small and medium-sized businesses, above all, need to take part in the distribution of these funds. If they do not, if businesspeople feel marginalised, if entrepreneurs cannot take part, not only in managing but also in receiving these funds, we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly. Also, in order to attain our objectives, to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment, it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies, to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies. All of this must be done – I repeat – with the participation of private business, which, by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations, but complementing them, never obstructing or excluding them, will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was because of the discredited policies of his own Conservative Party. Let me also remind him that when his party leader, Mr Hague, was Secretary of State for Wales, he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from Commissioner Wulf-Mathies regarding regulatory requirements. I can tell you that the British Government is aware of its regulatory requirements on Objective 1 additionality. I suggest Mr Evans goes back and reads the regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">My Group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today. I want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines. The objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration, to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector. It is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that Europe is rapidly losing ground to the US in the hi-tech growth industries of the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about. They should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape. They should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development, resulting in inevitable delays and underspends, particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer, either in the Commission or in the civil service. There must be an internal coherence in the Commission directorate, while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of Commission programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad, indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration. If we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence, which will be the key to future success. This is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines: whether EU regional policy with a good, solid, enabling guideline, can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report. The rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that Parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines. We are badly behind now in this matter. Hopefully, the stands Parliament has taken will help, however, in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation. For the time, the report grew too large when it was being debated. It contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports. At this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer Union regional policy, bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity, the responsibility of Member States and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes. It is especially important to get SMEs involved in the planning and implementation of programmes. Our Group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas. We oppose the excessive control the central administration of the Union and its Member States exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes. Projects implemented with support from the Union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes. Funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned. Projects have to be carried out more efficiently, more flexibly and they have to be made more productive.</p>
<p class="contents">While the report was being prepared, it was interesting to discuss the Union’s regional policy in general. For us new members, it was the first time, and this was a very interesting process. This report is very good and our Group supports it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results. We are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a Europe of Citizens and not just in a Europe of States and of Regions. </p>
<p class="contents">We feel that the Funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion. We might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator. Some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population. We will have to study several indicators, which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others, and how they are evolving. It is clear from some of the reports that have been presented to Parliament’s plenary sitting today that Europe’s 25 most prosperous regions enjoy a level of unemployment which is five times lower than in the 25 least prosperous regions. This fact means that the European Parliament, the Commissioner and the Commission must act decisively and strategically. </p>
<p class="contents">I agree that the European Parliament did not have the opportunity – or that it was not given the opportunity, as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term – to discuss the directives. I do not think, however, that this report has come too late. We need to consider it together, so that the new Objective 1 programmes and the plans for regional development, which have been drafted before the directives come into force, can be submitted for revision and proper assessment. We all agree that we should ask that, halfway through these programmes, when the assessment of the directives is made, Parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens’ representatives. Our citizens cannot accept that the European Union takes decisions in a way that is, at least on the face of it, bureaucratic. They need to see the political dimension working, to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens. This is what we are today asking the Commissioner for. I would like to think that, given his previous experience as a regional President, he will agree to propose indicators, and a strategy, which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas. This latter point is of particular importance. While urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers. We do not want to build a Europe of cities alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The Structural Funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries, mainly through the upgrading of roads, water treatment and related transport networks. This process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the EU leaders at their Berlin Summit last year, which were supported by Parliament at its last May plenary part-session.</p>
<p class="contents">Key EU programmes between 1989, 1993, 1994 and 1999 have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and Objective 1 regions within Europe. The key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date. This would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions, the poorer regions in Europe, are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone, as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital exist.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund, we should remember that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society. The Social Fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions, financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment, assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time, however, I actually agree with her. Whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path, I cannot say. Nevertheless, I would like to commend her on her work. </p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex, as we and Mrs McCarthy, as rapporteurs for the general regulation, had asked. Unfortunately, this did not happen. Mr Bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee. I am raising the issue just to reiterate Parliament’s position. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far. They are particularly beneficial to the Member States, and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the Commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development, job creation and, more particularly, on equal opportunities and transport issues. Personally, I at least am totally in favour of the guidelines. As an islander, however, I would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development. This is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves. This has been an ongoing concern for the five years that I have been a Member of this Parliament, and I have raised the issue time and time again. Commissioner, we shall continue to raise the issue, as Article 158, paragraph 1, of the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands. Therefore, the Commission should address the issue once and for all. </p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to implement the programmes, and so Member States should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly. As for us in Parliament, I would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the Commission and Parliament which was signed in May. I am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that Parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know many have already done so, but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides, and I think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity. Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003. In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face. </p>
<p class="contents">The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies. Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking. We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development?</p>
<p class="contents">The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms. These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds. As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation. Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want. Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations. I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear.

As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country. Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process. Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator. Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds. </p>
<p class="contents">What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level. The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner. The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere. It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development. This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy. To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds. For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level. </p>
<p class="contents">There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission’s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain. </p>
<p class="contents">I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission’s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them.</p>
<p class="contents">The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability. That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to explain our thinking here. Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as "value for money" indicators in the grant-giving process.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period. But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful. Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed. There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation. Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see. That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform.</p>
<p class="contents">If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist – in a financially sustainable manner – those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a "hand-up". I urge the House to support these changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Union’s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment. These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines. </p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life. Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community’s regional policy. </p>
<p class="contents">Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it. The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South. Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States. If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities. Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation. </p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy. A large section of the Union’s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots. Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes. However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission’s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas. Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields.</p>
<p class="contents">I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.

Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show – as we shall see later in the Berend report – how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe’s most highly-developed regions. They are growing, but only in terms of GDP. They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions. </p>

Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved – and I shall come back to this point presently – and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds. This means putting forward the Commission’s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations. The objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use, to the optimum and efficient use, as some of you have wished, of Community involvement, including, Mr Bradbourn, using, if necessary, the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of European public monies. When I speak of optimum utilisation, I am referring both to the national and regional levels. And so, Mr Seppänen, I shall also mention at this point, speaking of the national level, the link with the Cohesion Fund. This is the purpose of these guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding their content, as you know, ladies and gentlemen of this House, they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but, at the same time, very passionately, as I understood her presentation just now. The first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create, in all sectors, but especially in the private sector, as Mr Berend said, the maximum number of serious, worthwhile and permanent jobs, the competitiveness of regional economies, all regional economies, and in particular, Mr Evans, that of Wales, but not only of Wales. And, because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission, let me also add the regional economies of the European regions handicapped by their distance from the centre, be they remote regions, island regions or, of course, the most remote regions which are, naturally, the most distant.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I may inform Mr Ribeiro e Castro, who asked me about this, that, as I wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions, the Commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report. Concerning the most remote regions, it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments, but this is not necessarily an excuse, just an explanation. We must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work. I myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on 23 November and, within the College, we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions. I would thank you for your understanding in this matter. So that is the first priority, the competitiveness of regional economies.</p>
<p class="contents">The second priority, which several of you have stressed, Mr Puerta in particular, but there were others, not that I am mentioning them in any order of priority, is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment, particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we now have a European Union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great, proving the effectiveness and worth of the Cohesion Fund, but where, at the same time, in relation to unemployment – as you wrote, Mrs Schroedter – an increasing gap exists between the 15 or 20 richest regions and the 15 or 20 poorest or most disadvantaged regions. This is a situation which is, as it should be, unjustifiable and intolerable. As far as I am concerned – taking into account my own concept of the construction of Europe and regional development policy in particular – this is a situation which I find unacceptable and I have every intention, as far as possible, with your support, of dedicating all the appropriations for which I am responsible to this improved social, human and territorial cohesion, particularly in order to prevent what I once called in this House a two-speed Europe, a Europe of wealthy districts but, at the same time, a Europe of impoverished areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The third objective is urban and rural development, within the scope of a balanced territorial policy. In fact, the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account. The first is rural development, and let me say, Mrs Schroedter, that I am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport, an issue I have been involved in personally for a long time. I particularly remember the time when I was Minister for the Environment in my own country. The second principle is that of equal opportunities, particularly for men and women, as well as the European strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this House, particularly yourself, Mrs Schroedter, in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies, for development or redevelopment, which, of all the priorities, offer the maximum opportunity to synergy, to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership. You expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership, yet there is a clear reference to it on page 5 of the guidelines. However, I do wish to mention – since you have asked me to do so – that, as far as I am concerned, this partnership – and I spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely – is a tool, one used to involve local brainpower, be it in the public sector, in the form of elected representatives, the social and educational sectors, associations, or in the private sector; a decentralised partnership, and let me mention in this connection, in response to Mrs Angelilli, the territorial pacts, which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure. It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date. Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately. Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999. </p>
<p class="contents">Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning – Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this – as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration. And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided. I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document.</p>
<p class="contents">Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter. I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations. This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring’s negotiations. The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies. I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks. Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the <span class="italic">ex ante</span> assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration. I find the opposite the case. I wish to confirm the great importance the Commission attaches, and shall attach, to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy. Indeed, I had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards rural development, which a number of you brought up, particularly Mrs Redondo Jiménez, the guidelines are in line with the twofold objective mentioned by your rapporteur: a strong agricultural sector linked with increased competitiveness in rural areas, but also protection of the environment and Europe’s rural heritage. It must, however, be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the Structural Funds, whose Objectives 1 and 2 specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority. And indeed, on the subject of the balance of rural society, let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the EAGGF Guarantee Section, aimed at promoting reform in European agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture. At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions. In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France. I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2. I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow. We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms. Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view. I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes. This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions.</p>
