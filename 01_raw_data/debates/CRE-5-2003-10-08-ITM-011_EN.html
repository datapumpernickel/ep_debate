<p class="contents">The reform is the result of a review process that was launched in 2000, which is the basis for the new draft regulation that I hope the Council will soon adopt so that it can come into force in time for the forthcoming enlargement. The reform aims not to jeopardise the merits of the current system; what we are proposing is a series of significant improvements to the current system, intended, above all, to further improve the system in terms of the transparency and coherence of the control of concentrations. At the same time, over and above the regulation, we are improving the Commission’s decision-making process, ensuring that our inquiries into proposed mergers are more accurate, more focused and better supported by sound economic analysis and that they give full consideration to the rights of the parties involved in the concentration and of third parties; we are also aware of the fact that the Court of First Instance is asking the Commission for a high level of proof. This has obvious implications for the way in which we work.</p>
<p class="contents">The package reforming the control of concentrations is made up of the proposal for a new Community merger regulation and of a draft communication that contains guidelines on assessing horizontal mergers. In recent months, in addition to the preparation of these documents, many measures relating to the staff and internal organisation of the Competition Directorate General have been adopted, in particular the introduction of a new figure – the chief competition economist – and processes such as the peer<span class="italic"> </span>review<span class="italic"> </span>panel to ensure greater clarity of control during analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a new merger regulation is characterised by three main elements: firstly, clarification of the substantive test for evaluating the possible effects of concentrations on competition; secondly, jurisdictional issues, where we are proposing to rationalise the system of referrals between the Commission and Member States; thirdly and lastly, numerous procedural changes are being proposed to give slightly more flexibility in timeframes for inspections and for notification of a concentration, as well as aligning the powers of fact-finding provided for in the merger regulation with those that are set down in Regulation No 1/2003, which, as you know, relates to the application of Articles 81 and 82 of the Treaty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Della Vedova (NI),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, over the past three years, the Commission has been involved in a thorough review of the Community antitrust system. As you mentioned, Commissioner, the proposal for a new regulation on concentrations between undertakings before us today represents one of the key phases of that review process.</p>
<p class="contents">The previous regulation had become increasingly central to the EU’s competition policy. It had considerable merits, offering the undertakings involved in mergers a ‘one-stop shop’ and preset deadlines. However, the growing integration of markets and the consequent increase in the number and relevance of merger cases examined by the Commission has brought the existing rules to a critical point, as demonstrated by the recent Court of Justice judgments rejecting certain decisions by the Commission, something you, yourself, also referred to, Commissioner. Hence the need to reform the existing rules, and the Commission is to be congratulated for having reacted swiftly to this need.</p>
<p class="contents">The three vital points both in the Commission proposal and also in Parliament's report, points that you drew attention to yourself, Commissioner, are the substantive test, jurisdiction and procedural issues. As regards jurisdiction, that is to say the field of application of the regulation and thus the allocation of cases between the different national authorities, there is a need to solve the problem of multiple notifications, which will become even more serious for the businesses affected following enlargement. These multiple applications are totally at odds with the principle of the one-stop shop to which we have all referred.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal, the Commission has abandoned both the possibility of changing thresholds, presumably because of the complications involved, and the ‘3+’ principle, although contained in the Green Paper, which was advocated by Parliament in the Berenguer Fuster report. This positive view was confirmed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which defined an automatic test also allowing for referral to the Commission during the pre-notification stage, when a case has to be notified to several national authorities. Parliament accordingly wishes to reiterate the line already taken in the debate on the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to principle, the substantive test has nevertheless proved effective up to now, although this has been keenly debated. Some people have proposed switching to a substantial lessening of competition test, a principle used in the United States and in some Member States. In this respect, your rapporteur acted on the Commission's proposal to add a paragraph to Article 2, which would have defined the concept of dominant position more clearly. I, personally, suggested a rewording, but the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs decided at this stage to call on the Commission to leave things as they are, thus backing the value of the test and of its effectiveness, as demonstrated up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards procedural issues, I would like to say a few words about powers of investigation. The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has proposed toning down some of the provisions in the proposal for a regulation, given that we believe that, on grounds of proportionality, it is absolutely unnecessary to bring the Commission’s powers of investigation for mergers into line with the powers envisaged for cartels, since the areas concerned are completely different. A merger essentially represents ‘business as usual’ and we do not, therefore, believe there should be any presumption that the rules have been breached. This gives this House all the more reason to believe that we should stand firm on this issue, given the powers that the Commission is proposing to grant itself, albeit quite legitimately. We believe that Parliament should adopt a position offering a better guarantee here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make two points by way of conclusion. Firstly, there is the position of the workforce. During the debate, some Members, in particular the Socialists, expressed their concern and a proposal to take into account the possible employment impact of merger operations, and even proposed that the acceptability of a merger should be dependent on preserving jobs. We believe that this is not the right place to insert a clause of this kind, because there is a danger that it would conflict with the overall logic of the regulation, which is to guarantee a competitive single market precisely in order to increase employment.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards worker participation and information, the regulation already contains some provisions in this respect; further provisions in precisely this area are envisaged in other European legislation. I do not believe that there is any need to include these provisions here and, in view of this, I would ask the House and, in particular, Mr Berenguer Fuster and Mrs van den Burg, to reconsider. The fact that these amendments will be rejected should not be allowed to prejudice the vote on the entire legislative proposal. I am, however, happy to support Mr Schmidt's amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will only do so once, but I hope – if you do not mind – that I can combine the speaking times. Mr President, I have, first of all, a great deal of appreciation for the Commission's proposals for the revision of the regulation on the control of concentrations and an exceptional amount of appreciation for the sterling report by Mr Della Vedova. We support the objective of creating more clarity, legal certainty and quicker procedures. Against this background, I should like to make a few observations. In the first instance, Parliament welcomed the Green Paper’s proposals for a ‘one-stop-shop’ system in Brussels for multiple filings in more than two Member States. As Mr Della Vedova said a moment ago, that is why we regret the Commission’s failure to incorporate this principle in the present proposal. With the forthcoming enlargement, the number of multiple filings will increase substantially, always assuming that policy remains unchanged. The lack of mutual coordination among Member States has led to bureaucratic, costly and time-consuming procedures. The coordination and harmonisation of national procedures is very much what is wanted and we would therefore urge the Commissioner to make every effort to promote this idea. I know that this does not fall within the Commission's remit, but it can, of course, talk to the Member States and call for further harmonisation and mutual coordination. A single procedure in Brussels will not only cost less but will also significantly improve legal certainty for businesses and ensure that the procedure can be completed more quickly. The Commission does create some scope for promoting central processing in Brussels by means of the referral procedure, but we do not believe that this goes far enough. If a merger clearly has a cross-border impact, it ought to be considered by the Commission wherever possible. It should be made possible for cases to be referred to the Commission on the basis of objective criteria and at the request of the merging parties. We have developed concrete proposals to this effect. For the same reasons, the idea of referring concentrations to Member States needs to be treated with caution. Concentrations that comply with the requirements of a simplified procedure ought not, in principle, to be referred to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the purposes of this revision of the regulation is to increase legal certainty. However, in our view, if the concept of the dominant economic position is broadened in the way proposed by the Commission, this is more likely to have the opposite effect. Any merger conferring a certain advantage over competitors would fall within the new definition. All parties concerned are used to applying the existing definition, on which there is now ample case law. A change in the definition would obscure the situation and lead to unnecessary legal uncertainty. Moreover, there is, in our opinion, a danger that the market would lose its dynamism if concentration processes were to be interfered with on a far bigger scale than at present. I accordingly believe that it would be better not to expand the definition. We agree with the proposal to leave Article 2(1) unchanged. However, the requirements applicable to evidence of the existence of efficiencies must not become excessive. It is future advantages that would have to be demonstrated, and these cannot possibly be guaranteed 100%. There is a need to clarify exactly when relevant information about efficiencies would have to be provided. The Commission calls for a substantial expansion of its powers of investigation, in line with those relating to cartel procedures under Regulation 1/2003. However, in our view, there is an essential difference between the aim of merger control and combating violations of cartel rules. When investigating a concentration, unlike in the case of a cartel violation, it is not assumed that the law has been broken. We accordingly consider the Commission’s proposal for increasing its investigative resources under this Regulation excessive, particularly if viewed in the context of the enormous fines that the Commission can impose for non-compliance with the provisions of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can be compelled to give evidence against himself. This is an important basic principle of criminal law and should apply here too. It is therefore well worth laying down in the Regulation that, when carrying out an investigation, the Commission should respect the rights of the parties concerned. This particularly applies to the right to silence for company lawyers, and also indeed for other employees whom the Commission may question.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, I would draw attention to the lack of internal and external monitoring of the Commission’s decision-making. As things stand at present, there is no separation between the investigating authority and the authority taking the decision. This is difficult to reconcile with the requirement of legal certainty and independence. The legitimacy of decision-making can be further promoted by setting up a specialised chamber for competition at the Court of First Instance. This could also speed up the procedure and improve the quality of the administration of justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true that, if we accept the comments of Mr Monti, it is still necessary to make proposals in the field of the public aid proposed, and I wish them every success, even though it cannot be denied that this is clearly a road strewn with dangers and difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">In the field of conciliations, it is the case that the reform of Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 has not been as radical a change as the one which has taken place, for example, in the field of anti-competitive behaviour. This is firstly due to the fact that Regulation (EEC) No 4064/89 was a good regulation, it was a good legislative text, which has allowed us to carry out a suitable Community competition policy in the field of conciliations.</p>
<p class="contents">In September 2000, on the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of this Regulation, the Commission organised a seminar to discuss it and the opinions expressed by the specialists and sectors involved in it were positive, despite the criticism of certain very specific aspects. Subsequently, the Commission produced a Green Paper containing proposals for reform, which were also partial and specific, which deserved the clear support of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now debating the report on the proposed reform; Mr Della Vedova has produced a wonderful report and I congratulate him on it. The report contains some very significant aspects, and perhaps one of the very important aspects which should be stressed is that it differs from the Commission’s report on a point on which, at the same time, the Commission differs from the proposal contained in its Green Paper. This is the problem of multiple notifications.</p>
<p class="contents">These multiple notifications increase the costs for notifiers and affect legal certainty since, in so far as various authorities have to decide on a single concentration, there is always the possibility of contradictory resolutions. And if there was anything on which there was complete agreement it was the fact that the unnecessarily complex rule in Article 1(3), introduced in the 1997 reform, had not contributed to resolving the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the Green Paper proposed the three-country rule, but now that rule is being forgotten in favour of a system, which is welcome, of two-way communications, either from the national authorities to the Commission, or from the Commission to the national authorities. But maintaining the text of Article 1(3).</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that, as I have said, the improvement of these referral mechanisms deserved our applause, but we do not understand the reasons for having forgotten the three-country rule, unless it has been detected that, as happened in 1997, the majority of countries wish to keep in their hands a significant competence to implement policies with industrial content, which is not always necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Della Vedova has mentioned the Socialist Group's insistence on the participation of workers and says that this is not the place to deal with it. I cannot agree with that opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that, regardless of whether the conditions relating to efficiencies is reformed, any competition authority, on approving a concentration, takes account of certain efficiencies and there is no question that one of the most important of these efficiencies is the maintenance or creation of jobs, and this being the case, the information the representatives of the workers can provide is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If I were to grade different areas of responsibility within the EU, issues of competition would be among the most important. The work you do, Mr Monti, is of the greatest importance if the market economy is to operate, if Europe is to be able to grow, if there is to be a business-oriented EU and if all European consumers are to be given a choice in respect of low prices and high quality. Trying to strike a balance between the interests of companies and those of the consumer is not always simple, but I respect you for the work you have done. It is of necessity that the concentration rules are now being reviewed and modernised. The market is changing. Competition is increasing, and internationalisation and globalisation give rise to different basic conditions. We are entitled to demand that the EU’s concentration rules be legally secure and predictable, that investigations and assessments be genuine and rapidly carried out and that both the Commission’s and the national authorities’ rules be clear. These are things we are entitled to demand, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">The Della Vedova report further strengthens the Commission’s proposals in these respects. We believe it would be a step in the wrong direction to enlarge what is called the concept of dominance. </p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to touch upon the amendments by the ELDR Group. The Commission should be able to have a more dynamic and long-term perspective when the market basis is assessed in the case of concentrations and be able to see the common market in a global context. That applies in purely general terms but, in particular, it is important for leading companies in smaller countries to be able to grow stronger, within their own countries as well, and to do so with a view to providing more jobs within the whole of the EU and to increasing competitiveness outside the EU too. </p>
<p class="contents">We are sympathetic towards the amendments by the Group of the Party of European Socialists. The employees’ viewpoints are, of course, important, but concentrations of that type should, in our view, not be regulated in this context.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think this is very regrettable, because, as it has been stated here before, it is indeed an excellent report and the rapporteur has done a good job. The situation was such, however, that the amendments tabled by our group had simply not received any support from other groups. This is why it was difficult for us to vote in favour. We have re-tabled some of those amendments in this plenary, for we have really whittled them down to what we think was really essential and necessary. I sincerely hope that other groups, particularly the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, which has taken our side on issues of this kind in the past, are prepared to re-consider this carefully, so that we can vote in favour of this report wholeheartedly and without any reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will explain the kind of amendments they are, and I want to demonstrate why these, in our view, are perfectly in keeping with the Lisbon agenda. The guiding principle underlying the Lisbon agenda is that policy must become more coherent so as to promote greater competitiveness, sustainable growth, employment and social cohesion. This means that we have to abandon the three-pillars structure and ensure that policy adopted in the various directorates-general and in the various councils of ministers is also in line with our other objectives. Consideration should in this respect also be given to the required cohesion of policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, with regard to the regulation on concentrations, we would particularly draw your attention to two aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the assessment should consider aspects other than competition in the narrow sense of the word. In our amendment, we explicitly call for considerations with regard to the contribution that concentrations can make to improved production and marketing systems, to international competitiveness, to consumer interests and to the creation of jobs and the employment situation in general. This is thus a reasonably wide definition, and one that is capable of offering the necessary flexibility and room for manoeuvre. Amendment No 37 contains words to this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect is about a serious and fully-fledged consultation of employee representatives within the procedures. Particularly Amendments Nos 40 and 41 concern this topic. In current practice, employee councils or trade union representatives are heard only at their explicit request, that is, if they have at their disposal information that tells them that a concentration or merger is in progress. Then there is the question of whether their arguments will be addressed seriously if they are consulted about the employment and social implications of the proposed merger. This ties in with the other amendment I mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">They should be called upon by the authorities not only to gain an insight into the market positions and competitive risks, but it should also be possible to have serious discussions about those other effects. This should form a standard component of the procedure and this is what we hope our amendments will achieve. I truly hope that this will be re-considered in the other groups. I would already like to thank Mr Olle Schmitt for his support for part of these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have done this because our group stands for the social market economy, because we back the Lisbon objectives, and because social cohesion is not incompatible with economic success; on the contrary, it is contingent upon it. We will not, however, be supporting the Social Democrats’ amendments, either in committee or in plenary, as these things have to be dealt with where they belong. Most of those who have spoken before me have pointed out that this refusal does not go against people’s interests, but that we must find a place for our concerns where the matter in hand requires it, and where the most good can result.</p>
<p class="contents">The control of mergers is meant to ensure that EU law applies to them, and it is because the Mergers Regulation works well as an instrument of European competition legislation that we are all appealing to the Commission. It would be a mistake if amendments, albeit necessary ones, to an essentially good and workable instrument were to make it more bureaucratic, more costly and more time-consuming than it at present is in a form that has stood the test of time.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore endorse the Regulation’s objectives. It has to be said, for the benefit of those listening to this debate, that Parliament has no power of codecision on this issue, but is simply being consulted. We want greater clarity, greater legal certainty and the introduction of speedier procedures. That is why we also endorse the proposal for more flexible deadlines, which will bring great advantages to businesses. It is apparent from all the interventions that there are three points on which we have had criticisms to make, and we will continue to make them in the hope that the Commission will change tack. The first of them is that – as I see it – Parliament holds fast to the one-stop-shop principle. What this means is that, where a merger crosses more than two borders between Member States, this has to be reported directly to the Commission. This makes for clarity, legal certainty and is the simplest way of doing things in view of EU enlargement. I see the abandonment of the principle in the Green Book as regrettable, and urge you to return to it. You would thereby be helping to reduce costs and bureaucracy and increase legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point is the definition of the market. We believe that your definition of the ‘economically dominant position’ is too broad and that the old definition is potentially clearer. The third point is one that must be faced head-on – the issue of the way in which the provisions on mergers are being brought closer to those in the Cartels Regulation. Here, you are confusing apples with pears. What needs to be made clear is that mergers are legal, whereas cartels are not. This distinction must be kept and the two must not be confused with one another. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an extremely sensitive area, in which legal certainty should be enhanced and administrative procedures made more flexible. The transparency and monitoring of decisions, and appeals against them, should also be improved, as should the active, dynamic and appropriate participation of all the parties involved in undertakings.</p>
<p class="contents">Concentrations or mergers between undertakings are a fundamental economic and legal process. They make the markets more dynamic, help undertakings to restructure and encourage economies to grow. This process cannot and should not be perceived as leading inevitably to the abuse of a dominant position. A very clear distinction must be drawn between, on the one hand, the whole business of investigating violations of competition rules following allegedly irregular behaviour and, on the other, the normal process of monitoring a merger, which should, as a matter of principle, be accepted as legal and in accordance with the rules governing the market.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the amendments already approved by the Parliamentary committee, and those to be tabled in plenary, in particular by the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are of fundamental importance. In Community legislation and its underlying political philosophy, competition is not an end in itself. It is, rather, an instrument with which to achieve and attain the Union’s major goals.</p>
<p class="contents">Extreme caution is needed, therefore, when adopting European Union legislation with a view to substantially reducing competition (such laws exist in other legislative systems, in particular in the United States). It is only right for the final positions of the Parliamentary committee and the rapporteur to reflect this caution. It should not be forgotten, furthermore, that the majority of those consulted in business circles expressed reservations and concerns about the adoption of new legislation, especially in view of the fact that the legislation on abuse of the dominant position has worked well up to now.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts made by the Commission to table this proposal for a regulation, following the December 2001 Green Paper, are much to be commended, and deserve Parliament’s support overall. It is crucial, however, that some amendments be introduced to improve the text of this report, emphasising legal certainty and, above all, highlighting the role which workers in the merging undertakings should play. The workers should oversee the whole process and provide not only relevant information but also guarantees that the operation in question will be an economic and social success. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Cooperation comes about quite legally, with the objective of maximising opportunities on global markets; it is an important element in the free and dynamic internal market. It therefore follows that they still have their problems, most of which arise when widely divergent enterprise cultures are brought together. The new structures that result make for more conflicts. Businesses are often slimmed down, resulting in severe job losses. If there is to be a single European internal market, it needs to be laid down in unambiguous terms precisely when mergers have to be reported. In its Green Paper, the Commission has already stressed that they are always to fall within its own remit where mergers have been reported to the authorities in at least three Member States, and that is also the line that I take.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that this is where costly and time-consuming procedures in the Member States can at last be done away with. Rather than perpetuating the fragmentation that is already widespread, there may quite probably – as my colleagues have already pointed out – be some simplification and tightening-up, not to mention greater legal certainty. While this is going on, national competition rules must continue to apply in full, although they must not conflict with Community rules.</p>
<p class="contents">It strikes me that the imminent enlargement of our European Union will make the one-stop-shop system ever more important. If I may add a comment on the threshold value, our Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs proposes that the Commission should look into the merger of companies if their joint turnover in at least three Member States is greater than 10% of their overall turnover in the European Union. There is another point, Commissioner Monti, where I cannot support the Commission’s position. You seek to extend the definition of companies’ ‘economically dominant position’ to cover markets that are oligopolies, no matter when the merger comes about. Let me quote: ‘has a tangible and lasting influence on competition’. It is all too logical that mergers are meant to procure advantages over against competitors. I warn you against over-regulation. The markets would lose much of the dynamism that they need.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Della Vedova’s report is sound, and my Group, that of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, is in absolute agreement with it. The Socialists have tabled a number of new amendments, and, Mrs van den Burg, we will be voting on them tomorrow. Much of what these amendments contain one can certainly live with – but not in this report and not at this juncture. We are the party of the social market economy, and nothing will change that, as Mr Karas quite rightly pointed out, but introducing small amendments into these positions is like applying small amounts of cosmetics. That is something we must formulate elsewhere; that must indeed be clearly articulated, and I believe that we can find a common mind if we do this somewhere else. I hope that it will be possible for one or other amendment to be withdrawn; perhaps we will manage to get a broad consensus by tomorrow lunchtime. I am firmly convinced that this report by Mr Della Vedova deserves one rather than our later being suddenly disunited. Perhaps the Socialists will have a few new ideas by tomorrow. That is very much to be wished. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am delighted to see that, by and large, the report supports the Commission's proposal, and that we share the same general objectives with regard to the need for reform. The Commission is, however, I am afraid, unable to accept the various amendments tabled. I would like to explain why, although, for, reasons of time I shall have to be brief, starting with the substantive test in the regulation on concentrations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has come to the conclusion that the substantive test should be clarified, by adding a few words to the present text - words that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs wish to see removed. Why do we think that this change is needed? Many observers believe that the present test may not be adequate to cope with concentrations that raise competition problems in cases of what is known as ’non-collusive oligopoly’. If this is true, opting to keep the dominant position test as it is would mean failing to take advantage of an opportunity to make it clear that the substantive test for assessing concentrations will be applied without fail to all concentrations harmful to consumers' interests. I would also like to emphasise that the prevailing view in international economic literature is that oligopoly situations arising from concentrations can have long-term anticompetitive effects and thus harm consumers' interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission brought forward its proposal because it had become aware of the need to guarantee maximum legal certainty, an objective which it seems to me was generally shared and supported by various speakers, including Mr Olle Schmidt, Mr Ilgenfritz, Mr Santos and others. The greatest legal certainty you can have here is a genuinely effective instrument for controlling concentrations. We are convinced that the wording proposed would provide the greatest legal certainty possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards jurisdiction, a subject covered in depth in the Della Vedova and Doorn reports, and one on which various speakers commented, including Mr Berenguer Fuster and Mr Karas, I believe we all agree that it is necessary to achieve a sensible division of labour between the Commission and the Member States, thus minimising the burdens on companies and on public regulatory authorities. This means having allocation thresholds which, as far as possible, reflect an optimum division, and applying a referral system that can, so to speak, rectify incorrect allocations as far as is possible. We therefore propose to simplify and make more flexible the provisions for referring cases from the Commission to Member States and vice versa, thus also making it possible, as some companies have indicated would be helpful, for referral to take place even before notification.</p>
<p class="contents">What lies behind our position on the amendments proposed in relation to jurisdiction? Your report, Mr Della Vedova, proposes a ‘2+’ rule combined with new turnover thresholds. I fully appreciate the intentions behind the proposed amendment, but I believe that it would introduce an additional complication, because companies would first have to find out where to notify an operation. That is the reason, Mr Berenguer Fuster, why we, ourselves, dropped the idea, appealing as it is, of a ‘3+’ system, because it would come up against the situation of non-harmonised national legislation on concentrations, for the time being at least. This might be a longer-term objective, but it is not one for today.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards partial referrals to Member States, I agree that we should keep these to a minimum, but I also believe that it would not be advisable totally to rule out such referrals, because they may be appropriate in some cases.</p>
<p class="contents">I now wish to turn to a subject that has attracted a lot of attention and concern. The Commission has also proposed that its own powers of enforcement, as laid down in the regulation on concentrations, should, to a large extent, be brought in line with the new regulation, Regulation 1/2003. There are, in particular, two exceptions, namely the power to search private homes and the power to conduct investigations into sectors of the economy, which we, too, do not believe to be necessary for controlling concentrations. We do not, therefore, propose to introduce such powers.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that, like you, we believe that there should not be any presumption that the law is being breached in concentrations, and that they are, therefore, effectively different from cartels, for example. That much is clear. I would like to reassure the rapporteur, Mr Della Vedova, the draftsman, Mr Doorn, and also Mr Karas, Mr Mann and other Members about this basic principle. It is therefore only right that our powers of enforcement should not be any more extensive than necessary. Nevertheless, our priority objective is to ensure that these powers are sufficiently effective to allow the Commission to discharge its duties and to protect consumers against the risk of harm from anticompetitive concentrations, and I believe that the powers we have proposed are necessary to this end. Of course, you may well argue that, as control of concentrations is an area different from other aspects of competition, less draconian powers are needed here than those required, for instance, to combat cartels. Although I have said that these are two different areas, forgive me if I come to a different conclusion about enforcement powers. Why? Because concentrations have a unique  one-off if you like  structural impact on the market, which is irreversible. For this reason, there is an argument that it is even more vital for the Commission to have effective powers to collect information, as otherwise we may reach a decision whose consequences for competition would be irreparable.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, Mr President, concerns workers' rights, a subject raised by Mr Berenguer Fuster, Mrs van den Burg and Mr Santos, and an issue on which other Members disagreed with them. I believe - like those dissenting voices - that we are all working within the social market economy, and we consider workers' rights to be of the utmost importance. In fact, as has already been mentioned, appropriate instruments exist at Community level, but we believe there is a need for appropriate allocation of the various instruments to a range of different objectives. The regulation on concentrations is principally concerned with the components of the social market economy, and we do not, therefore, believe that it should be cluttered with measures to stimulate or safeguard employment: there are other instruments for that. In any case, the notifications are in the public domain, so that interested parties, including trade union representatives, are kept fully informed of whatever merger operations are in progress. We have, in any case, welcomed, and, what is more, at times actually sought the input that workers' representatives can provide in the procedure.</p>
