Let me acknowledge, in particular, the efforts made by Mr Maat on this important initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal welfare is an emotive subject. This is reflected by the wide participation in the debate and in part by the large number of amendments tabled. The Commission proposal aims to achieve significant improvement in the welfare of transported animals. It focuses in particular on long journeys, as it is these journeys that are most likely to cause problems. It seeks to introduce clearer and upgraded standards, as well as stronger enforcement rules. This proposal has been the result of extensive analysis, scientific advice and stakeholder consultation. I am sure it does not fulfil the wishes of the ardent proponents of both sides of the animal welfare debate, but I am quite sure that if introduced now it would implement major improvements in the transport conditions of animals that have been the dream of animal welfare enthusiasts for years.</p>
<p class="contents">I make really sure that any amendment which either seeks unduly to liberalise transport conditions or restrict them is doomed to failure. I have indicated that I am willing to participate in constructive dialogue with a view to reaching a speedy agreement and an early improvement of transport conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the major political aspects of the dossier concerns travelling times. The Commission proposes to replace the current rules by a simple scheme for all species involving a nine-hour maximum travelling time, to be followed by a minimum of twelve hours' rest if the journey is to be continued. It is no accident that these times coincide with the travel and rest rules applicable to drivers. Hence, enforcement should be much more straightforward – a crucially important aspect of this legislation as far as I am concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">I am prepared to consider variations on the theme proposed by the Commission in order to reach a durable compromise. However, let me be very frank: I cannot accept amendments which have as their practical effect a ban on the transport of live animals whether for slaughter, further rearing or breeding purposes. I believe such a move would be illegal and <span class="italic">ultra vires</span> of the Treaty. It would be liable to be struck down by the Court. In all events, there is no chance of such an initiative being supported in the Council. That is why I have been suggesting the adoption of an intelligent and sophisticated approach to the improvement of animal welfare. Putting it bluntly, tilting at windmills will be poor consolation if the greatest opportunity in a decade to improve welfare arrangements is not to be grasped. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maat (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, I thank the Commissioner for his initial contribution. However, before I add my own comment to the new animal transport directive, I should like to dwell briefly on an event in my own country, namely the departure of our Queen Mother, Princess Juliana. During her reign, she always showed a special interest in the agricultural sector and cattle farming in my country. To her, each and every human being and animal mattered. I would like to commemorate her today at the start of this debate and commiserate with her family and with all those who will miss her.</p>
<p class="contents">The review of Directives 64/432/EEC and 93/119/EC on the transport of animals has been rather a long time coming. I appreciate Commissioner Byrne's contribution, because after our debate on the resolution of 2001, he took up the gauntlet after all. In addition to animal welfare, it was mainly the FMD crisis and the outbreaks of swine fever that were reasons for me as rapporteur to subject legislation to a thorough overhaul.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, though, that the Commission's proposal does not offer a real choice. Given the proposed time limits of nine hours in transit and twelve hours rest, with unlimited repeats of this cycle, and the very generous expansion of space allowance per animal, one can confidently conclude that transport in excess of nine hours would become unaffordable. As rapporteur, however, I distance myself somewhat from that approach, because it does not do any justice to the already difficult income situation in cattle farming and because the limitation of the risks of animal diseases and the regularisation of the slaughter practice are insufficiently addressed. Moreover, too much space per animal leads to an unnecessary risk of injury during transport, so let me now set out the line I have decided to take.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, transport up to 100 kilometres should be kept outside of the scope of the directive, to avoid the so-called farmers' transport for slaughter and productive cattle from becoming unnecessarily expensive. Moreover, this transport mainly involves regional cattle farm systems and during these transports, there are hardly ever, if any, problems involving animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, space allowance requirements for cattle for slaughter should not be considerably altered. The restriction in the transport of cattle for slaughter to nine hours or 500 kilometres, the time and distance covered by 97% of cattle transported for slaughter, already applies. Transitional provisions should be put in place, though, for regions that have few slaughterhouses or special market problems. In addition, I should like to argue in favour of specifically promoting the establishment of slaughterhouses in regions where animals are kept. Why, when milk and sugar are generally processed in the regions where they are produced, would this not be possible in the case of animals for slaughter?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to productive cattle and traditional systems for fattening animals, I suggest a transport limit of 30 hours, including eight hours rest, but no unloading at staging places. I would also argue in favour of a separate regulation for cattle for breeding and racehorses, with a strict rest and feed regime. In general, however, the transport conditions for this group are already excellent.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I am in favour of more, and also more specific, controls of international transport. This point, in particular, is the Achilles' heel of current EU practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, I would like to see rest periods and driving times in existing EU directives for the transport sector coupled to fresh legislation. Furthermore, the GPS system should be introduced for international transport, so that unnecessary bureaucracy is prevented and controls can be carried out much more effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that especially this latter point is no unnecessary luxury has, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, been demonstrated in unannounced road checks in Austria, where no less than 50% of the animal hauliers appeared to break the law. It also raises questions when no fewer than 221 000 live cattle are exported to Lebanon every year, which translates into an entire cow for every two families in Lebanon on an annual basis! As far as I am concerned, there is every reason to adapt legislation, particularly with regard to the transport of animals for slaughter. I would therefore urge my fellow MEPs to support Amendments Nos 1 to 97 inclusive, Amendments Nos 109, 110, 111, 112 and 115. This strikes the best balance between animal welfare and what cattle farmers would find economically acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Council adopts this proposal, cattle farming in Europe will not be squeezed out of the market and animal welfare will enjoy a structural improvement. I would ask the Commission and Council to adopt a preliminary position at this stage. Finally, I should like to thank the different groups for the excellent cooperation during the preparation and discussion of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In relation to the Commission's proposal, many of the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee were not taken on board in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, but I hope the amendments that have been tabled will be supported when the vote takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">The rest period on the vehicles, for example, is completely impractical. A rest period on a vehicle cannot be considered as a rest period for a number of reasons. Firstly, conditions do not change at all for the animals. It would be very difficult to water and feed those animals unless the vehicle is equipped to make that possible. If that were the case, it would be economically unviable for transporters to have such a vehicle. It is going to be very difficult to look after the animals if the rest period is on the vehicle. How are dead animals going to be removed from the vehicle?</p>
<p class="contents">There was a recent case in Ireland in relation to Pandora, which said it did not want to transport live animals any more, presumably for economic reasons. They can see it coming in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, in relation to the continued cycle, the idea of a period of rest on a journey that can continue indefinitely is completely unacceptable. Even the industry does not agree with the rest period on the vehicle. This is one of the key issues that have to be addressed in Parliament this week.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to fraud in export refunds – an issue that came up during last night's sitting and in the media recently – one of the ways to avoid that would be to get rid of export refunds. The vast majority of European citizens do not want their money used to subsidise the inhumane transport of animals, which causes untold and unnecessary suffering. I agree with Mr Maat about the provision of local abattoirs. In some places in Germany, mobile abattoirs are provided to slaughter animals if no abattoir is available locally. We must ensure that animals are not subjected to unnecessary suffering, and this is clearly unnecessary. The Environment Committee is strongly of that opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a very emotive issue, nowhere more so than in the UK. I would also like to thank him straight away for co-sponsoring my amendments to ask the Commission and the UK Government to look for an opt-out, especially on the transport of live horses to the continent for slaughter. This is something that has not happened in the UK for over 70 years, and we want to make sure it does not start to happen again. I thank Mr Maat very much for that.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the good things about Mr Maat's report is that he has differentiated between animals going for slaughter and those going for further fattening. There is no justification for taking animals on huge journeys for slaughter – whenever possible they must be slaughtered in the country where they are reared. We have also heard that at the moment about EUR 52 million is still being paid out on export subsidies. A lot of these cattle are going to Lebanon, and their journeys do not end there: they continue for a great many hours after that. We have to make sure we put an end to that.</p>
<p class="contents">As we put this legislation in place, one of the keys to this whole process is proper enforcement: to ensure that we have the right type of lorries and the proper rest periods. We must also ensure that if these international transporters do not meet the requirements, they have their licences taken away. This would send a very clear message to the industry that you cannot abuse the system.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are trying to do is good, and we need to get the right type of transport in place. I disagree with the Commission proposal on the idea of a 12-hour rest on a lorry, especially if it concerns sheep. This is not practical and we must have an overall end to the journey. That is what Mr Maat is proposing in this report. I very much recommend the report to the House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Only because of the rapporteur’s persistence and huge efforts have we got so far as to have the report on the agenda for this part-session. Animals will benefit from the fact, and it should be to the delight of the many Europeans who are concerned about animal welfare. On behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I have tabled an amendment that limits the journey time for animals for slaughter to eight hours. There was no majority for this in the committee, but hopefully there will be a majority for it during the vote.</p>
<p class="contents">I am genuinely pleased that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development adopted my amendment concerning differentiated places in the case of journey times of less than four hours, for this will contribute to still more journeys taking place over short distances and, thus, to animals remaining in their countries of origin and being slaughtered there.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to journey times, there must be a lot of focus upon the conditions under which animals are transported, for even a journey time of two hours can be too long if the conditions are not as they should be. I am therefore delighted that the proposal on the table contains so many good decisions about ventilation, temperature and gradients of loading ramps. In that connection, it is definitely also worth mentioning that certificates are now being demanded of haulage contractors and that there is a demand for drivers and others who have dealings with animals to be trained to recognise and respond to issues concerning the animals’ welfare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is peculiar about this issue is the erratic nature of the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with the difficulties of defining animal welfare in an objective manner, the Commission has been making proposals by trial and error. Having tried to apply the inapplicable rest centres, it is now making the current proposal which is just as extraordinary, in my view. How can we imagine that an extended stop during the journey can benefit animal welfare? Looked at in this way, it seems to me to be extremely simple-minded.</p>
<p class="contents">We can imagine the effects of such a proposal if applied to ourselves. Allow me to offer this comparison: if on a car journey, just before reaching our destination, we were obliged to stop for a considerable length of time, without getting out of the car, our nerves would naturally suffer considerably.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission's proposal poses serious problems in terms of rigour, we must acknowledge that the draft report, despite the efforts of Mr Maat, represents little more than ‘every man for himself’.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a distinction is established between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended for fattening. Why should animals intended for slaughter have more right to well-being than those intended for fattening? As far as I am aware, according to the Treaties, all men are equal, and animals as well. It is clear that the draft report guarantees that 40% of Dutch exports of pigs go to their farthest destination: the Spanish market. Alright: 1 400 000 pigs will be able to travel for 30 hours, while the poor pigs intended for slaughter will have the right to a final wish and will not be able to travel for more than nine hours. What a wonderful achievement for the welfare of animals! It is true that, with the nine hours, pigs originating from Poland, for example, will be able to be sacrificed in certain nearby countries, leaving the added value there and not exactly promoting compliance by Polish slaughterhouses with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, this draft report addresses many issues and not simply animal welfare. We must recognise that nobody transports animals for the fun of it. The transportation of live animals is expensive and complicated, and is only done when necessary. I believe that the essential thing as far as the welfare of animals is concerned is to reduce the total travelling time for all animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Huge numbers of people oppose live exports; they are unnecessary, cruel and unjustifiable. My Amendment No 114 would enable Member States to ban them, and I urge colleagues to vote for it. This is not 'tilting at windmills', as Commissioner Byrne put it. It reflects public opinion, it respects much scientific opinion and it is the only humane and acceptable approach.</p>
<p class="contents">That the EU can continue to allow animals to be transported across Europe for many hours – sometimes over 40 or 50 hours, sometimes up to 90 hours – is completely unacceptable, both from an animal welfare point of view and from the point of view of trying to prevent the spread of disease. It is therefore crucial that Parliament accepts our amendments, particularly Amendment No 123, for an overall, final maximum journey time of eight hours for slaughter and for fattening.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it now seems that the United Kingdom Government is apparently – at the last minute – supporting the amendments for an overall eight-hour limit, I fear that this can only be a cynical PR stunt, since for the last six months it has been wrecking just such an outcome in the Council of Ministers. Not only that, but the United Kingdom Government has also completely failed to guarantee to protect our horses from being exported to the continent for slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">These are hugely important issues and we must make sure that our parliamentary response addresses them properly.</p>

The implementation of the internal market has required the elimination of the veterinary borders. Systematic veterinary controls at the borders are viewed as technical obstacles to trade. It must be possible to transport livestock freely around the whole of the EU like any other goods. Effective border controls on the transportation of animals are being made unlawful. The Commission’s proposal is a consistent implementation of this idea. The Commission’s proposal ensures that the fullest possible use can be made of all the economic advantages. A small pig born in Sweden can be fattened in Portugal and slaughtered in Poland, as long as savings are thereby made. That is the heart of the Commission’s proposal. Animal welfare has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Long journeys amount to cruelty to animals, and livestock diseases are becoming more widespread. Veterinary safety is threatened, with animal and human health suffering as a result. For example, we now have the multi-resistant salmonella DT104 in Denmark. This must be stopped. There must be legislation in relation to the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 100 exempts livestock from the rules governing the internal market. It must be possible to devise more far-reaching national rules governing the transport of animals and the equipping of vehicles. It must be possible to introduce veterinary inspections at the borders with attendant quarantine arrangements. This will be effective in limiting livestock diseases, and it will decisively reduce the number of long journeys so that, as a minimum, the longest journeys will be of eight hours. Moreover, this will apply to all animals, both those that are going to slaughter and those that are for fattening.</p>
<p class="contents">In another amendment, I propose that, for journeys of over eight hours, there should be systematic veterinary checks at the beginning of the journey and on the unloading platform at delivery. That is necessary in order constantly to evaluate whether the journeys have been defensible in terms of the animals’ welfare. At present, it is only the driver who provides feedback on the schedule, and this feedback contains no information about the condition of the animals. In the amendment, I also propose that animal transport exceeding eight hours should be subject to a levy towards the funding of checks and supervision. If the controls are to be effective, they will involve costs. The expenses linked to this aspect of livestock production must be defrayed in the form of a charge paid by the haulage contractors to the local authorities. There is no question of an EU tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are already sensible provisions regulating the transport of animals and favouring their well-being, which is one of the characteristics of the European agricultural model. The only problem is that these provisions are not adequately applied everywhere and are not monitored enough. Rather than, however, ensuring that there is better application and control – too difficult a task – the Commission decided that it was more rewarding for it to once again rush headlong into regulation by presenting us with this hefty new tome which concedes to the most radical demands of the ideological lobbies whose influence it is under.</p>
<p class="contents">The major repercussions that its wording could have on our transporters and breeders are of little importance to the Commission. It is not visibly the problem of the European Commission which, as is its wont, does not even think about providing, alongside the legislative project, a study of the impact of the measures that it is proposing on the activity of the professionals concerned. We had lengthy discussions in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development about how steep access ramps to livestock trucks should be. Should they be no steeper than 33.3% in relation to the horizontal, or 30% for pigs, calves and horses, and no steeper than 50% or 30% for sheep and cattle other than calves, provided that the ramps are equipped with cleats at intervals of no more than 30 centimetres? All that remains to be taken into account is the friction coefficient of the hooves on the ramp. This gap will certainly be filled in the next draft regulation submitted to us by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, is it really our role to overburden our producers, breeders, transporters and wealth and employment creators with such meticulous instructions and to force them into such a tight straightjacket? Is it not downright suicidal to establish such heavy burdens and such costly constraints only upon European economic operators in a context of free trade where we ourselves are managing without regulatory instruments? Is that not working to benefit third countries, discourage our producers and encourage imports?</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the few common-sense remarks inserted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, such as the need to slaughter livestock as close as possible to the place of rearing, the structure and the spirit of the Commission regulation basically remain intact. This is why, Mr President, we will vote against this damaging text. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, however, the problem of regulating the various aspects of transport has become a major component of legislation in the animal production sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The first requirement that has arisen concerns health, especially the spread of transmissible diseases. Added to this is the increasingly important question of animal protection and stress factors. Animal welfare during transport more directly involves operators other than farmers, even though the latter often suffer its consequences, both upstream, when they receive the animals to be added to their holdings, and downstream, because of the effects that transport can have on quality and hence on the return they get for their products.</p>
<p class="contents">Legislation protecting livestock during transport, in particular the regulation on which we are preparing to vote, is based on scientific and technical evidence. In this specific instance, we recall the studies following the report by the Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare, which took into account over 300 sources and drew up 55 recommendations. If we consider the five freedoms mentioned in the Bremmer report in 1995, we realise that the unloading, loading and moving operations will have a profound effect on each of these five freedoms. Indeed, it has been proved that this set of operations causes the animals greater stress and suffering than any other farming practice.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the maximum hours proposed and the system of rest periods are too reductionist, and the reasoning adopted in support of shorter travelling times cannot be justified from a scientific point of view: the Scientific Committee itself did not set this limit when it drew up its report. There is no doubt that transport can have a great many adverse effects on animals, but the whole situation must be analysed in technical terms for the good of both the animals themselves and the operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Furthermore, we must not forget that the transport of animals is subject to the rules and standards of the internal market and that we cannot legislate without taking account of economic reality, because surrounding the transport of animals there is economic activity for many areas of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot agree with the rapporteur’s proposal with regard to the difference between animals intended for slaughter and animals intended to live. Dignified transportation affects both equally.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the duration of transportation, from the outset the Commission has maintained its desire to bring the permitted duration of transportation into line with social legislation, but the truth is, Commissioner, that the best thing for the animal’s welfare is to reach its destination as quickly as possible. A rest of 12 hours for animals in the vehicle blatantly violates the welfare and dignity of the animals being transported, but the restriction of nine hours’ transportation also blatantly violates the principle of the internal market. We therefore believe that the coherent and correct solution or proposal will be to establish the obligation for two drivers, with a cycle of nine hours which would allow for a brief rest in order to be able to continue another cycle of nine hours in the transportation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we believe that all our efforts on this proposal to guarantee the dignity of animals in transport must focus on good conditions for the vehicles which transport them, good preparation of the people responsible for the transportation and, above all, ensuring that the rules we decide on here are complied with throughout the territory of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The distinction between journeys for slaughter and for other purposes is an important one.

It is far more important, however, that there should be a marked reduction in animal transports themselves. That really would be in the animals’ interests, and it would also make it more difficult for dangerous animal diseases to spread and reduce environmental pollution from carbon dioxide emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Most people think it is uncivilised to drive animals hundreds or even thousands of kilometres across Europe and the world for slaughter. They rightly demand that animals be transported to the nearest abattoirs and be marketed from there. It is after all much easier to deliver frozen meat to remote areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Transports of slaughter animals should be limited to four hours. That is long enough to reach an abattoir from almost any farm anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The report says the cross-border transport of animals is necessary because of the unequal distribution of resources and demand, owing to geographical and historical factors. I cannot support that view. EU subsidies have nevertheless been widely used to encourage concentration of abattoir capacities.</p>
<p class="contents">The main reason is the policy of liberalisation and concentration, which is destroying regional trade patterns. So long as this policy is applied, everything that is to be done to protect animals during transport will be treating the symptoms and not the cause. What the report says about giving priority to slaughter close to place of rearing, financial support for local slaughterhouses or the use of mobile slaughterhouses will be impossible to achieve in a European Union of 25 Member States. The reality is different. The merger trend in the slaughtering industry is continuing. The distances over which animals are transported are growing. Monitoring animal transports from space by satellite positioning may be a very interesting technology, but it is just one method of surveillance, of which in my view we have too many. The effectiveness of all methods should be looked at again.</p>
<p class="contents">This report ought to be promoting regional business cycles. That is why I can and must say that it needs to be completely revised to that effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dutch pigs spend 30 to 40 hours being transported to Spain and Italy; Irish sheep travel to Greece and even the Middle East. Transport times of 90 hours are not uncommon. That is cruel. Horses from Eastern Europe are taken to Italy and Greece. That should stop, but the Commission has not proposed anything to that effect, and unfortunately, Mr Maat's report does not call an end to appallingly long transports of this kind either.</p>
<p class="contents">More than one million Dutch pigs travel over the Alps and Pyrenees to Italy and Spain in order to be fattened there. My group, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, wants to put a stop to this. Although Mr Maat has joined 333 MEPs in signing the written declaration to call an end to all animal transports lasting over eight hours, he is now sadly backtracking. This is, regrettably, typical of the Christian Democrats, for whom economic interests take precedence over animal welfare. For my group, precisely the opposite is the case, and a huge number of Dutch people and Europeans are on our side.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion in the Council, it has to be said, is even worse. Nobody in the Council is calling a halt to anything anymore. We have to stand firm on our views, give a clear message and not give in at this stage, for otherwise, alas, the Council will make an even worse job of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whilst the welfare of animals being transported from one jurisdiction to the next must be of paramount importance, I do not believe the policy direction proposed by the Commission to Parliament with regard to this measure is correct. Staging posts were originally introduced as a disease-control measure when the problems concerning BSE were first discovered. A lot of research has been carried out in Ireland on the merits or demerits of staging posts in general, and studies by leading agricultural research institutes have shown that it is better for animal welfare on long journeys between Ireland and the continent that staging posts remain. Staging posts allow animals to be unloaded, watered and rested, and also the essential cleaning and rebedding of trucks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development recently approved an amendment which stated that the competent authorities in each Member State shall identify a sufficient number of suitable unloading premises and notify the European Commission at regular intervals. This is a wise approach by the Committee on Agriculture. We all want to see the welfare of animals being transported long distances protected. The provision of proper conditions for live animals moving from one Member State to another must be guaranteed. However, how do we ensure that this is the case? I for one believe that the retention of staging posts is of key importance in this regard, and I am certainly not alone in this view. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development wisely chose Mr Maat to prepare this report, which largely succeeds in reconciling animal welfare with the economics of farming. The fact that over 450 amendments were tabled showed the extent of interest and the wide range of opinion as to detail. Mr Maat handled this with skill, but on such a high-profile issue the amendments tabled before Parliament calling for even tighter conditions were to be expected.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee's report achieved a number of important objectives: a reduction in travelling times; upgraded transport conditions, including provisions for rest periods, feeding and watering; additional training for drivers and animal handlers; improved enforcement of the rules; stronger rules relating to journey planning and registration; satellite monitoring of vehicle movement; the ability of Member States to ban export of animals for slaughter is included; there is a preference for slaughter near to the farm and encouragement for mobile slaughterhouses.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking ahead, we must ensure that the rules are properly implemented, that transport as meat increasingly becomes the norm, and that the rules are driven more by science than by emotion. I shall support the report and look forward to early adoption of the revised rules. The provision of a review clause would be helpful and I trust the Council will introduce this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can be no doubt that something needs to be done. I support the proposals made in this report that will help to improve standards in live animal transports, such as setting minimum standards for the vehicles used, but above all the introduction of additional supervisory measures, because however good the rules may be, they will not work if there are no controls. There are already plenty of rules, but enforcement and controls are lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2, of which I am a co-signatory, is designed to clarify the term ‘journey’ in order to prevent the maximum duration of transport being exceeded by the back door, so to speak. Transport times must be reduced in any case. The vote has been brought forward to today. Amendment No 81 states, and I quote: ‘sequences of travel times may be repeated during a journey’, which means there can be repeated journeys and the time limits can be avoided. As a block vote has been applied for, it is no longer possible to vote against Amendment No 81 on its own. I consider that unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The best thing would be for animals to be transported as little as possible. That is probably pie in the sky. We must be clear that sales-based support for live animal exports is an incentive and that we are therefore deceiving ourselves if we want to cut animal transports to a minimum so long as such support continues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animal welfare must be ensured during transport. This is an important issue. Most consignments are of course undertaken in the proper manner. We have nevertheless seen horrendous instances of problems occurring. They have to be eliminated by means of clear regulations and effective monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Circumstances vary from Member State to Member State and region to region. The circumstances in Finland are the ones I know best, especially in the sparsely populated areas of the north. Distances there are long, farms are few and far between, and slaughtering is concentrated in just a few large units, partly owing to stringent EU regulations. Animal transport is nevertheless handled excellently. Vehicles have camera surveillance and air-conditioning, and the animals are loaded using lifts.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed maximum transport time, however, is not totally adequate. It is necessary for the welfare of the animals that a derogation is granted in the case of sparsely populated areas, mountains and islands and that this time limit is extended. A derogation is also required for the transport of breeding calves. Keeping animals on vehicles during long breaks or unloading them periodically is impossible. If this derogation is not granted, agriculture in the peripheral regions of the Union will become impossible, which surely is not the purpose of the report. The Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism agreed to the derogation, and it is also contained in Mr Maat’s report. I hope that Parliament will also agree to this derogation and that agriculture may also be able to continue in thinly populated areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems as if the starting point for the proposal was that it should be about goods being transported as efficiently as possible in an internal market. This is a mistaken point of departure. We should instead be proceeding on the basis that what is at issue here are animals, that is to say sentient creatures. It is this insight that is the very basis of the rules to be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Nordic Green Left welcome the fact that the committee has made this progress. We believe, however, that still further progress can be made in several areas. We shall vote in favour of the Member States being entitled both to introduce and to retain national rules that are stricter than the EU rules in this area. That applies not only to journey times. We recommend that an absolute maximum of eight hours be introduced for journeys and that it should not be possible to circumvent this time regulation with reference to rest time in the vehicles that are being used for transportation.</p>
<p class="contents">The rules in the Commission’s proposal relating to space in the vehicles used for transportation are inadequate and need to be improved. We believe that the same rules should apply to all types of transport, irrespective of whether it is transport to slaughter or transport for fattening elsewhere. Strict rules regarding this point are positive above all in terms of the animals’ well-being, but also because they will favour local abattoirs and the development of mobile abattoirs.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add a few words about the EU’s export refunds in connection with the export of livestock from the EU. Large sums are at present used for these export refunds. This practice is completely indefensible. It means direct support for comprehensive cruelty to animals, with very long journey times. It is entirely obvious that there are large problems involving the misuse and direct misappropriation of money within this sector. Budgetary control is very deficient in this area. It is not reforms that are needed where this issue is concerned. Refunds for the export of livestock from the EU should instead be completely abolished as quickly as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Animal welfare is a very emotive issue in many ways, so any new legislation must be based on sound veterinary and scientific information. To judge from the amount of lobbying on this issue, this is clearly a very important issue for the citizens of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly welcome amendments acknowledging difficulties facing remote and peripheral areas for the transportation of animals – including Wales and the Western Isles of Scotland. That is an important inclusion within the body of the report. I hope we do not get bogged down, for example, in whether it is to be eight or nine hours. Rather, we should focus on what in my view is the far more important issue of proper policing of the regulations and ensuring that the rules are as practical and as workable as they can be.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to see the live trade ultimately replaced by a carcass trade, with animals slaughtered locally. We know of the dangers of not slaughtering locally in the wake of the epidemics of foot-and-mouth and other diseases, where because of transportation of animals, those kinds of diseases spread across the country far more easily. Where the transport of live animals is necessary, I hope we will end up with legislation that is both firm and fair for the industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, I should like to thank Mr Maat for his excellent report, which is a move in this direction, and for the improvements made in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which, in relation to the Commission proposal, help to give a more civilised image of our continent in the field of protecting animal rights. Of course, it is not just a matter of image – of projecting a more humane image outside the confines of the European Union – but it is also, and I might say above all, a matter of substance.</p>
<p class="contents">Some aspects of the problem involve animal health, as has already been mentioned. Let me underline a few of them. First of all, the maximum length of time spent on the road: given that livestock should be moved as little as possible, it would be appropriate to limit transport to eight hours or 500 km per day at most. That would apply both to slaughter animals and to those intended for fattening. As regards the transport of animals for breeding, shows and competitions, however, transport for more than eight hours should require the use of special vehicles. What does ‘special’ mean? It means that these vehicles should be fitted with equipment to measure the temperature and humidity in the livestock compartment, and there should be a forced ventilation system that operates when the vehicle is stationary.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in addition to the quite reasonable requirement of special training for drivers of vehicles intended for the transport of livestock, because we know that inappropriate driving inevitably causes the animals serious and unnecessary damage and suffering, I should also like to underline the need for an official veterinarian to be present while the animals are being loaded. This is to ensure that the rules for transport – the fitness of the animals to travel, and the minimum space allowances – are observed. For this reason we particularly support Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would also like to support what has already been said today. Animal welfare must be dealt with scientifically and not just emotionally. The avoidance of unnecessary animal transports and the protection of animals during transport are fundamental concerns of agriculture, especially of farmers and producers. It must be ensured, however, that the statutory provisions are realistic and that their enforcement will not place our European farmers at a competitive disadvantage. It must all remain within a sensible economic context and it must also comply with the European Union’s laws. That was also something that Commissioner Byrne mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">It is of course in everyone’s interest – farmers, animal welfare and the animals themselves – that animals should arrive at their destination safe and sound and in the best possible condition. This is particularly the case of animals for slaughter because the quality of the meat depends on it. Let me make one observation here, Mr President: once the animals leave the farm, they are in fact no longer the producer’s, the farmer’s responsibility, but the responsibility of the carrier or buyer.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very grateful to the rapporteur for paying attention to traditional pasturing and transhumance, which is absolutely essential in mountain regions.</p>
<p class="contents">One last thing. An international organisation called PETA is currently mounting a large-scale campaign in Austria, and I believe in other Member States as well, about the keeping and slaughter of farm animals. The treatment of animals is being compared with the horrors of the Nazi regime. That is an insult to all those who perished in the Holocaust, and I ask you to protest against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should probably say that, in my view, there is a considerable disparity between the title of the proposal and its content.</p>
<p class="contents">With the Commission’s proposal, it is still possible to transport animals thousands of kilometres throughout Europe under wretched conditions and, moreover, without the animals being allowed at any time to leave the lorries. In my view, that cannot be called protection of animals during transport. Nor do I think that the report by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development remedies the Commission’s proposal, and I therefore hope that, in the vote, Parliament will stick to the position it has, moreover, held for two years that the transport of animals to slaughter or for fattening should not be for periods in excess of eight hours or for distances in excess of 500 kilometres. Because it is defensible in terms of animal protection, that would be the proposal to implement.</p>
<p class="contents">I am, moreover, also able to support our obtaining better conditions for animals during transport. There is a long list of amendments that I think would remedy some of the shortcomings in the Commission’s proposal, so that animal welfare is given precedence over the financial considerations that otherwise govern the transports.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think it important that we implement tighter controls, including random checks on the roads. I believe that these would be some of the most effective measures that could be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">As others too have mentioned, I think that export refunds for livestock should be abolished. It cannot be right that, under the EU system, we give direct transport subsidies to these long transports of livestock. Finally, I also think that individual countries must be entitled to give higher priority to animal welfare and so to lay down more restrictive rules than those proposed by the Commission.</p>

The Commission does not have a police force, and I recognise the attempts being made by the Commissioner to try and introduce a system that is more capable of being enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">However, that is no way near enough. Inevitably horrific practices will continue to occur. We will find many instances of dead animals being left amongst live animals on journeys taking many days. It is now some 150 years since refrigeration was introduced, which allowed beef from Argentina to be imported into Europe. It is simply incredible that all this time later we are still transporting live animals huge distances within our continent. The time is going to come when we will impose a ban on this, when carcasses only will be permitted. Refrigeration permits this.

I want to put on the record the total commitment of farmers to animal welfare. Animal welfare is central to the ethos and the profession of farming, and I am amazed that there are always people in this House who would like to convey an alternative impression.</p>
<p class="contents">Animal transport is central to Ireland's agricultural economy. We export 90% of our entire production, be it processed or live. Much of the discussion in committee centred around transport of mature animals for slaughter on mainland Europe. In the case of Ireland, we export young animals for finishing; so live transport is essential and central to the agricultural economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The retention of staging posts is important and the question of density also has an impact on the economics of transport. The provision of staging posts, therefore, is a central requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, decisions must be made on scientific findings and I draw the attention of the House to the findings of the recent report prepared by Dr Bernadette Earley, which presented a very coherent, balanced and objective view of live animal transport to the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This should stop. The Commission has come up with a plan that definitely improves the transport of animals, and, in its opinion, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism has imposed strict conditions with regard to the way in which this is done by road. Animals’ welfare should be improved, control should be stepped up and enforceable, and the personnel should be better trained. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has tabled an opinion to the same effect, but unfortunately, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has not adopted all recommendations.</p>
<p class="contents">Do not get me wrong; Mr Maat's report is sound and considerably improves the Commission's plan. For this, the rapporteur deserves all credit, but a number of important issues remain outstanding, and I should like to ask you to put this situation right. Transport should be of a high quality, so that the welfare of the animals is optimal and stress during transport is minimal. I think we are accommodating these requirements with this report, but the driving times should also be restricted. There is no reasonable explanation for the fact that transport of slaughter animals is being restricted, while that of animals destined for fattening is not. We must apply one rule for all and restrict transport in both categories.</p>
<p class="contents">The hauling of animals should stop. We in this House said this years ago and underlined this once again by a large majority in a written declaration in 2003. We now have the opportunity to translate our requirements into legislation. Let us seize this opportunity with both hands.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore ask you to support the amendments in which driving times are restricted, the beginning and end of journeys are defined effectively, the presence of a veterinarian is made obligatory and animals in lorries are given sufficient space. These are Amendments Nos 121, 122, 123 and 124. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not a proposal for the welfare of animals – the welfare of which I support entirely. How can we try to justify this being applied to animals for slaughter and not to all other animals? Transport and welfare affects all animals, not just those intended for slaughter, or is this perhaps a commercial measure, a commercial restriction? What do we want? For the peripheral countries to be left out of the market? What is the technical and scientific basis for laying down this differentiation in European legislation? Why are we justifying four hours, eight hours, nine hours? Why increase spaces? In order to increase costs? Whom does this benefit? The animals are seriously harmed, because of the risk of the friction, rubbing, injuries and fights which may arise. What is the justification? This is demonstrated by scientific and technical studies carried out at European level by the association of transporters.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I want to go into loading and unloading operations, temperature, etc. This is not justified either, which is what the report attempts to do in technical terms. We call for support for the amendments we have presented so that specific treatment is given to peripheral areas – Sweden, Finland, Portugal, Italy, Spain, etc. – so that we are not left out of the market. With proposals of four hours, in my region I cannot even get from one part to another, let alone participate in other international markets, which is my right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are talking about transports of living creatures with which people work and in which they trade and which, in the end, are also eaten. Everyone who is not a vegetarian must acknowledge that. The question is: how do we treat those animals? The question is also: why do animals have to be transported so far? Is it necessary for animals to be transported across half of Europe to be slaughtered? No, it is not. That is why this report clearly calls for slaughter animals to be slaughtered within a 500 km radius. I believe we must insist on their being able to be slaughtered within that radius. It must be no excuse to say there are not enough slaughterhouses; we must ensure that there are. That will stimulate the region’s economy and be of particular help to the animals. That is one of the most important points and also one of the trickiest: how far should animals be transported? Animals for fattening are counted as animals for slaughter, but I believe we should nevertheless make a distinction here. Animals for fattening should not be lumped together with slaughter animals, but they should be taken to a farm within the same short distance.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point that seems to have been overlooked is that controls are carried out. There is a directive; there used to be one. If anything went wrong, it was because the system was not working. It was the failure to implement the directive properly in the Member States and the inefficient control system that caused and still causes animals to suffer. I believe that needs to be said. The best rules and the best directive are useless if there are no controls and they are not enforced. In the end, that is the decisive factor and that is what will benefit the animals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This topic has been the subject of debate for a long time: sometimes heated, sometimes misrepresented, sometimes taken in the wrong way. I believe we need this, but it has to be realistic and it has to be workable. If it is not, then it will not work. Nine hours is about right. I do not think it makes much difference if we made it eight or ten hours, but we have to decide something. I think nine hours is right, but if it is not right, then we will revisit this at some stage in the future. But let us start somewhere!</p>
<p class="contents">There is a difference between animals that are going for slaughter and animals that are continuing their journey, and there is a difference between cattle, sheep and pigs. Cattle travel long distances to go to agricultural shows, but these animals are well cared for by their owners. The problems start when the animal leaves the farm, goes to a haulier and moves onward.</p>
<p class="contents">I know there are lots of differences between Member States and indeed between regions and I understand the concerns in remote areas, but we must address that. It has to be left to some extent to individual countries and indeed regions as to how they work their way through this. Animals should not be transported for long periods where at all possible, and the standards and the quality of lorries must be monitored very closely, especially the ventilation.</p>
<p class="contents">Animals should always be slaughtered close to the place where they were reared. We should export on the hook and not the hoof. That is the reality of this. We should be limiting export on the hoof. I know there is a difference, but animals must be respected and they must be protected.</p>

Evidence of this is that it was initially proposed that animals should be unloaded to rest in open spaces and subsequently it has been demonstrated that that is also prejudicial to their health and contributes to the spread of diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">These are reprehensible aspects indicating the lack of maturity of a document which is being presented for other reasons. And what do I believe are the main reasons for this document? Firstly, there is no scientific certainty and, therefore, there is no willingness to wait for it. That is why we have introduced an amendment which states that we must continue to carry out acute-phase protein research, which defines the stress suffered by animals. There is no knowledge of many of the aspects indicated and therefore certain measures, for example, such as excessive separation of animals, is going to harm them, or in other words, things are going to be worse than before.</p>
<p class="contents">The second hidden intention in this document is clearly to create a glass barrier, a new border for the countries of the East. In other words, on the one hand we integrate them and, on the other, we create a glass barrier, an invisible one, that is, a new form of customs, which will prevent them from crossing from one end of Europe to the other. This concept is furthermore entirely in opposition to the general policies we are implementing on other points.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, the intention is to dress everybody in the same suit: all animals in the same suit, like Chairman Mao’s suit. We have therefore also tabled an amendment calling for the exclusion of certain animals, such as, for example, those for repopulation, wild animals, circus animals, because there is no doubt that a measure for animals for slaughter cannot be applied to all the others. This is an impoverishment, a shackling, and goes against the ideas of sustainability, which are to adapt to reality and make things viable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in fashion, as the Commission just acknowledged in its intervention, but they are not based on any proven scientific basis.</p>
<p class="contents">The possible effects on the economy of regions and even whole countries could be very serious. The current legislation is more than sufficient to safeguard the welfare of animals during transport. The problem is not the existence of gaps in the legislation, which already covers all the requirements necessary to ensure comfort, but rather compliance with that legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The new rules should be directed towards improving controls in order to ensure respect for the legislation, rather than taking advantage of a debate such as this one on the welfare of cattle in order to introduce stringent restrictions on the free movement of goods, particularly restrictions which will not have the same effect in all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments presented by certain Members of this House clearly represent a step backwards in the achievements made in the creation of the single market and could lead to the isolation of many regions, especially the European Union's peripheral and outermost regions.</p>
<p class="contents">A restriction of the duration of journeys, without having made a prior in-depth impact study, is a measure which I would describe as clumsy and disproportionate, particularly if we bear in mind the harm that will be caused.</p>
<p class="contents">I would finally like to draw attention to another element of this debate whose effects could be entirely contrary to those pursued: the reduction of maximum densities, which are already laid down in the legislation. This measure promotes aggressive behaviour amongst animals, as well as injuries due to the greater mobility of the cattle within the compartments of lorries.</p>
<p class="contents">We should consider very carefully our decisions on all the points of the legislation which are equally incongruous, and thereby prevent our work from simply causing greater burdens for the sector and isolating economic sectors of entire regions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is our job once again to attempt a real balancing act in reconciling as far as possible two opposing demands: the demand to limit the effects of transport, by those who mainly see an environmental cost in this and are therefore primarily concerned with the animals’ health, and the demand to take financial costs into account as well, by those who want to keep transport costs down, but without ever neglecting the physical wellbeing of the livestock being transported.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the matter deserves our full attention, but in these difficult judgments it is a relief to note the great advances made by technology, which today provides hauliers – that hard-working, industrious group – with increasingly comfortable vehicles, fitted with fans, mangers and drinking systems with water for rehydration. With these new devices, more comfortable and especially longer journeys may be possible, although there must still be rest periods, which should in turn be increased to up to two hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is a debate on the problem of unloading and reloading the animals, an operation which does not always achieve its intended aim, which is to help the animals rest. Farmers and hauliers, and also environmentalists, tend to think that this type of operation, especially for small animals – I am thinking of calves – may cause even greater stress than remaining on board, especially on those vehicles that I have mentioned, with air-conditioning, water for rehydration and a ready supply of feed.</p>
<p class="contents">This too is a proposal that should not be ignored, so as not to make the wrong decision or repeat problems that have already been debated. One would, of course, have to be inside the head or the mind of a calf to be sure of reaching the right decision, but unfortunately a calf does not think and, most of all, it does not vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The vote has been brought forward to today, but Members have not been made aware of it. I think it is a little undemocratic that it is not possible to hold single separate votes or to ask for roll-call votes. The public will be very surprised and will say yet again how undemocratic this European Union is.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank Mrs Schierhuber. She has made a clear distinction between humans and animals and I, too, would like to reject the disgusting comparison with the Holocaust.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say something to Mr Adam. It is not correct to say that anyone who eats meat is a torturer of animals. You see, in Austria we have a national dish, <span class="italic">Wiener</span> <span class="italic">Schnitzel</span>, and if you come to Austria I can tell you precisely where the meat for it comes from, from the forest area of Lower Austria or from Styria. In most cases, that is only two or three hours away. In Austria, animals are allowed to be transported only for six hours. It is not necessary to torture animals if you want to eat them later. That is a change of thinking, and thinking is of course painful.</p>
<p class="contents">You see, Christian Democrats naturally have a perhaps rather different relationship with animals. For me, animals are God’s creatures and capable of suffering. I do not know whether you have saints, Mr Adam. My favourite saint is Francis of Assisi, and he did not only love people, he loved animals as well.</p>

Certainly we have had a very wide expression of views and opinions from one side and the other on the issue, and I hope and expect that the Council can draw some guidance from what has been said.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to express the Commission’s opinion in relation to the main points of concern. On travelling times, the European Parliament wants to introduce a fixed and final time limit of nine hours for slaughter animals, while allowing the others to travel with fewer restrictions. As I said at the outset, we cannot adopt measures which would effectively ban a trade, particularly in circumstances where there is insufficient scientific information to support such a move.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to limit the transport of animals for slaughter, the European Parliament advocates the use of mobile slaughterhouses. At present there is not enough expertise or practical experience to support this solution and the animal welfare advantages have not been clearly demonstrated.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the scope of the regulation, the European Parliament suggests a derogation for journeys of less than 100 km, as well as for certain categories of animals such as animals transported for sporting events and shows. The Commission could support retaining the current derogation for journeys of less than 50 km, but there is no reason to exclude from the scope of the regulation other animals that are at risk of suffering poor standards of welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission supports the proposal to open up the possibility for Member States to adopt stricter national rules, provided that they are compatible with the general rules of the Treaty. I am pleased that this would effectively maintain the UK’s restriction on the export of horses destined for human consumption. I have consistently said that I would look at this matter with a view to supporting a legally sustainable text.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the authorisation of transporters and the pre-approval of vehicles, the European Parliament proposes having a single system for short and long journeys. One of the major objectives of the proposal is to focus checks on long journeys – these are the most critical for the welfare of animals. I believe that by removing the distinction between long and short journeys, the efforts of inspection and the administrative burdens would be diluted and animals transported over long journeys would not benefit from a higher degree of attention from the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament suggests introducing the use of a satellite navigation system. This idea is most innovative and the Commission fully supports it in principle. I should add that the Commission proposal already includes a requirement to check the vehicles’ tachographs as a new enforcement tool.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards sanctions, a number of amendments have been proposed. Most of the suggestions are already covered by the Commission proposal through a stricter system of authorisation for transporters. A number of other amendments on sanctions need to be examined with regard to their compatibility with the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament and I trust that this will be included in the verbatim report of proceedings for this part-session<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
