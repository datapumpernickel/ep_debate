<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cercas (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the main aim of my report is to examine two articles of Council Directive 93/104/EC on certain aspects of the organisation of working time.</p>
<p class="contents">This important directive was approved ten years ago in order to regulate certain factors which are essential to the health and safety of salaried workers, such as daily rest periods and holidays. The directive also indicates the maximum weekly working time of 48 hours, although it allows it to be calculated as an average over a reference period of four months.</p>
<p class="contents">The approval of this important directive – which is one of the most important in Community social legislation – was not a straightforward process. The resistance of the United Kingdom was only overcome by the Court of Justice and, for ten years, we had to have two temporary exceptions with regard to the reference period for calculation of the 48 weekly hours, and with regard to the application of the 48 hours weekly working time in those countries that want to implement this exception if the workers wish, provided that this wish is expressed freely and reliably: this is what is known as individual opting-out.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Council should have re-examined these temporary exceptions before 26 November last year. Regrettably, however, the Commission did not communicate its analyses or proposals by that date. Up until 30 December 2003 it did not present us with any Communication nor open up a consultation period, and furthermore its text lacks specific proposals on the trickiest issues. What the Commission has done – and we should thank it – has been to commission a study by the University of Cambridge – carried out by Barnard, Deakin and Hobbs – on the way opting-out has been used in the country which approved it, in other words, the United Kingdom. This report provides us with in-depth knowledge of the negative consequences of its widespread use and abuse in a labour market in which it has been applied in a generalised manner.</p>
<p class="contents">My report refers exclusively to the re-examination of these two exceptions in order to respond not with waffle, but with clarity, to the question the Directive obliges us to ask: 10 years after its adoption, does it make sense to maintain the extension of the reference periods? Does it make sense to maintain the principle that it is possible not to apply the maximum 48 hours by means of individual opting out? I say in my report that both questions must be answered in light of the principles which governed the adoption of the Directive: the health and safety of workers. These must be accompanied by a third: flexibility, as indicated by the Commission in its communication. We must ensure that the professional and family lives of Europeans are reconciled.</p>
<p class="contents">My proposals are also clear. According to our objective information, there is no reason to abrogate the extension of the reference periods which have proven to be useful and have not, at least for the moment, had serious consequences for the health and safety of workers, but on the other hand, there is overwhelming evidence that opting-out seriously jeopardises minimum health and safety rights, and seriously jeopardises the reconciliation of family and professional life.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate and the vote within the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs have been very tough. I hope that tomorrow we can continue working and bringing positions closer together. I personally have maintained an open attitude to the element of flexibility, also with regard to the problem of the duty hours of doctors which has been introduced into this debate. I have been flexible, just as the Directive is flexible. Now, I have always stated, and I will do so until the end, that individual opting-out sets extremely dangerous precedents: minimum rights, Mr President, are inalienable.</p>
<p class="contents">If today workers are being obliged or allowed to surrender basic rights, such as maximum hours, tomorrow, on the basis of the same argument, they could be allowed to surrender other essential elements of their health and safety, to work in environments in which they suffer noise, dust, the removal of protective barriers at work sites, to surrender maternity rights and many other things. And all in the name of individual freedom, which disappears when it is applied. It is a horrendous precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end, Mr President, by saying that our Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 137 of the Treaty oblige us to resist the wishes of those who do not want European rules. Opting-out is not a flexible rule: it is the absence of rules. By allowing basic minimum rights legislation not to be applied to someone, we would be advocating the absence of rules. I hope that all Members of this House will give this full consideration. We cannot offer victory to people who do not want the social Europe to be built, to those allergic to minimum rules, which workers on our continent have enjoyed for more than a century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we have heard, the main objective of this directive, which is also both its political framework and its legal basis, is to protect workers from the harmful effects on their health and safety from working excessively long hours, inadequate rest or irregular working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is in fact a framework of minimum health and safety requirements as regards daily and weekly rest, the maximum working week, annual paid leave and the length of night shifts. Of course, we must not overlook the fact that, although the legal framework is the health and safety of workers, it also relates directly to the productivity of enterprises. Enterprises which have workers without these minimum acceptable limits clearly cannot achieve the required productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, as required due to the expiry of the ten-year period from publication of the directive, presented its report on 30 December and announced the revision of the working time directive. The Commission, taking account of the manner in which this directive was implemented in the 15 Member States, is obliged to evaluate two provisions in this directive. First, the derogations regarding reference periods and how the maximum working week is calculated. Mr Cercas questioned if we need to debate this matter, which has not created any particular problems. However, we have numerous branches which have problems and which would be interested in a different reference period and this has translated into proposals and discussions by both employers and employees. Secondly, the possibility of individual exceptions from the maximum working time, the famous 'opting out'.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, these two issues cannot be addressed without taking account of recent developments in the case law of the European Court of Justice, which qualifies the time which a doctor is at home on call as working time, insofar as he is called to the health centre during the period he is at home. Consequently, the Commission communication expressly concerns itself with the results of these judicial cases. We cannot look at the two provisions which need to be revised without taking account of the ruling of the courts. This is an extremely complicated issue which, as you too emphasise in your report, requires detailed evaluation of any repercussions of this change of legislation. That is why the Commission has started a broad consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we are asking for the opinion of the social partners within a special framework of procedures, as laid down in the Treaty, and we are already in the first stage of consultations in accordance with Article 138 of the Treaty. I must stress here that, according to the Treaty, the role of the social partners is very different, it is independent, and the framework within which the Commission is starting the debate cannot but be broad and the first approach cannot result in directions set by the Commission, because the social partners themselves must consult in the first and second stages, so that we have their positions. That is why I would say, as you will have observed, that this first communication has a fairly general framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, there are various points on which I think we are fairly clear and which I support.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that we cannot but have a careful analysis and evaluation of the repercussions and consequences of any change, first, on workers, because on questions of health and safety there can be no compromises, and secondly, on the functioning of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to address the matter in all its aspects. It is, as we said, a fundamental directive for labour law and we must categorically avoid any exclusively sectoral approach. Of course, this does not mean that we must not take account of various important problems, such as in the field of health which, following the rulings by the Court, could be extended to other branches with similar problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point is the correlation between working time and equal opportunities. This is an innate link which exists in the directive which, essentially, helps encourage the Member States to take measures which improve compatibility between working and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth point concerns 'opting out'. There are various types of approach. I would say there are two extremes, the first being that we have no facility to opt out of the maximum working time, in other words we completely abolish 'opting out', and the second being that we generalise 'opting out'. This generalisation would, essentially, leave employers and employees the facility to decide on working times and the entire employment framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Both extreme views create significant problems: the first takes no account of the special characteristics of branches, of a large number of branches and, more importantly, of the special characteristics which might arise from rulings such as that by the Court, with very serious consequences in the specific case of health systems. If there are also rulings of this type in other branches in the future, then other branches will have similar problems. The second extreme position, which concerns overall acceptance of 'opting out' as a way of operating the job market, essentially abolishes all the fundamental frameworks of the European Union based on workers' rights which essentially take account of health and safety and which link productivity with the worker as a person.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say from the outset that I am opposed to both these extreme approaches. Of course, we must accept that the institutional framework which the directive in question had for 'opting out' allowed for it to be abused. That is also why there are countries in which we have systematic abuse of 'opting out' in all branches, in all categories of enterprise, with very serious problems for the workers.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we should see and resolve these basic outstanding issues, taking account, on the one hand, of the need to use 'opting out' and, on the other hand, of the existence of new criteria and binding positions on the Member States, so that there is control of their use and not their abuse.</p>
<p class="contents">Because this directive is clearly of very great importance and affects the job market and the economy and has a direct impact on the lives of millions of workers in Europe and, at the same time, on enterprises and the economy of Europe, we need real, substantial consultation with all the agencies involved and, of course, as we said, with the social partners.</p>
<p class="contents">Our objective is for this procedure to bring us to a better legislative framework which takes account of the real impact on the job market and best serves the basic objective of the directive, which is to protect the health and safety of workers. I think that Parliament has the first word in this consultation process.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report is extremely topical and material. I would like to assure you that it is the basis for preparations and, of course, is only the Commission's first debate and approach with Parliament. Over all the coming months we shall have the opportunity for constant debate and exchanges of opinion, so that we take account of your particular positions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I mean no disrespect to the rapporteur, and I hope he will forgive me for saying that I cannot make the same comments about his own report. As he knows, together with the ELDR Group, we nearly managed to defeat it in committee, but virtually none of our amendments were accepted. Yet they so nearly won through and, had we succeeded, we would not have had to trouble the House on this occasion. Needless to say, we are retabling those amendments and we hope that the full House will do justice to them in the vote on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="contents">The sad thing about the report was that essentially it stated in black and white that there should be no opt-out at all under any circumstances and that the UK should be taken to court for alleged abuses, as if to say: my mind is made up, do not confuse me with the facts.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to share some facts with the House this evening. Opting out from the working time directive is voluntary: nobody can legally be forced to sign an opt-out and it is important to give people the flexibility to work longer hours and earn the overtime if they wish. Research in the UK has indicated that 2.5 million people work longer than the maximum hours stated in the directive, but two thirds of them get paid for the extra hours so would lose out if the opt-out were removed. It is true that some workers would like to work fewer hours, but not if the cut in hours means a drop in pay. More than seven out of ten of those working longer hours said they would not want fewer hours if it meant less pay. There is<span class="italic"> no evidence</span> that health and safety have been compromised in any of these circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now just like to talk briefly about the report by Barnard, Deakin and Hobbs, which the rapporteur referred to. He stated that, according to its conclusions, there have been abuses on a massive scale. I have to say that the conclusions say nothing of the kind. It was interesting that, when the Commission report itself came out, there was an article in the <span class="italic">Financial Times</span> on Tuesday, 6 January, co-authored by Catherine Barnard and Simon Deakin, professing surprise at the way their report had been misinterpreted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to quote three short paragraphs. 'It is true that we did uncover evidence of some abuses of the opt-out system. Sometimes, the opt-out was presented as a standard contract term to new staff, which they would have to take positive steps to avoid. But this was unusual. What was striking was that, for every employee who felt under pressure to opt out, we found others who wanted the right to choose what hours they worked and what salary, status and job satisfaction they gained as a result (...). We quickly discovered a gap between the rhetoric around reducing working hours and the reality of working life for many people. In one example given to us, workers in the tobacco industry could lose hundreds of pounds a week in overtime pay if they were limited to working 48 hours.'</p>
<p class="contents">They state in the final paragraph that 'a complete ban on long hours would be unfeasible in many companies and industries or would be simply disregarded.'</p>
<p class="contents">Those are the facts, not as presented by the rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore the conclusion has to be that the opt-out must stay and abuses, if any, must go. I would hope that Members on all sides of the House could support that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would just mention the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments. They are the important issues we should be addressing and our amendments try to focus on those issues, because we have to try to resolve the very clear problems that the Court of Justice has raised.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I know that on the record in September UK Labour MEPs said that they voted unanimously against retaining the opt-out, but it is never too late to repent. I still cherish the hope that on Wednesday they will vote with us in the interests both of employment and employees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work on the organisation of working time. As the Commissioner said, this is an issue which touches every worker and family within the European Union. However, although I clearly understand that individual Commissioners do not always get what they want when they want it, I am very disappointed with the way the issue of working time has been handled by the Commission as a whole. It had ten years to prepare and produce proposals on the operation of derogations on the opt-out and annualisation; the review and communication were clearly required by November 2003 and yet, incredibly, the Commission still managed to miss the deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">When the communication came, it was, quite frankly, hardly worth the paper it was printed on. It is a weak document and gives no clear signal on the best direction for action. It should not, in my opinion, be allowed to stand as a proper instrument for the opening of the first phase of consultation between the social partners under the procedure included in Article 138. I hope the social partners will make that clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, by the time the Commission got around to producing the communication, it was being bombarded with notifications from Member States that they would begin to use the opt-out in their health-care sectors in response to the SIMAP and Jaeger rulings. No doubt some Member States were being opportunistic in this respect, but the Commission had had three years to react to SIMAP; its inaction could therefore lead to the neutering of a central piece of EU health and safety law. In our view, a blanket spread in the use of the opt-out is not the answer to SIMAP and Jaeger. We want speedy and specific action from the Commission in response to those judgments and then time to sensibly revise other provisions in the original directive.</p>
<p class="contents">As to how we solve those difficulties, we could look to social partner agreements or re-rostering arrangements that have been put in place in certain parts of the EU to deal with the implications of those cases. Or we could look at the type of definition we adopted to cover the case of relief drivers and overnight ferry tripsin dealing with working time for drivers. As well as working time and rest time the notion of periods of availability was included there.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, people like Mr Bushill-Matthews are constantly telling me that the opt-out is essential to give companies the flexibility they need to operate. It is strange then, in my view, that until recently only one Member State used this opt-out: the others were managing just fine and would still be managing in their health-care sectors if not for the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments. The truth is that the directive is flexible. More relaxed arrangements apply to a whole range of occupations and activities and the reference periods are generous. I for one would also be quite happy to look at whether annualisation of working time could be made a more realistic option in all Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the Socialist Group takes the view that an opt-out from a health and safety directive is a dangerous nonsense. The possibility was created for purely political reasons ten years ago and it was a bad idea from the start. A general opt-out is bad for the welfare of workers, bad for a proper work-life balance, damaging to efforts to encourage women to return to the labour market and, as the statistics show, not at all helpful in the drive to boost productivity. It is not the direction a Union committed to transforming itself into the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world should even think of taking.</p>
<p class="contents">So I, for one, will not repent and I will certainly not join Mr Bushill-Matthews on Wednesday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would have been useful, however, to have brought it forward before Mr Cercas drew up the report, but I am very pleased that we were able to table oral amendments. Nevertheless this is not the ideal way of working and I would like to register that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled a number of amendments, a lot of them with the PPE-DE Group, and some of my own. The main point – and I am very pleased the Commissioner touched on this – is that the individual opt-out should be kept, but that it should be truly voluntary and measures should be taken to tackle any abuse. But as Mr Bushill-Matthews said, that abuse is not as widespread in the UK as the rapporteur leads us to believe. Indeed, as Mr Bushill-Matthews and the rapporteur have repeatedly said, the authors of the research – Barnard, Deakin and Hobbs – stated that the abuse was widespread. Those people have distanced themselves from what you have written in your report and indeed would distance themselves from your statement today.</p>
<p class="contents">To answer Mr Hughes' point, one of the reasons for maintaining the opt-out is that in the UK we do not have collective agreements. That is one of the main reasons we use the opt-out. Other Member States use derogations because they have collective agreements. Decisions can be made between both sides of industry: trade unions and employers will get together and decide what they want to do on the Working Time Directive. But because we do not have that – at least not to any great extent – we need the flexibility for our businesses to be able to cope.</p>
<p class="contents">Wages are not a competence of the EU, nor should they be. We should not be discussing pay. But workers in the UK are on low wages, even though we have a national minimum wage. They quite often add to their take-home pay by doing overtime. If we get rid of the opt-out, there will be many cases of workers not being able to do overtime and therefore not getting a reasonable pay level. We are not the only country that uses it either: Germany, France, the Netherlands, Spain and Luxembourg are all either using it or going to use it in the health or catering industries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the length of reference period. Tourism and agriculture have a particular problem because of different working patterns and because of the times of year that they work. The Commission must also look at the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments. It is very important that we do that on health and come forward with proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope enough MEPs will join us tomorrow when we vote, in particular those Labour MEPs who voted against us in committee and against the UK Labour Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The truth of the matter is that various Member States have used and abused these derogations and have not complied with the provisions therein, especially the upper limit of working time in sectors such as health, and the hotel and catering industries. Once again, now that the seven-year deadline has elapsed, the Commission has regrettably given no clear signal as to how the problems that have come to light are to be solved.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence my endorsement of most of the proposals contained in the Cercas report, in particular the provision of an amended directive resolving existing problems and ensuring a higher level of health and safety protection for workers. I also welcome the comparison study on the repercussions of long working hours on the family and on health, and the effect on both sexes. A further welcome proposal is the provision of protection for freelance workers and others whose safety is endangered by workers exhausted from working such long hours.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Justice has ruled in a number of cases, and has included time spent on call as working time, thereby confirming the fundamental principle that time not entirely available to workers due to work commitments must be regarded as working time. I congratulate Mr Cercas on the work he has carried out and, as he states in his report, derogations in the form of individual opt-out clauses must be scrapped and we must work towards reducing the pressures and eliminating the abuses that undermine family life.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left, has tabled proposals that would enable us to extend these rights a little further. We have called for a revision of the directive, initially reducing the maximum working week from 48 to 42 hours; and for a gradual reduction in the working week to 36 hours, over the course of the next seven years. We hope that this would lead to further reductions in working time and a redistribution of work in the Member States, which are effective ways of reconciling family and professional life, of promoting equal rights for women and of combating unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I deplore the fact that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats persists in disparaging the report approved by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which only serves to show that they are perfectly happy to perpetuate an unacceptable state of affairs that undermines effective health and safety protection of workers. You can therefore be sure that we shall be voting against these proposals, as we did in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is something with which we are not wholly unfamiliar and to which I shall return shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to start by thanking our rapporteur for having drafted an outstanding report. Everyone knows how narrow the vote was in our committee, and that it could have had a different result, so the Commission is aware of the differing views that exist in this House. We, though, have to look at each of them very carefully. This own-initiative report was nevertheless a necessary one. We actually wanted to talk about amendments to the directive, of which, as I see it, there is without a doubt a great need. I shall also be putting forward arguments as to why this is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">To be sure, the Commission has taken its time, and this is where I endorse Mr Hughes’ comments on the communication with which we have been presented. The material available to us and the study as published are enlightening, but they are not normative. Those who have dealt with this for some time actually knew what this was about. Yet again, as I see it, the actual blame for this rests with the Member States rather than with the Commission. A number of Member States are engaging in delaying tactics to gain the temporary support of the others in a while, such as the accession countries, which also may well be advocates of weakening necessary regulation. There are, of course also, and not least the employers, and, above all, there is all the heavy lobbying that is going on at the moment. As recently as last Thursday lunchtime, I was phoned up by the British social security minister, who asked me what I, for God’s sake, thought I was doing by signing up to a few pertinent amendments. I really do think that is going a bit far. I am pleased that he wanted to approach me, but I am doing no deals by the by, especially as that would mean bypassing the problems that exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the general individual opt-out. The question we have to ask ourselves is whether we want, at European level, social minimum rules, especially on highly topical matters where even the ILO – in 1919, I think – said that 48 hours is enough? Do we want a minimum regime? Do we want these rules to be a means of protecting safety and health, or do we want to move towards a situation that is slowly starting to take shape and which I would describe as social policy competition among Member States? That, at the moment, is what this is all about.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you one example. At the moment – and the Dutch Council of Ministers is also represented here – discussions are going on in the Netherlands about adjusting Dutch legislation on working hours along the lines of the European minimum regime. That is to say, in the Netherlands too, it is proposed that the 60 hours should no longer be a matter for consultation, but should be a norm. That is certainly going a long way. I know that this debate is going on in other countries as well, and I do not think that we can leave it to the social partners. On this issue, their advice may be sought, but such advice must not be determinative in the way that several amendments on this point propose.</p>
<p class="contents">I will deal very briefly with workers on call, a problem that we should try to resolve. Although I am happy with the Commission’s proposals, there is a great deal left to be done; not only as regards doctors, but also as regards firefighters – and I could say the same of a number of other services. This is an issue that is generating a lot of heat in certain Member States. As far as I am concerned, we have to be prompt and unambiguous in our dealings with each of them. I urge the Irish and the Dutch to give their full attention to this thorny problem, which, within the life of this Parliament, we will probably no longer be dealing with in the form of an amended directive.</p>

<p class="contents">The legislation was ill-conceived and did not take into consideration the difficulties experienced by small businessmen and by many professions. It is essential that the opt-out be retained, in particular for certain occupations. In the United Kingdom, the National Health Service could not run without the willingness of dedicated doctors and nursing staff to work long hours. In this regard it is imperative to remove the farcical rule that says that a doctor is working when he is asleep in bed purely because, technically, he is on call – but then, common sense is not a capability that this Parliament often utilises.</p>
<p class="contents">The current opt-out is open to all Member States. The fact that France, Germany and the Netherlands are now following the UK's example in deploying it in relation to the medical professions serves to demonstrate that the line the UK has always taken is the practical one.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement around the corner, some consideration must be given as to how this directive will affect the newcomers' individual labour markets. In my own experience when visiting Malta last year, the leading topic for all political parties was the Working Time Directive. The majority of people in Malta work in excess of 48 hours per week and need to do so for their own benefit and for the island's economy.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States need the flexibility to organise their own working time. The EU should recognise this and return this responsibility to national governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, it is very irritating that this House is virtually turning into a sort of House of Commons, in that we are now giving our attention solely to problems that are in fact not even specific to the UK, but are specifically English. That, of course, becomes very tiresome, especially for those participants in the debate who do not originate from that country. There is also the second problematic aspect, namely the legal cases referred to earlier: the Jaeger case and others. This is where I really do think that the Commission has not shown sufficient leadership. It ought to have been apparent that the combination of the interpretation of these legal acts and the existence of the opt-out would create difficulties and to the objectives of the directive being undermined. It waited a long time and gave what were in fact wholly inadequate answers as to what the solution might be. Not to mention such other things as, for example, the people who then think they too can use this for their own purposes by, contrary to what the directive intended, creating more difficulties. That can happen at any time and it is at that point that the whole thing starts to unravel.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where I differ from many others in my belief that we have to be quick. The fact is that we have to give priority to dealing with the points that are relevant to hospitals, the fire service and a few more of the sort of things that are relevant not only to the United Kingdom; then we will be able to talk about the opt-out. That is, at the moment, still inadequately expressed in our report and it is certainly inadequately expressed in what the Commission is saying. It is still doing no more than creating options, which seems to indicate that we have a very long process ahead of us, but, at the time, all the Member States resolved to avail themselves of the opt-out, so you never know what is going to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I myself think an opt-out is always a sign of failure, of your inability to completely sort matters out, which is also the underlying problem here. I still think that we have to be looking for alternatives to the opt-out, but you cannot say that you cannot get rid of it unless you offer alternatives. If you have no alternative, you cannot say that the opt-out is wrong. You have to say, ‘the opt-out is wrong, but here are the alternatives to it’. That is what we actually have to work towards with this report. We will certainly have to aspire to it in the course of further consultation. First, though, we have to close the loophole in the directive as quickly as possible, or in the place where at least the Member States think it is. Then we will, in any case, have all the Member States behind us – with the exception of the United Kingdom, but including, I am sure, the Member States in Eastern Europe. We can then take a look at the last part of the second opt-out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What we are talking about here is not rules on 35-hour or 38-hour weeks, but the option that exists in certain Member States of a week of 55 or more hours. I have to say that I regard this opting-out arrangement as absolutely absurd. Figures like that belong in the nineteenth century; I am convinced that the productivity of our businesses is not dependent on them and that they will not make us the most modern and the most efficient economic region in Europe. What matters most of all to businesses is the options available for machinery’s runtimes and operating times, rather than any unnecessary extension of working time. Businesses care about modern forms of labour organisation. In fact, Germany is a good example of how the social partners can be involved in the shared development of modern types of employment, organisation of work and working times.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add that it is this that has enabled us to lead the world in the export field.</p>
<p class="contents">Let it also be said that the figures, data and times currently under discussion do not seem to take account of the possibility of workers having such things as children and families. Who, after all, is capable of being away from home for 48, 55 or more hours in a week? I might remind you that the Working Times Directive was meant, as one of its objectives, to be an instrument for reconciling work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Pronk said something very good about the opt-out, namely that it has actually failed. Had it been a derogation with a limited lifespan, nothing could have been said against it. Now, though, in the meantime, there are several countries that want to adopt this British model, and it is unfortunate that these include Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, and most of the accession countries that will be joining us on 1 May.</p>
<p class="contents">I doubt that the Commissioner will often have come across so much public approval as there has been as a result of the rulings of the European Court of Justice in connection with hospital doctors. It is, for this reason, vital that we counteract every tendency to hand these things back to the national level. It is in this area that European social policy is under scrutiny, as are guaranteed European standards, for if we make it possible for these matters to be handed back to the national level, you can be sure that the same thing will happen in many other cases in the life of the next Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to nip that sort of thing in the bud, we want the precise legal framework, which you have promised us. We are happy to go along with that, but let there be no turning back! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Eight hours’ work, eight hours’ leisure time and eight hours’ sleep were what were then demanded. Gradually, that programme was implemented. It was important in many ways, because it meant that companies stopped competing on the basis of working time. They had to compete in other areas instead. It also meant that workers were protected and that society was given a fixed framework for work, schooling, leisure and other activities.</p>
<p class="contents">I am really shocked that the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, together with several other political groups, seem to want to break with this tradition and, instead, go back to the situation that existed a hundred years ago when a voluntary ethos prevailed in the labour market. I note that there is no talk of voluntary agreements between trade unions and employers’ organisations. Instead, the talk is of voluntary agreements between individual employees and individual employers. That is a retrograde step that is incomprehensible. I do not understand how people can argue in that way or put forward a proposal along those lines. It is deeply irresponsible and will lead to strife and conflict in the labour markets. In a labour market so exposed to competition, it will lead to a situation in which people are forced to take jobs on the conditions that apply. Call it voluntary or involuntary, but the fact is that, in a labour market exposed to competition, people may expect to have a pre-determined market value. They have to take what is on offer. So much for matters being voluntary.</p>
<p class="contents">As many have said, family life is also affected. Parents are forced to work hours that make it difficult to combine work and family life and take care of their children. I also want to add that all of us, as consumers, are affected. This has not been emphasised so much, but we are in danger, for example, of being injured when we are operated on by exhausted surgeons or of being run over when we encounter lorry drivers that are half asleep. We are all victims of stress and of pressure at work. It would be much better for all parties if we could agree to put an end to these opt-outs obtained by the United Kingdom at the time when the directive was adopted. In actual fact, they were contrary to the rule concerning competition under equal conditions. Now, employers in other countries are saying, ‘If the United Kingdom can have opt-outs, we too want opt-outs.’ This will lead to the exception becoming the rule. That is not something we can live with. We must therefore call a halt and instead go down the opposite route. We must remove the United Kingdom’s opt-out and find other ways of solving these flexibility problems, for we cannot cope successfully without labour legislation that is applicable across the board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For those who are interested, the details are on the website.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are honest we all know the problems that long hours of work bring for health and safety, productivity and social relationships, both for the individual and within the family. A number of Member States, for example, are very concerned about children being left without appropriate adult care at times while their parents and carers are at work. We know that the 'long hours' culture, for whatever reason, brings strain, stress and potential breakdown.</p>
<p class="contents">I find myself in the interesting position of agreeing with Mr Hughes this evening, and certainly with most of what Mr Pronk said, about the 'on call' issue being resolvable, between social partners, in various sectors and in other ways. The issue about who owns your time, who controls it, who says where you have to be at what point, is a key question when deciding whether or not you are actually at work.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the dedication of doctors, yes, there is enormous dedication there but I do not feel safe at the hands of a doctor who has been on call for 72 hours and is swaying with tiredness while he is trying to make a decision how to treat me. That is a personal experience.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that many people want to work longer hours because they really love their jobs – just as we all do. Good. But we also recognise that there is more to life than paid work. We are seeing again in certain countries a decline in voluntary work, for example, with all the repercussions that has for wider society.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also told that we need additional flexibility so that people can do overtime to earn a living wage. If this has to be done on a regular basis, I contend that there is a problem with the basic wage paid, rather than the right to continue compulsory overtime. We all know about the pressures exerted by teams to make sure you turn up for that overtime, whether you want to or not.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of this debate sounds to me at times rather like gender discrimination: people claim it does not exist because they have never experienced it. Part of this is the question whether or not people have a real choice, say in the UK with its opt-out, as to whether or not they work longer hours.</p>
<p class="contents">We know of the enormous pressure exerted on people by employers, by methods of working, by just-in-time production, by a whole set of things such as the macho work culture that says you are not dedicated to your job unless you are in at 8 a.m. in the morning and still there at 10 p.m. at night. I am sure that a number of the staff in this Parliament will recognise that feeling.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of flexibility is about who makes that decision. I would be happier with a lot of the UK's arguments if I felt there really was a concerted effort by the UK Government to apply the rules. But I do not see any evidence of this and it is not what I am hearing at meeting after meeting either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The purpose of the original directive was, out of health and safety considerations, to safeguard employees against unduly long working days by setting a maximum working time of 48 hours per week. The directive nonetheless makes it possible for the employee, by means of his signature, to permit this maximum of 48 hours per week to be worked only as an average over a whole year. Employers are accorded flexibility at the expense of employees’ welfare. This has, for example, led to millions of Britons increasing their working time to more than 48 hours per week since the directive was introduced. It is a sick way in which to organise labour market legislation. The directive supports the principle of individual agreements that is contrary to the collective agreement model that exists in Denmark. Among Danes, there is considerable backing for the national model in which, for example, working time and wage conditions are established through free negotiations between independent trade unions and employer associations. Employees use ballots to agree upon the conditions under which they wish to work.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on working time is an example of the EU’s needing to keep clear of labour market policy and leave this to the Member States. The proximity principle must be taken seriously. Unfortunately, we are now in a situation in which the EU has already legislated in this area. The report on revising the directive proposes closing those gaps in it that employers have misused to exploit the unfair individual agreements. In practice, employers have, upon employing people, in many cases put pressure on them to accept longer working hours. This individualisation is unacceptable as a basis for labour market agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, therefore, we are voting in favour of the rapporteur’s report and against the majority of the many amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is because the completion of the internal market must lead to an improvement in working conditions, because the Community will support and complement the Member States’ actions in the fields of health and safety protection of workers, as laid down in Article 137 of the EC Treaty, and because all workers have the right to a restriction of maximum working time, to daily and weekly periods of rest, and an annual period of paid holiday, as well as to work in conditions which respect their health, their safety and their dignity, as laid down in the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is very simple, therefore, on a theoretical level. The first aspect is the reference periods for the application of Article 6 (maximum weekly working time): four months, as laid down in Article 16 of the Directive, or, where appropriate, the possibility of extension in the cases laid down in Article 17: up to six and twelve months if implemented by means of collective agreements or agreements between social partners. The second aspect is the power not to apply Article 6 if the worker is in agreement, the system of opting-out, as has been said here already.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly, a consequence of extending the reference periods would be to increase the flexibility available to companies. The only limit would be the eleven hours of rest daily or the twenty-four hours of rest weekly, but the directive would be losing its purpose and only regulating the maximum four-monthly, six-monthly or annual working time, depending on the particular case.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to opting-out, the potential for abuse is obvious, particularly in a situation of legal equality but not economic equality between the protagonists in working life.</p>
<p class="contents">Directive 93/104/EC is intended to guarantee a higher level of health and safety protection for workers, as reiterated in Directive 2000/34/EC. We should therefore seek effective solutions to the cases and activities which require them, such as those involved in the judgments mentioned here, Simap or Jäger, but with objective criteria and conditions, to be used generally and in a non-abusive fashion; and under no circumstances turning the exception into the general rule.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that before the vote we should seek agreements which combine legal guarantees for workers with creating more flexibility, in the spirit of Directive 93/104/EC. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We clearly recognise the importance of this issue for our political group and for working people, particularly the issue of work/life balance and health and safety. That has been established and eloquently spoken about by a number of speakers. We do not want to see a long-hours culture; we want to see higher productivity. We want to see working people have the kind of work that allows them the leisure they deserve. We fully support the repeated statements by our government stating that the opt-out should not be abused and that the exercise of the opt-out must be truly voluntary to be legal under UK law.</p>
<p class="contents">We need clarification of the SIMAP and Jaeger judgments. As British Labour MEPs, we also believe that it is inappropriate for infringement proceedings to be taken against the UK Government. We have tabled Amendment 1, which deletes the recommendation that the UK Government should be subject to infringement proceedings.

They increase the level of exploitation of the working class and maximise the profits of big business.</p>
<p class="contents">According to these proposals, workers will be at the immediate disposal of employers whenever, when and for as long as the employer wants, without overtime pay, a fact which the European Court of Justice itself has condemned.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus they abolish basic rights of the workers, such as a set working day, eight hours or seven hours, five days a week. Collective working agreements are being cast aside and fixed term contracts are being extended. The right to insurance and normal leave is being violated, while greater flexibility in employment relations is being promoted.</p>
<p class="contents">Any positive arrangements are gainsaid by the planned derogations and the application of the 'opting-out' clause imposed by the United Kingdom and also used by other countries. In it, the workers are dragged under the pressure of securing a job. It is a form of modern paid slavery, which forces a large percentage of the workforce to work an average of between 48 and 70 hours a week, with deteriorating health and safety conditions and very serious repercussions on the mental and physical health of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the reduction in working time, the introduction of a genuine 35-hour week of seven set working hours a day, five days a week, an increase in wages and full insurance and employment rights which will apply universally to all workers and all enterprises. We are fighting together with the workers to overturn the current anti-labour framework and flexible forms of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is because we have waited for too long that we find ourselves in this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, President Prodi presented to us a document entitled ‘Delivering Lisbon’. We cannot deny that, to make Europe the most dynamic economic power in the world, we need to have policies that perform to help businesses adapt to new production conditions and to ever-increasing economic competition whilst taking into account the safety and health of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why, in order to adapt to the realities of the market, we need to evolve in a relatively flexible framework. Given this, organisation of working time is dependent on a number of factors and on the characteristics of the sector of activity concerned and of the profession in question. It is on that basis, for example, that we have already legislated for mobile workers in the transport sector, but we have recognised and accepted the concept of flexibility for people driving goods vehicles over 3.5 tonnes. We also have a certain number of problems as regards homeworkers and also those working in situations that involve caring for others, because private and professional life are often intermingled in this area. That is the first point.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that, in addition to these differences according to sectors, we must draw attention to the specific characteristics of national industrial relations systems. Some Member States call on collective or workforce agreements to establish the average working time, whilst others resort to individual derogations which make it possible for workers in, for example, supervisory positions, not to be subjected to restrictions in working time.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, of course, agree with the fact that the European Union is duty bound to lay down minimum conditions governing the organisation of working time in order to guarantee a high level of health and safety protection for workers. Should it not at the same time, though, give enterprises the option of reacting contrary to general practice when faced with different constraints? This is why it seems to me that the rapporteur’s opinion would have to be qualified by accepting, for example, as you initially proposed, Commissioner, the gradual abolition of the opt out, provided for in Article 18 of the Directive, in return for the introduction, in the future draft revision of the directive, of a derogation at Article 6 to allow periods of inactivity partially to be taken into account. This would probably be a transitional solution that would make it possible to have minimal social rules whilst, at the same time, taking into account the constraints of each sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Pressure is being exerted from two sides. This comes firstly in relation to the individual opt-out. Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Lynne are very enthusiastic about these individual opt-outs. I think, however, that we are obliged now to ask them why, if individual opt-outs are so fantastic, this provision should not be extended to apply to all legislation concerning health and safety in the workplace. Why stop here? Why not go further and include noise, asbestos and other areas if it is such a splendid principle?</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a prevailing misunderstanding that it is the individual opt-out that makes it possible to work long hours. I should like to invite both Mr Bushill-Matthews and Mrs Lynne to get out and about in Europe and visit a few workplaces and to come to Denmark where they will see that it is, in actual fact, possible to work very long hours in various industries in Denmark and, at the same time, to comply with the directive, for it is very flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor, at the same time, must we of course forget that we are concerned here with health and safety in the workplace. It is not just something that the Social Democrats have lighted upon in order to be officious and over-zealous or in order to limit individual flexibility. We also know that the statistics are clear in their implications. We know that there is a clear connection between long working hours and accidents at work. Moreover, it is generally known that the number of sick days is increasing and that long working hours do not in actual fact mean higher productivity.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can we ignore the fact that it is women who will be placed in a difficult position if we simply extend working time, the natural consequence being that a number of women will perhaps withdraw completely from the labour market. I am certain that the right-hand side of the Chamber too will appreciate that this would be very unfortunate for the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second pressure on the working time directive stems directly from the fact that the Commission has neglected to say what it intends to do as a consequence of the Jaeger and SIMAP Judgments. These rigid judgments have sent shock waves through the national and regional health authorities which simply cannot imagine how they are to make ends meet if on-call hours are to be fully charged for.</p>
<p class="contents">I would go so far as to say to the Commission that, if it does not do something soon and produce a proposal, it will itself contribute to the image of the EU as something removed from the real world and unable to come up with flexible solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">We badly need a revision of the directive that abolishes the individual opt-out but that constantly provides for flexibility where there is a need for this, for example in the health sector. I would also ask the right wing today to take note of the fact that no one is asking for a very rigid directive. We are all asking for flexibility, but we must not of course destroy the principles behind having legislation in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask for the revised directive also clearly to indicate that it can be implemented with the help of collective agreements. I say this not just to harp on about time-honoured Danish practices, but also because this method of implementation puts a stop to the individual ways of doing things and, at the same time, provides for a very high-level <span class="italic">de facto </span>implementation of the directive. That is why this is a sound way of proceeding, and that is why I should like to ask the Commission specifically to state in the directive that the directive can be implemented by means of collective agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It should not, however, have diverged either needlessly or too far from the objective pursued, that is to say the possible amendment of the directive in order to guarantee a better level of health and safety protection for workers.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities is, unfortunately, another typical example of that very process, since it made a brilliant job of missing the point of the report.</p>
<p class="contents">I had tabled a series of amendments aimed at removing from the text of this opinion the obvious falsehoods, according to which working hours are apparently being extended all over the place in the European Union and long working hours being imposed in our Member States, with negative effects on our health, well-being and appetite for life. The opinion then concludes by heaping criticism on the would-be culture of long working hours for high level professionals and others, managers in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">These generalisations and falsehoods do not serve our objective, designed to promote a better level of health and safety protection for workers. For some here, a massive reduction in working time is the universal remedy for all problems. That being said, I agree that the Lisbon Agenda, which sets the goal of a 60% employment rate for women by 2010, will not be respected without prior progress in reconciling professional life and family responsibilities. I also agree that couples need to be better at dividing domestic tasks and educational responsibilities and, on this subject, there should be a response on the part of men, because women are still forced to take on, to a disproportionate degree, the double burden of professional work, on the one hand, and of family responsibilities on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret that my attempts to qualify the statements of some Members and to re-establish the truth did not find favour with the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities and, above all, I regret that the rapporteur repeated certain falsehoods, in particular that which would have us believe that working hours continue to be extended in the European Union when, in the majority of Member States, the opposite is true.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has tabled a host of amendments designed to re-establish truth and reason on this sensitive issue and aimed, in particular, at those populists who would have our European citizens believe that they can always work a lot less to earn a lot more than their colleagues in other parts of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Sometimes when I listen to the speeches, I get the feeling that health and safety aspects as they relate to the private individual – which, strictly speaking, is what the legislation is really about – are not the main point. I am, to be honest, frightened when I hear the British representatives of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. They say that, in view of the fact that certain jobs have such low wages, we must allow employees to work longer hours so as to compensate for these low wages. What is this other than the model that exists in the United States where people sometimes need two or three jobs in order to be at all able to take care of their families? Is that what we agreed to in the Lisbon Process? Certainly, we must have competitiveness and growth, but we must also have challenging social objectives and the opportunity to combine family life and working life. These principles, about which we have expressed our opinions, are directly contrary to flexibility of that kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that the exception has become the rule in the United Kingdom. It is never the intention that an exception should become the rule, but it has become so in the UK. If the opt-out is extended, there is a danger of the Member States competing by means of longer working time in order to attract production. Is that the kind of Europe we want: one in which we compete in terms of social legislation? No, I do not want a Europe like that.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that we must have flexibility, just as Mrs Thorning-Schmidt said. I do not, however, see the individual opt-out as a possibility. Think how dependent the individual employees are on their companies when they are to agree upon wages and working time. The word ‘voluntary’ does not apply, no matter what people say. It is much better to involve the two sides of industry. There are differences between various industries and, sometimes, certain industries may require special arrangements in order to achieve flexibility and, at the same time, maintain the principles of health and safety. I therefore recommend collective agreements through which this flexibility can be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not in favour of renationalisation, because it would have the same effect. It would mean countries competing with each other by attracting capital available to them because of their not prioritising health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to use our European model to stimulate competitiveness but, at the same time, have challenging social objectives and the opportunity of combining working life and parenthood. Let us comply with this model, in which case we must remove the individual opt-out, at the same time as preserving flexibility and a high level of safety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
