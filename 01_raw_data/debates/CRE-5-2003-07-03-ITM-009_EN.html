The appropriate fines were imposed to the tune of nearly EUR 17 million.</p>
<p class="contents">We are talking about an agreement made in France between four federations of farmers and two federations of abattoirs at the end of 2001. The agreement consisted of a minimum price commitment and a suspension-restriction of imports from other Member States. Initially it took the form of a public written agreement and then, once the Commission had sent letters of warning, of a secret oral agreement. These agreements were made within the context of low prices in the beef market as a result of the crisis in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of data communicated by the Directorate-General for Agriculture, the Directorate-General for Competition opened up an investigation and sent demands for information in the middle of November 2001. On this basis, the Commission – and I would like to stress this – initially did no more than send letters of warning at the end of November 2001. All the parties to the agreement then assured the Commission, in writing, that they were putting an end to the illegal agreement. But the Commission found evidence that the parties were maintaining the agreement secretly. The unannounced inspections carried out in the middle of December 2001 confirmed the Commission’s suspicions. The parties were given the opportunity to present written and oral comments. The decision adopted on 2 April 2003 concludes, on the basis of a repeated ruling of the Court of Justice, that, firstly, there is a price agreement which violates the provisions of Article 81 of the Treaty and that, secondly, there is an agreement to suspend imports from other Member States, which also violates Community competition rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The documentation discovered by the Commission during the course of the investigation demonstrates that, furthermore, all the organisations in question knew that the agreement they were making was illegal and that they were liable for intervention by the competition authorities. The Commission imposed fines of EUR 12 million on the FNSA, the main French agricultural federation, and of up to EUR 480 000 on one of the federations of abattoirs.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to remind you that, in the event of very serious violations of competition rules, the Commission imposes fines of the basic sum for each participant, in principle, of a minimum of EUR 20 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The three main criticisms levelled at the Commission's decision are: firstly, that this is an attack on trade union freedoms; secondly, that the fine is excessive, given the context of crisis; and thirdly, the Commission's lack of action over the second mad cow disease crisis. I will try to respond to these three arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to trade union freedom, the Commission believes that the scope of the decision has been exaggerated. Trade union freedom is a fundamental freedom, recognised by everybody. The Commission reiterates this in its decision. But this freedom does not give the right to do absolutely anything: a trade union cannot legitimately make an agreement on prices and import restrictions violating the principles of the common market. The decision says no more than that.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the size of the fine, it must be borne in mind that it is set in accordance with the seriousness of the violation and with the aggravating circumstances. Well, in this case the violation was serious but so were the aggravating circumstances. In this respect, we should remember that the farmers obliged the abattoirs to sign the illegal agreement through acts of violence. We must also remember that the parties, having provided assurances that the agreement would not be renewed, in actual fact continued to apply it in secret. Furthermore, the Commission did take into account the difficult economic context the agricultural sector was working within, the dual crisis of mad cow disease and foot and mouth disease, which Mr Bernié referred to in his speech in this House on 7 April, and, it was precisely as a result of this very unusual context that for the first time the fine has been reduced by 60%, a not inconsiderable percentage.</p>
<p class="contents">The third criticism is that it was the Commission itself that did not adopt adequate measures to deal with the mad cow disease crisis. In this regard, we should remember that the Commission multiplied its measures for market stabilisation. The intervention mechanisms were used extensively, and the application conditions were increased, specific crisis mechanisms were created to allow the Member States to withdraw from the market additional quantities of channels. In this way, in a few months, almost 10% of European consumption was withdrawn from the market. More than EUR 1 billion of the Community budget was used for this operation and, furthermore, the Commission authorised the Member States to grant national aid to the worst affected farmers. In the case of France, the Commission approved more than EUR 300 million in state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should remember that, although the crisis in the beef sector affected the whole of Europe, the Commission is not aware of any parties in any other Member State deeming it necessary to create an illegal cartel. The decision, which explains the facts as established by the Commission and its illegal conclusions in detail, will be published shortly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although you do discuss this, the fact remains that livestock farmers were in an extraordinarily difficult situation. The BSE crisis dealt the market a blow the like of which it had never before experienced, and this is something else for which the Commission has to assume its responsibility. Let me remind you that this crisis was marked by repeated attempts by the Commission and, to a varying degree, the Council and some of the Member States, to pour oil on troubled waters, which had a negative effect on the market when disaster actually struck. Let me remind you that it was this House and its investigating committee that had to force the Commission – and to some extent also the Council – to act in order that steps could be taken, not only to make provision for health care and to combat the disease, but also to compensate the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is understandable that, in such a situation, people will look for ways of defending themselves, even those that are not legal. I do not want to defend this, and they must be punished for it, but then we – by which I mean the Commission – must accept our own responsibilities. Moreover, we must, in addition to the current measures for cleaning up and regulating the market, which you have described, take a good hard look at the agricultural policy. At that time, the situation was that the 90-head upper limit for bull premiums, which had applied in France, did not apply in other countries – Germany being one of them – so that we were paid premiums for every bull that we could produce, while a limit was in force in France. This meant that, in France, a stable market developed, and other countries tried very hard to get their exports onto it. France and the livestock price therefore came under pressure. This, then, is another area in which the agricultural policy must ensure that conditions are the same, in order that we do not end up with the same premium being paid for the twenty-thousandth bull as was paid for the twentieth. The alternative is that this measure must apply in all countries. Let me again remind you that this disparity within the agricultural sector gave rise to major problems, in that it stoked up competition within the agricultural sector. If then, the Commission wants to avail itself of such penalties, it must always take the conditions into account and keep at least the amount of the penalty in line with them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It punishes the unions twice: firstly you punish a sector for its ability to demonstrate initiative, which enabled it to provide assistance for coping with a quite exceptional crisis. You then threaten the very existence of the unions, because the size of the fine is greater than their budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The French beef industry employs 200 000 farmers, whose average income is less than EUR 8 000 per year. In the autumn of 2001, prices fell by more than 45% whereas the price of beef for consumption continued, paradoxically, to rise. Furthermore, there was no sign of any European solidarity and the French market was saturated by consignments of meat at giveaway prices arriving from other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context of exceptional crisis, there was no longer even a market. French farming unions decided, with the agreement of the French Minister for Agriculture and of his Ministry, to set a minimum price. This price was so low that it allowed for no profit margin at all. There is no way that it was a secret agreement because, on the very evening on which the agreement was signed, the French unions held a press conference. Despite what one reads in the press, therefore, this was not the setting-up of a cartel; it was instead an act of solidarity to prevent the disappearance of one aspect of farm production: high-quality beef.</p>
<p class="contents">If Europe had not failed in its task of ensuring market stability, French farmers would not have needed to take over from it. In an exceptional crisis, exceptional measures are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Commissioner, I should like to ask you a few questions. Can you specify what measures the Commission took and can you tell me why these measures failed? Did you really understand the depth of farmers’ concern and the risk that a high-quality sector might disappear? Can you tell me on what basis you set the fine at EUR 16.7 million, a figure that I believe is astronomical? Do you not think that the Commission’s position runs counter to the principle of setting a minimum price? Lastly, do you not think that in a context in which the farming unions have asked the European Court of Justice to arbitrate, the Commission should try to calm the situation, given the circumstances, by withdrawing these penalties? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I totally disagree with your analysis. We must remember the tragic situation facing the European Union in the autumn of 2001, when the appalling mad cow crisis emerged: exaggerated fears on the part of consumers led to a staggering fall in beef consumption and prices collapsed to unprecedented levels. Institutional caterers, hypermarkets and slaughterhouses refused to accept beef. Desperate farmers saw their livestock pile up and their feed stock disappear and threatened public order. And what proposals did the European Commission come up with? Feeble and ineffectual measures, which came nowhere near to addressing the scale of the crisis and the troubles that it was causing. It proposed optional measures for slaughter and destruction, which some Member States did not implement, in particular Germany and the Netherlands, which exported their problems to France and refused to come to the aid of their own farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the measures adopted in France by common agreement between the public authorities and the farming profession, which consisted of setting, in conjunction with slaughterers, a buying scale at prices that also matched the ‘purchase for destruction’ prices set by the Commission and of appealing to importers to stop importing beef were perfectly appropriate to the situation and had an immediate calming effect. The Commission’s accusation of an illegal agreement appears, therefore, to be completely out of touch and scandalous, given the seriousness of the situation at the time and, to be quite honest, both absurd and irresponsible. I therefore urge the Commission to call off this action, which makes no sense and to dedicate all its energies to uncovering the real secret agreements which are the real threats to free competition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
