<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lindh,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the situation in the Middle East is deteriorating. Distrust between the parties is growing. Violence is claiming more victims every day.</p>
<p class="contents">A normal life has not been possible for the Palestinians for a long time and conditions are getting worse all the time. The EU distances itself from the increasing amount of violence in Gaza and on the West Bank: Israeli encroachment and tank fire in Palestinian-controlled areas, firing on various roads, the killing of certain selected people. Innocent civilians have lost their lives, including many children. The economic situation is also difficult. The Palestinian Authority is in deep financial crisis since the Israeli transfer payments were halted and normal economic activities ceased in the area. In practice, the Authority is living on financial grants from Arab donors and the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Israel is also suffering from the economic downturn as a result of the crisis, although to a lesser extent than Palestinian society. The daily lives of Israelis are becoming more and more difficult. Violence in the form of mortar fire, car bombs and suicide bombings is increasingly affecting Israel. Israeli civilians and children are being killed.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Ariel Sharon was elected on the promise of increasing security. Instead confrontation has been exacerbated, military interventions have increased and a readiness has been demonstrated both to enter Palestinian-controlled areas and to attack Syrian targets in Lebanon. Quite simply, the security situation has got worse.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no long-term military solution. The conflict will neither be won or lost. The only solution to the conflict lies in negotiation. Therefore the peace process must continue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency and the EU are in close contact with the parties and we are encouraging them to continue the peace negotiations on the basis of the result of previous negotiations, seeking to reach a permanent status agreement on the basis of international law, including UN Resolutions 242 and 338.</p>
<p class="contents">A crucial difficulty is the basic lack of trust between the parties. Both parties harbour the misconception that it is the <span class="italic">other</span> side which is solely responsible for the violence and the halting of the peace process. No one dares to show an example of reconciliation or flexibility as it is feared that <span class="italic">this</span> will be seen as weakness.</p>
<p class="contents">A diplomatic initiative is required to break the deadlock. The European Council in Stockholm commissioned High Representative Javier Solana together with the Commission to also report to the Gothenburg Summit in June on how the EU can promote the peace effort. Javier Solana reported the progress of this work at the Gymnich meeting in Nyköping on 5 May.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU welcomes and supports the Mitchell Commission’s report and proposals, as it does the Egyptian-Jordanian peace initiative, which is based on agreements in which Israel took part. Both proposals encourage the parties to immediately enter into cease-fire agreements, to confirm their willingness to respect agreements entered into and seek to reopen negotiations. Measures to build trust are required if negotiations are to succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the most critical issues for the peace process is the Israeli settlement policy. Both the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative and the Mitchell Report demand a freeze on all settlements. The Mitchell Report also suggests that the Israelis should consider withdrawing from controversial and vulnerable settlements. The EU considers that these requirements are justified. We consider that the settlement policy is in breach of international law and constitutes a serious obstacle to peace. The EU has encouraged Israel to start to withdraw from its settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">We also support the Mitchell Report’s proposal that Israel should cease using live ammunition against demonstrators. Measures to build trust also include Israel repaying the taxes due to the Palestinian Authority.</p>
<p class="contents">A negotiated solution, or a step on the way towards one, must include the goal of establishing a democratic, sustainable and peaceful Palestinian state. The EU has defined its positions on the issue in the Berlin Declaration of March 1999 and in the New York Declaration of 12 September 2000. It will remain the task of the EU in cooperation with other interested countries and players to help the Palestinians in developing such a democratic and peaceful Palestinian state.</p>
<p class="contents">Lasting peace in the region is impossible without peace agreements also between Israel and Syria and between Israel and Lebanon. Considerable progress has been achieved in negotiations between Israel and Syria. These now have to be concluded and a solution found based on the principles of international law as stated earlier. Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon in May last year was an important precondition for a future peace agreement. Until such a peace agreement is concluded, it is important for all parties to avoid incidents and other action which may lead to continued violence.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU will actively contribute to the continued peace process in cooperation with other states affected and through High Representative Javier Solana, special envoy Miguel Moratinos and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Middle East is the original home of human civilisation. It is an area of rare cultural riches and religious importance which is now increasingly associated with the long conflict into which the region is sinking deeper and deeper. One condition for positive development in the region is the cessation of the current conflict. The Swedish Presidency wishes to do all it can to contribute to this together with other EU partners to the best of our ability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Madam President, I obviously very much regret that the situation in the Middle East which has been well described by the Minister has not improved since my last intervention in the House on this subject. The violence continues, killings on both sides, including of children, also continue unabated, property is being destroyed, particularly arable land and shelters in refugee camps, and settlements in West Bank and Gaza are still expanding.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is regularly urged to play a stronger part in the Middle East. The core principles of our position are that peace must be built on international law, on the relevant UN Resolutions including UN Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338 and on the formula 'Land for Peace'. We, that is all the European Union institutions, should clearly restate these principles in all our contacts with the parties to this bitter dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union continues to support any efforts to find a peaceful solution to the conflict. We support, as the Minister said, the Egyptian-Jordanian initiative as well as the recommendations of the commendable Mitchell Commission of Inquiry, including the settlement freeze and the swift and decisive cessation of violence and terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been too much bloodshed and fighting. Violence must stop. On the Israeli side there is no justification for the disproportionate use of force against civilians and the destruction of property. On the Palestinian side, the Palestinian Authority must do everything in its power to stop attacks on Israeli civilians. This includes preventing incitements for such attacks, and the Palestinian Authority must naturally control its security services effectively. We cannot condemn violence on one side but not the other. The Mitchell Commission seemed to me to point a sensible way, the only way, to ending the blame game, stopping the killing and the maiming and getting back to talking. Talks have to resume, and the parties must honour their international obligations. In the case of Israel, these obligations range from complying with international humanitarian law, that covers respect for human rights, as stated by the European Union at the Human Rights Commission meeting in Geneva, and also settlements. It goes on to bilateral obligations regarding the Palestinian Authority, for example the transfer of tax revenues, and it also includes obligations under the EC-Israel Association Agreement. In the case of the Palestinian Authority, we need to see the implementation of long-overdue reforms both in financial and political terms including democratic transparency, fighting against corruption and strengthening the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer to two concrete and practical points today about which I am regularly asked by Parliament: the effect of the economic blockade on the Palestinian Authority and the policy of settlements. There has been some improvement recently concerning the movement of goods and people within and out of Gaza. For example, a number of businessmen have received permits, but economic activities in the Palestinian territories remain severely restricted. The Palestinian Authority is still facing financial and institutional collapse. The international donor meeting in Stockholm on 11 April was a good step forward in bringing a solution to the Palestinian Authority's budgetary crisis. We particularly appreciate the commitments made by Arab countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Stockholm meeting, the Commission is discussing with the Palestinian Authority the basis for our future assistance. This includes measures intended to enhance financial management and complete the process of institutional reform. Some of these measures, in particular those referring to institutional reform, constitute a clear confirmation of commitments announced in the past by the Palestinian Authority. We have noted the steps taken by the Palestinian authority to adopt an austerity budget. The Palestinian Authority is also working on other welcome reforms related to financial management, such as the consolidation of revenues. The International Monetary Fund is monitoring this process, and our intention on the basis of this austerity budget is to make monthly payments of EUR 10 million during the next six months once we can get the agreement we all want, but I repeat what I said earlier and what the Minister said, what is important is to end the blockade and resume the payment of revenues.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me turn now to Israel's settlement policy. The European Union's position on settlements is clear. All settlement activities in Gaza, the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and on the Golan Heights are illegal, under international law, and constitute a major obstacle to peace. This includes the natural growth of settlements, a violation of international law that cannot be allowed to continue unabated. I am often asked, particularly in view of the failure of our efforts to resolve the issue, what this means for the working of our Association Agreement with Israel and in particular for the question of rules of origin which is covered by the Agreement. It follows from what I have said that the West Bank, Gaza and the Golan Heights fall outside the territorial scope of the Agreement. This is not a new point I am making, it is not some political gesture. Let me make that point crystal clear. This point has already been made in the Commission's communication in 1998 on the same issue. The communication made it clear that preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and in East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, and I quote, "contravenes agreed rules of origin since these territories do not form part of the State of Israel under public international law". Therefore the communication indicated that, and I quote again, "preferential access to Community markets for exports originating in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as originating in Israel under the EC-Israel Interim Trade Agreement is a violation of the latter, given that it does not apply to these territories."</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must uphold the rule of law. That was a point recently made very seriously in a similar case by the Court of First Instance which has stated that the existence of political tensions, and I quote, "does not exonerate the Commission as guardian of the Treaty and of the agreements concluded under it from ensuring the correct implementation by a third country of the obligation it has contracted to fulfil under an agreement concluded with the Community". The position is absolutely clear. If, I stress the word if, Israel wants to declare goods coming from the settlements as being of Israeli origin, EU customs authorities would not be able to share this interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Customs is a Community competence and the implementation of this common policy is delegated to Member States, but the role of the Commission is to ensure coherence and to avoid divergent interpretations by different Member States. A number of Member States have queried Israeli origin certificates over recent months, and replies are now being received by Member States' customs authorities. Our responsibility in the Commission today is to avoid uncoordinated action. This is why I have suggested that customs authorities discuss the replies received urgently and any action they may be contemplating at the next meeting of the Customs Code Committee on 31 May.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are the technical steps that will be taken now? This issue will be signalled at the EU-Israel Association Committee on 21 May. The item is on the agenda agreed with Israel and, as I have just mentioned, there will be a full discussion by Member States' customs experts at the end of May on how to interpret Israeli replies and the common line on how to respond. In the light of the conclusions reached at this occasion, this would be discussed in the Customs Cooperation Committee between the European Union and Israel which would normally take place in July. I wish to stress that our decision will be entirely based on the law and its technical application case by case. We can do no more but we should do no less. As the Court judgment to which I referred argued, the Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and of the agreements concluded under it. We cannot, nor should we seek to, resile from the duty.</p>
<p class="contents">I return to where I began: like others we wish to see an end to the violence. We want to see a return to negotiation and we stand ready to help with the delicate and demanding work of building an enduring peace. There is no other way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is all the more distressing if we think back to the discussions we held a few short months ago. Then, as you have just reminded us, we were considering the content of various draft proposals which seemed to be bringing the prospect of permanent peace in the region closer.</p>
<p class="contents">Nowadays the agenda seems to be set by the most extremist elements on both sides. A permanent vicious circle of violence has been created. I certainly do not wish to name names or apportion blame, but the fact is that rightly or wrongly, the feeling of insecurity in Israel is stronger than ever. At the same time the belief is gaining ground that the Palestinian National Authority does not wish to act in a serious and determined manner to bring an end to the conflict, or is simply not in a position to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the rapid deterioration in living conditions in the Palestinian Territories is a cause for great concern. It creates fertile ground for the growth of the most radical sectors. Faced with this turn of events, the Palestinian National Authority appears to be losing its grip on the situation. At the same time, the population’s support for the Intifada and indeed for terrorist action against Israel is growing. This should be categorically condemned and decisive action taken against it. President Arafat neglected to do so as recently as yesterday evening in his televised address.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, the Arab countries are becoming ever more demoralised and positions are hardening. Consequently, appeals have been made from the area to the international community and in particular to the European Union, requesting greater involvement in the peace process. However, we need to establish whether the parties to the conflict are genuinely interested in returning to the negotiating table or whether anyone still believes in a military solution to the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been pleased to welcome a delegation from the Israeli Parliament to the House today. I should like to assure them that the institutions of the European Union are more committed than ever to offering even-handed support, if both parties wish it, in order to rebuild the necessary confidence to allow peace negotiations to resume. I am sure members of that delegation have felt this for themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Unquestionably, the European Union has already made a significant effort to offer economic support, in line with its global political vision for the region. Our political involvement is increasing as we hone the Union’s foreign policy instruments. However, we still have a long way to go. Nonetheless, neither the Community nor anyone else can replace the will of the parties concerned to negotiate. We firmly believe that if the aim is to achieve genuine security and well being in the area, peaceful and negotiated settlements must be reconsidered. Confrontation has to cease, and all parties must work together again, striving for peaceful coexistence and cooperation. It is my heartfelt desire that this should come about at the earliest opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unemployment has reached 50%, the investments in peace are lost, the population is sealed off, i.e., living under surveillance in its towns and villages, and the hopes of an entire generation have vanished into thin air.</p>
<p class="contents">In face of this disastrous situation, the European Union must raise its voice and call for respect for the law; in other words, we must focus on essentials again, and I thank Mr Patten for having done that so clearly. That means ending the illegal occupation, handing back the territories acquired by force, calling a halt to the settlement of the West Bank, Gaza, East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights and respecting the Palestinian people's right to self-determination.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If the escalation of violence is to stop, if the problem is to be resolved once and for all and the just and lasting settlement everybody is longing for is to be achieved, surely the first step must be to respect the United Nations resolutions? That is precisely what the Pope said in his speech in Damas and I hope that this time the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats will not disavow it.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">In any case, we welcome the fact that recital D and point 13 of the joint motion for a resolution recall that fundamental point. Israel, like any other country, has the right to live in peace within secure and recognised frontiers. But Israel, like any other country, must recognise its international frontiers. That, however, is not the case. During a recent interview, Mr Sharon spelled out his strategic thinking by stating that the war of independence was not over, and I quote "so long as we are not in possession of the entire territory of Israel". The entire territory of Israel? What territory? Faced with <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> after <span class="italic">fait accompli</span>, the international community stands by and does nothing. Last Saturday, Israeli shells once again fell on a Palestinian refugee camp. On Sunday, the army killed five Palestinian policemen whom it regarded as suspects. And so the list goes on. Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, it is now time to say, loudly and firmly, ‘<span class="italic">basta ya!</span>’ Enough is enough, Mr Sharon.</p>

If Europe wants to make a credible contribution to this debate, we must not choose one side or the other, but always the side of peace, democracy and human rights. That means that whenever these values are in jeopardy we must raise our voice, irrespective of who is responsible at that moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is often vociferous about the possible influence that it might have in the Middle East. From our perspective these are empty words, if we look at the lack of new initiatives from Europe and particularly the lack of coherence between the Member States. That is why we call expressly on the Commission, the presidency and on Mr Solana, whose absence today I find a little odd, to do their utmost to bring the Union into line.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the possible violation by Israel of the rules of origin in the Association Agreement, I should like to express my appreciation for the unambiguous words of Commissioner Patten, and ask him, and at the same time the Council, to give an immediate answer to four clear questions: for how many products have Member States asked for verification from the Israeli authorities, what answers have they received, what steps are they considering and within what timescale?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make the position of my group on this matter quite clear. If it turns out to be true that there are doubts about the certificates issued by Israel and the Member States and the Commission do not act immediately and firmly, Europe will be complicit in the policy of settlement that we all abhor.</p>

Having said that, it is crystal clear to my group that overwhelming responsibility for the present escalation lies with the Sharon government in Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Two examples: my group considers the heightened strategy of the execution of Palestinians by Israeli security services a disgrace, unworthy of a democratic state and moreover a strategy with no hope of success, since it will only increase the fury and frustration among the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="contents">The rejection of the Mitchell Report is a lost opportunity for the Israeli government. Bringing an end to further expansion of the settlements, not even to the settlements themselves, should have been a first gesture towards the Palestinians as a sign that the Israelis also want a compromise, but sadly the Israeli government was unwilling to make that gesture.</p>
<p class="contents">All this is a good reason for stepping up the pressure from the European Union on the Israeli government. Consequently I should like very specifically to ask the Commission and the Council, with all appreciation for the words spoken on the products from the settlements: what exactly is the Commission going to say to the Israeli delegation on 21 May about trade with Israel itself? Will it be business as usual for products from Israel itself? Not in the view of my group. The issue of products from the settlements must be addressed, but we also feel that normal trade should be scrutinised carefully and that the Commission should take initiatives in that direction on 21 May.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I do not wish to suggest that Palestinians are acting correctly. The Palestinians are waging a war that they cannot win. I also believe that the Commission must take responsibility and spell out to the Palestinian Authority that it – however difficult that may be – must try to prevent attacks on civilians and must opt for a different course, because the Palestinian Authority has its own responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Suffering and tragedy will continue to mark the days and nights in Palestine if Israel and the wider international community do not take action to restore international and human rights. Yesterday was another day of tragedy: more than 200 people, including a French journalist, were wounded at the check points, although the Palestinians had not opened fire; the evening claimed another victim, an Israeli settlement; over 500 Palestinians were killed, 23 000 wounded and hundreds maimed for life; bombings, the houses of the poor demolished by bombs, thousands of trees – the livelihood of the peasant farmers – uprooted, roads blocked, despairing men and women, prisoners in their own villages, going hungry and Palestinian leaders considered to be military targets executed. Pacifists from the Israeli movement, Peace Now, and I myself wept at the murder of Dr Tabet Tabet, an old friend; schools closed, land confiscated to make room for fresh settlements and further suffering: 80 Israelis, including children and adolescents, killed.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stop the cycle of violence, for every death, whether Palestinian or Israeli, reduces our humanity. I understand the despair, the rage, the humiliation, the collective punishments, the retaliation, the need of the Palestinians forced to live under military occupation for 30 years for freedom; I understand the historical fear of the Israeli people, the persecutions they have suffered, the unique experience of the Shoah, for which we Europeans are responsible; I understand the fear that a bomb might explode under a bus or a shell hit a school, but these fears do not give anyone the right to occupy another people's territory or to violate international human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our responsibility not to allow any expression of anti-Semitism in Europe, guaranteeing to the Israelis that the safety of Israel is very important to us, just as the safety of the Palestinian people is very important to us. We have been saying for too long that we must stop the cycle of violence. What, then, is our policy? To urge the Israeli government to resume talks without delay and to put an end to the closing-off of the territories and the bombings. International protection for the Palestinians must be guaranteed – this request has been made by over 400 Israeli citizens as well as by the Palestinians – but, above all, the expansion of settlements and roads must stop. The Mitchell Commission also says this.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, in an article in the newspaper, <span class="italic">Ha'aretz</span>, Daniel Bensimon condemned Mr Sharon's false motives in respect of the natural population expansion of the settlements. He cites sources of American intelligence which state that 20 000 houses have been emptied and that many settlers, even those who are most fanatical, are leaving. He writes that, if the government genuinely had the interests of the country at heart, it would put a freeze on new settlements. This would be a positive message to the Palestinians, the Arabs and the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">Stopping the escalation of violence: the Palestinian Authority must make every endeavour to prevent extremism from prevailing. There are no military solutions. The European Union – as Parliament has stressed – must play a political role: international law must be applied in real life and not just proclaimed in declarations. In this sense, respect for the agreements signed by Israel must be ensured, including the agreement concluded with the European Union which lays down a ban on the exporting of goods produced in the settlements to Europe. Commissioner Patten has made this very clear, as has Mrs van der Laan. The resolution upon which Parliament is about to vote calls upon the Council and the Commission to consider whether collective punishments and the disproportionate use of force are not in conflict with the principles of the Association Agreement and to take the necessary action: our aim is not to punish, just to obtain respect for the rule of law. There is no time to lose in the struggle for peace: it is necessary for Palestinians and Israelis, for the region, but also for us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question that really has to be answered is: who is going to broker an end to the violence in the Middle East? I certainly welcome the active role the High Representative of the EU for the common foreign and security policy is playing in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union can play a constructive role firstly in ending the violence in the Middle East and then putting in place structures whereby peace talks can recommence between the various factions. I condemn without reservation violence from whatever quarter. It is not only a question of seeking to prevent violence by different factions in the Middle East, it is primarily a question of guaranteeing that conditions can be improved in the hope that the violence ends and that negotiations can be reopened.</p>
<p class="contents">A peaceful solution in the Middle East can be achieved. It was only last summer that the Israeli government and the Palestinian people were negotiating on what were bottom-line issues. While I am disappointed that the peace talks in America last year did not culminate in a final peace settlement, they were not a complete failure either. Issues, including the status of Jerusalem, the borders of the Palestinian State, the fate of Jewish settlements and the right of return of Palestinian refugees, were all being discussed between the two sides last year. If violence can be ended in the Middle East and the conditions for the reopening of negotiations can be secured, we can once again come to a situation whereby bottom-line issues can be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has affirmed on a number of occasions the need to ensure that the security of the Israeli and Palestinian people, both collectively and individually, is always protected. In the overall context, securing peace in the Middle East is going to take time. The first step in the current peace process was taken when Israel and Egypt concluded the peace treaty at Camp David in 1979. It took another twelve years before a comprehensive peace process got under way at the Madrid Conference in October 1999, which enshrined the principle of exchanging land for peace. The permanent status negotiations resumed in September 1999. I would appeal to the key parties involved to strive in good faith to end the violence in the Middle East and to put in place a negotiated settlement, based on the principles of existing agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How can this spiral of violence in the Middle East be averted? What exact contribution can the Member States of the European Union make?</p>
<p class="contents">With the noble intention of addressing these questions the Netherlands Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr Van Aartsen, travelled to the region at the beginning of this month. The written account of his in-depth findings leads me to put a number of follow-up questions to the members of the Council and Commission present here. For example, during his meeting with the Israeli prime minister, Mr Sharon, the Dutch minister encountered clear criticism of the Middle East policy of the EU. Mr Sharon characterised it as ‘unbalanced’. This judgement, though, did not apply to the Netherlands, the premier added. I should like to hear the rebuttal by the Council and Commission of Mr Sharon’s statements on the matter, since they imply divergent approaches to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition Mr Van Aartsen points to the dangerous radicalisation of the Palestinian camp. Do the Council and Commission share this analysis and what opportunities do they see for combating this tendency from the European side?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Dutch minister argues for “a more effective international effort to promote a healthy institutional and democratic development of the Palestinian administration”. For at this moment, says Mr Van Aartsen, the administrative weakness of the Palestinian Authority threatens to undermine its authority on two sides, with its own population and no less with the state of Israel. And in that case what political prospects will there be for peaceful relations between Israel and Palestine? Are the Council and Commission, as donors of the Palestinian Authority, as aware of this lacuna and how do they propose to fill it in concrete terms?</p>
<p class="contents">At any rate they can count on the support of the Israeli vice-premier Nathan Sharansky. In last Monday’s <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span> he argues for a direct link between concessions to the Palestinians and making Palestinian society more open and transparent. Mr Sharansky hopes that such a society will give the Palestinians the rights they deserve, without threatening Israel. Surely that Jewish dream demands a European effort too? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, the TV news bulletins showing the Middle East are still full of bloodshed and despair this morning. And yet the UN and Parliament resolutions have been reiterated for decades now to no avail, as have the calls for action from the whole world. In this morning's debate in this Chamber, we are repeating all the same things all over again. I no longer have faith in resolutions which are treated like waste paper, often lying in some dusty corner of the archives of the Parliamentary committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what we must do here is not dismiss<span class="bold"> </span>the Palestinians, who are defending the right of a people to a homeland, as extremists. What we must actually do here is ask ourselves why, despite the resolutions, the autonomous activities of a community are still subject to Israeli approval, why a recently-built airport cannot operate, why the extermination of a community of 4 million people which, since the beginning of the Yom Kippur war, has been reduced by almost 10% by a subtle, insidious, treacherous, poisonous, cynical, cruel war which shows no mercy to women or children, is not considered to be genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I wonder how a people which has known such pain can inflict it on others so relentlessly. I regret to say that it is since a certain right-wing party, the party of Mr Sharon, took control of Israel that, as a result of that appalling right-wing policy, the world has lost control of the overall situation. Let us therefore set about introducing an initiative which will go beyond the paper-pushing games that have been played by the world's parliaments for too long now and lead us to resolute, tangible, decisive action to save the innocent lives of women, children and the elderly with peace. It is no coincidence that Jesus Christ was born in Palestine. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Austrian chancellor Bruno Kreisky was one of the first to urge Israeli politicians to start direct talks with Arafat. What was then a Utopian ideal is now political reality. But where are today’s European Kreiskys? Where are the visions, the ideas, the creativity and the courage to go beyond standard, purely bureaucratic duties?</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has endeavoured over recent years, besides financial and political activities in the Middle East, to leave political brokering to the USA and to focus on purely economic issues in this region. Perhaps this was a reaction to Europe’s chaotic, uncoordinated political stance in relation to the warring factions.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the biggest obstacles preventing EU representatives from assuming an active role in the peace process is what are, at times, incomprehensible and intolerable unilateral accusations and intrepid judgements. For example, why on earth did the Swedish foreign minister issue such an aggressive, unilateral judgment of Israel’s show of power after visiting Israel and the settlements during the Swedish Presidency, thereby scuppering any chance of brokering by the EU during the Swedish Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can seriously ignore Israel’s desire for peace. No Israeli politician has ever ventured as far as the last prime minister, Ehud Barak, did in his proposals. The present catastrophic situation is the result. Blaming new Sharon government for it, as has been done here, merely hampers the efforts of the EU representatives to broker an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe should understand, once and for all, that none of us looks on the Middle East merely in terms of friends or foes. If Europe is to have any chance of being taken seriously as a broker, we need a consistent language in our foreign policy, a neutral attitude towards the warring factions and to work out and broker feasible peace proposals. Simply stating ones support for the claims of one side or the other is several principles short of a peace policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues such as the Palestinians' right to return, the division of Jerusalem and the Holy Mount, the problem of the settlement policy and Palestinian statehood and the Israeli people’s justifiable demand for security must be discussed directly by the parties to the conflict. Our opinions must take second place if we want to be taken seriously as peace brokers.</p>
<p class="contents">To do all this, we need high-profile, persuasive people to represent Europe, who will be taken seriously by all parties in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">I arrived back in Strasbourg last night directly from visiting Israel. My statements are perhaps coloured somewhat by my private connections. But you can rest assured that this nation wants peace on both sides. It is part of our job to engage in talks with both sides. It does not always have to be the politicians currently in office. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has reached its climax in the stoning of human beings and in the killing and murdering of children and innocent victims.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community’s appeals for dialogue and peace have been ignored or sidelined. It is therefore urgent to press ahead with the initiatives currently under way. I have in mind the joint Jordano-Egyptian plan and the Mitchell Committee’s conclusions calling for an immediate cessation of violence and the resumption of dialogue aimed at a peaceful solution to this conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">If there is no response to these appeals, the international community must not remain unmoved by this display of violence, deep-rooted hatred and the ‘an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth’ culture. Nor can we remain blind deaf and dumb to it.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, Madam President, if the two initiatives now on the table fail to bear fruit, we shall have to come up with a formula to allow us to break the current deadlock.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers – I refer to the Defence Ministers, who met informally on Monday prior to meeting with the Foreign Ministers – has stated that by the end of the year the European Union will be in a position to become involved in crisis management situations on a case by case basis. It should be borne in mind, however, that a large proportion of our resources is currently committed in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we cannot afford to wait until the end of the year. If the initiatives now under way fail to bear fruit, we should consider other alternatives, such as a United Nations’ buffer force. Alternatively, as Mr Patten rightly suggested, we could use the instruments available to the European Union, namely the association agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not overlook other possibilities such as the International Court in The Hague, or the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. It would be best not to have to resort to them, however, because the parties do really wish to return to the negotiating table and seek a peace which must be based on justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In any case, the President-in-Office, Mrs Lindh, and many other Members have stressed the severity and scale of the situation in the occupied territories and throughout the Middle East in their speeches. There has been quite enough description.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that Parliament's role is coming into its own in this case as well. There have been many debates but few resolutions, and Parliament is realising that resolutions and declarations have to have value and meaning. As you pointed out, in this case we have a resolution which, I hope, will be adopted by a very wide majority, in which practically all the political groups undertake initiatives in respect of the Commission and the Council. I would like to thank Commissioner Patten for the clarity and determination with which he has re-established international law and responsibilities in economic relations with Israel as well. If we do not get back to international law, it will be very difficult to get away from the maze of violence and retaliation which have erupted in that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would like to stress to the Council that it may not be sufficient for Mr Solana to bring the matter up in Gothenburg. The Treaty of Amsterdam has provided us with tools which have not yet been used in this field. It is rather strange that the European Union should not have equipped itself with a common strategy on the Middle East, and it is rather strange that the 15 should have gone to the United Nations Security Council and the meetings of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva with different positions. This makes no sense. It is appalling. In my opinion, it is the duty of the European Union to strengthen the role of the High Representative and of Mr Moratinos through a common strategy laying down the direction to be followed. We call for this to be done in Gothenburg. What Mr Salafranca said makes sense. The Mitchell Commission has made recommendations. The first step could be to send observers, but this could be lead to the sending of a peacekeeping force. If the violence does not cease, we will have to do something to assist the process from outside. I feel that this debate has been useful and, above all, I call upon the Council to take the resolution into due consideration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is high time that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict escaped from the impasse in which it is currently stuck. I believe that both parties will have to make great efforts to achieve this. To begin with both sides must immediately refrain from any unilateral act that may cause the conflict to escalate further.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must insist on mutual respect and good will. In this connection, I should like to point to the, in my view, very important statement made by the Israeli Foreign Affairs Minister, Shimon Peres, on Sunday 13 May that there will be no more new settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European Union is concerned, it is our duty to strengthen our position in the peace talks, in view of all our humanitarian and geostrategic interests in this region as well as our important trading relations. The Commission and the Member States must also be encouraged to support projects that can help in the building of understanding and partnership. Of course, many unsolved problems and unanswered questions will remain. Everyone knows that the peace process will be long and arduous, but I remain convinced that with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance we can achieve our common goal, of a peaceful and prosperous Middle East. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly that is because since 1967 most of our states, with the notable exception of France, have continued to give the State of Israel – a state that is growing increasingly self-assured and domineering – the impression that it can violate international law and UN resolutions with impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, here as elsewhere we have followed Washington and persist in closing our eyes to the theocratic excesses of this religious state whose governments are under the thumb of fanatical parties and minorities that are just as bad as the other groups of religious fanatics in the region. That is why we should envisage imposing sanctions on Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, another serious imbalance for which we are in part responsible, namely the imbalance of forces. I have no hesitation in saying that we must consider giving the Arab side a large enough force, including a large enough nuclear force, to persuade Israel that it cannot simply do whatever it wants. That is the policy my country pursued in the 1970s when it gave Iraq a nuclear force. We have now destroyed it. So we will carry on with our policy of imbalance and what is happening today is merely the annoying but inevitable result of our collective blindness and cowardice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, some people, both in the Council and the Commission and in our Parliament, seem to have short memories when it comes to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">In reaction to this morning's debate let me begin by observing that Mrs Lindh is taking rather a selective approach when she speaks of Israel's retreat from Lebanon, while forgetting that Lebanon is still occupied by Syria. I am surprised at such forgetfulness. The policy proposed by Mrs Lindh, MEPs and the Commission is a formulaic policy. It forgets that Mr Barak made proposals that no Israeli before him had ever made and that the Palestinians rejected his proposals. I doubt whether putting the Israelis' backs against the wall will persuade them to subscribe to a peace plan that even Mr Arafat does not seem prepared to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">We should take a more objective view. We should also remember our own history of the past hundred years, perhaps show a little more generosity towards Israel and perhaps also begin to seriously consider the possibility of Israel joining the European Union. That would respond to the Israeli people's deep-seated anxieties, while certainly not denying the frustrations and extremely harsh living conditions of the Palestinians, and would also respond to the fundamental issue of the profound anxiety of the Palestinian people. I think Europe should give proof of its generosity by offering Israel membership of the European Union. That is a prospect that would allow the European Union to make greater concessions, even in territorial terms, and allow Palestine to develop and Israel to live in security in this part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal has already been signed by thirty Members of the European Parliament and a number of members of the Knesset. I invite Members to sign it as soon as possible so that we can hold a major debate on this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is already present there, far more so than in the past, thanks to the commitment of its High Representative. Now it must play an even more active part. The time has passed when it could confine itself to watching the drama unfold from its Mediterranean balcony seat.</p>
<p class="contents">It must play an active part because as history has demonstrated, in politics and in war, merely to play a passive role is ignominious. If we are to have any prospect of being useful, we must act with absolute impartiality. That is the first difficulty in this exercise, since each of the camps expects first of all that we side with it against its enemy, following the old adage that my enemy's enemy is my friend, but my enemy's friend is my enemy. If we are to help break this vicious circle of bloodshed and revenge, here as elsewhere we do not have the right to be anyone's enemy.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do? I sincerely believe that nobody will make peace in the Middle East unless the two parties are resolved to do so and unless the various proposals put forward in this Chamber just now, by Members as also by the Council and by the Commission, are taken into consideration. If, as we must continue to hope, the wish for peace exists, and only if it exists, then we must also support the idea of deploying an international observers' force, in which Europe could and should take part. Like my friend Mr Salafranca Sánchez Neyra and like Mrs Napoletano, I want to stress that point to our counterparts from the Knesset who are here today, because I know that at present Israel is profoundly opposed to the idea. The way to cool down a conflict as acute and heated as the one that continues to bathe the Holy Land in blood is to have impartial observers on the ground. Through their actions and their testimony they could prevent a new general conflagration from being sparked off by the growing number of incidents that are bound to occur when a real armistice is signed. Like my fellow Members, I continue to hope that we will finally see such an armistice one day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, while I regret the fact that the Europeans all too often underestimate the tragedy of the repeated terrorist attacks on innocent civilians in the Israeli villages, while I reproach Yasser Arafat with not having had the courage to take the hand Mr Ehud Barak courageously extended to him within a few days of the elections – it would have been enough to say ‘yes, but …’ or ‘yes, if …’. but he chose to say ‘no’ – nonetheless Israel is a democratic, powerful, well-armed and well-equipped state. That is why it is up to Israel not only to stop the pressure mounting, but also to take peace initiatives that are acceptable to the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that although I understand the Israeli people’s concern for their security, I cannot accept statements or acts by Mr Ariel Sharon that I personally would condemn on the part of anyone else.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely in the name of my friendship towards Israel, let me say to the Israelis that they will not achieve the security they deserve by the use of force and that the settlements are a serious mistake. Let me also say that the Palestinians have the right to a state. Lastly, let me say that the Israelis and the Palestinians need us to make serious proposals for a solution. We know that a peaceful settlement will require sacrifices on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe can and must make its contribution and set out a balanced and active position to that end. I have found such a position set out in the statements by the Council and the Commission. I also hope that our resolution will be a contribution and I am sure the Mitchell Commission’s report could form the basis for new negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are two peoples who must coexist as neighbours or offer their grandchildren the prospect of eternal feuding. Sadly, there is provocation by people who should be showing leadership. Provocation leads to violence, which is met by violence, which leads to revenge and a slippery slope away from a just and peaceful <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">Much of the solution is in Israel's hands, but Palestine and the neighbouring states must respond. Of course I understand Israel's nervousness about taking the first steps. Lebanon, for example, has been in an impossible situation for years: it has been shelled by Israel and infiltrated by Syria, and both must help it now to provide stability in its own lands. Israeli withdrawal was met responsibly by the Lebanese. However, Israel still holds pockets of Lebanese territory in the south and has not yet provided maps of where the landmines are so that they can be cleared and, as a result, nine shepherds have been killed since the withdrawal. Prisoners on both sides still have to be returned and the Shebaa farms on the Golan border belonging to Lebanon are still held, controlled and occupied by Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The key area of provocation has been covered by the minister and by the Commissioner, including the issue of the sale in the EU of goods labelled as Israeli but coming from the settlements.</p>
<p class="contents">There are 145 settlements in the West Bank, 16 in Gaza, 9 in East Jerusalem; 400,000 people live in them. Only 42% of West Bank territory is controlled by the Palestinians, 58% is either in military camps or settlements and too often the military camps lead to the settlements. Peace will not come from resolutions adopted here – although we can help. Peace will come if, and only when, Israel, Palestine and the neighbouring states realise they want peace so much that they are prepared to live it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has consistently been shown here that it is important that the European Union has influence and plays an active role. If we are to have any influence, there must also be unanimity within the European Union on the way in which we wish to influence the current process.</p>
<p class="contents">It is good to see that the Council is considerably more unanimous today than we ever have been before. I also think this unanimity can be seen in this context too. Although different resolutions have been proposed and although there are many different opinions, there are still fewer differences between us than previously. I also think this is one reason why we have never before been able to see the EU being as greatly involved in the Middle East conflict. However, unfortunately this is not sufficient, and on the contrary, as Mr Poos said initially, it is also about the willingness of the parties to negotiate and not least about the Israeli government currently bearing the main responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">I can agree with very much of what Mr Poos said regarding the description of the current situation: the catastrophic economic situation, and the illegal occupation. The problem is that this leads to Mr Galeote Quecedo’s view that there is a risk of extremists setting the agenda. The risk is that hate propaganda on both sides and Palestinian poverty will lead to violence increasing further.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lagendijk said that it is unacceptable for resistance fighters on the Palestinian side to be executed by Israelis. I can only agree; I brought this up in my initial speech. This is completely in breach of both international law and international standards and of what most of us consider to be basic human rights. We have brought this up several times with the Israeli government. We have also received guarantees that this is to cease, but unfortunately this has not hitherto been the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the meeting of 21 May, addressed by several of the speakers, the Council is providing every support to the Commission for the course of action which Commissioner Patten has described and which means that we must now follow the rules and clearly show that the EU cannot accept Israel continuing to break them.</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers have addressed the allocation of the burden of guilt, where we lay the blame and how much of an intermediary the EU can be. I would like to say to Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra, and many others who have brought up this issue, that <span class="italic">even </span>if the EU clearly is to make requirements of both parties, today it is natural for us to make more stringent demands of the Israeli government and Ariel Sharon. Ariel Sharon actually bears the main responsibility today for reversing the trend. As many of you have pointed out, the current policy increases the risk of benefiting extremist groups. Mr Sharon must acknowledge his political responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Council will naturally also make demands of the Palestinian side: that the Palestinians are to have a more open budget, that they should work more on the basis of democratic, open principles, that they should do everything in their power to stop terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can the EU do further? Just as Mr Napolitano said, it is important that we also act. So I can guarantee that we will not passively sit waiting for the report from Javier Solana to the European Council meeting in Gothenburg. We will address the Israeli government and demand that it stop the violence, cease to close off Palestinian areas and immediately halt its settlement policy which <span class="italic">is </span>illegal and constitutes illegal occupation. As I said, we have also demanded that the Palestinian side do all it can to prevent terrorism and to reduce violence. We support the proposals of the Mitchell Report and it was good to see support for the report here in Parliament too. We also support the Jordanian-Egyptian initiative. In particular, and the Commission has also played a part in developing this, we assume a major financial responsibility today for the Palestinian areas and for ensuring that the situation does not become even worse in these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely as General Morillon said, the EU is currently more active than ever before. However, I believe that we all feel the need not only to take on more responsibility than we have done hitherto – the major financial responsibility which has been taken so far – but also the need to take even greater <span class="italic">political </span>responsibility which also actually corresponds to the financial responsibility we are taking on the region.</p>
<p class="contents">By commissioning Javier Solana to draw up a roadmap for the Gothenburg Summit, we anticipate that the EU will be able to provide a further substantial contribution to the peace process and achieve a better, more long-term strategy for the EU’s involvement in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is still the parties themselves who must come to their senses, who must break the spiral of violence, who have to refrain from the ever increasing conflicts and return to the only possible road to peace; cease-fire, a freeze on settlements, a return to the negotiating table.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say both to the Israeli side and the Palestinian side that this is not a question which concerns only you. It is of major international interest. It is crucial to the future of us all and therefore we demand that the parties also take their responsibility. As Mr Caudron said, in this situation it is not about being a friend to Israel or a friend to Palestine. Instead it is about all of us in the EU having to do all we can to contribute to the peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, Mrs van der Laan asked about the rules of origin, and if there are points which I do not cover in what I am going to say, I will take them up in correspondence with the honourable Member. What I would like to do is rehearse exactly what has happened so far. The issue of rules of origin was raised in the Commission communication to the Council and the European Parliament to which I referred earlier. The General Affairs Council at the end of June 1998 took note of our communication and asked the Commission to resolve these issues on a technical level. A great deal has happened since then. Technical contacts at different levels with Israel took place immediately after the communication. On 16 December 1999 the Commission informed COREPER on the outcome of these meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">In early 2000 concrete information on specific imports from Israeli settlements was supplied to the Commission. On the basis of this information, at the Customs Code Committee meeting on 6 April last year, the Commission reminded Member States of their obligation in this respect, namely to apply the provisions of Article 32 of the Protocol on Customs of the Association Agreement to consignments for which information had been received that they originated in the settlements. After this meeting Member States returned around 2000 EUR1 certificates to Israel for verification. In some cases, goods were only released for free circulation in the European Union subject to the payment of a guarantee against liability for customs duties. Replies to the letters of verification are coming in as the ten month deadline for Israel's reply is expiring.</p>
<p class="contents">All along there has been a notice to importers which was first published in the Community Official Journal of 8 November 1997 warning exporters of doubts regarding EUR1 certificates from Israel. The notice is still in force, although of course references to the orange juice case, which honourable Members will recall, no longer apply. That is all the information that I have at hand on the history of rules of origin. I am determined, as I said earlier, to conduct this issue by the Agreement and entirely according to the law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lagendijk asked what we would be saying to the Israeli side next week at our meeting on 21 May and he said that what we sought, or should seek, in the Middle East was a balanced approach. I do not think, and I do not think he thinks either, that means we should search for some point on the political agenda where neither side will disagree with us. That is not what is meant by a balanced approach. I happen to think that the Mitchell Commission report was an extremely balanced and sensible document. The Mitchell Commission – and I hope we will do much the same – in my judgment supports those who are still committed to working for peace on both sides of the argument. That is a sensible, balanced approach. As for what we will say on 21 May, we can discuss human rights under the essential elements clause of our Agreement, we will certainly discuss for the first time this summer rules of origin – that is already on the agenda – but I want to be scrupulous in sticking to the letter and the spirit of our Agreement. To go beyond that would risk putting us on a very slippery slope indeed. So as far as I am concerned we stick to the letter of the Agreement and do not go beyond it with any other political gestures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Belder asked about the remarks of our colleague and friend the Dutch Foreign Minister about the Palestinian Authority in particular and the importance of ensuring that it operates in a more transparent and democratic way. I have to say that what our colleague Mr van Aartsen said during his visit to the Middle East was not just wholly in line with our views on the development of democracy in the Palestinian territories, but an extremely eloquent and effective exposition of our view, as one would expect from him. Even in these less than perfect circumstances we need to press the Palestinian Authority to be more open, to be more transparent, to be more pluralistic, to protect people's civil liberties and human rights and to become increasingly democratic. That is, I think, what the Minister was saying and he has our total support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
