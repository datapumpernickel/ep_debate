<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Heinisch </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, we have now spent nearly three years considering whether Turkey can participate in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes. Now that these programmes are coming to a close at the end of this year and we are already discussing follow‐up programmes, this subject has finally come onto Parliament's agenda. One reason why it has taken so long is that people tended to link the subject of this report to the basic question of relations between the EU and Turkey and of Turkey's full membership of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 28 of the EU‐Turkey Association Agreement already provided for the possibility of Turkish accession to the EU. The December 1997 European Council in Luxembourg, and in particular the June 1998 Cardiff European Council, confirmed the importance of binding Turkey more closely to the European Union in every area. From the outset that also implied Turkish participation in Community programmes such as Socrates and Youth for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Council has repeatedly noted that the applicant states must first achieve institutional stability, as a guarantee of a democratic and constitutional system, of the protection of human rights and of respect for and the protection of minorities. There is no doubt that the human rights situation in Turkey, especially in regard to the treatment of minorities, remains unsatisfactory, as reflected in the most recent annual report by Amnesty International. Moreover, Turkey's policy of obstructing Cyprus' application for accession is not acceptable. Let me say that quite plainly.</p>
<p class="contents">But I do not want to go into any further detail today on the current human rights situation. We have made our position on this clear on several occasions and in a variety of reports, as most recently in the Swoboda report by our committee on the development of relations with Turkey and on the European strategy for Turkey. We have said all that needs saying on that subject. Parliament's demands have been set out in numerous documents. So this report confines itself to the question of Turkey"s participation in the education and training programmes. The wider‐ranging discussions on Turkey's accession to the EU distract us from the objectives we are actually pursuing with the exchange programmes and which should really be our main yardstick when we look at this question.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes were developed in order to teach young people the values of tolerance, democracy and active citizenship. A declared aim of the European Union in establishing these programmes is to enable young people to play their part in building Europe, for young people who are brought up in a spirit of openness and tolerance are the most promising architects of a peaceful and humane Europe. That is precisely why we should try to bind young people more closely to the idea of Europe and to its values. That is why we began by opening these programmes to young people from the EFTA states and then also to young people from the associated Central and Eastern European states and also Cyprus and Malta. That is why we must not simply leave Turkey out in the cold.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the tasks named in the justification for the first phase of Socrates was to put Europe within the reach of the man in the street and to give it a human dimension. With that in mind, Turkey seems almost predestined to take part in the exchange programmes. Europe must be brought into the field of vision of young people in Turkey, for it is these young people who are open to change in their country and are forward‐looking enough to bring it about. Moreover, young people have a very basic and responsible role to play in the process of democratisation and rapprochement between peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential that exists here is shown by the fact that people under the age of 25 make up more than 50 % of Turkish society. That offers a huge opportunity! Of course we can only reach a fraction of these young people with our programmes. But just think of the enormous amplifying effect produced by young people who gain positive personal experience from these programmes. That is why we must offer young Turks a chance to get to know our western European culture and the way we treat fundamental rights and human rights for themselves. This does actually work, as we have seen from the existing cooperation schemes between European youth and students' organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also emphasise again that we will seek fair participation of minorities and especially Kurds when we carry out the programmes. The violent disputes that are now occurring on European soil make no difference here. But we cannot achieve that through votes or suchlike. Instead, we must carefully monitor the participation of the various minorities by drawing up an annual report.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me just say that in my opinion we should remember the well‐known saying by Jean Monnet, who kept emphasising that all European efforts at integration must in the end be based on bringing people closer together and not just uniting nations. Closer cooperation among young people and the offer of exchange grants are important factors for strengthening democracy and respect for human rights in Turkey. So both are an important step in terms of binding Turkey to the west in the long term. I would therefore ask you to support me in calling for Turkey to participate in the Community's education and training and youth exchange programmes.</p>

They also encourage Turkey to open up more to the democratic and constitutional states of the European Union. The Committee on External Economic Relations therefore unanimously endorses Mrs Renate Heinisch's excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to see young people in Turkey participate more closely in the long‐term construction of a pluralist society within a constitutional state, as the Turkish social partners have repeatedly demanded. The adoption of this report would also be a sign that the European Union is gradually living up to its responsibility towards our great neighbour in the south by formulating a medium and long‐term strategy for Turkey, and that areas of cooperation are constantly growing and being strengthened so that in the long term they will manage not only to eclipse the conflicts of the day – indeed we have been discussing Öcalan today – but also to eradicate them in the long term, with the growth of a new society in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the European Parliament for its part is prepared to promote cooperation in other areas too, in addition to the areas covered by this Heinisch report, so that the European Union can successfully complete all its unfinished homework – here I am thinking mainly of financial aid.</p>

My group is also in favour of extending the Youth for Europe programme to Turkey, although this decision has nothing to do with our everyday political relations with Turkey or with our serious reservations about certain domestic conditions in Turkey. Why? The Youth for Europe programme pursues its own educational objective, which is to promote tolerance among young people towards other ways of thought and life in other countries, through projects of intercultural encounters and exercises in solidarity based on practical participation in local schemes, to name one example.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme is aimed at encouraging personal experience and making young people less vulnerable to nationalist movements. The young Turks who visit my country, even if some of them are hand‐picked, do have their first chance to really get to know Europe and to correct the biased picture of Europe they may have received from their national press. The softening of set ways of thought and the advent of a new generation can bring about socio‐political change in a country. That is precisely why we must support the dialogue with young people in Turkey, with the help also of this democracy programme. To all those who are against it I would say: the young Turks we invite to our countries should not be made to pay for the wrongs of their government. We cannot combat nationalist attitudes while at the same time saying no to a cross‐frontier dialogue with young people in Turkey.</p>

This is because it proposes to let Turkey benefit from the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes even though, by the rapporteur"s own admission, the human rights situation in Turkey is still giving cause for concern. Recent events are also not indicative of any change for the better in Turkey: I am of course referring to the arrest, detention and trial conditions of Abdullah Öcalan, and also to Turkey"s reactions to the European Union"s statements and proposals calling for Turkey to solve its human rights problems. What has Turkey"s response been? It has said that the EU"s statements simply add to the list of items to be resolved prior to cooperation being extended between Europe and Turkey. The mind boggles!</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation, the sensible course of action might have been to refer this report back to committee in order to allow time for reflection. However, this will not happen and so we must decide what to do. Some people may consider, as has just been said, that the young people of Turkey cannot be held responsible for the current problems in their country and that perhaps closer ties with the EU could in the long run steer Turkey towards greater democracy, greater respect for the resolutions of international organisations, improved justice and more freedom.</p>
<p class="contents">However, others, myself included, consider that to vote for Mrs Heinisch"s report would be tantamount to telling Turkey that it can take any liberties, that it can refuse to make any gestures and that it can continue to take everything offered by Europe without giving anything in return. We would also be saying that Turkey can continue to violate human rights while arrogantly ignoring the fact that the basic principle of the EU, to which Turkey wants to accede, is actually absolute respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">You cannot be heavy‐handed in negotiations, as Turkey has been, but I feel that the European Union is being too timid with Turkey, whereas with the applicant countries of Eastern Europe the EU is being very demanding about their legal systems and the protection of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The ELDR Group wishes to give the young people of Turkey a chance, which is why we will not be voting against the report, although it would be wrong to think that Turkey"s current attitude is not supported by its young people. Nevertheless, we should still give them a chance, but Turkey should not be allowed to regard a positive vote as another victory and as a ratification of its current policy of arbitrary executions which are attacks on freedom of expression. This is why our group intends to abstain.</p>

We have also been awaiting decisions for a long time given that the first exchange took place in September 1996. The programmes concerned will end in 1999 and the new Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes will start in 2000, when they should be open to Turkey in accordance with certain procedures to be established.</p>
<p class="contents">In the current context, I am therefore wondering what sort of urgent message we need to send to Turkey. Clearly, such programmes are a way of imparting the values of a community based on democracy and tolerance of other people and other cultures, not to mention all the other virtues of education and training. In this respect, I agree that the Socrates programme should be extended as broadly as possible. However, I must point out that an amendment tabled by my colleagues on the Culture Committee, which stated that this decision should enter into force after the European Parliament has verified that human rights are being respected by Turkey, has been rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, the members of our group are to vote freely and according to their consciences on this report. I myself intend to abstain.</p>

And that is precisely the point of today's debate. We unreservedly support Turkey's participation in the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes because we believe that we can make an important contribution by giving young people in Turkey a chance to use the opportunity offered by our programmes to turn their country, Turkey, which, sadly, is rightly described as not sufficiently democratic at this moment, into a democratic republic. In that sense we regard Mrs Heinisch's report as very useful. We certainly endorse it and believe that this report, today's discussion and, I hope, the vote in favour will act as a signal in Turkey.</p>

In the meantime other countries have been admitted, but specifically because of its human rights record, Turkey remained excluded. The European Parliament backed that exclusion in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage too, the Social Affairs Committee wonders, to my mind quite properly, whether we should not hold back on budgetary measures for implementation of these programmes until there has been more progress on solutions to the Cyprus and Kurdish questions. After all, our debate a few hours ago on the Kurdish question and the Öcalan affair are proof enough that Parliament still regards the situation in Turkey as highly problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone recognises the value of the programmes as a means of promoting mutual understanding and respect amongst individuals and peoples. But what guarantees do we have that participation in these programmes will be open to young people in Turkey from all the various population groups? I have no illusions about this at all. It would surely be sending the wrong signal if we approved Turkish participation and opened the door now, at this dramatic moment just before the elections. We know very well that a start cannot be made before the year 2000. So why should we start making preparations just as Parliament is pressing Turkey to show some real movement on human rights? We must be logical and consistent and not send out the wrong signals.</p>
<p class="contents">We are basically in agreement with the proposal, but we shall abstain because we think that this is absolutely the worst possible time to be sending out this signal.</p>

However, I have the feeling, with this proposal to admit Turkey to the group of countries eligible for Socrates and Youth for Europe, that Parliament is firstly making itself seriously ridiculous and, secondly, that we are committing an error of principle.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making ourselves ridiculous here in Parliament because for years now, and in any case since the final talks on the Customs Union in 1995, we have been threatening Turkey that there had to be progress on Cyprus or on the Kurdish question, otherwise we would have to see, and Parliament would then block this or that dossier. Well, I should like to know what progress there has been since then, on Cyprus for example. I am not aware of any. Parliament makes itself ridiculous by constantly uttering threats and not following them through.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we are committing a particularly grave error of principle in embroidering further, without protest, on the position of the Council and the Commission and in seeing Turkey as a candidate for membership of the European Union. That is absurd! Historically, culturally and even in purely geographical terms, Turkey is not part of the continent of Europe – or at least only 3 % of it is. Europe is not a product like a soft drink or dog food; unless I am very much mistaken, it has evolved from a social, cultural and historical base.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, and I will end here, Parliament should have the courage to tell our Turkish neighbour that we wish to maintain ties of the greatest friendship and cooperation, but that Turkey is not a European country and so cannot be a candidate for membership of the European Union.</p>

We support this report, perhaps also because we believe that there should be no abstentions when it comes to human rights questions. We must decide for or against, support or impede the process. We think Turkey must be included in the educational programmes because the level of education of a society always has a direct bearing on the progress of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We can and must certainly use every political means of persuading Turkey to become more democratic. But we must not punish the young people for the sins of their political leaders. These leaders will not change their behaviour if we exclude young people from the educational and cultural programmes. Perhaps it is a sign of political intelligence if for once we show the ability to differentiate.</p>

<p class="contents">We cannot, however, refrain from voicing our disappointment that this House is only now being consulted on a proposal which was put forward by the Commission back in May 1996. There can be no denying that this delay has been caused by obstructionism, resistance, hostility and reluctance in various quarters and at various levels, with regard to Turkey's inclusion in the cultural programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Turkish Government, it is maintained, does not yet provide sufficient guarantees regarding human rights. Of course we share this opinion and concern, in spite of the considerable improvements in Turkey's legal order in recent years; our concern is compounded by the continuing affair over the terrorist leader Öcalan and the uncertain and – for us – distressing fate of the Kurdish people.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the European Union cannot penalise Turkey for the reprehensible slowness of its democratisation process by abandoning to dangerous international isolation that very section of the Turkish population which is most sensitive to change and to the basic principles of civil coexistence: I refer to young people, in other words 50 % of the population of this Mediterranean country, since youngsters are the main beneficiaries of the Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes. This rich and opulent Europe, this pacifist Europe – which is as strongly critical in words as the sternest public prosecutor, but timid as a rabbit when it comes to action – already bears the responsibility for not having intervened to prevent the Öcalan case from degenerating. It must not now make itself similarly responsible for preventing Turkish youth from acquiring – by means of cultural exchanges – those values of democracy, freedom, tolerance and justice through which Turkey will soon become a new reference point in the policy of enlarging Europe in the Mediterranean area.</p>
<p class="contents">This at least is our wish, as pro‐Europeans and citizens of the Mediterranean.</p>

It aims to allow exchanges between Turkish and European young people through the Leonardo, Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes. However, it should be pointed out that Turkey"s population, language, culture, religion and history are not European.</p>
<p class="contents">In December 1995 we denounced the agreements on the Customs Union – which were what the United States of America wanted – warning that they were an unacceptable first step towards the integration of a non‐European country into the Union. Now, by extending European youth and education programmes to Turkey, the EU is taking another step down this road.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is also being inconsistent in its relations with Turkey. On the one hand it is concerned about human rights in Cyprus and the rights of the Kurdish minority, yet on the other hand it is aiming to strengthen its political and cultural relations with Turkey. This is a contradiction and is not a serious‐minded or responsible attitude.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">van den Broek, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (NL)</span> Madam President, may I say first of all that I am pleased to see that a large majority of honourable Members are now in favour of admitting Turkey to these Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes. With specific reference to the previous debate and the many earlier debates we have had on the European Union"s relations with Turkey, I would say that I agree with all those who think, despite the many political problems we have with Turkey and our many differences of opinion, that we have to make an effort – precisely towards Turkey"s young people – to develop and strengthen our mutual understanding further and seize the opportunity through these exchange programmes to exchange and share our views on democracy, tolerance and citizenship. Catch them young, as the saying goes, and I am sure that this is true of programmes such as these as well.</p>
<p class="contents">I must also compliment Mrs Heinisch on her report and her perseverance in producing this recommendation, after long discussions in the Committee on Culture, and seeing it supported. I should add that we do not really have any problems with the proposed amendments, although as regards Amendment No 5, which refers to the need to ensure fair representation of minorities – something altogether consistent with Commission policy – we are rather less happy that this may create the impression, when it comes to implementing the programme, that a quota system is to be applied, albeit informally, for the numbers of participants from minority groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We think these minorities must be assured of success without that assurance being introduced into the text in this way by the amendment in question. I hope that the rapporteur and other Members of the House will go along with us on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, decisions on Turkey"s participation in the context of the current proposals do not, as we know, mean that Turkey can take part in the programmes straight away. After discussions with Turkey, a decision has to be taken on the implementing rules, the financial aspects of participation. Parliament will of course be consulted on this. It is already assumed, however, that the new Socrates and Youth for Europe programmes running from the year 2000 to 2004 will include Turkey, and approval of the draft decisions now before us will give the green light for a series of preparatory measures which are absolutely vital if Turkey is to participate satisfactorily in these programmes. Decisions to allow Turkish participation are, I think, one more positive signal from the European Union to civil society in Turkey that the EU is prepared to develop its cooperation with Turkey in certain sectors further. We are hoping for a positive reply and a positive response from the Turkish side.</p>
