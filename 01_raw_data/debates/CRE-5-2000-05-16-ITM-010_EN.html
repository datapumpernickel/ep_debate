<p class="contents">On the first occasion, in December 1998, this report on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars was approved at first reading with 48 amendments. Of those 48 amendments, the Council and Commission accepted some in their entirety and others only in part. The report therefore returned for a second reading.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council had accepted certain amendments which we considered to be important, but there remained certain aspects of the report and the amendments approved unanimously in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy – and by a large majority in plenary session – which we also considered to be important and which had not been accepted. We are basically talking about the inclusion, in this scheme to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from new cars, of lightweight industrial cars, which are used widely within cities and whose carbon dioxide emissions also pollute.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seemed to us that they had not included a guarantee of the quality of data. For a scheme of this nature, rigour and comparability, in terms of the data collected by the governments, are essential.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seemed very important that we maintained something that was traditional in the positions of the Committee on the Environment: a certain degree of precaution in relation to voluntary agreements. If we bear in mind that Community Law – directives and regulations – is often not complied with, it seems to us all the more unlikely that voluntary agreements will be complied with. The Committee on the Environment had little faith in these voluntary agreements and another amendment asked for the establishment of a clear legal framework which would come into play in the event that the voluntary agreements failed.</p>
<p class="contents">They also finally accepted our concern that one of the paragraphs should not only mention the stabilisation of emissions, but also their reduction. Another amendment which we felt was important concerned the dimensions of vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, in total, 10 amendments were approved by a substantial majority in this House and then not accepted by the Council, and we therefore had to embark on this conciliation procedure, which I must point out has been neither difficult nor controversial.</p>
<p class="contents">As its very name indicates, the conciliation procedures require each of the parties to give some ground so that a final agreement can be reached. In this final agreement, our main concerns have been addressed. It includes a study of the future inclusion of lightweight industrial vehicles, the possibility of shortly presenting a proposed legal framework and reviewing the data with a view to making them more rigorous and more or less equivalent in each of the countries. In short, Parliament’s main concerns have been taken up, if not in an immediate and radical manner, at least to the extent that a commitment has been given to adopt decisions on this issue in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The only amendment which was not accepted was the one relating to dimensions of vehicles. Parliament continued to insist that this was very important because the more powerful and larger the vehicle, the greater its level of emissions, and we considered it important that this be included in one of the annexes. However, bearing in mind that another six issues relating to the capacities and conditions of the vehicles have been accepted, we felt that we could not prolong the conciliation process any longer, particularly considering that we want this study on the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from new passenger cars to be implemented immediately in each of the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that this is a reasonable agreement, which is neither Parliament’s nor the Council’s initial proposal. Mr President, I believe that we will have no problem ensuring that this agreement is approved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She really is most persistent, because we had a very good report at second reading as it was, but she was determined to incorporate more proposed amendments and I really must congratulate her on succeeding in doing so. Parliament has asserted itself against the Council once again.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of this sort of monitoring scheme is just one of the many steps on the path towards compliance with the Kyoto protocol. Reducing greenhouse gases by 8% in comparison with 1990 is therefore the main objective between now and the year 2012. The dramatic change in the climate has been noticeable here in Strasbourg over the past two days and is far greater than we assumed. It will therefore come as no surprise if we adopt this report unanimously tomorrow, as will certainly be the case, and that the Council and Parliament have been able to find a common position so quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">This joint monitoring scheme is the first of its kind and I think that its success or failure will decide whether or not we opt to introduce other similar schemes. We have taken recourse to a three-part strategy in order to reduce CO2 emissions and fuel consumption: environmental agreements with the car industry, a system of tax incentives and a system of labelling for fuel consumption and CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">But despite all these efforts, directives and joint measuring schemes, we should not delude ourselves: we are unlikely to achieve the target objective of reducing greenhouse gases to 1990 levels. Some experts are advising us to try and stabilise emissions at present levels. That may well be pessimistic but if we consider that the number of cars on the road is continuing to rise in the 14 Member States, oh excuse me, I meant 15; we Austrians often have to stop and ask ourselves if there are 14 or 15 Member States, but there are in fact still 15, and if we consider enlargement to the east and if we consider that people in China and India also want to live as we do, then we should make no mistake: it will be difficult to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gases or CO2 and we should therefore make every effort to stabilise them at the very least.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the pessimism, introducing a pan-European monitoring system for CO2 emissions will not do any harm. Let us try yet again with one small step at a time and perhaps the House will sit in 2005, when we need to examine the initial results, and complain that perhaps we did not do enough today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nonetheless, once in a while these words of wisdom fit the bill because our CO2 strategy for cars is of course a new departure in that we are trusting in the willingness of car manufacturers in Europe, Korea and Japan to take voluntary technical measures to reduce CO2 emissions from their cars to 140g by 2008, which will represent a reduction of around 25%.</p>
<p class="contents">But we do still need a control mechanism so that we can intervene if necessary. Hence: trust is good, control is even better. We want a statistically perfect control instrument at our disposal and in this respect I thank the rapporteur for her persistence in establishing a reasonable control instrument for CO2 emissions from cars in Europe which applies to all Member States, which clearly shows which vehicles are registered where and what their CO2 emissions are, so that we can see clearly in 2003 if the manufacturers’ undertakings are being respected or not. And if they are not, then we must take legislative measures.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer to another two pillars in our strategy: the question of labelling, which has been dealt with and the question of additional tax incentives for low-consumption vehicles, which is still a somewhat weak point. I think that all of us, especially of course the Member States, need to give clear additional incentives, so that we really can achieve our objective of 120 g in 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since the Rio de Janeiro Conference and then Kyoto, the European Union has always led the political side of the debate on climate change. Nevertheless, although Europe continues to lead the debate in terms of rhetoric, it is beginning to lose the legitimacy to do so in a credible way. It is rather pointless for the European Union to try to alarm the whole world with this problem when, in reality, the European greenhouse gas bubble, in particular the carbon dioxide bubble, is more likely to increase by 6% to 8% than to decrease by the 8% that we agreed in Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore time to take internal action in order to lend credibility to our external efforts. In terms of political action, the transport sector must be our priority for the following two fundamental reasons. Firstly, because, according to the Green Paper published by the European Commission, this sector will not be part of the European trading system for carbon dioxide emissions, and all greenhouse gas reductions will therefore have to be achieved exclusively through national and Community policies and measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, because transport is the sector that is contributing most to Europe’s falling short of the levels set in Kyoto. According to a study recently published by the European Environment Agency, transport is responsible for almost 30% of the European Union’s total emissions, and it predicts that the level of carbon dioxide emissions generated by this sector will increase by 39% of the 1990 level by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this extremely disturbing picture, which shows that road transport is responsible for 85% of total carbon dioxide emissions in the transport sector, and given the overwhelming need for action, the agreement reached in the Conciliation Committee on this system for monitoring CO2 emissions from light passenger vehicles is to be welcomed. This system is a crucial aspect in the implementation of the Kyoto protocol and will ensure rigorous control of the voluntary commitment made by the car industry to reduce carbon dioxide emissions in new passenger vehicles by 25%. I regret the fact that it has not been possible to include light commercial vehicles in this system. In any event, I congratulate Mrs González Álvarez once again on the results she has achieved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, let me just offer her my hearty congratulations on her excellent report and brilliant success, as some of the previous speakers have done. Contrary to some previous speakers, I think it is most important that the report should seek not just to stabilise concentrations of greenhouse gases but to reduce them, especially given the fact that we need to achieve a demonstrable success by 2005 under the terms of the Kyoto protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is fundamental, given the reservation which this Parliament has always expressed in connection with voluntary obligations in environmental agreements, that we have managed to include the passage stating that data will be used from 2003 onwards to monitor the voluntary obligations of the car industry. I also think that it is fundamental – and the scope is not extended by this decision – that we have managed to bring the Commission so far down the line that it is looking into implementing harmonised measurements for the specific CO2 emissions from class N1 vehicles and presenting proposals to this effect. I think that is a huge success. I should like once again to congratulate the rapporteur and vote in favour of this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the co-legislators on their efforts in finding a swift and satisfactory agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The process leading to the approval of this proposal constitutes a prime example of how the two arms of the European legislature can settle their differences and work together towards adoption of sound and effective environmental law. I should like to seize the opportunity to thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and, in particular, the rapporteur, Mrs González Álvarez, for its constructive approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption of this decision will allow the effectiveness of the Community strategy to reduce CO2 emissions from passenger cars to be monitored and, more specifically, it will provide credible data to monitor the implementation of the voluntary agreements with car manufacturers. This strategy is one of the most concrete activities of the Community on CO2 emissions and reductions from the transport sector. Therefore it represents an important milestone in the achievement of the Kyoto target.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
