This execution called forth both protests from around the world and a resolution from this House, which Beijing ignored.</p>
<p class="contents">In January 2003, we made efforts to prevent the execution of his spiritual leader, Lama Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche, and did likewise in November 2004, when the two-year stay of execution expired. Yesterday, in a conversation here in Strasbourg, the Chinese Embassy assured me of the high probability of the death sentence being commuted to life imprisonment. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats regards that statement as a triumph for the many initiatives taken by this House and others. We have never ceased from speaking out and winning support from parliaments and human rights organisations. Again and again, we have urged the Council and the Commission to press a change of course on those in power in China. Our demands are still on the agenda. A new trial is to examine charges of sabotage and involvement in bomb attacks. This trial must be in accordance with the rule of law and monitored by international observers.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, unfortunately, little has changed as regards human rights in China. Bishop Julius Jia Zhiguo, who belongs to the underground church, was recently arrested. It follows that the arms embargo must be maintained. The possibility of his being pardoned opens up a way ahead, and I hope that we will be able to go down it. What we are aiming for, and will continue to aim for, is the recognition of minority rights and the acknowledgement of the right to religious practice. One essential step in that direction would be the stepping up of dialogue with the representatives of the Dalai Lama. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We return today to his case.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a reminder to us all that, even though this is 2005, some people in our world today still cannot practice their religious beliefs without the threat of violence or, in Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche's case, death. Since we last spoke about his case in this House, there have been rumours that his death sentence has been suspended and may be commuted to a life sentence. I am pleased to hear Mr Mann's comments. I suggest that we still urge the Chinese authorities immediately to clarify the situation and urge – as our resolution says – the Chinese Government to commute the death sentence handed down to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche. We should also ask the Chinese authorities further to clarify where Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is being held and whether he is in good health. For the time being, no one knows his exact location.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe this House should strongly support the continuation of the EU embargo on arms sales to the People's Republic of China until such time as the human rights situation has improved and China has taken the vital step of signing the United Nations Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Further to this, we must continue to exert pressure on China to abolish the death penalty and place an immediate moratorium on capital punishment.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be stressing to the Chinese authorities that Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche deserves a fair trial and not a sham trial.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, there are many like Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche out there in our world today who deserve our support and the right to live in a country where religious freedom and human rights are respected. I hope this House can support this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In their dealings with the Chinese authorities, European governments must take very good account of the enormous risks involved in any lifting of the European Union's arms embargo and must deal with the issue of political prisoners and the risk of their being sentenced to death, as in the case we are dealing with of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche. Furthermore, it is urgent that we appoint a European Union special representative for Tibet, in order to demonstrate both the importance of the Tibetan issue within the context of European Union-China negotiations and in order to facilitate the path towards a Chinese-Tibetan dialogue to put an end to the repression suffered by the Tibetan population, religion, language and culture for decades. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an area in the course of colonisation by the Chinese and one where many newcomers fulfil the function of official, policeman or military. Violent means have for many years been used to repress opposition to this humiliating state of affairs. The death penalty, whether to be carried out immediately or delayed, has been used by the Chinese state as a means of quashing the wishes of a large part of the population of Tibet. We in this Parliament, right across the political spectrum, have every reason to be indignant about the death penalty and certainly about its use as a political instrument, and we hope to prevent the execution in two weeks time of a respected and influential Buddhist lama.</p>
<p class="contents">Present day China is akin to South Korea of recent years. In that model, economic growth is paramount, over and above man and the environment. If, on the basis of short-sighted European self-interest, we were to reason in the short term, there would be a considerable temptation to withdraw the criticism we have levelled at China. Indeed, China is the country with the largest population and the faster growing economy. For a century, that country stagnated on account of domestic wars, foreign occupations and idealistic, but ill-considered experiments, and has, internationally speaking, been placed off-side. It now looks as if it will be playing a vital role in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we resign ourselves to the fact that such an authoritative country applies the death penalty, treats its minorities badly, neglects its environment, pays its workers badly, tolerates unsafe living and working conditions and is not a democracy? Or do we in Europe want to promote over there our views about a democratic constitutional state, diversity of political and religious opinions, freedom of association and democratic majority decisions?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Europe must explicitly dare take sides with threatened minorities and movements, which, in future too, must be able to continue to play their role. In their relations with China, the Commission and Council must not work from the assumption that this is a big country with a fast-growing economy, but that this is a country which refuses to release colonised peoples, puts economic growth above anything else and for the rest also violates human rights. Only then can we expect results. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation in Europe today has improved tremendously, although the fact that Mrs Estimirova and Mr Kovalev are present in this Chamber now indicates that much still remains for us to do in Europe in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning once again that Tibet has always been an independent state, which, being naturally cut off from the world, has never had any ambition to conduct any kind of foreign policy. This cannot be taken to mean, however, that China is entitled to declare Tibet part of China, as Tibet is most certainly not part of China. In spite of this, the Tibetan authorities and the Dalai Lama are prepared to hold a dialogue and would be satisfied with mere autonomy. Yet this is the bare minimum due to them, which we must call for on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is to adopt a position on this issue today, and we must call on the Government of the People’s Republic of China to enter into an ongoing dialogue with the Tibetan people and to respect the rights of minorities. We must call, and indeed we are calling, for the death sentence imposed on Tenzin Delek Rinpoche to be lifted, and for him to be released from prison. We are also calling on our institutions to maintain the arms trade embargo against the People’s Republic of China, and not to lift it. The free world has an instrument available to it to prevent tyrants from abusing those subject to such tyrants’ power against their will, and this instrument is appropriate economic sanctions. We must therefore call for our institutions to apply these sanctions, as well as for dialogue to take place between China and the whole of Chinese society, above all the Tibetan people and their representative, the Dalai Lama.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like the President of Parliament to forward this resolution to the European Council, the European Commission, the UN Secretary-General and all those who can bring any influence to bear on China to encourage the country to start respecting human rights. We should not only feel pangs of conscience when a disaster such as the tsunami strikes.

This wise saying must not be misunderstood; it counsels stubborn determination rather than inactivity, and it is when, as sometimes happens, we begin to become resigned to the persistence with which the same human rights issues resurface over and over again, that we must continue to speak out with tenacity and a clear voice; we must be unrelenting in the defence of human rights, whether this be in the face of the Chinese Government or of other regimes that trample these rights underfoot. We must not, though, misinterpret this saying to mean that we should do nothing. We must be impatient when we protest against the large-scale violations of human rights that occur in a country like China, which is such an important partner.</p>
<p class="contents">Our specific concern today is with the fate of a senior Tibetan monk and of a bishop of the Chinese underground church, the brutal persecution of both of whom violates the universally accepted principle of freedom of religion. Let me make it plain to our Chinese partners that it is unworthy of an ancient and highly-developed culture like their own to suppress another – that of Tibet, which is equally ancient and venerable. It ill becomes such an advanced culture to oppress and persecute faith communities such as the Buddhist community and the Catholic Church. China has no need of such a thing, and by doing this it does massive damage to itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans must back up our words with deeds and try to exert pressure to enforce the observance of human rights, even when the state violating them is a large one and an important trading partner, such as Russia in its dealings with Chechnya, and China where Tibet and freedom of religion are concerned. In these matters, we must apply the same standards, rather than condemning the small states while grovelling to the big ones. Only if we do will Europe’s human rights policy remain credible in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has, in particular, urged the Chinese authorities to preserve the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people.</p>
<p class="contents">These issues have also been systematically dealt with in the context of the EU-China bilateral dialogue on human rights. During this dialogue, the EU has regularly brought to the attention of the Chinese authorities, at every session, and most recently in Beijing on 24 September 2004, the situation of individuals who have been sentenced for having expressed their opinion or their beliefs. The case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche is one such case.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of 2004, the EU made an official démarche in Beijing to request information on his whereabouts and state of health, expressed the hope that the death sentence would not be upheld and asked for judicial review of the case. More recently, on 15 November, the EU Troika made a new ad hoc démarche in Beijing, during which the case of Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche was again highlighted.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is fully committed to urging China not to carry out the sentence and is prepared to contribute, in this respect, to finding an acceptable solution to the case under examination. It takes the view that the application of the death penalty to Tenzin Deleg Rinpoche would send out a very negative signal and would have an adverse impact on relations with China. We have just learned that the Luxembourg presidency - and the Commission immediately contacted it - is currently preparing a démarche that would also associate the Commission. The démarche will be sent to China asking it not to administer the death penalty and to re-examine the case.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more general level, the EU has called for years, and will continue to call, as part of its overall policies vis-à-vis Tibet, for the establishment of a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities as the only realistic way of finding a lasting solution to the question of Tibet. In this context, we consider the recent third visit to China of the Dalai Lama’s special envoys to be an encouraging sign of progress.</p>
<p class="contents">In the dialogue with China, the EU has regularly expressed concern over the extensive use of the death penalty. While reaffirming our longstanding position in favour of abolition, we have continued to press hard for at least the introduction of a moratorium. We have also stressed the need to comply, in the fight against terrorism, with the basic principles governing international relations and safeguarding human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly the case if one wants to make progress with partners with whom one has little in common. I therefore accept the fact that, in some way, and even though the parties do not admit it, a deal has been done, one that involves, on the one hand, Iran’s compliance with the IAEA’s (International Atomic Energy Agency) demands on nuclear matters and, on the other, the resumption of negotiations on the partnership and cooperation agreement with the EU, as happened in January.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, however, one area in which no deals can be done, and that is in the field of human rights. Iran may well behave itself where nuclear energy is concerned, but this House, at any rate, will not reward it by turning a blind eye to what goes on there in the area of human rights, and I would also like to remind the Commission and the Council that any agreement has to be approved by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">If the human rights situation continues to develop as it has done so far, I have grave doubts as to whether it will be. Even the UN General Assembly, when it met on 20 December last year, denounced the deteriorating situation in Iran as regards the freedoms of speech, opinion and the media, as well as the arbitrary arrests without charges or court proceedings. It is journalists and those who write for the Internet who are on the receiving end of this sort of treatment, and I have learned from the Observatory for the Protection of Human Rights Defenders that the Nobel Peace Prize holder Shirin Ebadi was yesterday summoned to the public prosecutor’s office in Teheran. The reason for this is not yet known, but my hunch is that this is another case of good old-fashioned intimidation.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from that, it is unacceptable that death sentences should still be being carried out, particularly on juveniles and the mentally handicapped, and there is still no confirmation that execution by stoning is now a thing of the past and will not be revived.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us then send out a clear message that we will not allow Iran to continue with such a policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is not only important in terms of defending our economic interests, but also and primarily in terms of building up networks whereby human rights, peacekeeping, respect for nature, and much else, can be demanded and put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an area in which many delegations from this House are active, and these contacts have enabled us to achieve a great deal. Parliament’s desire to establish and build up inter-parliamentary delegations with Iran in order to enter into dialogue with that country is something to be welcomed. During its preparatory stages, many sensitive issues will have to be addressed and stipulations made. As we have just heard, the Iranian Government has, in recent years, acceded to a number of UN Conventions, including that on the rights of the child, and signed up to the Declaration of Human Rights. Changes have also been made to its penal code, and execution by stoning prohibited, although this ban has been inadequately implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that this list does not include the Declaration on the Rights of Women. In this resolution, we highlight the very large gaps in many areas and the inadequate respect for human rights, with particular reference to the imprisonment of women and to arbitrary arrests. The treatment of journalists also leaves much to be desired, and the situation must be improved as a matter of urgency. What is going on in Iran must be carefully investigated and examined, and so there are two points on which I cannot endorse this resolution, and in respect of which I will be moving an oral amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must clearly express what we think joint cooperation means and stick to our principles, whilst also accepting that Iran has its own structures and must itself decide in what way it is to change, difficult though this may often be for us to understand. The only way for us to change anything is not to pass up the chance of a new start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted to learn of the efforts being made to foster dialogue with it, and of the pressure that the European Union is exerting in connection with the state of human rights there. During the fourth dialogue on human rights between the EU and Iran, held on 14 and 15 June 2004 in Teheran, Iran undertook to improve human rights, and that is a good thing, but we can also see that there is an urgent need that something be done about this, for international organisations estimate that every year still sees between 300 and 400 executions carried out, with some 80 people being flogged and an unknown number stoned to death – all this despite, as you have heard, these things no longer, officially, being in the Iranian penal code. What shows how much contempt a government can have for its own people is the relevant article – no. 119 – from the former Iranian penal code, according to which the stones used at a stoning must not be so large that the condemned person dies from the impact of one or two of them, nor so small that they cannot be described as stones.</p>
<p class="contents">Such a thing is torture, legitimised by the state with the intention of causing death, and it has yet to be demonstrated that it is no longer carried out today, at this stage in the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has also been made to the human rights of juveniles; although death sentences are pronounced on them, the sentence is not carried out until they are 18. That means that minors aged 14 and over can spend up to four years in what are called ‘education camps’, waiting to be executed, instead of being able to have a proper education and a future to look forward to.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard what the UN has had to say on the situation in Iran. I am very glad that the letter sent by the President of this Parliament, Josep Borrell, to the Iranian ambassador has helped to get a stoning, due to be carried out at the end of last year, delayed and the sentence commuted. Let us continue to exert this sort of pressure, for only in that way will we, in the eyes of the world, do justice to our own objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am relieved to learn that the United Kingdom, Germany and France have managed to press on with the negotiations on the atomic energy programme. Above all, I am glad that – as we have just heard – there have been positive responses when we have raised individual cases of grave violations of human rights in Iran. We are evidently being listened to after all, and can hope that our intervention in the human rights sphere can meet with success.</p>
<p class="contents">In this process the European Commission is a partner in negotiation and dialogue, and so it is to them, in the first instance, that I appeal that human rights should not be treated as a secondary issue, but put centre stage in exactly the same way as economic relations with Iran or the issue of how to prevent it acquiring nuclear weapons. I also want to make it clear to our Iranian friends that dialogue and negotiation mean critical dialogue; Iran must listen when we criticise some of the things that go on there and that we cannot accept and never will, such as the maltreatment and oppression of women, the stonings and the executions. I do not see last December’s United Nations resolution as an interruption to this dialogue, but rather as a component of our policy and an admonition to us. It is also, unfortunately, evidence that our concerns about the human rights situation, the restrictions on the freedom of the press and the persecution of journalists are more than justified.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me once again appeal, as a matter of urgency, to the Iranian authorities to do something more than make announcements and instead cancel the stonings, give women real rights in practice, and offer more than lip-service to what this dialogue is about. We are also very concerned about the accusations levelled at the Nobel Peace Prize winner Shirin Ebadi. I believe that not only all Members of this House, but also the Commission’s and Council’s representatives, are making it plain that we expect her good work not to be hampered in any way.</p>
<p class="contents">Although my group will be voting in favour of the resolution, we will be asking for item 9 to be deleted, as this debate is not the place for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason for this, or so we are told, is that Iran has now agreed to allow monitoring by the International Atomic Energy Agency and has put a stop, for the time being, to the enrichment of uranium. I ask myself how it is that Iran’s stance in the so-called ‘nuclear controversy’ can be the only criterion that the Commission considers when deciding to restart the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still serious problems where human rights are concerned, and every one of the European Union’s trade and cooperation agreements contains unequivocal statements on the human rights chapters on which cooperation depends. The Commission’s attitude gives the impression that human rights have, overnight, ceased to be a problem in Iran. This resolution presses home the point that there has been no improvement in the human rights situation in Iran. Sharia law continues to be imposed with its full rigour; executions, stonings, torture and arbitrary arrests continue day by day. The work of human rights activists and journalists has become even more difficult and even more hazardous; the Nobel Prize winner Shirin Ebadi has again been summoned before a court.</p>
<p class="contents">These facts lead me to regard the European Union as acting utterly deceitfully in resuming negotiations with the Iranian Government at this stage. I appeal both to the Commission and to the Council to take their own demands seriously and not to allow themselves to be bought – in the truest sense of the word. Rather than negotiating with Iran on cooperation in economic policy matters, the European Union should be sitting down with those forces that are actually doing something for democracy, to change Iran, to make it democratic. I think that what Mr Gahler came out with was another attempt at coupling one thing with another, so let me ask him, in plain language, to name one country that behaves in the way Iran does. If we are not to suspend trade relations with Iran, with what country does he want us to suspend them? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Public hangings are now an almost daily spectacle, often involving the execution of children, the mentally handicapped and even pregnant women. Six pregnant women have been executed this year alone. Stoning to death, amputation of limbs, floggings and torture are commonplace.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a fascist regime that has made a farce of democracy and has consigned human rights to the dustbin. Only today the Nobel Peace Prize winner has been summoned to the Office of the Public Prosecutor, which is an outrage. I hope you will write to the Iranian Ambassador and object to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Last month, Maryam Rajavi, the charismatic leader of the Iranian opposition movement, came here to the European Parliament in Strasbourg and told us that the solution in confronting this challenge is neither appeasement nor a military invasion. The Iranian people themselves, through their courageous resistance movement, have the capacity to bring about change. But we have to offer them encouragement. So it is vitally important that we support Article 9 of this resolution which would enable us to look again at the EU terror list which, at the insistence of the mullahs, includes the name of the Iranian resistance, the People's Mujahedin.</p>
<p class="contents">As a major US intelligence investigation recently disclosed, there is no justification for keeping the name of the Mujahedin on the EU terror list. Indeed, by agreeing to this demand from the mullahs, we have given them a further reason to impose the death penalty on supporters of the resistance movement. Right now, three men are awaiting execution in Iran simply because they support the People's Mujahedin. They have been accused of no other crimes but, according to the mullahs' website, the death penalty is justified because the Mujahedin appears on the EU terror list. This is the result of our squalid attempts at appeasement and we must do something to stop it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a particularly positive development in the continuing Paris agreement of November 2004 between France, Germany and Great Britain, on behalf of the European Union, and Iran on the moratorium on uranium enrichment and control of Iranian activities in the nuclear sector.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments confirm the international credibility and the huge political potential of the European Union when it acts as one to resolve important international problems through dialogue and political means.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the negative experience in Iraq and in the face of the unilateral philosophy of the United States, the European Union is in a position to formulate its own alternative proposal on international problems, in close cooperation with the UN and its competent agencies.</p>
<p class="contents">The ΕU is Iran's first trading partner, a fact which proves the importance of reinforcing Euro-Iranian relations as a tool in the European strategy for the democratisation of Iran, for respect of its international obligations and for reversing its internalisation and isolation. A balanced policy of, on the one hand, pressure and checks on Iran for the respect of democratic freedoms and human rights and, on the other hand, of incentives to develop relations, is the only effective way of establishing a climate of mutual trust and reversing confrontational outbidding and the unilateral strategic approach to the resolution of regional problems. We must continue to be constant supporters of human rights in Iran, of cooperation with civil society and of dialogue at all levels. Within this framework, the European Parliament must take specific initiatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Like the Council, which adopted conclusions on this issue at the end of 2004, the Commission is of the opinion that little progress has been made in the past two years, despite the commitment made by the Government of Iran to strengthen respect for human rights and promote the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union has decided unanimously to co-sponsor the resolution on the situation of human rights in Iran adopted at the United Nations General Assembly of November 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution expresses serious concern in relation to a number of human rights issues, including the use of torture and other forms of cruel, inhuman and degrading punishment, such as amputation and flogging. At the same time, the resolution recalls the announcement of a ban on torture by the head of the Iranian judiciary in April 2004 and the subsequent passing of related legislation by the Iranian Parliament in May 2004. Those are interesting developments and issues which, together with the recent allegations of torture, warrant being raised directly with our Iranian partners.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is committed to pursuing the human rights dialogue initiated in December 2002, which remains an important channel for dialogue, not only with influential representatives of the judiciary, but also with Iranian civil society. I would also like to highlight the visits undertaken by a number of United Nations special rapporteurs to Iran since our human rights dialogue opened. That is quite remarkable in a country which previously had remained closed to United Nations visits for 16 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to recall that following the positive developments on the nuclear front, the European Union is currently in the process of resuming talks with the Iranian Government on trade, investment and economic issues. These talks will provide an opportunity to highlight once again to our Iranian partners that all the relevant issues – political, nuclear, trade and human rights – are mutually inter-linked.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is in favour of constructive engagement with Iran, but that engagement is not synonymous with acting irresponsibly as regards areas of concern that matter so much to Parliament, the European Union and the world at large. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Cambodia, women are the first to become victims of internal political instability. It is a problem which certainly cannot be solved by a discussion on a Thursday afternoon in the Chamber of the European Parliament, but I should nevertheless like to draw your attention to a broader phenomenon in this part of the world - sex tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about the abuse of children and women, we must have the courage also to talk about men, for it is men who bear special responsibility for this. Tourism is of course a legitimate activity with its own cultural and educational values. But when tourism is abused, it can destroy the morals and culture of many Asian countries, including Cambodia. This is a moral tsunami, resulting mainly in the abuse of young women and even small children through prostitution and people trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">We must continue to address those who are responsible. We must act with resolution. We should persist in confronting all media which are not fighting against the sex industry. The protection of women and children in Cambodia against abuse begins here, with us, in our Member States. The persistence of poverty and the exploitation of people give rise to extreme disquiet.</p>
<p class="contents">Asian women are well aware of their dignity. They wish to support their fundamental cultural values. This awakening is one of the most important signals of our times. But, despite this, poverty and the exploitation of women remain a serious problem throughout Asia. Illiteracy among women is far more widespread than among men and the right to life for female children is subject to far greater risks. The actions of our Member States must above all have regard for the values held by these women and ensure that their cultures are respected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the Chai Hour hotel in Phnom Penh, prostitution was taking place and women and girls were forced to take part in it. On the initiative of the AFESIP organisation, 84 of them were freed and were transferred to that organisation’s refuge. The pimps were arrested in the same operation. According to our information, the next day the criminals were freed without charge and the same type of activity continued to operate in the hotel.</p>
<p class="contents">In the mean time, a violent group broke into the refuge, took away the women and girls and, undoubtedly, put them back to work as prostitutes.</p>
<p class="contents">So the organisations dedicated to protecting sexually-exploited women and girls, such as AFESIP, are seeing the girls they rescue and try to rehabilitate socially being sold back into prostitution. This process involves threats and often violence against the activists who carry out this work.</p>
<p class="contents">In this particular case, I would like to state that the Socialist Group supports, and calls on Parliament to support, the President of AFESIP, Mrs Somaly Mam, who is in great danger and has had to flee her country, having had her life threatened by the mafias who control this criminal business. It should be noted that Mrs Mam has received significant recognition in Spain, France and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">This impunity is the result of the corruption that is generated as a result of the huge financial profits created by sexual exploitation and people trafficking, and what makes this worse for us is that a large proportion of these profits come from sexual tourism by Europeans.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group’s appeal is addressed to the governments of our countries, to tackle sexual tourism and strengthen the fight against the mafias operating within it. We are also addressing our appeal to the Commission and the authorities of the countries in which child and forced prostitution is an everyday reality, such as Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">We should urge them, in their relations with those countries, to become involved in combating this type of activity, amongst other things by supporting the organisations involved in rescuing and rehabilitating the victims. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Cambodia alone, it is estimated that a staggering 8 000 to 100 000 women and children could be caught up in the sex trafficking industry. That is according to a Cambodian Government report. Those figures have increased dramatically since the 1990s.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also estimated that the judiciary fails to convict in 94% of the cases brought to court. Prosecutions need to be increased, but must also result in convictions, meaning that corruption has to be stamped out. Often it is the poor who are convicted – a mother selling her daughter, for instance, to put food on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">According to one Cambodia NGO, the police, military police, army and other state personnel are involved in this trade, and are running or protecting trafficking rings and brothels. Traffickers quite often receive assistance from immigration officials. The EU must work with governments and local and international NGOs to put an end to this trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Cooperation between Thailand, Vietnam, Hong Kong, is absolutely imperative in order to stop the flow of sex workers across borders. We also need education and training for border police. Sex workers should have access to affordable legal advice so as to increase the conviction rate. Regarding HIV and Aids, prevention is also a priority.</p>
<p class="contents">NGOs need increased funding and assistance, not only for these areas, but also to rehabilitate victims. The EU must continue targeting development aid to the poverty-stricken areas of Cambodia so that young women who escape have an actual alternative and are not lured back into the trade through desperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over recent weeks, public opinion around the world has been disturbed by reports in the media according to which child victims of the tsunami are being trafficked. What makes this case in Cambodia all the more disconcerting is the fact that it is only by chance that it has reached the public – us in this House – and is, unfortunately, not unsettling people around the world. Nonetheless, where the worldwide trade in women and children is concerned, it is but the tip of the iceberg. I believe that it shows how prevalent corruption is in Cambodia, that the country’s justice system has not been reformed, and that, no matter what the sex industry is up to, the Cambodian Government should have ensured that the pimps were not, within a matter of days, set at liberty to again be a menace to their victims.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also, though, ask ourselves questions about what lies behind this trade. The constant increase in the number of landless people in Cambodia is contributing to an ever-worsening situation, in that these people have no prospects unless they sell their sons and daughters. This is something we have to denounce; this is where we really have to point out where the problem lies and at last bring the necessary pressure to bear on the Cambodian Government, so that nothing like what has happened there can ever happen again. We also have to voice our concern that the committee that has been appointed may well be a mere formality, a sort of sedative pill to calm down the public and us as well. We therefore hope that the debate in this House will prompt others to bring these crimes more to light and to the attention of the world, and to combat them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it has rightly been said that none of this can be a reason to tolerate or accept what is currently happening there, and before our very eyes. What we see going on is a particularly unpleasant form of contemporary – I refuse to call it modern – slavery, in the shape of the sexual exploitation of this country’s women and underaged children. It is, of course, in the first instance, organised crime in Cambodia that bears responsibility for this to a massive degree, but that responsibility is shared by two other bodies, and so I see items 12 and 13 of our resolution as very important.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, on the one hand, the Cambodian Government itself, which must, at long last, ratify and implement the relevant UN Convention and the relevant agreement on the combating, firstly of trafficking in human beings, and secondly of organised crime. It is we, though, in the European Union, who share responsibility to an equal degree. This trade in slaves could not exist in the absence of a market for them; the demand for them comes not exclusively or principally from Asia, but, to a massive degree and not least, from Europe. For that reason, our responsibility is not only to use our foreign policy, security policy and development policy as a means to the end of doing away with this form of slavery; we must also be unrelenting in using all the means with which we, in Europe, combat cross-border crime and fight for our internal security, to hunt down the operators and organisers of this sort of sex tourism, for if we do not, we will have not the least right to point the finger at others. We must start by discharging our own responsibilities in Europe and then press home the point to our Cambodian partners that this is a fundamental human rights issue and one on which we will yield not an inch, and we must be willing not only to give them massive support in building up their justice system, but also, within the EU, to clean our own house. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dramatic events that can only be described as the unleashing of the elements have however been happening on a day-to-day basis for many years, with such events being primarily a source of physical evil. By way of contrast, a person without a conscience or moral principles may cause much greater harm by insulting the dignity of human beings and making it impossible to live in the fullness of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">We have witnessed both moral and spiritual destruction for many years in the countries of Southern Asia and in Cambodia, the country we are debating today. This destruction can be seen particularly clearly in the treatment of women and young children, who are forced into prostitution, taken away to work in warehouses, factories or on rubber plantations or sold for profit. Such treatment is plainly an insult to human dignity.</p>
<p class="contents">According to overall estimates, over 2 million people are sold in this region every year, and trade in children ranks third in terms of profitability for the criminal world, after drugs trafficking and arms trading. According to such estimates and the UN’s reports, in Cambodia it is particularly difficult to combat the trade in women and children or their sexual exploitation, as both the police and the authorities are corrupt and accept large bribes from rich and depraved tourists. Exploitation of this kind is a barbaric form of modern slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">Over 60% of women and young girls are forced into prostitution, and the majority of them are either infected with HIV or suffering from AIDS. The most obvious cause for this is poverty, or rather destitution, as in this region almost one quarter of the population, a population which amounts for one third of the world’s inhabitants, live on less than one dollar a day. In circumstances such as these, millions of women and children are forced into life-threatening work and tricked with promises of legal employment. This results in their sale and export abroad as slaves. There, they are exploited not only for work, but also for various deviant practices, including sexual practices, paedophilia and child pornography. Another cause is illiteracy and the Communist ideology of the Khmer Rouge, who attempted to build a new society by means of terror, threats and lies, claiming over a million victims in the process. After years under Pol Pot’s rule, both the country and its health service and medical care infrastructures were left entirely destroyed, and millions of children who had lost their parents were left without anything to live on. Unfortunately, over the past few years the state has also moved towards economic liberalism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not insignificant that liberal destruction of the family and the much-lauded utilitarian and hedonistic model of life are characteristic even of those who help humanitarian non-governmental organisations, some of whom accept a shameful form of payment in kind for this help by exploiting women and children sexually. It is for this reason that this House’s resolutions and debates will do little to improve the situation, as even educated people in high-ranking positions mock the sanctity of the human being and the family. It is not only financial aid and the much-praised market economy that are needed, but above all moral renewal and ethical principles. I thank you.</p>

The Commission fully shares the concerns of the Members of the European Parliament about the existence and the extent of human trafficking in Cambodian citizens. It is particularly revolting that the perpetrators of this evil crime focus their attention on the poorest of the poor in one of the least-developed countries of south-east Asia, where the high level of poverty and the limited capacity of the national agencies, as well as local corruption and collusion, make it easier for them to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">These conditions have facilitated the development of trafficking of migrant workers for economic exploitation, the trafficking of women - both inside Cambodia and across its borders - for prostitution, and the trafficking of children for prostitution, begging and illegal adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s cooperation activities in Cambodia are directed ultimately at reducing poverty but are also designed to reflect the EU’s commitment to human rights and democracy, including equal treatment for men and women and the protection of children. More specifically, under the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights, the Commission has already committed almost EUR 1.9 million to UNICEF and Action by Churches Together/DanChurchAid in support of two large programmes to secure legal protection for children in Cambodia, as well as funds to support the development of local human rights NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the Commission’s programming document for the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights for 2005 and 2006 for Campaign 2, called 'Fostering a culture of human rights', for which Cambodia is eligible, it is planned to address the issue of trafficking in children and women. The campaign will also promote the rights of human rights defenders. It will improve the protection of, and raise awareness about, the situation of those who work, at personal risk, to advance human rights through non-violent means, taking into account the recommendations of paragraph 13 of the European Union Guidelines on Human Rights Defenders.</p>
<p class="contents">The Royal Government of Cambodia has recently taken a number of positive initiatives to address the problem, including the signature of memoranda of understanding with Thailand on trafficking in women and children and on the management of migrant labour between the two countries, participation in the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative against Trafficking and the establishment of a Department of Anti-Human Trafficking in the Ministry of Interior in 2002. I very much welcome these important initiatives and I have no doubt that these initiatives will also be welcomed by the Members of this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But the practical realities and the evident difficulty of implementing these measures have been drawn to the attention of all of us by the recent events involving the NGO AFESIP, which has received support from Spain, the UK and the Commission. These events have rightly given renewed concern to all of us. The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation reacted immediately with a statement, calling for a full investigation and for the perpetrators to be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">On 12 December, the government announced the establishment of an inter-Departmental Commission to inquire into the events. The Member State embassies in Phnom Penh and the EC Delegation joined other donors in a further statement to welcome this announcement and to express the hope that the conclusions of the inquiry would be credible and transparent. I can assure you that the EC Delegation to the Kingdom of Cambodia, in collaboration with the Member States' missions in the country, will follow closely the progress of the government inquiry and will continue to report on developments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
