<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corrie (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur</span>.<span class="italic"> – </span>Mr President, Mr Khanbhai sends his sincere apologies for not being here to present his report. Unforeseen circumstances have forced him to return to the UK this evening. I would like to stress that this is his report, and I thank him for his work and his willingness to cooperate with other parties. It is perhaps appropriate that Mr Khanbhai drew up this report, because he was born in Tanzania, where his family have lived for 170 years. He and I have travelled extensively in rural Africa and we share many views on the eradication of poverty in developing countries. It is therefore a pleasure to stand in for him today.</p>
<p class="contents">It is unacceptable that even today, more than one billion people are living on less than a dollar a day in rural areas of developing countries. They have no access to water, sanitation, electricity, health services or education. The poor are hungry, have no jobs, and fear disease. More than 40 years of international aid have not eliminated poverty. Many of these poor countries have huge debts, and their people are worse off than they were 25 years ago when Lomé assistance started. The EU is the largest donor in the world. Why have we not identified the country-specific problems, so that we can focus our aid on attacking the causes of poverty?</p>
<p class="contents">I have been travelling in the ACP countries for over 20 years. The major cause of poverty is the lack of investment in rural areas. We need to invest in helping the rural population to have a stake in their local economies. These people need infrastructure, technical skills for farming and animal husbandry, and vocational training to establish small businesses in the agro-processing, engineering, IT and service sectors. They need the kind of support provided by micro-finance schemes such as the Gramine Bank in Bangladesh, and I strongly support Mr Khanbhai in this matter. A 'bottom-up' approach is the only way to regenerate rural areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Asian countries like China, India and Bangladesh were food-deficient and net importers 20 years ago. Subsidies to farmers, selecting appropriate seed, irrigation, micro-finance for small farmers, establishing food cooperatives and other rural investments transformed the agricultures of these countries. Today, they grow enough food for their huge populations and have surplus for exports. There must be a lesson here.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and the US offer substantial subsidies to their farmers. Without such subsidies, there would be no economic prosperity in countries like Spain, Portugal, Ireland, Italy and France, which have all benefited from European subsidies. Without investment in Europe's rural infrastructure, the EU would not function as it does today. Sadly, international aid for rural areas in sub-Saharan countries has dropped from EUR 14 billion in 1988 to EUR 8 billion in 1998. This has resulted in a sharp decline in food production. It has been aggravated by natural disasters, both drought and floods. A decade of famine and malnutrition has precipitated disease, fear, social tension and civil war in many poor countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU needs to encourage land reform, the efficient and fair utilisation of water resources and the transfer of technology for the rural populations of poor countries. We need to teach them to grow their own food, create their own employment and sustain their own economies. The poor do not wish to beg for life; they value their self-respect and dignity in the same way as we do. They do not want our fish. They need to learn how to fish and feed themselves. I agree with Mr Khanbhai that this is the spirit within which the EU should reassess its policy on aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Agriculture, agrarian reform and rural economic development should be top priority areas for EU assistance. This will help production, employment and the sustainable management of natural resources in developing countries, enabling the poor to be self-reliant and break their dependence on our aid. I hope that the House will accept this report. Mr Khanbhai has agreed to over 75 per cent of the amendments that have been tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Poverty and food insecurity in developing countries will not be eradicated without substantial investment in rural areas. The Commission fully shares the main thrust of the report on the importance of rural and agricultural development for poor people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond rural development, the report also addresses issues related to EU trade and agricultural policy. It underlines the importance of improving trade opportunities for the rural poor, which we fully share. In this respect, the World Summit on Sustainable Development reconfirmed the commitments made in the WTO Ministerial Declaration in Doha – the so-called Doha Development Agenda. These include taking into account the specificity of developing countries in the trade negotiations and putting in place flanking measures such as capacity building and trade-related technical assistance. The Commission has recently sent to the Council and Parliament a communication that will provide the policy framework for this type of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to highlight the positive trade agenda promoted by the European Union and adopted in Johannesburg to complement the WTO process. It is also worth recalling that the Union is committed to providing to least-developed countries, through the 'Everything but Arms' initiative, full duty-free and quota-free access to the European market. We hope to see similar initiatives adopted by other developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards agriculture, the Commission supports the emphasis on the multifunctionality of agriculture, a concept of particular relevance for developing countries. However, I would like to draw your attention to the reference made in the report to the dumping of European agricultural production. The Community provides an export refund, which reduces the difference between the higher Community price and the world price. Technically that cannot be called dumping. Ceilings on export subsidies, in quantity and value, are regulated by the WTO, and these ceilings have been reduced between 1995 and 2000. The Community has constantly reduced its use of export refunds, beyond WTO obligations. These positive efforts should be recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">But rural development is the main focus of the report. For many donors, including the European Commission, rural poverty is a multidimensional issue. To address it, it is necessary to combine interventions at different levels. At national level, we need to improve incomes, reduce inequality in access to productive assets and services, combat the degradation of natural resources and reduce vulnerability to risk. At an international level, we need to improve the coherence between developed countries' domestic policies – in particular trade and agriculture – and their development objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">In developing countries, addressing such a complex set of issues requires coherent and balanced national strategies tailored to local needs, resources and institutional settings. Although there is no 'one size fits all' solution, the Commission, in its recent communication, 'Fighting Rural Poverty', has identified some key principles to be applied in all rural development interventions. They include the importance of promoting gender equality, maximising the impact on poverty, supporting national strategies and the participation of stakeholders, as well as mainstreaming environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for pro-poor land reforms, capacity-building, improved access to financial services, agricultural research, infrastructure and services are all areas whose importance is underlined in the Commission strategy and in which the Community's development programme is heavily involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Commission also broadly shares other, more specific recommendations, such as the importance of supporting the development of arts and crafts, rural training centres and domestication of wildlife. However, the level of priority of such interventions depends on local circumstances and on their relevance for poverty reduction. Support for such activities will therefore have to be addressed on a case—by-case basis and in line with the priorities defined in national strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">Rural development is also primarily about decentralisation and local governance. Resources will only reach the rural poor if they can be managed effectively and planned in a participatory way, with the active involvement of local communities. The most disadvantaged sections of societies – particularly women – must be effectively represented and participate in these processes. Reinforcing and democratising local institutions is a key challenge for governments and donors alike. The report rightly emphasises the importance of good governance for the sustainability of all development efforts.</p>

Agriculture and rural development are of central importance in the EU and developing countries alike. That is why I support and welcome the fact that 'food security and sustainable rural development strategies' is one of the six priorities listed for EU development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The multifunctional agricultural model and its underlying philosophy is, I believe, also the only right way forward for developing countries. We should continue to support the approach of making sustainable management one of the non-trade concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me remind you that the EU is by far the world's largest importer of agricultural products from poor countries. The Commissioner has already pointed out that the EU has substantially increased market access for the poorest countries in recent years. I hope that other industrialised countries will also follow the EU's example. The agripolitical measures in the developing countries should not focus exclusively on exports, but must above all guarantee the food security of the domestic population.</p>
<p class="contents">The war on poverty must continue to be the overriding aim of development policy. An important precondition for this is to improve the infrastructure for supplying energy, for transport, for water supply and distribution and for health and education. Above all, however, improved governmental and administrative systems as well as democracy and the rule of law are necessary, as has already been said, to enable robust policy-making. Appropriate land reform and access to water and productive resources can enable the rural population to increase their standard of living and help to boost economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">To support the process of building appropriate capacities in the developing countries, the European Community should provide more technical help for farmers and also pass on technical know-how, for example on renewable energies and in many other areas. A further essential aspect is, in my view, policy in rural areas, so as to stop migration to the slums, and it is also important that there be proper recognition of the work carried out by women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, as other speakers have said, the European Union and its Member States have a very important role to play. I think we need to show much more understanding of the real reasons for the so-called urban drift from rural areas and of the effect of the systems and structures which conspire to destroy the livelihoods of millions who live by the land.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is, of course, part of the solution. As the biggest trading block, we have an important role to play. I have to say that it is sheer hypocrisy to continue to protect our own agricultural competitive position with higher resources, while at the same time forcing developing countries to liberalise. Rapid opening of their markets threatens food security and sustainable livelihoods in developing countries. The parallel negotiations which will be going on at the WTO and between the ACP and the European Union must be used as an opportunity to show that the European Union clearly understands that trade and market access and tariff levels are directly and inextricably linked to our understanding of how we meet those critical millennium development goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The paradox is that, in a time of global plenty, farmers in developing countries are abandoning the land and agriculture. They simply cannot compete with heavily subsidised food flooding into their markets and dumped on their markets. The report describes the effect of the dumping of milk on Jamaica and the dumping of beef on West Africa. In Uganda, for instance, the coffee growers are suffering enormously. One hundred and fifty Ugandan shillings are what a grower gets for a kilo of the coffee he grows. If you go down to the Sheraton in Kampala, you pay one thousand Ugandan shillings for one single cup of coffee.</p>
<p class="contents">With growers receiving such a poor reward for their efforts, it is not surprising that Oxfam describes this as a situation that affects health and education and the whole rural community.</p>
<p class="contents">So small farmers from Haiti to Mexico and Mozambique to Tanzania are simply selling up and selling out. They are unable to compete with the rich agricultural barons. That is the reality we are facing, one which Mr Khanbhai deals with very well indeed. He also gives us a very timely reminder in his report that 75% of the 1.2 billion living on less than one dollar a day are in rural areas. That certainly is a call to action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They often have great potential in this area. Ambitious agricultural reforms are or ought to be dedicated to this. The main issue, however, concerns these countries’ self-sufficiency in food. This is why, from the outset, I wish to support my group’s call for the right to food sovereignty, in other words, people’s right to define their own policy, to be recognised in a specific United Nations convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing countries are often restricted to exporting a few unprocessed products. All the evidence suggests, however, that specialising in exports of raw materials is relatively unprofitable and weakens economies by making them subject to the whims of world markets. Furthermore, the destruction of traditional food-producing farming caused by single-crop farming for export does not benefit anyone apart from huge multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above this, as the report quite rightly states, unbridled global free trade has devastating effects on the agriculture of the South. The opening up of agricultural markets forces farmers to produce at prices set by the international market. These are so low that they allow neither the farmers of the North nor those of the South to produce in a way that respects the environment and at the same time to earn enough money to support their families.</p>
<p class="contents">Given these circumstances, as one NGO working in Burkina Faso has expressed it, how can we persuade people that international trade is the key to development in the countries of the South? The countries of the North have always protected their agriculture. Why should a system that has worked well and which is still working well for the North no longer be good for the South? Should the opening up of the markets, therefore, benefit the peasant farmers or the multinationals that are buying up the banana plantations of Cameroon or Côte-d'Ivoire, for example?</p>
<p class="contents">Enabling developing countries to safeguard their basic right to food security and to the survival of their farming methods therefore requires clear principles to be brought to international negotiations, starting with the recognition, by the WTO, of the need for preferential and differentiated treatment for developing countries, which must be interpreted with this aim in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we are concerned, the European Union cannot continue, on the one hand, to call for the development of the countries of the South and, on the other, to uphold an agricultural policy which ruins much of their efforts in this sector. There is now, therefore, an undeniable need to speed up the elimination of export subsidies granted by the Union, and we must also condemn the major increase in subsidies for agriculture determined by the US agricultural guidance law, with subsidies of around USD 180 billion over ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, the EU ought to play a much more active role in ensuring that fair prices are set on the world market and thereby prevent the deterioration of trade terms. The burden of debt also contributes to an increase in export crops in order to obtain the currency needed to pay back this debt. Its cancellation, therefore, remains more topical than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, and on this note I shall conclude, with regard to aid, investment must be made as a matter of urgency in human resources and infrastructures, especially in transport. It is also crucial to preserve water and biodiversity as public commodities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposed enlargement of the European Union reminds us of the inequalities between existing Member States and the applicant countries of Central and Eastern Europe. While I am not suggesting that our efforts should be concentrated on assisting these countries in preference to Third World countries, the more we consolidate the economies, particularly the agricultural economies of the proposed new Member States, the more successful we will be in achieving our goal for Third World development.</p>
<p class="contents">It does no harm to remind ourselves – and I do not say that for any selfish reason – that the EU's commitment to sustainability of family farming, both in existing Member States and for new entrants, is facing considerable difficulties. While the Commission proposals for a further reform of the CAP are likely to be more compatible with Third World development needs, I fear that our aspirations to protect Community farmers, particularly those on the margins, are not going to be easy to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that 1.2 billion people living in the rural areas of developing countries live in poverty is a shocking indictment of the developed world, but equally the long-term development and sustainability of Third World economies depend on our efforts and – hopefully – success in helping them to develop and add value to their natural resources, with corresponding measures to assist with market access for their products. It should not, however, go unnoticed that the EU is the world's largest food importer, with 53% coming from developing countries thanks to the CAP compatible trade concessions.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Parliament's Committee on Agriculture's viewpoint that uncontrolled free world trade has had devastating effects on the development of food crops in developing countries and their entitlement to protect producers by tariff barriers. As regards agricultural and rural development, the EU and developing countries have the same objective of developing a multifunctional form of agriculture with increasing emphasis on rural development and the sustainability of rural communities. It is wrong to place all the blame for the problems of developing countries on the common agricultural policy, particularly for the reasons I have stated.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the continuing access of products from developing countries to Community markets but believe the transition must be gradual and carefully planned in tandem with CAP reform. I abhor the term 'dumping' in so far as it refers to food produced in excess of market requirements. It makes no sense to overproduce a food product for which there are no consumers and even less sense to offload that product in a manner which disrupts the agricultural economy of developing countries. Farmers and processors must be discouraged from seeking over-access to the markets of developing countries as a substitute for poor marketing and product diversification within the Community or other developed economies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make three observations about this well-balanced and explicit report.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, a proper anti-dumping policy is necessary in order to bring about more reasonable world market prices. Dumping product surpluses onto world markets at extremely low prices in many cases makes world market prices drop to very low levels. This makes it almost impossible for farmers in poor countries to participate independently in world trade at market prices.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is, however, still guilty of dumping in return for export subsidies. These subsidies account for 8% of the agricultural budget, which runs to EUR 40 billion. The rapporteur ought to have highlighted the abolition of export subsidies more clearly.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the situation for poor countries can be improved by giving them greater access to the European market for products that are essential to them. Access to the European market is hindered by tariff barriers and, more particularly, by non-tariff barriers such as health and environmental requirements. Increased access is especially crucial for countries that are only active in one product category, such as bananas, sugar or cotton. The rapporteur recognises the need to diversify exports and indeed makes practical suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the trading position of poor countries is helped most by targeted development cooperation. The report correctly refers to the need for facilitating support. Structural aid for basic infrastructure comes primarily from the Member States. The report should therefore leave the setting of priorities with regard to spending this money to the donors and recipient countries themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, the report contributes towards achieving a productive relationship between the agricultural sectors of Europe and the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report contradicts itself on this matter, predicting devastating effects of free trade which I am sure will not come to pass in the agricultural sector, but the central concern, which, I repeat, has been mentioned several times in this evening’s debate too, is – and, at European level, must be – the barriers which the European Union continues to erect to<span class="bold"> </span>access of goods, including agricultural produce, from developing countries. We must bear in mind that farm subsidies in wealthy countries amount to USD 350 billion per year, which is seven times more than the USD 50 billion which the same countries appropriate each year to external aid. In this connection, we could recall what Oxfam pointed out too, namely that, in actual fact, thanks, purely, to trade barriers, the aid we give to a continent such as Africa, for instance, is less than the value of the trade opportunities we provide for these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two things I would like to say to the European Commission. I believe that we need to reflect on the characteristics of an agricultural policy which would be sustainable for the developing countries and, therefore, on the fact that the Community agricultural policy is unsustainable. I believe we must start to take the line that the CAP has to be abolished, albeit gradually, for there are no longer any economic, social, national, European or international grounds for preserving the CAP system. The reform proposal put forward by the Commission is inadequate in this sense, for it preserves the amount of aid completely intact. The report helps us to understand the devastating impact of this on the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned the Everything but Arms initiative, and rightly so, but I would like to remind her and the House as a whole that the Everything but Arms initiative itself provides for the deferral of the definitive abolition of tariffs on three major products – bananas, rice and sugar – to 2009. I feel that this does us no credit at all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite the moderate tone of the report, he makes some criticism of the European Union and the CAP, which I feel is, in some cases, unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the report does not acknowledge the fact that the EU is today the largest market in the world for agri-food products from the poorest countries. We need only remember that the EU is the world’s largest importer of agricultural products and that imports from developing countries stand at more than EUR 27 billion per year, in other words, more than all imports from these countries bought by the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Canada and Australia put together.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU and its Member States are by far the largest supporters of these countries, providing, for example, around USD 28 billion of development aid, compared to the USD 11 billion provided by Japan or the USD 9 billion from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should remember that, in negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, it is the European Union that has pushed hardest for positive discrimination in favour of developing countries and that it is the EU that is responsible for the most important initiative for the world’s 50 poorest countries: the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative, which proposes allowing the main products of these countries onto the Community market free of any tariff and without these countries having to accept any reciprocal measures in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to point out that, fundamentally, farming in the EU complements farming in developing countries, since these are major importers of products from temperate zones, whereas the European Union is a major importer of tropical products. The conflict is often seen more from the point of view of the interests of certain companies operating in these countries than from the point of view of the interests of local communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The numerous amendments, which the rapporteur has shown flexibility in accepting, mean that we are faced with an acceptable and balanced motion for a resolution. But there are principles that we should take more account of when assessing the different policies of the European Union and also, of course, Community agricultural policies.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, for many years the Socialists, when judging any Community policy, have used the yardstick of what that policy offered in terms of social cohesion. To this end a particular policy was considered by us to be positive insofar as it offered added value in terms of the cohesion of our societies and negative insofar as it increased inequalities between the Europeans. Well, in the global world we are becoming involved in it is clear that solidarity cannot be an exclusively internal, or intra-European, value. And therefore, every Community policy deserves our support insofar as they contribute not only to social cohesion within our borders but also to reducing inequalities at world level.</p>
<p class="contents">For us, the common agricultural policy was something to be welcomed, since it supported our farmers, so that they would not be left behind in a process of prosperity which was benefiting other sectors of society. But, later on, when it comes to evaluating the Community’s agricultural policies, it will not be sufficient to measure whether they contribute to maintaining or improving the situation of our farmers and breeders. Furthermore, we should consider whether subsidies to our producers also contribute to improving the situation in the Third World, or whether they actually devastate it, increasing the chasm separating it from our developed world. In this case, those policies will not be acceptable and, however difficult the exercise will be, others will have to be found which are good, fair and provide a balance for the North, while being good and fair for the South, and providing a balance in terms of relations between the South and the North.</p>

The salient features of this report are a hypocritical interest in the people and farmers of developing countries, wishful thinking and contradictions and its ultimate purpose is to offer those responsible for the problem an alibi so that they can continue with the very policy which is exacerbating the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of the proposed draft is to resolve the food security problem and it sets an interim date of 2015 for halving the number of people forced to live on a dollar a day. This objective is cancelled out by CAP reforms, which cut Community agricultural output in order to bring it into line with the international market, as defined by the WTO rather than mankind's food requirements. Why? Because, according to the prevailing view in the European Union, food is not a commodity that meets various needs, it is a commodity that guarantees huge profits for the food industry and multinationals.</p>
<p class="contents">With its endless reforms of the CAP, the European Union is becoming more and more product-deficient, ruining farmers and, at the same time, forcing developing countries, with extortionate agreements and price mechanisms, to sell their agricultural produce at knock-down prices, tightening the noose around the neck of their people and protecting the multinationals' profits.</p>
<p class="contents">The solution is not to abolish subsidies in developed countries, ruining their farmers and bringing them into line with farmers in developing countries, but to maintain a parity in international trading relations between developed and developing countries in practice, so as to improve their standard of living, reduce their foreign debt and increase their overall domestic output. The wishful thinking and contradictions in the report reach the height of hypocrisy in the proposal to fund genetically modified crops for developing countries, to be supplied by various multinationals and never mind the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">We know from experience that famine is a political and social problem, not a technical problem. We have the productive potential and wherewithal to feed the entire world and still take care of the environment and public health, but not under the current social system, by which I mean the prevailing capitalist system.</p>
<p class="contents">This report keeps to the standard formula and offers no positive suggestions to mitigate the global food problem. On the contrary, the measures it proposes will exacerbate the problem, which will be compounded by serious risks to the environment and public health and the dependency of developing countries on multinationals in the developed world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Souchet (NI).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, of the world’s six billion inhabitants, more than 800 million today suffer from malnutrition and of this figure, three-quarters live in rural areas; poor peasant farmers who are poorly equipped and have no market on which to sell their goods and who therefore restrict their production to their own consumption needs. It is crucial to understand that the majority of those going hungry are not city-dwellers who can buy food but rural producers of food crops. It is, therefore, the fall in the price of farm produce that is leaving the third world hungry. Only access to the markets at reasonable prices can provide these poor peasant farmers with a sufficient income to modernise their production, buy tools and gain access to chemicals, to irrigation, and to better seeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The countries that have been most successful in staving off famine, particularly India and China, are those that, as a result of policies supporting agricultural prices, subsidies for chemicals and for transport and irrigation infrastructures, have enabled their farmers to access their own internal market and thereby increase their buying power, their productivity and their production. On the other hand, the countries in which famine has spread are those in which the fall in agricultural prices has thrown peasant farmers into poverty, destabilising marketing networks, and has forced many of those living in rural areas, oppressed by poverty, towards ill-equipped suburbs or into emigrating.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial that we halt the fall in agricultural prices. Access to a profitable local market is the primary right of any agricultural producer, the primary condition for growth in agricultural production and a prerequisite for eliminating hunger from the world. We must give up on the crazy Utopian idea of making the planet one immense borderless market. It makes no sense at all to attempt to pit a peasant farmer in Chad against a farmer in Minnesota or an Andean shepherd against a large New Zealand landowner . Countries which act as propagandists for this single world market, not least those that are members of the Cairns group, are not countries suffering from famine, but countries which, as a result of particularly low production costs, huge areas of farmland, low wages and top-rate agricultural investment are capable of ruining the farming of those countries that do not share these advantages.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the policies maintained by the European Union, there are three conclusions to be drawn. First, the agricultural development projects that we fund in the developing countries must all contain a section for assistance for the marketing of food produce. Second, we must help developing countries, or groups of countries with similar production costs, to protect their domestic markets against dumping prices set by the world market, by means of instruments without which their producers would face ruin. Third, we must bring all our influence to bear on international trade negotiations to ensure that the right to agricultural exception, i.e., a nation’s right to protect the farmers that provide its food, is recognised.</p>

As a member of Parliament's ACP delegation, I have been concerned with this issue for years. Sustainable agricultural policy, land reform and rural development are important political challenges with a view to the developing countries being entirely independent. Why, with our considerable financial aid, have we not been able to make a more decisive contribution to improving the situation in the poorest countries? I constantly ask myself what Europe is doing wrong. What are the rich countries doing wrong, but also what do the poor countries gain by stepping up their own efforts? I think that we will have to get much tougher on these issues because we can see – and have examples to prove it – that the world population is not prepared to put up with this injustice any longer. As European politicians working on agriculture, we know only too well that the European Community's common agricultural policy regularly comes in for harsh criticism for the impact that it has on agriculture in the poorest countries and this has again been the case this evening in a number of contributions to the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, however, that the critics often think that the answer is too easy, because it is wrong to think that a greater opening up of trade will inevitably lead to better development of the food sector in the developing countries. Many have said it: the EU is already the largest importer of food in the world and against this background the agricultural problems in the vast majority of developing countries will not be resolved solely by more intensive trade and agricultural deregulation. It is actually wrong – and here too I am addressing Mrs Kinnock – to call for total liberalisation and an abandonment of national quotas in developing countries. This would lead to merciless distortions of competition, which small farmers would have absolutely no chance of withstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, allow me to mention three facts: we need production for domestic consumption and for export on the basis of a reformed system of land tenure; we need better employment; we need sustainable management and we should consider new ways forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate will continue, and we have only touched upon these most sensitive and important issues. Agricultural reform, as outlined in the review, goes in the right direction, but that will certainly not be enough in the long run.</p>
<p class="contents">I was happy to see that the fight against poverty was at the forefront of the World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg. That will help our forthcoming discussions. This report provides valuable input in the implementation stage and in the follow-up to the summit, as does the communication on rural development presented by my colleague, Mr Nielson.

<p class="contents">The CAP must be revised in this area by including all the measures that are likely to enable these countries to develop a competitive agricultural industry with respect to production costs, and also product quality. We will therefore ensure respect for the environment so that its degradation does not lead to the degradation of farmland, particularly compared to intensive farming, the intensive use of chemical fertilisers and pesticides, the pollution of agricultural produce by GMOs. We will therefore be able to safeguard a healthy and organic production. Particular attention will be paid to these issues, especially by means of collaboration with the common research centre.</p>
