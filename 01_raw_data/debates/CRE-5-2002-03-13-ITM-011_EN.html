<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Situation in Chechnya</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is now over a year since the European Parliament last debated the situation in Chechnya. On that occasion it spoke of the issue of 'grave and large-scale violations of international humanitarian law in Chechnya'. In mid-January 2002, the Council of Europe adopted a resolution making it clear that the situation has not improved over the past year. What diplomatic steps does the Council intend to take vis-à-vis the Russian Federation in order to help bring about an immediate ceasefire and the withdrawal of all (!) military forces from Chechnya? Is the Council insisting that diplomatic negotiations be entered into with the lawfully elected President Maskhadov under the aegis of the OSCE? Is the Council urging that the presence of journalists and international humanitarian organisations be authorised in Chechnya, with guarantees of their safety and independence? And is it pressing for action to be brought against those that have committed crimes against humanity during the conflict in Chechnya? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Miguel,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, the situation in Chechnya is still very worrying for the European Union. Recent reports by the OSCE Assistance Group in Chechnya, by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and by two NGOs (Memorial and <span class="italic">Médecins sans Frontières</span>) demonstrate that the situation in this part of Russia is still dramatic.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this and other reports, the European Union has raised the issue with the Russian authorities in all the political dialogue that has taken place recently and will continue to do so. This is no surprise, since the European Union has repeatedly spoken out clearly against any violation of human rights and on the situation of the refugees and internally displaced people in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, the Union has adopted a coherent position in principle which makes it very clear to Russia that, while the upheaval in Chechnya continues, the Union will continue to apply firm pressure for a change to come about, taking every possible opportunity and also turning to the relevant international organisations. However, I believe that it would be misleading to say that nothing has happened throughout the whole of last year. The question refers to Resolution 1270 of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe which says that, while it has been frustratingly slow, some progress has been made thanks to positive changes of attitude now visible within the Russian Federation in relation to dealing with the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">As an example of this change, we have heard statements from President Putin to the effect that members of the Russian armed forces who do not respect human rights will be tried and punished. The Union is pleased with this statement and hopes that the Russian authorities will fulfil their commitment and prevent any further violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It has always been understood that the fight against terrorism and extremism should take place within the framework of the Rule of Law and with full respect for human rights. The indiscriminate use of force will only serve to fan the flames of conflict for many years to come. At the same time, it is clearly necessary to maintain stability in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council absolutely agrees that only a political solution can resolve the Chechen conflict. It understands that the Russian authorities have tried to reach an agreement with representatives of Maskhadov, but that unfortunately these efforts have not been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union will not miss any opportunity to insist on a political solution and, for its part, the OSCE is still playing a useful role through the presence of its Assistance Group.</p>
<p class="contents">The security and independence of journalists are issues of great concern to the European Union, which has recently reiterated its views on the situation of the media in Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has also been very active in terms of achieving the presence of international humanitarian organisations in Chechnya and, by means of ECHO (the European Community Humanitarian Office), it has directly participated in humanitarian aid as one of the principal donors since the start of the Chechen conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has periodically dealt with the problem of security with the Russian authorities and recently a Commission official travelled to Chechnya to assess the current situation on the ground and the Union’s troika is planning another visit to the region on a Head of Mission level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in relation to the prosecution of those people who have violated human rights, the European Union would point out that the Court of Human Rights in the Hague is now involved in several cases. The Court will set a date in the coming months to study the admissibility of some of these cases. Naturally, the European Union intends to follow these events closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have taken note of the Council’s statement that it will continue to discuss the situation in Chechnya during all meetings with Russian authorities. I would also expressly like to thank the President of the Council for his condemnation of all human rights violations and for the fact that he calls for change, and continues to do so. In addition, I thank the President of the Council for confirming once again that a political solution alone can end the Chechen conflict. He also states that the European Union will seize every opportunity to achieve this political solution, and he rightly refers to the contacts between the Russian government and the government of the Chechen President, Mr Maskhadov. It is clear that these talks deserve a helping hand, but Mr President of the Council, I am a little disappointed with your very diplomatic use of language. It is evident that the contacts with the Russian government will be stepped up in the weeks to come. The Russian Prime Minister will be visiting Brussels during the EU Summit at the end of May; I should like to ask you what concrete initiatives you will take in order to translate the fine declaration of intent, which you gave today, into action? This is my specific, supplementary question. Thank you for your response. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Major reports have appeared in our newspapers which indicate that Russian military death squads are operating in Chechnya and that one village turned to the United Nations for help as it had been visited a total of 33 times for "cleansing operations". I urge you to ensure that an EU delegation should inspect the position in Chechnya on the ground and check what is actually happening there, because journalists can still only visit if accompanied by officers.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Spanish Presidency's measures against opponents of globalisation</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Spanish Government has reportedly formed special police rapid-response units to prevent anti-globalisation movements from demonstrating as planned in various Spanish cities during the Spanish Presidency. At the same time, personal data are being compiled on anyone who took part in similar demonstrations in other European cities. These data are being collected with the cooperation of several Member States' police forces, while the Spanish security forces have been monitoring the websites of anti-globalisation movements for months.</p>
<p class="contents">Can the Council confirm this information? Can it guarantee that personal data concerning Union citizens will be protected and that there will be no obstruction of the freedom to express political opinions in the European Union?</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Position of the Spanish Presidency on demonstrations</span></p>
<p class="contents">A memorandum of 29.1.2002 from the Spanish Presidency to the Council's Working Party on Terrorism proposes drawing up, on the basis of a Council Decision, a standard form for the exchange of information concerning acts of terrorism committed during EU summits or other events convened by international or Community organisations. The perpetrators of such acts are organisations which, although being legal, in the estimation of the authors of the memorandum, commit acts outside the scope of their declared activities, thus indirectly aiding terrorist organisations to achieve their objectives. They also consider that such 'manipulation' poses a serious threat which may increase considerably in the immediate future. According to the memorandum, the Presidency's proposal is a very useful tool for preventing and, when deemed necessary, repressing outbreaks of violent 'youth radicalism' in major cities. Since such 'analyses' and proposals are questionable to say the least and totally contrary to the fundamental right of freedom of expression and the right to demonstrate, will the Council state its official position on this matter? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In relation to data protection, the 1981 Council of Europe Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data has been ratified by all the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions adopted by the Council and the representatives of the governments of the Member States of 13 July 2001, relating to security at European Councils and similar events, indicated the European Union’s objective, which was to maintain and develop the Union’s status as an area of freedom, security and justice. In this field, the citizens must have the right to freely express their opinions and to meet in a peaceful way, as laid down in the European Convention on Human Rights, and to do so free from any threat to their security, to other citizens or to property.</p>
<p class="contents">The same conclusions stressed the importance of constructive dialogue between organisers of public demonstrations and the authorities of the country in question, as well as the importance of maintaining close international contacts, particularly between police and customs authorities, in order to ensure that legitimate demonstrations are not taken advantage of or abused in order to commit acts of collective or individual violence.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Mr Papayannakis, I will say that the preparatory bodies who are examining his question met in January and in February and worked as laid down in the Treaty, that is, respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms.

<p class="contents">Firstly, in relation to the Action Plan, the Council would remind the honourable Member that in the Resolution which it adopted on 14 May 2001 on the programme for action and the speeding up of the fight against HIV (AIDS), malaria and tuberculosis in the context of a reduction in poverty (document 8495/01), the Council explained the actions it considers essential in the fight against these three diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">The actions include, firstly, access to pharmaceutical products and, in particular, the flexible application of the ADPIC (Trips) agreement in relation to intellectual property, which allows us to confront public health problems, amongst other things, through the discretionary power to grant obligatory licences in certain exceptional circumstances, including those involving the protection of public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is a question of strengthening and increasing the financial contributions in the field of research and development. It is particularly important both to increase the capacity of the developing countries and to offer incentives for the development of specific universal public services, such as new treatments and vaccines.</p>
<p class="contents">Another action is the participation in world associations. The objective consists of strengthening the cooperation agreements amongst the Member States with the WHO, the UNO (AIDS), the World Bank and other international actors in both the private and the public sectors, for example, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI).</p>
<p class="contents">The Council wishes to stress that that Resolution was presented at the 26th Special Sitting of the General Assembly of the United Nations which took place in New York on 25 to 27 June 2001, during which the European Union actively participated in the drawing up of the final declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, with regard to the World Fund for Fighting AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Council would remind the honourable Member of the European Parliament and Council Decision adopted on 6 December 2001, on the European Community contribution to the World Fund for Fighting HIV (AIDS), Tuberculosis and Malaria. In accordance with that decision, the Commission will contribute EUR 600 million to that world fund for 2001, which will be paid within the framework of a funding agreement to be reached between the Commission and the World Bank. That Decision also stipulates that in 2002 the Commission must present the European Parliament and the Council with a first report on the management and working methods of the World Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to future contributions, the Council is waiting for the Commission to present it with proposals for modifications to the existing Regulations. In particular, the Regulation of 24 March 1997 on actions in the field of HIV (AIDS) in the developing countries, which also includes interventions in the field of genetic health, what is know as ‘reproductive health’, as well as that of 22 July 1997 on aid for demographic policies and programmes in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the activities so far carried out by the Fund, the Council wishes to tell the honourable Member that on 29 January 2002 the management board meeting in Geneva approved its first presentation of proposals for funding of associations in countries seriously affected by epidemics. The initial series of subsidies, which will be awarded in April, will be the first granted by the Fund. The second meeting of the Fund’s board must take place in New York at the end of April.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council would urge the honourable Member to approach the Commission directly, since it is represented on the management board of the World Fund, in order to obtain more precise information on the Fund’s activities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This issue is a key element of the pre-accession strategy for each of these countries, in accordance with the political requirements for accession established by the Copenhagen European Council in 1993.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Romania, one of the specific areas included in the pre-accession strategy is childcare. In the Commission’s periodic report for 2000 on Romania’s progress towards accession, the Commission expressed its concern in relation to the adoption legislation and practices in the various countries, which allow different considerations of the greater interest of the child influence decisions on adoption. As a result of this, and other expressions of concern, the Romanian Government decided to suspend international adoptions. In the revised Association for the accession of Romania, adopted by the Council on 28 January 2002, amongst the intermediate priorities and objectives, it is stipulated that Romania must maintain the moratorium on international adoption until new legislation is adopted which is compatible with interests of the children and with Romania’s international obligations, and the necessary administrative capacity to apply the new legislation is guaranteed. As well as maintaining the general moratorium, the Romanian Government adopted measures in December 2001 to allow for the completion of adoption procedures in those cases which were already before the courts at the time of the suspension of international adoptions. The Presidency of the Council believes that the adoptions of those children whose adoption procedures have already begun in the Member States, with all legal guarantees, should be completed within a reasonable time period.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the European Union will closely monitor the situation in Romania in this regard, especially within the bodies created within the framework of European agreement, such as the Association Council and the Association Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Progress has been made in numerous chapters of the Agreement and working groups have been set up in specific sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">The second meeting of the Association Council, taking place today, 13 March 2002, in Rabat, will provide an excellent opportunity to analyse the work being carried out to implement the Agreement and to lay down the foundations for future work. At this meeting, the Presidency will also refer to various issues of a political nature, such as the human rights situation in Morocco and the Western Sahara. It will also provide the opportunity to analyse the ways and means of strengthening relations between the European Union and Morocco with a view to preparing for the third meeting of the European Union-Morocco Association Council, which, in principle, will take place under the Danish Presidency during the second half of this year, given that the last meeting took place in October 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the objective of the agricultural negotiations the Commission is holding with Morocco, which started in January, is to widely liberalise agricultural trade between the European Union and Morocco. In accordance with the Association Agreement, negotiations will resume in parallel with the Association Committee on 14 March and, in principle, will be concluded by the end of 2002 at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Presidency, for its part, will continue to support Morocco’s efforts in regional and subregional cooperation, such as the Arab Maghreb Union and the Agadir Process. The latter paves the way for the creation of a free trade area, initially between Morocco, Egypt, Jordan and Tunisia, and, if this proves successful, other countries in the region which have an Association Agreement with the European Union will also have access to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Presidency is pursuing dialogue and cooperation with Morocco on migration policy, including illegal immigration, with the aim, amongst others, of jointly implementing the action plan for Morocco adopted by the Council in October 1999. This plan paves the way for socio-economic development, the integration of Moroccan nationals legally residing in Member States, the management of migratory flows and respect for the right of asylum. Several projects are being implemented, having regard, for example, to joint development in the socio-economic area, living and working conditions of Moroccan communities in the European Union, the management of border controls and also support for the fight against illegal immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">A meeting of the working group on social affairs and migration was held yesterday in Rabat, and there will be consultations with regard to negotiations for a readmission agreement between the European Union and Morocco during this current six-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard more specifically to fisheries, the Council recognises the ever-important relationship between the EU and the Kingdom of Morocco in this area. The Presidency will not spare any effort to ensure that this close relationship is maintained within the framework of a mutually beneficial arrangement between both parties. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, the Association Committee is meeting to deal with all the political issues relating to cooperation with Morocco, not only in the economic but also in the political fields, as well as all the projects existing within the association framework and the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, which is the fundamental instrument in the relationship between the European Union and Morocco.</p>
<p class="contents">And, tomorrow, the Committee which is looking at all the agricultural exports from Morocco to the European Union will be meeting in Brussels, which is Morocco’s top priority: to be able to export its agricultural produce to the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">The EU spends nearly five billion euro each year on subsidies of exports of its own agricultural produce. These subsidies seriously damage the prospects of other countries, particularly developing ones, of maintaining a viable position on the market in agricultural produce. The Court of Auditors has also highlighted the fact that the expenditure is not checked in a satisfactory manner. The EU's subsidies have come in for strong criticism in the WTO and part of the conclusions of the WTO meeting in Qatar was an objective to review subsidies.

<p class="contents">The European Union imports more agricultural products from developing countries than the United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and New Zealand put together. Between 1997 and 1999, the European Union imported more than EUR 35 000 million worth of agricultural products every year from developing countries, with no import duty in the majority of cases, or at a very low level in exceptional cases.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the European Union has a very active policy of supporting these countries, particularly through two main programmes aimed at encouraging exports from developing countries to the European Union. One is the Generalised System of Preferences and the other, the well-known EBA<span class="italic"> </span>(everything but arms) initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the Council would like to remind you that, within the framework of the World Trade Organisation – comprising 144 member countries, the majority of which are developing countries – an agreement on agriculture was made by virtue of the 1994 Marrakech Agreements with the aim, amongst other things, of reducing the subsidies that cause distortions to competition in world markets.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, in November 2001, the development cycle initiated by the Doha Declaration set the objective of reducing these trade distortions further, helping, at the same time, developing countries to take fair advantage of world exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of these new multilateral trade negotiations, the European Union has committed itself to contributing to the conclusion, before 1 January 2005, of a balanced multilateral agreement that will be advantageous to all parties. The Community position consists of setting up additional reductions to export subsidies, such as export credits, state trading enterprises or other kinds of export monopolies that use one market to subsidise another; or even specific practices regarding food, whose true objective is to eliminate surpluses and open markets or suppress competition in the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council does not yet have proposals from the Commission, which, as this Parliament is aware, has exclusive control over common commercial policy, but as soon as these proposals are presented to the Council, it will study them within the framework of these guidelines which the Commission, naturally, shares. There is no risk therefore of there being any difficulty between the Council and the Commission in terms of achieving the objective of giving more advantages to developing countries so that they can export to Union markets. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have to say that, if you bear in mind that 80% of subsidies go to 20% of farms, according to the MacSharry report, the subsidies paid to farmers, especially in the south, should have been increased long ago in order to meet the demands of the European Union for produce in which it is not self-sufficient and of which 70% are imports, such as cotton, tobacco, oil, fruit etc. Secondly, this produce is high quality and is good for the consumers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">My question to the Council, given that it has not given a clear answer and, we are told, has not yet formulated a position, is this: will it agree to abolish subsidies in all cases on the basis of the conclusions of the Qatar summit and, if it does, will it take account of the fact that farming will be abandoned in countries such as Greece and other countries in the south and all that that implies, with small and medium-sized farms being wiped out, increased unemployment and the adverse impact on the environment? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Evidently, the Commission's comment is a very sensitive issue in Germany, the largest Member State, whose Chancellor, Gerhard Schröder, is quoted by the Frankfurter Allgemeine (4 February 2002) as saying 'I do not understand the Commission'.</p>

On 12 February 2002, the Ecofin Council studied the updated stability programmes put forward by Germany and Portugal. In this regard, the Council also studied, in a similar fashion, the Commission’s recommendations aimed at forewarning, using the famous early warning method, these Member States so that they could prevent an excessive public deficit.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the concerns expressed in the Commission’s recommendations on the worsening of this deficit, both the German and the Portuguese Governments committed themselves to ensuring that the reference value of 3% of GDP for public deficit would not rise again in 2002. They also committed themselves to the very strict control of budgetary development in 2002 and to avoid any measure that could worsen the budget deficit and, naturally, to taking all the steps necessary to return, by 2004 at the latest, to a budgetary position closer to a balance, in the case of Germany, or an actual balance, in the case of Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council and the Commission considered that such commitments from the German and Portuguese Governments responded to the basis of the concerns expressed in the Commission’s recommendations for which they would be forewarned. Consequently, the Council rejected the Commission’s recommendations and has opted to conclude the process. The Council’s motives were given in two declarations on the budgetary situation of these two Member States, which were made public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council would never take a decision that would cause harm either consciously or voluntarily. That is unthinkable. The Council only takes decisions when it believes they are in the best interests of the Union and its Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, with regard to the supposed discrepancy between the Commission and the Council, I can only say that the Commission fully complied with its obligations laid down in the Treaties to monitor the Stability Pact and to propose to the Council the activation of the early warning mechanism, and that the Council carried out its corresponding obligation upon this warning from the Commission, and unanimously decided that, having obtained clear guarantees and commitments from the States involved, it should take the decision it took.</p>
<p class="contents">You ask me to compare the decision taken for Ireland with that taken for Germany and for Portugal. In the case of Ireland, the Council took the decision it deemed appropriate – I imagine it took specific considerations into account – and then, in the case of Portugal and Germany, it took another decision it also deemed appropriate. That is to say, the limits of the Council’s discretion to make recommendations to countries that are in danger of not complying with the Stability Pact are absolutely sovereign and the Council decides on each case according to circumstances, and it goes without saying that the Irish case was not the same as the Portuguese case or the German case. In the Portuguese and German cases, guarantees were given that were unanimously approved by Council members and the Council therefore took it upon itself to take the decision, in line with its own competences and responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the new international climate following the events of 11 September, the Ghent European Council of 19 and 20 October 2001 considered it fundamentally important to encourage dialogue on equal terms between our communities and those from the Arab and Muslim world, particularly within the framework of the Barcelona Process. Special attention is therefore being devoted to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking this into account, the strengthening of activities within the Barcelona process is, in fact, one of the Spanish Presidency’s priorities, with the intention that the Euro-Mediterranean Conference of Foreign Affairs Ministers in Valencia on 22 and 23 April should be a success. With the objective of preparing for this conference, from 18 to 22 February we led a mission to countries in the Maghreb and, as a result of this, all the necessary preparations have more or less been made to deal with issues in the three great political, economic and socio-cultural spheres, with the aim of reaching specific agreements at the Valencia Conference. I should also like to say that, up to now, we have received more or less the same response from all countries in the Barcelona process guaranteeing their presence at the Valencia Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, in view of the difficult circumstances we are facing with regard to the Middle East peace process, the fact that all delegations have announced their willingness to participate in the Valencia Conference is already proof of a spirit of cooperation and a desire to use the framework of the Barcelona Council to overcome the difficulties faced by the Arab and Israeli parties in the Middle East peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that I have to catch a plane, and also that in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, Questions to the Council end at 7 p.m. on the dot. Therefore, while I would love to be able to stay here longer, unfortunately on this occasion I cannot. In any event, I should like to say that the Presidency is here, in accordance with the Rules of Procedure, until the last minute it is required.</p>
<p class="contents">However, having said this, I shall be delighted to answer Mr Obiols’ questions because I believe them both to be very pertinent, especially, I am embarrassed to have to say, the second one.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Conference, we continue to insist on the participation of Ministers from associated countries in the Mediterranean, Arab countries and Israel, and you have reminded us of last year’s embarrassment when only four EU Ministers out of the fifteen expected came to this meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Obiols is aware of the extent of Spain’s current concern about this issue, given that Spain was one of the countries that was represented at ministerial level at the Conference, and the extent of their concern as Presidency-in-Office, which is why we have taken all necessary steps with all Ministers concerned, and have repeated to them on various occasions that, with regard to this meeting, which will be important with regard to the revision of the Barcelona process, the physical presence of the Ministers responsible for Foreign Affairs in the European Union is absolutely crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">We have received guarantees from Ministers from all EU States that they will be in Valencia on these dates. I hope that when I myself or the Spanish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Piqué, give an explanation of the results from this meeting at the session immediately following the meeting or at the next session, we will be able to say that there was full participation, for if this is not the case, we will have to take a serious look at our own consciences. This European Parliament should really draw the attention of the EU governments to this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the Euro-Mediterranean Development Bank, I am not in a position to give you any definitive plans at this moment. What I can tell you is that the Presidency of the European Union is very actively engaged in this regard at this present time, particularly the President-in-Office of the European Council, José María Aznar, by completing the visits we have made to all the EU capitals at the highest level and trying to find a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p class="contents">This all seems to hint that in Barcelona we could adopt an agreement on a formula that, as has been said from the start, would consist of creating a subsidiary of the European Investment Bank (EIB), which would have autonomy and furthermore would follow a process of evolution. It would start with a structure and several competences which would be increased over time. It would evolve into a more ambitious body than perhaps we could possibly have approved from the outset. Frankly, I believe that it is very possible that we will find a solution to this issue in Barcelona, because we would very much like to be able to put this plan forward in the ministerial meeting that will take place in Valencia with regard to the Barcelona process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
