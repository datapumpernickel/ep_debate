Europe has not succeeded in containing this new phenomenon which affects basic consumer commodities and constitutes a serious public health hazard.</p>

That is why the question of additional measures is not being raised, at least not for the moment, the question being the need to apply existing measures correctly.</p>
<p class="contents">Programmes for monitoring dioxins and PCBs in food and feedingstuffs are applied throughout the European Union. Τhese programmes have allowed the Dutch authorities to identify the contamination and take suitable measures to exterminate its source. There are monitoring and identification systems for identifying the undertakings and livestock units which may have been contaminated.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent the introduction of possibly contaminated food and feedingstuffs into the food chain, the necessary containment measures have been taken for these installations. The early warning system for food and feedingstuffs operated with particular efficiency as regards the exchange of information between the competent authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The adoption by the European Union of upper limits for dioxins played a primary role in the management of this case of contamination. It is indeed a legal tool for taking decisions which safeguard the protection of public health. However, we must admit that it is not possible to totally exclude the possibility of contamination of the food chain. The risk will always remain, which is why we have adopted the measures needed for us to identify and combat such risks. It is, however, of immense importance to the protection of public health that contamination be identified in the early stages through monitoring and for us to have rules which prevent and avert further contamination of the food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">Current Community legislation already includes such provisions. Nonetheless, the case of contamination which we are discussing today demonstrates the need to evaluate the safety not only of the ingredients of food and feedingstuffs, but also of the products which are used directly or indirectly in the preparation of food and feedingstuffs. Food safety legislation stipulates that food and feedingstuff manufacturers are responsible for product safety. The Commission will continue to emphasise this obligation to manufacturers and to monitor the controls carried out under the responsibility of the competent national agencies in order to safeguard compliance with current requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as far as landfills are concerned, Community legislation has been adopted in order to ensure that landfills are designed and operated in a way which does not jeopardise human health or the environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, the weak link in the chain for the success of this endeavour are the control mechanisms, especially in the feedingstuffs sector, where the link with public health is not directly perceived by citizens and awareness at production level is lower than with food. This has also been proven by the fact that the root cause of recent major food problems has been dioxins in feedingstuffs.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Piracy in the information society</span></p>
<p class="contents">Piracy constitutes a clear violation of intellectual property. It has a devastating effect on the financing of the culture industries and, in particular, on the production and distribution of audio and audio-visual works.</p>
<p class="contents">In the information society, audio-visual creators generate content for the Internet whilst at the same time searching for new technological media which will enable that content to be disseminated. Although new technologies facilitate the dissemination of culture, they may well prevent creators from being properly remunerated if piracy is not stamped out.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the action which needs to be taken in the police and judicial sphere, one of the main battles will have to be fought by educating the general public. Ordinary people are not aware of the value of intellectual property in the information society, hence they do not understand why piracy is an offence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has an important role to play in educating the general public and raising its awareness (particularly in the case of young people) as regards the threat which piracy poses in the information society. What action is the Commission proposing to take in order to spread this message and help protect Europe's audio-visual industry? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I fully share the honourable Member's view that this phenomenon is very damaging to the cultural industries and I am determined to do the utmost to get piracy levels as low as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission established a high-level group on digital rights management systems in March 2004, as part of the eEurope 2005 Action Plan. The high-level group's final report, presented on 8 July, reflects a consensus on basic principles and recommendations for future actions in three areas, one of which is the migration to legitimate services. Encouraging consumers to use legitimate online services is fundamental to the creation of a thriving e-content market. The digital rights management systems will play an essential part, enabling new business models and preventing unauthorised use. Recommendations included actively promoting awareness among consumers of legitimate alternative offerings and the need to create consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the situation outside the EU borders, also addressed by the honourable Member, on 10 November 2004 the Commission adopted a strategy for the enforcement of intellectual property rights in third countries. This strategy sets the guidelines for the coming years towards a reduction of the level of intellectual property rights violations taking place beyond the EU borders. Over and above technical cooperation and assistance, enforcement, regulatory implementation and bilateral and multilateral monitoring, the Commission will foster awareness-raising of users and consumers in third countries and support the creation of public-private partnerships for enforcement. There are a number of programmes that also cover intellectual property rights and include awareness and education: for example, ECAP, which is an intellectual property programme for the ASEAN countries; the Cotonou Agreement for the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and the CARDS programme for the countries of the Balkans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The point is that all those measures are perfectly valid and, as you explained, deal with all the different aspects of protecting intellectual property.

I am informed that the black market value of illegal CDs and DVDs is three times that of cannabis, and the profit margins are eight-fold. Therefore it is a much more profitable activity, with lower risks of being caught and lower penalties.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Cost of travelling to Strasbourg</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is a major expense to move a parliament with 732 members at least once a month. Papers, office supplies, vehicles and people have to be transported, resulting in inefficiency and unnecessary bureaucracy. The low turnout in the European Parliament elections this spring shows that people do not care enough about the European Union, which is a serious political problem. However, the solution to this problem is not to move the institutions between two European countries, which only prompts more people to turn their backs on the EU. We politicians must be close to the citizens we represent and take their daily problems seriously, which we could do even if the European Parliament had its seat in one country.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot be justified in the eyes of European citizens to spend such large sums on moving back and forth.

The question of the location of the institutions has had a very high priority and concerns a high level of decision-making, relating not only to the location of our institutions in Brussels and Strasbourg, but also to Luxembourg. This concerns a very high-level political decision.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Commission the total cost of missions of officials to Strasbourg amounted to EUR 1.7 million in 2003. This includes all the costs of missions, including those of Commission officials and members of Commissioners' offices. So this is not a large amount of money. A slightly higher amount is forecast for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">You asked about all the costs for the Union. We do not have a very precise overview of all costs, but we know that for the European Parliament the costs are much higher. According to the March 2004 report by Mr van Hulten, MEP, the total cost of having part-sessions in both Brussels and Strasbourg amounts to about EUR 200 million annually.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Hulten favoured Brussels as the single seat of Parliament and he was supported by Parliament's Committee on Budgetary Control. The Commission is not in a position to judge the functioning of the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Public service has a vital role to play in a democratic society – to be an arena for scrutiny, to enable different voices to be heard and different opinions to be voiced, to provide impartial and in-depth information. The market has no such role nor can it fully meet the need for programmes targeting minority groups in society.</p>
<p class="contents">Public service is the driving force behind developments in the media. The media works increasingly with new technologies. However, the new media landscape in the knowledge and information society does not reduce the need for public service – on the contrary. In the light of technological developments in the media and the greater need for an independently financed media sector, how will the Commission ensure that public service in the European Union can maintain its position when new media technologies are being used to an ever greater extent? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Cultural diversity is enshrined in Community law, mainly in the Amsterdam Protocol. The second aspect is an innovation-encouraging and technology-welcoming strategy. Both these objectives have a vital role to play in the future EU. Community law does not exclude the possibility of defining new media services as a public service. However, new technologies must be embraced by all actors – both public and private – for a successful information society for all. This means that appropriate public service obligations may be needed and imposed in the environment of these new technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission communication of 2001 on the application of state aid rules to public service broadcasting confirms that the Member States are responsible for the financing and definition of public service broadcasting. In that communication the Commission does not exclude the possibility that certain on-line activities could be performed as a public service. Thus Member States may take appropriate actions to achieve the objectives mentioned. However, I should like to remind you that other media players – both existing operators and new entrants – have a role to play in contributing to pluralism, cultural diversity, innovation, competitiveness and consumer choice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: The definition of 'public service obligation' and public broadcasting bodies</span></p>
<p class="contents">To date, the Commission has turned a deaf ear to private television operators complaining to it about the unfair competition they have to face.</p>
<p class="contents">The unlimited guarantee which the state grants to public television channels often exceeds by a large margin the net cost of the public service obligation. Moreover, many public channels use the subsidies they receive (which in some cases exceeds 92% of their revenue) to offer programming similar to that of the private channel, although this has nothing to do with their fulfilling their public service obligation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that each Member State is free to establish its own definition of 'public service obligation' means that many of them choose to make this definition a kind of catch-all phrase under which all programmes can be deemed to be of public service.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite what is laid down in the Protocol on Member States' public broadcasting systems, does the Commission not believe that for the sake of greater transparency and respect for the right to compete, it would be appropriate to lay down a single definition of 'public service obligation' at Community level? Would the Commission be prepared to put forward a proposal to this effect? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Still on this question, I would like to add that the 2001 communication on State aid to public service broadcasting clarifies the way in which the relevant rules must be applied. It explains clearly, should there still be any need to do so, that Member States are responsible for financing this public service and for defining its remit, and that it is not for the Commission to decide whether a programme should be broadcast as a service of general economic interest or what the definition of the remit should be. The Commission looks only at whether the definition of the remit and the financing correspond to the reality on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The important thing in the eyes of the Commission is therefore that the remit be defined as clearly and precisely as possible, and that if a public service goes beyond its public remit it should keep separate accounts for commercial activities such as the sale of advertising space, for example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Others were amended or rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have cases that are being examined, and you can be sure, Mr Herrero-Tejedor, that the Commission tries to apply the rules every time, and to ensure that there can be free competition between a public sector and a private sector which must not be stifled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is certain that digital broadcasting offers improved subtitling and audio description when compared with the analogue system. There are already standards for these services. I see the switchover to digital television as an opportunity for enhanced services of this type. It is not a threat.</p>
<p class="contents">As I told Parliament at my hearing in September, I believe that the development of new technologies must be to the benefit of citizens and of their welfare. That is why my services will shortly publish a call for tenders, launching a study on accessibility to digital television. This study will focus on developing policy models in order to help Member States implement assistive services.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say that there is no requirement in European law for broadcasters in Member States to provide subtitling and audio descriptions. Provision of assistive service is handled under the subsidiarity principle, but there are of course some areas coordinated at Community level by the Television Without Frontiers Directive. Within the framework of this directive, I have called on the contact committee to provide information on the measures taken by the Member States in order to enhance the opportunities for access of visually- and hearing-impaired people to television programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now in the process of collecting and analysing the Member States' replies. Our aim is to promote best practice among regulators and industry groups and we will work with Member States to promote availability of assistive services and to foster an economically viable market for equipment that addresses accessibility needs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has recently been noticeable that, following the debate about the Television Directive, TV suppliers are attempting to blur the demarcation line between editorial content and advertising.

The Directive also states that surreptitious advertising and teleshopping are prohibited.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said in answer to previous questions, the Directive is being reviewed, and the public consultation held in 2003 allowed the various parties concerned to express their views. Some operators are in fact in favour of making the rule on advertising more flexible to take account of changing technology by allowing split screens, for example, or the marketing of equipment that would enable viewers to avoid advertising messages. However, in 2003 there was a consensus that advertising should be clearly identified so as to avoid misleading the public.</p>
<p class="contents">That consultation did not identify any development in Europe of product placement advertising practices that would violate the terms of the Directive. That is why this point was clarified in the Commission’s 2003 interpretative communication on certain aspects of the provisions on televised advertising. I am of course prepared to go over all these matters again in connection with a possible revision of the Directive, which I intend to present in 2005. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since this question is related to an interpretation of national law, I would refer the honourable Member to Mr Richard Thomas, the Information Commissioner in the United Kingdom, who is responsible for enforcing these privacy and electronic communication regulations. The regulations transpose the European directive on privacy and economic communication – the ePrivacy Directive.</p>

This EU ePrivacy Directive provides that location data may be used, but only with the consent of the subscriber or user.

<p class="contents">However, the Commission is not of the view that the directive requires the user or subscriber to be informed of or consent to the location prior to every single attempt by the locator to locate him.

<p class="contents">On 26 October 2004, Amnesty International published a report on mass rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The DRC-EU strategy paper, 'Cooperation strategy and indicative programme 2003-2007', likewise refers to this. The social, political and economic situation in the DRC is said to be having an 'extremely negative impact' on human rights.</p>

The Commission has in fact made support to the health sector and institutional support for democratic transition part of its 2003-2007 strategy for cooperation with the Democratic Republic of Congo. This support is a differentiated and complementary response to the problem of mass rapes in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Community cooperation experience in the health sector goes back a long way, with EUR 70 million having been spent on support programmes since 1992. These programmes encourage access to basic health care and the supply of medicines at prices appropriate to the situation on the ground. A new health support programme amounting to around EUR 70 million will be put in place to consolidate what has been achieved by the earlier programmes, and to extend their activities to other areas relating to health.</p>
<p class="contents">In its global plan for 2005, ECHO confirms its support for areas with a high incidence of sexual violence, in particular in the Kivus and Maniema. Projects designed to restore the rule of law and promote women’s rights are also being funded by the European initiative for democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also very active in the field of institutional support. Since the beginning of this year it has in fact been assisting the Bunia court of first instance in Ituri, which deals with cases of rape. The purpose of this support is to combat impunity and to pacify the region.</p>
<p class="contents">On a more structural level, the Commission is putting in place a mechanism for partnership and support for the Congolese Government with a view to reforming the justice system. This will ultimately enable the national courts to deal effectively with cases involving actions for rape.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, envelope B, to which the honourable Member refers in his question, is providing around EUR 27 million for urgent rehabilitation work in Congo’s eastern provinces, which are the most seriously affected by the conflict and hence by human rights violations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a few weeks ago, the Presidents of Rwanda and of the Democratic Republic of Congo concluded a new peace agreement, only to be at each other’s throats again a few days later. My own sources in that country – a number of Catholic priests – have reported to me that there have been many gang rapes. Once again, thousands to tens of thousands of women have been raped.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is indeed funding a programme in the region, but should we not look into the real roots of the conflict? We all know that there are massive gains to be made from the mineral resources – diamonds, coltan and gold. Together with the Council and its presidency, should the Commission not be taking action about this? This has been going on for years. I do indeed believe, Commissioner, that everyone expects you, with your personal dedication and your personal knowledge of the region, together with your colleague, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner, to have a stronger and more effective presence in that region, and I should like to hear your view on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As you well know, I am very sensitive to and very concerned at the situation in the Great Lakes countries and, more especially, by what is happening in eastern Congo. That is why, when I leave you tomorrow morning, I shall be flying out there to make a repeat visit to all those countries and to review the situation with their leaders.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also aware of the renewed abuses and renewed and extremely serious acts of violence that the region is again witnessing. The problem is not only the ex-FAR/Interahamwe, there are also groups of what are really organised criminals and others who are really living off the backs of the population and are behind what can only be described as atrocities.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore be touring the capitals between 15 and 20 December. I shall be meeting with those countries’ presidents and various people in positions of responsibility, including United Nations officials, to see what the international community can really do and, in particular, what the international community is in the end prepared to do. We are well aware that the problem will not be solved by the Congolese army and police. They are not, at this present time, in a position to do so and it would be better to give the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) another mandate: it needs more resources in terms of ability to act on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are also aware, its present mandate does not allow it to disarm people by force, for example, but only to collect weapons from those who are willing to hand them over. There is therefore a principle of voluntarism involved and I shall be trying to convince the people with whom I have talks. First of all, I am going to try and persuade the Rwandans and the Congolese to keep calm and not to act in haste and risk reopening a conflict when the transition process is in full swing. I am therefore first going to try to convince them of the necessity of preserving the transition process. Then I shall be doing my utmost to persuade the international community, which is represented in the country by bodies like the United Nations, of the need to take the necessary decisions to settle this matter once and for all, because, as you so rightly said, the rule of law is no longer truly a reality in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the proof that I am in total agreement with you is that I am leaving to tour the area again tomorrow, and to take stock of the situation on the ground. There is the question of elections in Congo, of the timetable for those elections, and the legislation that still has to be passed by the parliament for those elections to be held. You are aware, since I have already said so publicly, that I believe the election timetable should be left unchanged so as to keep up the pressure on the authorities. I am also going to argue in Kigali that there should be no incursions of Kigali troops into foreign territory. As you see, I am therefore planning to make another complete review of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, Mr Staes, it is beyond my power to resolve the problem myself, and I can only hope that my powers of persuasion will have an effect this time. At any rate, believe me, I shall be voicing your concerns because they are my own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Effective use of EU humanitarian aid</span></p>
<p class="contents">The EU provides humanitarian aid to numerous countries worldwide. The heightened awareness of the governments of the 25 Member States and their immediate response to the humanitarian appeals of suffering peoples has assumed unforeseen proportions at the present time. Unfortunately, in a number of cases, the news arriving from certain parts of the world, such as recently the Ivory Coast, does not paint a picture of ideal conditions. Outbreaks of civil war, which very often spread to other countries, such as in Asia, Africa and Central America, complicate humanitarian action.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that the European Union provides humanitarian aid to these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">How is it possible, however, to ensure that such aid and material assistance reaches the people who are suffering, such as at the present time in the Ivory Coast and Darfur, where ongoing hostilities claim scores of victims and anarchy and lawlessness are the order of the day?</p>

I am sure we are all aware that the risks they run in order to provide aid in unstable situations have increased considerably. Take the examples of Iraq, Côte d'Ivoire and Darfur in particular. Relief workers have very often, too often in fact, come under attack from the armed forces and militias.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the difficult conditions in which the Commission, through ECHO, the Humanitarian Aid Office, and its partners, is working, it is becoming increasingly difficult to get material aid and assistance to those who are suffering. It also has to be said that the growing involvement in humanitarian activities of players who are not strictly humanitarian, such as the military, has sometimes resulted in roles becoming confused, with the consequent risks for the safety of relief workers.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to preserve the existence of a humanitarian space and, consequently, to ensure that aid and equipment reaches the victims, the Commission’s decisions are based on humanitarian values and principles and on a desire to provide quality assistance through its partnership with humanitarian organisations. In accordance with the Council’s rules on humanitarian aid, the Commission’s decisions are therefore dictated solely by basic humanitarian needs and principles, namely neutrality, impartiality and independence. Observance of these principles should help to protect relief workers and give them access to victims in cases of conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to maintain the distinction between the roles of the military and of relief workers, the Commission supports the key role of civilian organisations when implementing humanitarian measures in situations where military capacity and resources are used. To do so, it maintains that such recourse must comply with the guidelines for the use of army and civil defence resources in complex emergency humanitarian aid operations conducted by the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO is not an operational organisation. Its task is to finance the coordinated provision of humanitarian aid through partner organisations, for example international NGOs, other international organisations or the United Nations. The quality and effectiveness of ECHO’s aid depend very much on its partners’ professional abilities. All organisations signing the partnership agreement by virtue of which they work with ECHO therefore commit themselves to upholding the fundamental humanitarian values and principles I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic objective of humanitarian aid is neither to prevent nor to resolve conflicts, but to alleviate the human suffering they cause. In consultation with other sponsors and partners, ECHO is actively looking for ways of tackling the growing problems of access to victims and the safety of relief workers, with the aim of improving the situation in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments, armed forces and non-state players need to be made more aware of their obligations under international humanitarian law. That law states that the parties to a conflict must facilitate the passage of aid convoys and the provision of neutral assistance to civilians affected by a conflict. To give a real-life example of this principle, when I went to Sudan, to Darfur to be more precise, I reminded the government authorities and the rebels that it was absolutely essential that they allow international humanitarian organisations free access to the victims and the people in need of help. That is a fundamental principle and, in quoting that example, I am also stressing the importance of the political dialogue between the Commission and those countries’ authorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having said that, I admit that it is extremely difficult because we need real-time information.</p>
<p class="contents">We generally get that information from the operators on the ground, either NGOs or international organisations, etc. That all happens in extremely tricky and extremely sensitive circumstances. We therefore have to carry out a proper analysis before cutting off humanitarian aid or stopping sending or trying to send it. You mention Côte d'Ivoire. We also have to avoid throwing the population into disarray and total destitution if humanitarian aid is cut off.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, each case is assessed individually on the basis of information from our own delegations. I have to say that the high level of decentralisation we have today helps a lot. Information reaches us more reliably and more quickly, and on the basis of that information we can either continue our work, negotiate to try and get the aid where it is needed, or quite simply break it off. But I could not give my backing to any action that did not take all these things into account.</p>

<p class="contents">Development aid is no exception, and it should be noted that the Court of Auditors has given a positive statement of assurance concerning the management of the European Development Fund for 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Court of Auditors and OLAF have confirmed, the risks relate not to the regularity of the transactions managed by the delegation’s services but very often to the transactions managed by the implementing agencies, be they local associations in the developing countries, non-governmental organisations or project management structures. That is why, in 2003, the Commission adopted a much more rigorous approach involving procedural simplification and external audit, so that such transactions can be monitored better.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as the part played by national interests in development aid is concerned, tendering procedures are the best guarantee of transparency and competition, and therefore also of reasonable prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the European Union’s development policy is defined by the Council and Commission joint declaration of November 2000 and by partnership agreements with different regions and countries, such as the Cotonou Agreement, and, finally, by international commitments like the Millennium Declaration or the Monterrey Consensus, for example. That is the framework for the European Union’s development policy, and there is no question of any Member State’s specific national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, that is the comparative advantage of a development policy conducted by the Community: it represents European values, principles and objectives, it is perceived by our partners to be neutral with respect to national policies and it is based on a genuine concept of partnership with those countries which is genuinely implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proof is that you refer to a case that was in fact brought to our notice by our delegation. I think, therefore, that all the necessary procedures were set in motion immediately; complaints were lodged, etc. The whole mechanism responded as it should.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, everything possible should be done to prevent fraud. But everything must also be done to prevent our entire system grinding to a halt in the process. I think the controls we have today are adequate and the financial rules are sufficiently precise and restrictive. I do not question them. Obviously we are in favour, I am in favour, of zero tolerance, but, if you will forgive me, there is, on the other hand, no such thing as zero risk.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither can we keep on increasing the number of controls, evaluations and audits over and over again, only to find in the end that no more projects are being implemented. Both humanitarian and development emergencies arise. You ask me for concrete measures, but you know what measures are deployed and, on the basis of the information I have, I am not in favour of creating additional measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The OLAF mechanism is completely independent and works well. Our delegations on the ground send back extremely important information, and even if we only have mere rumours, a rapid alert mechanism is put in place immediately. I think it would be difficult to do more. What we could still do, if you want a concrete measure, would be to keep our delegations well informed and to train them well, so that they are able to respond very quickly, be on constant alert and make the most of any information they may receive.</p>
<p class="contents">There you are; I am of course willing to discuss the matter and to revise my opinion, but I think there are already enough controls, especially so far as my portfolio is concerned. All these controls, evaluations, audits and obstacle courses seem to me to be amply sufficient and I am therefore rather reluctant to invent anything else. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Steps to foster peace and dialogue in Mauritania</span></p>
<p class="contents">In Mauritania, tension seems to have remained high since the presidential elections held in 2003. Given the lack of a consensus on an electoral code, the sources of conflict are mounting up: failure to punish the ethnic crimes committed between 1989 and 1991, repeated allegations of torture, slavery-like practices and the prospect of oil production.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the EU is Mauritania's leading economic partner, there is an urgent need to encourage an open dialogue and act as arbitrator between the Mauritanian Government, its civilian and military opponents and human rights organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission plan to take resolute steps with a view to securing a negotiated settlement of the Mauritanian crisis, given that inaction would amount to an acknowledgement of responsibility for 'failing to assist a people in danger'? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first was an attempted <span class="italic">coup d’état </span>on 8 and 9 June, and the second was the presidential election of 7 November, which saw the re-election of the incumbent President Maaouya Ould Sid’Ahmed Taya, who has been in power since 1984. This latest presidential election was preceded and followed by arrests, most probably somewhat arbitrary, of leading political figures.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the restrictions on the exercise of civil liberties in the context of the war on terrorism, and the measures taken in the aftermath of the attempted <span class="italic">coup</span>, 2003 may be regarded as a year of regression on the democracy front. The deterioration does not seem to have gathered pace in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, Mauritania remains a country where dialogue is possible among the various components of the power structure, even if that dialogue is invariably fraught with tension. The Commission is aware of the fragility of this situation. This is why, in the ninth European Development Fund, an amount of EUR ten million, or in other words 10% of the total appropriation, was allocated to the tasks of strengthening capacities and establishing the rule of law. The Commission considers it essential, of course, to remain vigilant. It seems to me, however, that the setback in the democratisation process does not yet warrant a vigorous initiative to secure a negotiated solution to the Mauritanian crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that the Mauritanian Government was informed that its allocation under the ninth EDF was to be reduced by EUR ten million, chiefly to take account of inadequate sectoral performance in those very areas of strengthening capacities and establishing the rule of law, as identified in 2004’s mid-term review. Although the reduction in funding has more to do with absorption capacity than with the political situation, it should signal to the Mauritanian authorities how imperative it is to bolster the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, the European Union is conducting an intensified political dialogue with the Mauritanian authorities, and is keeping a very close eye on developments. Moreover, I shall be making personal contact with the President’s office and with a number of our connections in Mauritania to discuss the situation. The primary purpose of this dialogue is to promote good political and economic governance. To this end, it seeks to support the pursuit of the democratisation process that began with the elections in 2001 by highlighting the need to respect the rule of law and its instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up my reply to your question, I do not think there are sufficient grounds for embarking in the immediate future on a vigorous initiative designed to secure a negotiated solution to the crisis in Mauritania. This does not appear to be justified at the present time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is true that few people know much about Mauritania. Indeed, it is virtually a forgotten country. We are not too sure whether it will be part of the Cotonou Agreements with the ACP countries, or whether it will enter into the Euro-Mediterranean framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, now that the European Union is one of Mauritania’s main donors, we should like to know whether the country will depend on ACP funding or on the new delegation that has been created. On the same subject, may I ask you to provide for closer monitoring. In fact, in the light of current events, and if we focus only on what has been allocated to Mauritania in the fisheries sector, we must conclude that proper monitoring and control are desirable and that we ought to be able to ensure that this control is exercised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem that existed in 2003 has certainly not become any more acute in 2004. I can only promise to ensure that the political dialogue with the authorities will be quickly relaunched, and that it will focus on the concerns which you have clearly expressed and which I share. In the coming weeks, at the beginning of the new year, I shall establish more regular contact with the authorities – whom I know well, incidentally. Indeed, in my previous life as a Foreign Minister, I visited Mauritania and was struck by the fact that, although the majority of its population are Muslims, Mauritania is one of the only Muslim countries that maintains relations with Israel and therefore tries to be even-handed.</p>
<p class="contents">I admired Mauritania for that, because the ability of a Muslim country to adopt an even-handed approach to a conflict such as that in the Middle East seemed to me to indicate intelligence and a desire to avoid exposing the country’s political life to fundamentalism or excesses of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason, I do not think I shall have any difficulty in relaunching this political dialogue. You can certainly count on me to relaunch it at the start of the new year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
