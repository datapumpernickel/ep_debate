<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Klaß (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Commissioner Byrne, ladies and gentlemen, we are now going about the amending of Directive 2013/EC on the indication of the ingredients present in foodstuffs, which is a significant step towards maximising consumer protection in the states of Europe. The fundamental change in eating habits and the resultant transformation of the way food is produced and processed – for who, after all, still washes their own vegetables or still cooks according to basic recipes? – mean that ready-produced food constitutes an increasing part of our diet. There must be a political response to this in the form of new rules to improve consumer safety.</p>
<p class="contents">People with allergic reactions to certain ingredients must also be enabled to recognise with certainty from the packaging when substances dangerous to them are present. Already, 8% of adults in the European Union, and 3% of children, suffer from allergies, the effects of which can range from respiratory illnesses to life-threatening symptoms. Only the avoidance of the foods that are hazardous to them can give these people a high degree of security, and so there is an urgent need for notification of ingredients that trigger allergies.</p>
<p class="contents">In labelling, there is a need to strike a balance between practical and clear identification on the one hand and the consumers' justified demand for complete information on the other. The Commission proposal provides a good basis for doing this. What is particularly important from the consumers' point of view is to tighten up on the exceptions to the requirement for labelling, with the dropping of the 25% rule deserving particular mention. But the completely new and most attention-grabbing thing in the amendment of the directive is, for me, the list of allergenic substances based on the <span class="italic">Codex Alimentarius</span>. This report proposes for the first time that the presence of allergenic substances must always, and without exception, be indicated.</p>
<p class="contents">This list of allergenic substances must, though, be constantly monitored so that current scientific knowledge can be incorporated. Parliament must act together with the European Food Safety Authority and the Commission to find a way to keep this list constantly up to date. As I see it, this means that it must be possible to add new substances, but it must also be possible, in the light of new knowledge, to delete others. I therefore strongly urge support for my amendment on the continuous monitoring of the list.</p>
<p class="contents">The interpretation of this list, to be found in Annex III, requires detailed guidelines. What, for example, is meant when nuts are mentioned? What products are meant by the reference to crustaceans? Does that include snails? Having dropped the 25% rule, the Commission proposes minor derogations to the requirement for labelling, these being in the order of 5% and 2%. These apply, on the one hand, to foodstuffs on which there are already Community regulations, such as chocolate, sauce and mustard preparations and to foodstuffs such as milk, that do not require a list of ingredients. An exception is made for mixtures of spices or<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>herbs constituting less than 2% of the finished product.</p>
<p class="contents">Seasonal variations in supply make it particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises to be enabled to react speedily to changes in market conditions by means of the use of the clause with the phrase ‘contains ....... and/or .............’.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what some critics have said, all the concessions I have referred to do not mean that consumer protection is being weakened, but constitute a sensible arrangement and an alternative to the 25% rule, which has been dropped. This does not affect the fundamental requirement that the presence of all allergenic substances be indicated on the label. I have gone into labelling in great depth and also got to grips with its practical implementation. In all this, we must not forget that labelling must not disorient the consumer, but must be clear, distinct, and, in the final analysis, legible. Taken as a whole, the Commission proposal improves consumer protection in the European Union and offers consumers greater transparency and more information. Current difficulties, in particular, mean that it sends an important signal to the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by thanking most warmly all those who have helped and supported me. I would be delighted if the amendments I have put forward were to meet with the approval of a large majority of Members of this House.</p>

I believe it to be important that we should keep fighting to win consumers' trust, and it is particularly with regard to foodstuffs that more precise labelling is vitally necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In my capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I would like first to thank our rapporteur, Mrs Klaß, for her fine cooperation. Even though, when discussions started, we approached issues of detail from slightly different angles, as a whole we took the same line, so that the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy complemented each other very well, something which I do think should be mentioned and appreciated at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">As a whole, the Commission proposal amounted to a welcome advance in the labelling of foodstuffs, but no doubt there is nothing so good that it cannot be improved. That was a task for us here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The existing rule that all food ingredients – including constituent parts of compound foodstuffs – must be enumerated in the so-called list of ingredients on the label did indeed provide for derogations. Mrs Klaß has addressed the question of the so-called 25% rule. We often hear it said by way of justification for this that labels were made too all-inclusive by the large number of constituents listed on them, thereby ending up being unreadable, which was no doubt a bit extreme. The Commission itself made reference to the absence of uncertainty in Member States where this rule did not apply. No doubt the 25% rule was problematic mainly in that consumers could not know, when buying processed foods, whether they contained substances that might trigger allergies, in that even very small proportions of these were significant to the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that this context makes it clear that an even closer look needs to be taken at the difference in Amendments Nos 7 and 12, and consideration given either before or after the adoption of the directive as to whether this scientific basis for the inclusion of allergenic substances is the right one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When a major amendment to the labelling directive was decided on in 1995, there were similar discussions on the same issues as are on the agenda today. In my view, though, today's discussions are necessary simply because there has been an increase in people's allergic reactions to certain component foods, some of which have been a threat to life itself. This alone makes amendment of the directive and other measures necessary. In my estimation, the production processes have remained unchanged since 1995. What has changed is Parliament's attitude, as, at that time, we were already debating the rights and wrongs of the 25% rule. That is no longer an issue today, so we are – I think – going back to 5%, which ensures that consumers can be certain of spotting allergenic substances that are a danger to them, and that is the whole point of this amendment. That is why we should carry on along this road.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, though, we are back to walking the tightrope between clarity and the need for information, by which I mean firstly the clarity of the label and secondly that of the directive. The consolidated version 2013/EC was a superfluous piece of legislation, and, in my view, so complex that anyone starting to apply this directive needs the help of someone learned in the law in order to accomplish it properly. Please do not misunderstand me: I know of no amendment that we should be making other than this one. I would like, however, to sharpen our awareness so that we can consider, in view of the next amendment to the labelling directive being imminent, whether there are not essential things that we could leave off the label because the public now know a good deal more than once they did. When the public enter a hostelry, restaurant or bar, where mixed drinks and many varieties of food are prepared, we work on the assumption that they know what is in them and can also find out by asking. That is an approach that we might perhaps take to what lies ahead when the next amendment comes round; I believe it is nearly upon us. I am thinking of such things as alcoholic drinks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my remarks, I want to follow Mr Schnellhardt. I believe that it was right for our committee to go further than the Commission, after the abolition of the 25% rule, by also taking an axe to some of the exceptions and exemptions which had been suggested by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to say something about the many people who correspond with us about allergies. For anyone suffering from an allergy, it is no good saying that it is only an insignificant percentage of people who have it. If you have an allergy, it is 100% for you and we need to be certain that the labelling concerned gives due warning.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one area where we are not for the first time facing sustained opposition. Mr Schnellhardt just mentioned alcoholic products. Amendment No 1 which I moved in the committee and which was carried, would indeed make certain that there could be a single committee responsible for the labelling of products for alcoholic beverages. I believe that is important and something which has been strenuously resisted over the years by the wine lobby.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not saying that the specialist committees should not be involved in this, nor that there should not be a dialogue. Sooner or later, we have to tackle, within this general issue of allergies and labelling, the issue of a special interest which has always stood in the way of accurate labelling of some products and of applying the same provisions to all products. I do not believe that we can go on with that and my personal view is that now is the time. I would recommend – although there is a free vote in my group – that we vote in favour of Amendment No 1 and that we start to label wine in the same way as we label other products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The question of food labelling is of great importance, as many people have said this morning. Our legislation must satisfy the legitimate demands of consumers. After all, what could be more reasonable than wanting to know what foods are made up of, in order to make informed decisions in the face of an increasingly wide range of foods from which to choose. But even more important for a sadly ever-growing number of consumers, those who suffer from food allergies or intolerances, is information about the presence of certain ingredients for health reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential that labelling legislation not only ensures that all consumers receive comprehensive information, but also addresses the very real problem of adverse reactions to food. These are the objectives of the proposal we are discussing here today and I am pleased to note that in general it has attracted a broad consensus of support. In view of this, our discussions can focus mainly on the most appropriate means of achieving the objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Labelling issues are often more complex than they at first appear. For example, some flavourings are spice mixtures containing dozens of ingredients. Is it necessary, or even desirable, to list them all? I believe not, except in the case of substances derived from ingredients which can cause allergies or intolerances.</p>
<p class="contents">To encapsulate the problem, just how precise does food labelling need to be? It is absolutely essential to avoid an excessive amount of information which would be difficult for consumers to take on board. Quantity cannot be allowed to cloud quality and clarity. Our proposal aims, therefore, to provide information that is sufficiently complete whilst guarding against the omission of any ingredients which might cause allergies or intolerances. At the same time, the obligation to provide detailed labelling must be accompanied by procedures enabling manufacturers to satisfy this obligation without excessive technical difficulties. It was with these considerations in mind that we examined the proposed amendments before us today. As the list is relatively short, I will comment on them all.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 1 would abolish the possibility of having technical implementing rules adopted for the special case of alcoholic drinks under the sectoral management committee procedure. However, specific labelling provisions are in force for certain alcoholic drinks – wines, for example. This amendment would create inconsistency with existing legislation and therefore I cannot accept it.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 would add mixtures of mushrooms to other mixtures, fruit and vegetables, which can be labelled without having to satisfy the rule of descending order of weight and specifies that this option would only apply in the case of mixtures whose proportions may vary. I accept that this point is valid and I therefore accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 3 would abolish the possibility of flexibility in the labelling of ingredients used in small quantities – under 5% of the finished product.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus it would remove, firstly, the possibility of not strictly respecting the descending order of weight in the list of ingredients and, secondly, the possibility of using the expression "and/or" in the case of ingredients which are interchangeable according to availability. Amendment No 13 would abolish only the first possibility.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these provisions which allow for some flexibility of labelling presentation are technically justified, given the obligation to list all ingredients, including those used in very small quantities. I cannot, therefore, accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 would abolish a requirement for an explanation as regards repetition where ingredients are used several times in the preparation of a product. This amendment provides for simplification and can be accepted. Therefore Amendment No 14, which would abolish the whole provision, cannot be accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 5 aims to remove the provision of not requiring the indication of the composition of compound ingredients used in small quantities – under 5% of the finished product – where the composition in question is covered by current Community legislation which gives the composition corresponding to the trade name. This derogation would not, however, apply in either additives or allergens.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this derogation is to avoid making a list of ingredients unnecessarily long, while remaining consistent with the objectives of the proposal. I cannot accept its removal and must therefore reject the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 6 aims chiefly to abolish the derogation from labelling provided for in the proposal for ingredients which make up preparations of sauces and mustards constituting less than 5% of the foodstuffs. This derogation is also designed to avoid making the list of ingredients excessively long. The amendment would remove the advantage of keeping lists shorter. I cannot, therefore, accept Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 7 comprises two distinct elements. First, it would exempt processing aids derived from allergenic ingredients from the requirement to be indicated on the label, on the grounds that these substances are eliminated during the manufacturing process. However, residues may be present in the finished product and may cause allergic reactions, even where mere residues or traces of allergens are present. This part of Amendment No 7 is therefore not acceptable. Second, it would make the European Food Safety Authority responsible for establishing criteria for updating the annex and for revising it every two years. There is an ambiguity here, because amendment of the annex – which will be necessary – has to be done by the legislator, having consulted the authority on the scientific aspects. We can accept the principle of regular revision of the list annexed to the proposal but the amendment as it is currently worded is not acceptable. Neither is Amendment No 12 on the same issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of Amendments Nos 8, 9 and 10 is to add ingredients to the list in the annex. However, the list proposed by the Commission remains valid and should only be supplemented later on the basis of objective scientific criteria. With a view to subsequent updating of the list the Commission is consulting the Scientific Committee for Food and has made provisions for a rapid procedure to update the list. These amendments are therefore not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can agree on the principle that, as requested in Amendment No 11, an interpretative guideline for Annex III(a) would have to be laid down, but only if this is necessary. My view is that this annex should be drawn up in such a way that no further interpretation guideline would be needed. I cannot, therefore, accept the current wording of this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes the summary of the Commission view of the proposed amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
