In my opinion, the important thing when we discuss legislation at European level are the reports and scientific evidence which underlie this legislation. It is very important that the quality of legislation is right. We talk about this a great deal in the individual Member States, and we should also be aware of it when we are creating European legislation. On behalf of the Liberal Group, I would like to say that many of the amendments proposed by the Greens make the Commission's proposal far more restrictive than is necessary. I would very much like to know on what kind of scientific evidence the Greens are basing all these amendments. If I may take the liberty of referring to my own country, Denmark, where the Anti‐Cancer Association has carried out analyses of risks in this area, it has been found that there is no connection between electromagnetic fields and cancer. Children and workers at power stations were both studied. With children there was a very small risk, and with power station workers there was no risk. That was, of course, a Danish study.</p>
<p class="contents">But I fail to see how studies from other countries would justify the requirements being proposed by Mr Tamino. I would therefore like to ask the rapporteur, and not least the Commission, what scientific basis there is for these very restrictive demands from the Greens, because if the Greens' amendments are adopted, there would be very serious economic consequences for power stations and, not least, for general consumers. The Liberal Group is therefore opposed to the Greens" amendments, and I would ask the Commission on behalf of the Liberal Group what it has to say about the scientific studies to which Mr Tamino refers. I must say that on the basis of the national and international studies which have been carried out in this area, I have difficulty in recognising the assertions which have been made.</p>

<p class="contents">This is a significant problem that is very familiar to people living in Greece, where we are literally drowning in a sea of television transmitters. Just recently hundreds of transmitters for mobile phones were erected in Pefki, which is just outside Athens, and we have high voltage transmission lines and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">We have evidence, Mr President, but we apparently do not have proof. However, three Member States have much stricter legislation than what is being called for here. We also have the precautionary principle, which we are obliged to implement. This is why I believe that, until further studies have been carried out and the facts have been observed further, as Mr Whitehead said, we must abide by the recommendations made by Mr Tamino. There are very significant issues at stake regarding public health on a long term basis.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Collins, Gerard </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, the Commission's proposal for a recommendation on limiting exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields was formulated against the background of increasing public concern over possible links between electromagnetic fields and health problems. This is an issue which affects aspects of everyday life. The fields concerned are created not only by high voltage lines and broadcasting transmitters but by ordinary household appliances that we are all in regular contact with, such as mobile phones and television screens. Naturally there is a need to reassure customers by providing adequate protection from real and proven risks and by keeping them informed. What we do not need is irresponsible misinformation and scare tactics.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission sought to take into consideration all well‐founded scientific and experimental evidence in preparing its proposed recommendation. The guidelines and exposure proposed by the Commissioner are based on those recently published by the International Convention on Non‐Ionising Radiation Protection. This is a formally recognised organ of the World Health Organization. Thus there is a solid scientific basis for the proposed limit values. Furthermore, this WHO body takes the added precaution of incorporating large safety factors into the limit values to public exposure. In fact, we are talking about a safety margin at least 50 times lower than the levels for which possible health effects have been established.</p>
<p class="contents">The national authorities in most EU states have already accepted the health basis from which the WHO body derives its guidelines. These are enforced in the Member States which ensure compliance by industry and are vigilant in protecting the health of their citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Tamino's proposals are therefore greatly disproportionate. They seek to impose exposure limits which go far beyond what the Commission is proposing and what are scientifically shown to be necessary. If such exaggerated proposals were to be approved they would have a serious socio‐economic impact with no health benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the report fails to address the basic problem that there is no common European measurement system. This allows different national limits which create barriers to trade and distort a single market. The differences in standards have also contributed to public anxieties – consumers wonder why their countries have a different limit to another country. My group and I are calling for a European research project aimed at harmonising calculation methodologies.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Lannoye </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, there seems to be a great deal of confusion in this debate on Mr Tamino"s report. In particular this is because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection and some of our colleagues are proposing to lay down limit values for the distance between certain installations generating electromagnetic fields and people living close by, and also because they consider that the Commission"s proposals are acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I would draw your attention to the fact that the Commission"s proposals do not strictly change current practices in any way. In actual fact, these proposals endorse the activities of industrial groups which, with regard to the transport and distribution of electricity or telecommunications, are exposing people to significant electromagnetic fields. For example, there is a magnetic field of a few micro tesla in a vertical line from a high‐voltage power line of 380 000 volts. The Commission"s proposal fixes a limit value of 100 micro tesla which means that it is endorsing what is already in common practice.</p>
<p class="contents">This is unacceptable because numerous epidemiological studies and several laboratory studies have shown that effects on health involving the nervous, endocrine or immune systems start to be detected from values which are up to 1 000 times smaller. Limiting the problem to the appearance of cancer is a simplistic approach which will cause us to make serious mistakes in terms of public health. On the basis of what is already occurring today in one of the Member States, namely Italy, we therefore believe that it is possible to recommend much lower limit values, with which Mr Tamino agrees. These certainly do not threaten the various current economic activities but they do prevent people being exposed to electromagnetic fields which may endanger their health.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore propose that everyone thoroughly reviews this dossier in order to avoid falling into the trap of saying that Mr Tamino"s proposals would cause excessive economic damage. This statement has already been made three or four times but has not been proven by any argument.</p>

According to various scientific studies, they can lead to the development of cancerous cells.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the findings of these reports are not totally conclusive, it would be wise for the Commission to take account of the two basic principles of risk prevention: the safeguard principle, that is, avoiding risk in cases of doubt; and the ALARA principle, in other words, that exposure to radiation should be as low as may reasonably be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to draw the attention of the House to a project currently under consideration: the connection of the French and Spanish electricity grids through a high‐voltage line of 400 000 volts across the Pyrenees. This project was approved at Essen. Citizens likely to be affected by the line have been campaigning against it for more than 15 years on account of its environmental impact and the electromagnetic fields that would be generated. This is a good opportunity for the Commission to adopt a common sense approach and look for alternative solutions in order to ensure that we have no regrets in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission needs to establish a common framework to safeguard public health. This should stipulate that minimum safety distances and an environmental impact assessment are essential preconditions for the construction of power lines. It should then be possible to avoid the electromagnetic fields generated.</p>

This means that the consumer should be given the benefit of any doubt, even if there is only a hint of risk in using modern techniques. That could quite easily be the case, and GM foods are only one example of it. But today we are considering the short‐term effects of exposure to radiation from electromagnetic fields. The Greens' amendments in the report, on the other hand, concern the long‐term effects, and they have not yet been adequately studied. We therefore think that the very restrictive advice which would result from supporting the amendments is untenable. We cannot get round the fact that electricity is a fundamental cornerstone of modern society. It is also clear that all scientists agree that the short‐term effects of being exposed to radiation are very small, and to hinder or even prevent the supply and consumption of electricity would be like using cannons to shoot sparrows, as we say in Denmark.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I have also stressed the fact that, after extensive research, the Anti‐Cancer Association came to the conclusion that it would be quite irresponsible to make people afraid to use various electrical appliances which are part of every household, such as kitchen equipment and shavers. One cannot of course rule out the possibility that the long‐term effects might be different. This is being studied at the moment by the World Health Organisation, and if they should come to a conclusion which reflects Mr Tamino's amendments, then we in the June Movement would of course fully support the amendments which we are rejecting today.</p>

High‐voltage power lines, GSM radio transmitters and many domestic appliances are disrupting the natural balance.</p>
<p class="contents">The 1994 Lannoye report demonstrated the harmful effect of these electromagnetic fields on health and in particular the risk of the development of cancers, leukaemias and diseases of the nervous system and brain. However, just because scientists do not yet understand the mechanisms of these attacks on the human body, this must not be used as a pretext to stick our heads in the sand. On the contrary, we must use the precautionary principle and prohibit or at least limit any equipment, even any technology, which endangers human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation gives the consumer the responsibility of proving that a device is dangerous. The burden of proof must be reversed and manufacturers must be required to prove that their goods are harmless. A Commissioner said that the best way to validate a product is to place it on the market. In the case which concerns us today, major suspicions exist about the harmfulness of these electromagnetic fields to the human body. It is therefore high time to act and we must not put off implementing limit values on the effects, whatever they may be, and not just the thermal effects.</p>
<p class="contents">If over the five years since the Lannoye report there has not been enough sufficiently convincing scientific research, this is precisely because some people had much to lose from this. In any case, it is scandalous to say that this report would harm industrial development, firstly because this is false and secondly, and in particular, because public health must come before any economic considerations.</p>

And yet the precise effects on the organism of exposure to electromagnetic radiation are not known. Worrying theories have been put forward on the possible harmful health effects of exposure to artificially produced fields, and a debate is under way concerning the existence of possible long‐term effects, first and foremost cancer, and particularly cancer of the blood, leukaemia.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, however, there is no conclusive scientific evidence that electromagnetic fields can directly cause cancer. In most Member States, the authorities are constantly being questioned about such effects, revealing considerable concern among the public. Experiments have proved only that prolonged exposure to high frequencies may cause pathologies. As draftsman of the opinion of Parliament's Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, which I chair, on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, I believe that it is crucial for Europe to create a single, coherent body of legislation enabling all the Member States to protect their inhabitants from these potentially harmful effects. Such limits should not however exceed the bounds of knowledge and reasonableness, causing severe economic damage both to industry and to employment.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendation introduces, throughout Europe, a proper level of protection against EMF health effects. It is rightly based on well‐established health effects, the acute ones, while stating that there is currently no convincing evidence that these fields produce long‐term carcinogenic effects; the available data cannot be used as a basis for developing exposure guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Mr President, I believe that it is absolutely crucial for further high‐level studies to be conducted on long‐term exposure, on the one hand so as to protect the public and, on the other, to avoid panic and unemployment.</p>

I have no doubts at all about the rapporteur"s well‐meaning proposals for limit values, but the committee was unable to accept them on the basis of the facts presented here. This in now way implies that the principle of preparedness should not be vital for everyone, for example, in the elimination of the adverse effects of non‐ionising radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">The basis here must, however, be the results of research and the WHO recommendations, as well as the principle that the degree of exposure to electromagnetic radiation must be kept as low as is reasonably possible. Member States must also introduce minimum values for safe distances from electronic equipment and minimum distances in general which must be complied with in the vicinity of people"s homes and places of work. This a very new subject area, and research into possible problems and their prevention must continue. This will be one of the sections of the Fifth Research and Development Framework Programme. Responsibility for the research will lie with the equipment manufacturers as far as product development is concerned, but to ensure impartial results the source material will have to be as broad in scope as possible and independent of any bias on the part of the researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">While there are calls for an increase in research into the possible problems of non‐ionising radiation we have to ensure that resources are used effectively in the health sector as a whole. There are limited resources for public health and we must see to it that they are exploited effectively. We have to consider what social costs are worth paying so that public health can expect a good return on its investment. Assessment of the social costs is the job of politicians, and acquiring information on the possible risks is that of researchers and scientists. Politicians have a responsibility in all this.</p>

The Commission"s estimates of what would be health‐endangering values reflect the outcome of the research carried out. Certain MEPs, however, have suggested values which are considerable more stringent than the Commission"s recommendations, in recognition of the possible health impact. This method of investigation, where conclusions are based on vague estimates and the policy is to ignore other research data, cannot have any real meaning. Furthermore, we also have to take into account the relationship between the desired recommendations and the tangible effects on health as well as the cost of any action that needs to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years one subject of debate that has quickly assumed prominence is the possible effect on people"s health of the increasing use of mobile phones. Hopefully, we all appreciate the need for a closer study of the effects of these on users, and the possible need to take action when we have some real facts before us. I do not believe that anyone wants to start restructuring the electrical power networks in heavily populated areas, preventing the use of mobile phones in cities, or replacing household appliances as a result of possibly unfounded restrictions. We must respect the precautionary principle, but excessive caution must be substantiated by the results of research.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McKenna </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, most people speaking here today talk about how ‘the precautionary principle must be respected, <span class="italic">but...</span> ". There is a total contradiction there. If the precautionary principle is to be respected, then we need to ensure that we have definite evidence that this kind of radiation is not dangerous. We do not have that evidence. One of the major failings in the Commission's proposal is that it does not take the precautionary approach. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has been a complete disaster on this. It has completely diluted the rapporteur's proposal. It has failed to protect public health and the environment. This issue has come up again and again and the Commission has done nothing about it. Even Member State governments have done nothing about it. In my own country mobile phone masts are erected close to people's houses and right beside schools. The central nervous system bioeffects – which the Commission does not refer to – seem to be occurring where mobile phone masts are located close to people's homes. There are reports of headaches, sleep disruption and a number of other effects, which are not referred to by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">As the rapporteur has pointed out, there is a suggestion that exposure to electromagnetic fields could lead to an increase in occurrences of cancer and other serious threats to human health. We need to ensure that the precautionary approach is taken. The Commission seems to base its findings on certain research but to ignore other research that is available. We need proper research centres to be set up to ensure that the real effects of this kind of non‐ionizing radiation are properly examined by independent assessors.</p>

We obviously have to regulate the amount of radiation that people are exposed to. However, it is essential that the rules should be reasonable. We cannot have a situation in which a single political group claims a monopoly of the scientific knowledge; instead, we take it for granted that the Environment Committee and the House will do their best to reach a satisfactory decision.</p>
<p class="contents">Electromagnetic fields and their effect on people are subjects that have come up for debate with increasing frequency in recent years. In point of fact, we still do not have any precise answers to the questions which they raise. We do not know how ordinary electric currents and magnetic fields affect us. What we do know, however, is that more and more people are becoming hypersensitive to electricity.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be establishing limit values on a Europe‐wide basis, but they should be reasonable as well. Sweden has been mentioned in the discussion as one of the countries with satisfactory limit values. All I can say about this is that the limit values are well above the levels proposed by Mr Tamino. The values are 100 micro tesla in normal daily life and 500 micro tesla in industry and places of work. That is substantially different from those proposed by Mr Tamino.</p>

First of all there is low‐frequency radiation from high‐tension cables and frequencies generated by them. All the experience from all the new research carried out by our governments shows that nothing can be proved. In Denmark, we have a cancer register in which all cancer cases are recorded, and the central register of persons shows where people live. All the 30 000 people who work in the electricity supply industry were examined in a major study carried out in 1998, and no connection was found between their work in the electricity supply industry and cancer. The claims that extensive studies have not been carried out are incorrect.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are mobile telephones. More or less everyone in this Parliament uses a mobile telephone, sometimes a great deal, although there are some who believe that mobile telephones are dangerous. I agree that not enough research has been done on this question to know whether the vital parts of cells or the basic building‐blocks of human life are being destroyed by this radiation. Considering how many children in their teens and younger use mobile telephones, it is important that such research is started, so that we can have some specific conclusions. However, I am not aware of suggestions that there is any danger from the base stations which are being set up or the DECT stations in supermarkets. And of course no one stands in front of a radar beam or rays from a microwave source. These are concentrated rays, but they do not penetrate down to where we usually are. Many of the amendments, in other words Nos 14 to 24, are only designed to create unease and are not based on the necessary scientific research.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Ahern </span> <span class="bold">(V).</span> – Mr President, it is really important that we produce a recommendation for minimum distances from people's homes for mobile phone masts. These are proliferating in my own country. If, as the companies producing them say, there are no health risks, why should we not have a mandatory health indemnity? The vested interests that produce these should be legally liable for insuring people's health if something goes wrong. That is something that we should be considering seriously at European level. If they are not dangerous, then there is no risk. So why should we not insure people against the problem?</p>
<p class="contents">A recent conference in Vienna concluded that the biological effects from low‐intensity exposure are scientifically established, so it is no longer acceptable for Member State governments or the Commission to say that more research is required before setting standards. People deserve to have their health protected and not have the ball kicked into touch for a scientific investigation that may take years. Then we will be in the same situation as with the tobacco companies where millions could be paid out to people whose health has been put in danger.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very shocked that my own government has made several attempts to water down EU proposals to regulate emissions of electromagnetic radiation from mobile home masts. It is scandalous that these attempts by the Irish delegation to delete clauses are claimed as being in accordance with the precautionary principle. There is sufficient evidence to warrant a whole re‐think on the health implications of these masts.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McAvan </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I am very pleased to be able to speak on this issue, which I think everyone agrees is of major public concern. In my own country in the last three days there have been front‐page articles about the effects of mobile phones and in my local newspapers stories about power lines and their effects on people. Some of these reports are alarming and some are worrying and it is not surprising that the public are confused and do not really know what to think. So the Commission proposals are very timely. We need some form of European‐wide action on this issue. The approach of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection is also very balanced.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to stress two amendments which are important. The first deals with the application of the precautionary principle, based on the ALARA proposals from the World Health Organization. My second point is that we must keep this under constant review. It is not enough to set standards now and then never come back to them. People are increasing their mobile phone usage; parents are buying mobile phones for their children; people are switching to mobile phones. So I hope the Commission will take into account some of these amendments.</p>

This is no doubt a good approach, but it does not allow for detailed rules at European level so that in my view the subsidiarity principle should be applied in some areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, it is to be welcomed that the Committee on the Environment did not accept the doubtless well‐intentioned proposals from the rapporteur, on the grounds I referred to above. But well‐intentioned does not always mean good. Moreover, the rapporteur"s proposals could not be justified scientifically – as many speakers have mentioned today – and would in practice have led to low limits that could not have been adhered to. Or should we go so far as to get rid of mobile phones and emergency telephones? I do not think that can do us much good.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me raise another point. The discussion between experts has shown that laying down safety distances from fixed installations, for example high‐voltage transmission lines, is of extremely questionable use in protecting against radiation because, apart from the distance as such, numerous parameters specific to the installation can have quite a determining effect on exposure. In the case of electrical devices, laying down minimum safety distances is even more of a problem. As a rule the distance between such devices and the public is surely determined by whether they are used as they should be. In this case I think it is confusing, unhelpful and inconsistent with the aims of adequate protection against radiation to lay down additional safety distances.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is different in the case of equipment that is designed to produce fields, such as broadcasting transmitters. Here, safety distances can no doubt simplify matters. I would ask you to consider this at the vote. I have tabled the corresponding amendments.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Bangemann, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (DE)</span> Mr President, the Commission would like to begin by warmly thanking the committee and also the rapporteur. Of course this is a subject on which opinions can differ, as they do here in the discussion too, for not every individual issue has undergone adequate scientific investigation and been supported by unequivocal findings.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless we wanted to take a first step with our proposal. For one thing, there is increasing concern – and that is undoubtedly true – on the part of experts too. There is a wide debate, particularly among the public, which is not always very objective but which does of course create doubts in the public mind. That is why we believe it is right, given also that the Maastricht Treaty commits us to aim for a high level of public health, to propose a common framework of basic restrictions and reference levels under this recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing I want to say quite clearly here, since Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen also put this question to the Commission – even if she has gone now; indeed it is sadly becoming increasingly common for Members to put questions and then to disappear – is that even if you raise the question of scientific findings, our proposal is based on the recommendations of the International Commission on Non‐Ionising Radiation Protection and on the positions of the Commission"s Scientific Steering Committee. So it is not the case that we have not taken account of these scientific positions.</p>
<p class="contents">I could now discuss all the amendments, but that would be going too far, given also that this is a recommendation. But let me say that we can accept in whole or in part Amendments Nos 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 13. Other amendments go far beyond the recommendation, for instance in assuming that this kind of recommendation also has legal implications, which is not the case. By definition a recommendation is addressed to Member States and they may follow it but are not obliged to do so, which means that this kind of recommendation cannot lay down other legal commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">That applies in particular to the question of minimum safety distances. Mr Schnellhardt made a few comments on this question that are worth considering. But I must say that even if everything he says is right – and basically I have no doubt it is – we cannot lay down any binding minimum safety distances in the recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is Amendment No 12. We have already made provision for a review system. That means that we will of course ourselves draft a report for the Union, on the basis of the Member States" reports, and naturally we will take account of all the new scientific findings as they become known. If necessary, the Commission will act at once. But it is also certain that we cannot act according to the principle that this is a matter of health and that we must therefore discontinue all our activities, even if that cannot be justified on scientific grounds. We cannot proceed according to that kind of principle. I am saying this with particular reference to some of the comments made by the Greens. If, for instance, we switched off the entire electricity network, I wonder what the public would say to that.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling) </span></p>
<p class="contents">I did say ‘if". So if we want to proceed in a sensible manner here, we can only do so in the light of and on the basis of scientific findings. Any other approach would be arbitrary and not right. That could not be justified in a constitutional state! What is called the precautionary principle relates to very restricted exceptional cases in which it allows us to do something when we do not yet have the relevant scientific findings. And the Commission does apply that principle. For example we introduced very strict limits for baby food, even though there are no scientific findings, because in that case it was justified, even in terms of the expenditure involved, to do something although we did not know whether it was necessary. But obviously we cannot make that a general principle. If we were to proceed according to this principle, the end results really would be totally absurd. And you cannot expect that of the Commission.</p>
