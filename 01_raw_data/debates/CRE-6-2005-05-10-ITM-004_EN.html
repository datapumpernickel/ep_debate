<p class="contents">Our aim in revising the directive is quite clear, namely to ensure continued high standards of health and safety at work. It is well known that a link exists between work-related accidents and excessive working hours. At the same time, we are all aware that the future will belong to flexible businesses that introduce innovative working methods, in so doing motivating their workers to be more productive and also offering them high-quality jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of our fellow citizens, we must respond to these new challenges to the best of our ability. We must flesh out the European social model, one of the founding principles of which is quality as a determinant of competitiveness, and in fact the need to do so has also emerged from public consultations on the Constitutional Treaty. The Commission’s aim has always been to ensure that the revised directive maintains the current level of protection for workers at the same time as contributing to a more flexible organisation of working time. This was the intention behind the original proposal, and I believe that the same goal is pursued by those of Parliament’s amendments that the Commission will be able to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I will comment in more detail on the Commission’s position on the amendments that have been tabled after listening to your debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, by chance, our debate on the Directive on working time has coincided with the European anniversaries of 9 May. The words of our President, Mr Borrell, yesterday in this house on the relationship between our duty to remember and our duty to build a Europe in which euro-scepticism and anti-europeanism have been defeated are still ringing in my ears.</p>
<p class="contents">Our debate today and tomorrow’s vote are very much related to our responsibilities. They are very much related because millions of Europeans are awaiting the result of certain debates in which they have placed very great hopes, since this Directive is at the heart of social Europe and will be a clear signal of our will and our conviction that the European social model has a future, otherwise we will be at the mercy of a future dictated not from the other side of the Atlantic, but from the Pacific.</p>
<p class="contents">Our debates also coincide with an important moment in European integration and the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty by the various parliaments and peoples of Europe. And at the heart of the concerns of the citizens currently facing the question of whether or not to take the constitutional route is always the same question: what is Europe doing to improve our living conditions? We all know that this is the key point and that the question of whether or not our agenda is in line with the agenda and concerns of the citizens will depend precisely upon our reaffirming the European social model. </p>
<p class="contents">And the key point, as the Commissioner has said, is the opt-out<span class="italic">.</span> Parliament wishes to put an end to this clause. European social laws must apply to all countries without exception. It is not sufficient, Commissioner, to eliminate the abuse and fraud committed in the past under the previous legislation. We must put an end to its legal basis in all of the Member States, as Parliament says, after 36 months or whatever is decided in a subsequent negotiation with the Council. </p>
<p class="contents">Why? Because the opt-out blatantly contradicts the objectives of the Directive, the health and safety of workers and the fundamental principles of the Treaty. Because it contradicts that which we have learnt from 10 years of experience during which, in the countries in which it has been applied, the health, safety and reconciliation of the family and professional lives of millions of European men and women have suffered seriously. Because it contravenes the Charter of Fundamental Rights and our Constitutional Treaty, Article 91 of which lays down the obligation for a high quality of life in work and a restriction of working days. Because, Commissioner, European workers, their organisations, women's organisations and also, in private, many employers who want a typically European model for industrial relations, are asking us for it.</p>
<p class="contents">What about flexibility though? This Parliament knows that we also need to deal with the issue of flexibility, because in Europe we do not just need higher quality work, but also more work. We are therefore in agreement and we will allow flexibility and we will vote for the annualisation, but, I must insist, this is a <span class="italic">do ut des</span>, we shall not vote for annualisation unless there is a vote in favour of putting an end to the opt-out clause. We believe that the opt-out would be proper in a Europe without rules, but we are nevertheless in favour of making European rules flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater flexibility is not incompatible with a higher level of social protection for workers, provided that we ensure that there is a minimum level of regulations and guarantees, as the Wim Kok report stated. We also want to respond, Commissioner, to the principles to be taken into account when defining on-call times; we want the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>to be respected; we want the decision of the Court of Justice to be respected. On-call time is working time, because workers cannot use their time freely and they have to be in the places dictated by the employer. </p>
<p class="contents">We are also sensitive to the needs of the European health systems, which are facing serious difficulties recruiting professionals to cover this on-call time. We have therefore sought a solution which creates a synthesis between flexibility and safety. Commissioner, the Members in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs believe that these two things are compatible. Those who believe they are not compatible are the people who are seeking to perpetuate the opt-out or those who are seeking to define on-call time as non-working time. </p>
<p class="contents">We can make an effort, we have demonstrated this, there is a consensus in Parliament. I would ask the Commission and the Council not to destroy the enthusiasm created by this agreement, because it is the old agreement that led to the European social model. We therefore fervently hope that we can count on your help, your dialogue and that we can work together constructively over the coming months.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what we see now. Whenever anyone objects to our transferring power from the Member States to the EU institutions, we are told that not to do so would be tantamount to re-playing the Second World War, complete with holocaust and everything else. We cannot therefore even debate the existence or otherwise of the Working Time Directive without being subject to accusations of that kind.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of subsidiarity is fundamental, with tribute paid to it on solemn occasions of every conceivable kind. When we get down to the details, precisely the opposite is the case. It is actually impossible for anything to remain with the Member States. The Working Time Directive is in itself a breach of the principle of subsidiarity. Each of the Member States is different. Each has its own economic structure. Some countries make their living from manufacturing, others from the processing industry. We have different arrangements in the public sector, with different rules governing such matters. There is no good reason for trying to regulate working time for the whole of the EU in this way. Indeed, it would be extremely inappropriate. Those who now argue in favour of doing so say that the alternative is social dumping. That is a hugely serious accusation to make against those countries that we have accepted as members of the EU and which all fulfil the Copenhagen criteria and are constitutional states entitled to organise themselves as they see fit. The notion that we could obtain some form of slave labour from these countries is a grotesque accusation which definitely must be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has now attempted in this House further to exacerbate the Working Time Directive already in place. That is something we must reject, for it is an attempt to give a yet further increased presence to the EU institutions. The proposal should therefore definitely be rejected with reference to the principle of subsidiarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Problems resulting from the fact that anything that benefits employers places employees at a disadvantage, and vice versa, have beset the proposal for a directive concerning certain aspects of the organisation of working time at every turn, and we should not pretend otherwise.</p>
<p class="contents">The vote in the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, of which I am a member, has demonstrated that Members of all political persuasions wish to tackle inequalities between employees and employers, and to ensure that there is a gradual move towards equal treatment for men and women on the labour market. The modern humanist approach to employment relations did not come out of the blue, however. It is the culmination of a long struggle for the recognition of human rights, and hence of the right to fair working conditions, which right is enshrined, <span class="italic">inter alia</span>, in the Lisbon Strategy, and emerges quite clearly from the Cercas report. Yet a few legislative loopholes and seemingly innocent compromises could undo centuries of progress. It is an unfortunate fact that altruism by employers towards their employees has not to date been a founding principle of our civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We adhered to the principle of work-life balance when voting on the proposal in committee, and we would insist that the following proposals are adopted, in order to ensure that this principle becomes more than an empty phrase to salve our conscience. Firstly, the maximum working week should not exceed 48 hours, including overtime. Derogations to this principle may only be decided on by means of collective agreements, which would rule out the use of individual opt-outs. Secondly, on-call time, including what is termed ‘inactive on-call time’, should be regarded as working time. Quite apart from anything else, this principle has been confirmed in rulings by the Court of Justice. Thirdly, the reference period for calculating the average working week should continue to be four months. There is a further priority I should like to highlight, namely that achieving equal opportunities does not only involve creating a level playing field for men and women with regard to wages and access to jobs and education. It also involves granting equal rights to men as far as opportunities to participate fully in family life are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in tune with the Lisbon Strategy, it protects small and medium-sized enterprises, and it contains a number of points providing for greater flexibility in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some controversial elements, however, the first of which is the opt-out. The possibility of keeping the opt-out would mean that the Union would be adopting a directive on delicate aspects of minimum standards to be met in the area of health and safety at work, and yet would be also saying in the same directive that compliance with those standards is entirely optional. Continuing this practice cannot therefore be seen as a form of flexibility. What it would mean is deregulation in an area as sensitive as health and safety at work.</p>
<p class="contents">The European economy needs greater flexibility in the labour market, but not at the expense of an absence of rules. There are other, more effective, ways of bringing flexibility into the labour market, such as extending the reference period, which is covered in this proposal. This is, moreover, guided by the subsidiarity principle, in that it gives the Member States the freedom to choose to set the reference period anywhere between 4 and 12 months, depending on the situation in the country, without the EU unilaterally imposing a set period.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, as regards working time and rest time, there is no reason for Parliament not to abide by the rulings made by the Court of Justice. Once again, this proposal fails to uphold the subsidiarity principle, which would accord the Member States the right to set out methods for calculation as they see fit for the purposes of salaries and counting working time. Let me state very clearly that, in the proposal that has been tabled, there are no other possible outcomes than those I have mentioned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are two crucial points in the report: they are the twin proposals to phase out the opt-out, while opening a way to the annual calculation of working time. In that way we will maintain workers' safety while continuing to allow businesses the flexibility they need to thrive in the modern marketplace.</p>
<p class="contents">An opt-out from a piece of health and safety legislation is wrong in principle. It needs to end and we need to bring about a proper balance between working and family life. Our leaders pledged to make the European Union the most dynamic, knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better quality jobs and greater social cohesion. We will not achieve that by opening the door to a universal opt-out. That would be the path to a long-hours, low-pay economy, which is the exact opposite to what we are trying to achieve. If we do not end the opt-out, we should simply repeal the legislation and stop pretending that we want to put in place any sensible minimum standards at all on working time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress this: people have told me that this has nothing to do with work/life/family balance. It has. In 1996 the European Court of Justice ruled that this is a health and safety directive and that health and safety is about the total social, psychological and physical wellbeing of individuals. Family and working life balance has to do with the social and psychological wellbeing of all workers within the European Union. So let us nail that particular argument. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The more beneficial social systems, like the French labour law, are therefore not challenged and will remain enforceable. This point is essential, you suspect, in the context of the debate on the Constitution in France and in view of concerns raised by the drafting of European rules in the social field.</p>
<p class="contents">The stakes are nonetheless important. For us, ladies and gentlemen, it is a question of sending a clear signal as regards the social system that we hope to promote at European level. The ambitious objectives of the Lisbon Strategy make it necessary to adapt the European economy to new challenges. It is obvious that businesses should benefit from a dose of flexibility in the management of working time, but we sincerely believe that greater flexibility is not contradictory with a high level of workers’ health and safety. The balance between flexibility in the management of time and the safety of workers enforces the definition of minimum regulations and safeguards as well as suitable controls.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate surrounding the opt-out is thus of particular importance in this context. The option for an employer to contravene the legal limit of a 48-hour working week with the individual agreement of workers is, for us, clearly at odds with the spirit of the directive. I should like to point out that Parliament, during its examination of the 2004 report, was against keeping the individual opt-out agreement. Whilst we have hoped for the progressive abolition of the individual opt-out in a text that does not lean towards standardisation, however, we have given our support to keeping an opt-out option that would be managed by negotiation and collective conventions, in accordance with national customs. With regard to the reference periods, we agree with the rapporteur and the Commission on allowing an extension of not more than 12 months. This corresponds to the requirement for flexibility from the business community, which must naturally be able to deal with fluctuations in demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we remain convinced that all instances of on-call time must be considered working time. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs nevertheless proposes that Member States may authorise the calculation of the inactive parts of on-call time in a specific manner in order to comply with the maximum weekly working time. We endorse this provision that once again takes account of national customs in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For our Group, this is an extremely important piece of legislation. The limitation of working time has been an historic struggle for the labour movement and we should not be giving that away in the 21st century.</p>
<p class="contents">But according to a recent report from the Work Foundation, based in the UK, the pattern of working in excess of 60 hours a week is prevalent now throughout the European Union, particularly in certain sectors. I think this is something that we should not be welcoming but should actually be very worried about.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Verts/ALE<span class="italic"> </span>Group,<span class="italic"> </span>the control of working time is also about who controls your life, and this working time directive applies to employees. It is very important that people realise that. This is not just about having flexibility as a one-way street, but of bringing in the rights of employees. It is a health and safety issue. Tired workers are dangerous workers, whether they are operating on you or driving home. It is also a social health issue, in terms of a work/life balance, if we want our citizens to be active citizens involved in a whole set of other things. You cannot do that if you are working the entire time.</p>
<p class="contents">But the opt-out is a big issue for us. We will be told that this is about workers having a choice. A lot of the evidence shows that it is not a choice. It is something that is put in front of workers who are asked to sign away their rights to avoid employers having to negotiate or do paper work. Indeed, we find that in the UK two thirds of workers do not even know there is a limit to their working time.</p>
<p class="contents">For us the issue of on-call time as working time is also important, whether you are working in a burger bar or a hospital, and the compensatory rest element is also crucial, given that stress is one of the biggest causes of time off work and that is linked to working time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is highly critical of the report approved by a majority in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs because, unfortunately, on most issues it goes along with the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We reject the Commission proposal because it perpetuates opting out and strengthens social dumping. It feeds the unilateral power of the employer even more, on the pretext of corporate flexibility. It weakens the existing levels of protection of tens of millions of workers and the equilibrium within their families. It relaxes the current rules regulating working time introduced in the 1993 directive out of existence.</p>
<p class="contents">To be specific, the Commission proposal will allow the maximum working time to be as much as 65 hours a week, while the current directive and the International Labour Organisation Convention introduced a maximum permissible working week of 48 hours as long ago as 1919. We are turning the clock back 85 years.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the reference period for flexible working time has been extended from four to twelve months, while the necessary precondition of prior collective negotiation and agreement on the subject has been abolished. This will allow employers, in both the private and public sectors, to unilaterally and abusively manage the working time of workers, in the absence of the workers themselves, under the law or regulations. Similarly, the clear case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities has been circumvented with the misleading device of dividing on-call time into active and inactive on-call time. Thus, the Member States or employers acting alone can say that eight inactive working hours implies 0.8 hours active time. It is a mockery.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Court of Justice of the European Communities has imposed a rest period immediately after on-call time. How does the Commission interpret the word 'immediately'? One day, three days, three weeks? I greatly fear that the Commission's proposal is nothing other than a knife in the back of tens of millions of workers, especially in the health and service sectors. At the same time, however, it represents a danger to the health and safety of us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, would you want to be operated on by a surgeon who had been on call for 30 hours? Would you want to come across a lorry driver on the road who has been driving for 30 hours without a break? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The best deal a worker can get is to have a job, and this directive will not improve employment or social life.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the central objective of the EU is for each Member State to bring to the table its experience and skills, its best practice and ideas, share with the rest and strengthen all. So, allow this UK representative to bring to the table today some UK experience and practice: that less regulation equals more employment. Even Mr Špidla agreed with me on that to some degree a short while ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Denmark and Sweden apart, the United Kingdom has the lowest unemployment rate in the whole EU, way below the average EU rate. These countries have not taken the euro and the UK has not indulged in the more restrictive employment practices. The 48-hour week, rigidly enforced, will cause small firms to close or drive people into the black economy, where they are outside of all protection and where they will become avoiders of income tax and VAT. Flexibility can be provided by the opt-outs from the working week, which are due to be phased out in spite of a vote in this House on 24 February. Organisations like the United Kingdom Government, the chambers of commerce, EuroCommerce and Sky TV all want the opt outs to continue, but these bodies do not work in the pseudo-EU world of fancy plans and dead-hand regulation – they work in the real world of profit margins and of full employment as produced by the 48-hour opt out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It amounts to misplaced interference in the conditions of the labour market, and it is not surprising that the two sides of industry have rejected the directive. The conditions to which the directive relates differ widely across the 25 Member States and, no matter what positive things are inserted in the directive about the protection of employees and private life, it is and remains an expression of the EU’s obsession with regulation. The European Parliament clearly wants to see low growth. In my country, which without doubt has the EU’s highest standard of worker protection, these conditions are agreed between the two sides of industry. This has produced good results. Firstly, we have a larger proportion of the population of working age in the labour market than any other EU country. We do not have the strikes we see again and again in Belgium and France. We have a level of unemployment only half that of the eurozone, and we have the EU’s second highest gross national product per inhabitant.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incredible that we should have to put up with a situation in which the EU, which has not been able to solve these problems nearly so well as ourselves, is to tell us what to do. People would do better to come to Denmark, see the way to do things and then go home and work out, on a national basis, what they might do in terms of their own circumstances. It is quite impossible to assess how hard a nation works by looking at the length of its working time. What are crucial are methods of organisation, the training of the labour force and degrees of efficiency. In Denmark, people work efficiently, so the country can manage with shorter working hours. Foreigners should not interfere in these conditions, and I recommend voting against this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reasons for this include the scourge of unemployment and the economic problems faced by employers, particularly in the new Member States. A few days ago I was astonished to find that people in Poland were able to go shopping in Ikea until 8 p.m. on 1 May, which was not only Labour Day, but also a Sunday. Supermarkets frequently stay open until 10 p.m. on weekdays, and sometimes even round the clock. The threat of job losses and the shaky state of our economies make it hard to know whether one should support employer or employee groups, the positions of which are inherently opposed. It is for this reason that I regard Mr Cercas’ report and the amendments by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as a sensible compromise, and one aimed at improving people’s overall wellbeing. On-call time in the workplace should be regarded as working time, and employees should be paid a flat rate for on-call time outside the workplace. There are certain issues that need to be regulated jointly in the EU, and working time is one of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Denmark, Sweden and France, for example, are at liberty to have standards higher than those in this minimum directive. This is a minimum directive. Can we do without a minimum directive? No, we cannot, for a directive of this kind also affects indirectly what may be some countries’ very significantly higher standards. If we were to have a situation in which countries began to compete with each other in terms of long working hours, then that would affect the situation in Denmark, Sweden and France. Because we have free movement of capital, these matters are not unrelated to the principle of subsidiarity. That is the first thing.</p>
<p class="contents">The second concerns our responsibility as legislators. Does our responsibility stop at our national borders? Are we only to think about the free movement of companies or are we also to assume some responsibility for employees’ health? I believe that we must also assume some responsibility for employees’ health, and we therefore need a minimum directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we often talk about the need to reconcile family life and working life, but what is to become of this if we permit long working periods? It would lead to a situation in which it were men who worked and did not assume responsibility for their families, and then we should not obtain an equal society. That is why we need this proposal by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My congratulations are not just a formality, as from the very first words of the debate in which we participated, it was made clear to us how difficult it is to manage such a delicate subject.</p>
<p class="contents">I will only make reference to a few fundamental issues in my speech: protecting health and safety in the workplace is not merely the legal basis, but the reference that warrants this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I fail to see how people can assert that this is a threat to the principle of subsidiarity and to the safeguarding of our various national experiences. We must bear in mind that the principle of health and safety protection beyond certain limits on working hours constitutes a general safeguard value that demands a foundation of common rules and references for the very definition of the social and economic employment model and the principles from which the European Union must take its inspiration.</p>
<p class="contents">Every opportunity for flexible and specific regulation in this area must be defended and it is precisely because of that that I, like other Members, would prefer the fundamental principle to be that of referring back to the solutions adopted by means of collective bargaining in the various countries. That is, of course, in so far as collective bargaining exists, is effective and guarantees a regulatory foundation that can combine the requirements of flexibility and the specific organisation of working hours by sector with those of health and safety, which must be protected at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We will wait and see if it will be possible to make progress on this point, also in connection with the Council position. For the time being, I believe that the solutions adopted in the vote in committee guarantee such conditions, in the same way that they guarantee margins of flexibility thanks to the prospect of extending the reference period to 12 months.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, on the basis of this work, the positions that may develop in relation to the Council’s common position will guarantee ever more adequate solutions in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A social Europe requires minimum standards, and so we reject the Commission’s amendments to the Working Time Directive, which suspend these standards and turn the directive into nothing but an arbitrary abstraction.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments involve, among other things, the new-found idea of dividing on-call time into active and inactive working time, with parts of it no longer recognised as working time. As we see it, time spent on stand-by must continue to be regarded as working time. Worker protection and the safety of the public must continue to be given priority over economic considerations. Health workers working shifts of 30 hours or more put patients at risk; I do not think that there is any room for compromise here, and the ruling of the ECJ backs me up in this. Although I wish to thank the rapporteur for including this crucial sentence in the report, we cannot support the compromises that follow it. We see here a need for improvements, for we believe that on-call time must continue to be regarded as working time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Granted, we need to become more flexible and more competitive, but that is precisely what we find in the Cercas report on the Working Time Directive, and in the compromises on which my colleague Mr Silva Peneda and others from our group have worked.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to put the whole of the EU in a straitjacket; rather, we want a reasonable framework for action that leaves room for national regulations, for example to extend the reference period from four months to one year, provided that the social partners agree to this. Decisions on possible extensions of the 48-hour week, too, are a matter for them and for collective agreements. This is a practical expression of what subsidiarity and flexibility are about, but the basis for all this must continue to be the ruling in which the Court of Justice defined on-call time as working time. I regard the Commission proposal, which draws a distinction between paid active and unpaid inactive working time, as unrealistic.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell Commissioner Špidla that I, on one occasion, joined the staff of the biggest accident and emergency unit in Hessen for their night shift. The junior doctors, nurses and ambulance drivers were on call, and extremely actively so. The short breaks between callouts were not long enough to allow the staff to recharge their batteries. It is not only in hospitals that workers are entitled to job security and job satisfaction; there is a need for derogations from the directive for fire brigades, including those on airports, for rescue workers and for security workers in environmentally sensitive enterprises. I have talked to all of them. Familiar though I am with the hospitals’ financial worries, they must do what has been done in other sectors and find intelligent ways of reducing costs, improving the coordination of their staff’s callouts and making better use of technical facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us not forget the other costs that result when staff are, day in and day out, so stressed out that they run the risk of permanent damage to their health, not to mention the risk of exhausted staff making the wrong diagnosis or giving the wrong treatment. It is not acceptable that patients should be exposed to such risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do so because many Members are wondering why it is that this appears to be a particular problem in Germany, where the owners of hospitals are up in arms against the change proposed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, just as they once were against the rulings by the ECJ.</p>
<p class="contents">So, for the sake of clarification, let me explain that the ECJ’s ruling has been implemented in Germany, too, since 2004, when German law began to treat the whole of on-call time as working time, in precisely the same way that Mr Cercas’ report demands.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in practice, too, this can be done without too much difficulty, as is demonstrated by a study to which even the German Minister for Health has referred. I might add that, in Germany, there has been funding available since 2003 for the introduction of much-needed innovative models of working time and for the recruitment of some new doctors. Even then, there can be problems, but it is for that very reason that our Committee wants the opening clause, which would state that alternative arrangements could be made by collective agreement – and only in an emergency by law – to make allowance for the inactive periods. The problem is not the European Working Time Directive; the problem is German hospitals’ aversion to reform. For example, one German region, while being much smaller than Sweden, has far more hospitals and hospital beds. The issue with on-call time is the safety of the patients. Even though staying awake for a period of 24 hours is equivalent, in terms of its adverse effects, to having a blood-alcohol level of 1 per thousand, doctors often work over 30 hours at a stretch, and that is what must be changed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A high level of unemployment, in particular in some new Member States, the slow development of new workplaces, reduction of old workplaces in some sectors, for example, in the textile industry, and the fear of people, particularly in the provinces, that they will lose their jobs, enable employers to misuse the possibility of eliminating workplaces, or threatening dismissal if an employee refuses to work overtime. Work exceeding 48 hours per week can worsen the conditions of employees in all sectors even more, in particular those working in the service sector, creating not only physical, but also moral discomfort, and causing undesirable effects for families and the education of children.</p>
<p class="contents">If the necessity for prolongation of the workweek is argued from the point of view of the fear that businesses in the European Union will move to China or other countries, then we should ask ourselves whether one of the essential motives of the establishment of the European Union – the welfare of its citizens – becomes just a catchword, and whether we should seek other means for economic development and competitive abilities. On the other hand, the proposal of the European Parliament, in respect to employees having several work contracts and to summing up their working time according to each contract, deprives the citizens of those states where salaries are low, in such sectors as the health sector, which employs duty time, of the possibility of ensuring themselves an appropriate standard of living. Therefore, when adopting the amending directive, I suggest refraining from the ‘opt-out’ introduction into all sectors and not to sum up the working time in respect to people voluntarily working according to several work contracts, and leave such decisions to the national level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission is the guardian of the Treaties; the Commission proposed 10 years ago that the opt-out should exist. In the review now, 10 years on, the Commission is still proposing that the opt-out should continue to exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hughes said that the issue is about work/life balance. The rapporteur asserts that people are asking how Europe improves their living conditions. I do not believe that people are asking that. People are asking themselves how they can improve their living conditions for themselves. At the moment, the decision of many millions of them is to use the opt-out.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue before us today is: who decides? Should it be a small group of out-of-touch politicians dictating what makes a better quality of life for the people, or should it be the millions of workers themselves, who currently enjoy the right to choose and who want to continue to decide for themselves?</p>

<p class="contents">It is impossible to imagine the economic growth and development of Europe without the crucial contribution of the workers, the safeguarding of their quality of work and the protection of their health in the workplace. The working time directive is an essential element of a social Europe. We have to be fully aware that it will be impossible to reach these growth and development objectives, if we choose the ‘low road’ to competitiveness: that based on cost cutting and increased demands on the workforce. The high road is based on quality and innovation: in that context, human capital is vital and its qualitative contribution must be our objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cercas report offers a legitimate response to this objective. The report in question seeks to preserve the fundamental principles of the working time directive, as they are laid down in the European Constitution, on the issue of the reference period, on the opt-out and as regards the Court of Justice ruling relating to the periods of time spent on duty. The report contains strong support for the introduction of provisions aiming at helping employees to strike a balance between work and family life, and we therefore fully endorse the Cercas report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support measures that protect individuals from exploitation at work. We are not convinced that it is for the European Union to be the body that imposes unwanted restrictions, that have nothing to do with health and safety, on individuals in every Member State. We strongly disagree with Mr Hughes, of the British Labour Party, that the European Union should lay down the law with regard to the work/life/family balance of people everywhere. It is not surprising that we have to counter so much Euro-scepticism in Britain when senior Members of this Parliament call for the EU to be allowed to interfere in the lives of individuals to such an extent.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a European single market, but that does not overrule the fact that Member States compete against one another. If the people of one country want greater social protection at the risk of damaging their competitive position, then they should vote for a government that will do that. In many cases the Liberal Democrats will support them. But blanket controls imposed on every country by Brussels will limit the freedom of Member States to decide the approach most appropriate for them. It is excessive and wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also condescending for this Parliament to seek to impose restrictions on others, while excluding executives, MEPs and Commissioners. Speaking for myself, I have never worked less than a 48-hour week and I do not intend to start doing so. Applying these restrictions rigidly to workers in the tourist industry and the agricultural sector, with their extreme seasonal fluctuations, will simply drive people into the black economy. That is no way to promote the Lisbon Agenda. For practical reasons and for reasons of principle, the right to opt out should remain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My main focus in the course of this work is to ensure that it is made easier for the Member States to create new jobs. It is therefore important that flexible solutions be provided and that there is a reduction in detailed regulation and central control by the EU. Issues relating to working time should, in the first place, be the responsibility of the Member States, each of which should therefore have broad scope for finding its own solution. Industries too operate differently, and as individuals we also have different needs and desires regarding our working hours.</p>
<p class="contents">Issues of working time are an area in which national practice should apply and not matters that should be decided on by the EU. Unfortunately, there are powerful forces in this Parliament which wish to move in the opposite direction. They want to curtail the Member States’ ability to adjust things to their own traditions and needs. A single model has to apply for the whole of Europe, meaning that they want to introduce supranationalism where issues of working time are concerned. They do not want to allow the Member States to be different from one another and are content for all Europeans to want exactly the same things in terms of organising their working time. Unlike those people, I believe that what is most important in Europe today is to lay sound foundations for creating new jobs. Unlike them, I have faith that people themselves have a better idea than politicians of what best suits them.</p>
<p class="contents">As with so many other issues, it is not the case that one solution is best for everyone. We are different, and therein lie the charm and the strength of the EU. We consist of different states with different cultures and traditions. I want to give each European country the opportunity to retain its distinctive features and to give the Member States the power to decide about the issue of working time. It is not an issue to be regulated in detail at EU level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Good sense alone will tell us that, with the exception of jobs clearly demanded by those who carry them out, the reality of working 60 hours per week - or worse still, 63 hours with the authorisation granted in 1993 – as is the case in certain countries in the European Union, will pose problems in terms of adapting to one’s personal, family and social environment in the long run.</p>

This also involves our protecting their rights as employees and their rights in the workplace. For this, there must be rules; yes, indeed, but what rules? How many and how detailed must they be? The fundamental task must surely be – or so I have heard in this House over and over again in the course of the past year – that we give priority to enabling them to keep their jobs or to enabling them to have jobs in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now been presented with a Working Time Directive that committees of this House have considered – and made worse, not least in terms of the criteria of the Lisbon strategy. The whole thing boils down to us making more regulations. Rather than reducing regulation and becoming more flexible, we will end up with the very opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me illustrate that by a couple of questions. Firstly, why is it that we, in Europe, have to specify what it means to be on call? Must it mean the same thing in every hospital in every town in every country in Europe? And, if so, why? It is a fact, though, that there is a difference between what goes on in an accident and emergency department, where people often have to go out in the middle of the night, and the situation in an orthopaedic ward, where, at night, everyone is asleep! It is not acceptable – it is quite wrong – for these things to be tied to some sort of Procrustes’ bed!</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, why can the extension of working time be governed only by a collective agreement? Why can an individual employee not conclude an agreement for himself? Who, in fact, gives us the right to forbid workers to come to agreements for themselves concerning their jobs and the hours that they work? I know young doctors who would be perfectly willing to work a bit longer in future and to earn a bit more, because they are starting out on life or have just become property-owners. Do we, in future, seriously want to prohibit them from doing that? And what right do we have to do so?</p>
<p class="contents">Why, too, do we now also want to prescribe in minute detail the hours that family members may work? Why do we want to prevent family firms from being, in future, as flexible as they always have been in the past? Different work situations call for different solutions, and if we do not enable people to find them, we will be doing people an injustice and Europe a disservice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, if we abolish the opt-out, we must find a solution for stand-by times, an increasing number of countries are responding to the Court of Justice’s rulings by threatening to resort to the opt-out for sectors such as health care and care for the elderly. It would be unacceptable to us, Commissioner, if stand-by and rest times were to be excluded from working time, for that is the time during which the workers are at their employers’ disposal, and what is more, exclusion of those hours would have major implications not only for the safety and health of workers, but also for patients in hospitals and the elderly in rest homes.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the solution presented in the Cercas report is an excellent one, treating periods of on-call duty as working time, in accordance with the Court judgments, while proposing that we allow the stand-by and rest times to be calculated differently by collective agreement. I hope that the whole House will give Mr Cercas and his excellent report their backing, and let me say, Commissioner, that I hope that the Commission will change its position. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">An effort is being made to place the actual situation and the needs of each Member State within a general framework, which each partner evaluates from his own point of view and finds uncomfortably narrow and anything but protective of health and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the rapporteur, Mr Cercas, who deserves congratulations, and the shadow rapporteur of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Silva Peneda, and all the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality and, above all, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, did their very best, even if their opinions differed, to reconcile the differences.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus, the report to be put to the vote and the amendments to it – not the Commission's proposal, Mr Papadimoulis – do not accept the extension; they put an end to the derogation from the 8-hour day, they do not accept the Commission's proposal for an upper limit of 65 hours, they safeguard the 48-hour week and, in all events, they propose that conditions of work and safety and the need for free time and lifelong learning be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cercas proposal reinstates respect for the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities with regard both to working time limitations and on-call time, which is expressly referred to as working time. It likewise respects the principle of subsidiarity and safeguards social dialogue as a regulatory factor. Calculating working time on an annual basis is a compromise solution, but it will have consequences, unfortunately, for low-income workers relying on overtime in peak periods.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issues which concern working women in families, I would comment that the European Commission may have forgotten them, but Parliament is being called on to vote in favour of Amendment 12, which emphasises that employers must take account of the needs of lifelong professional and family life, and Amendment 22 requiring the Commission to submit ....</p>

<p class="contents">The parliamentary report before us goes too far, however, and could create serious problems, especially in Member States that have not yet obtained a certain standard of living. Why should we remove workers’ right to increased wages, especially in new Member States where people necessarily have to work longer hours in order to increase their incomes? What are workers who borrowed money from banks in the form of home loans going to do?</p>
<p class="contents">It is right to have ever higher social standards. However, we must understand that we are dealing with reality, not theory. At a time when we are talking so much about the Lisbon Strategy in order to make our economy grow and to create work, we should not pass laws that are less flexible. Workers want us to pass laws that create jobs, not to stop them from working more than eight hours’ overtime per week. Who are we to take this right away from them?</p>
<p class="contents">I would be the first to agree that the working week should be shorter, but only if wages are enough to live on. Some countries have not yet reached that position. So let us use common sense. If there is anyone who abuses the opt out and works an excessive number of hours with risks to health and safety, then let us attack this abuse.

The opt-out from the 48-hour week must finally be removed. No country should be exempt from the rules governing working time and thus have a labour market in which employees are exposed to impossible and exhaustingly long working weeks. The opt-out makes no contribution to a social Europe. It opens the way to social dumping, whereby countries can pick and choose which rules they want to follow. That is not the way forward for Europe. We cannot and must not compete in terms of either low wages or long working days. Europe’s populations must feel that the European Union has their interests at heart. All studies clearly show that long working weeks are harmful to both safety and health. A 48-hour working week which had better definitions of working time and recreational time and which called on companies to take account of workers’ family lives, would increase employees’ options. By voting in favour of the committee’s report, we shall show the people of Europe that we want a social and just Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow, we will be able to take a step in the right direction by voting in favour of a flexible, modern and forward-looking revision of the Working Time Directive. A European directive must, by definition, allow the Member States the creative space and flexibility to apply it in their own way, and so our main objective, at European level, must be only to set out the guiding principles.</p>
<p class="contents">If what the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has proposed is accepted, that is, if the whole of the time spent on call is, in principle, to be treated as working time, and if the opt-out is to be abolished, then this will represent a considerable hindrance to flexible working arrangements throughout Europe. This is not what I would regard as a modern solution. It cannot be fair that we should set down as applicable to the workers concerned the principle that time spent on call is seen in its entirety as working time, for there is no likelihood of, for example, fire-fighters, youth workers and staff in rehabilitation centres over-exerting themselves, as being on call in these involves being inactive for most of the time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is for that reason that we advocate the drawing of distinctions between different types of on-call service. Let the hospitals, the doctors, the fire services and the youth workers, together with the local social partners, decide among themselves what working arrangements are right for them. Let us vote to give workers freedom of choice. Let us opt for flexibility, which requires the opt-out, longer reference periods and reasonable and appropriate differentiation between different types of standby duty. It is for these that we are aiming with our Amendments 26, 27 and 32, along with Amendments 29 and 30 on on-call services, and these I ask you to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we know, it is in the workplace where law and practice differ the most. The more means a country needs to mobilise in order to catch up, the larger the gap becomes between rules and reality.</p>
<p class="contents">In the new Member States, the length of working time is just barely above the European average, but the actual number of hours worked annually is 112 more, almost three weeks more, than in the existing States. It is therefore especially important for us to set clear limits for working time. Consistent participation of social partners in the creation of local rules is important, and so is the improvement of monitoring mechanisms on both a Community and Member State level. Parliament’s compromise proposal promises that the role of trade unions will become more important, the individual will not be left alone and that by monitoring Member State compliance with guarantees, it will establish consistent practice in the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before I focus on the individual amendments in more detail, I should like to make a number of more general comments. Firstly, I would note that this proposal for a directive is a proposal for an amending directive. The original directive, which has already been in force for 10 years, needs to be amended from time to time, not least because provision is made in the directive itself for future amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I should like to emphasise that this is a directive that relates to safety and health at work. Its aim is therefore not to reorganise working time, but to protect workers, at the same time as maintaining the much-needed flexibility demanded by the Lisbon Strategy, and indeed by modern life itself. The issues that form the backdrop to this directive are extremely complex. They include the ageing of the population, which is something that calls for a much better balance between working life and social life. As I have already highlighted, the directive relates to the protection of working time. I have no hesitation in stating that working time has an overall influence on safety and health at work. Consideration is currently being given to an extension of working lives as a result of demographic developments in society, and there can be no question that people need to reach the end of these working lives in good health.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate we have just heard covered a number of key proposals, which I should like to deal with in more detail. I shall begin with the proposal for an extension of the reference period for calculating the maximum average working week of 48 hours.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will be aware, the Commission is proposing that matters should be left as they stand, or in other words that the ‘standard’ reference period should continue to be four months, with the option of extending it to twelve months by means of collective agreements. The Commission wishes to ensure that the same conditions apply in all Member States, irrespective of the way in which relations between social partners are organised, and I would therefore propose that it should also be possible to extend this reference period by means of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to see that Parliament’s position does not differ greatly from that of the Commission on this matter, and in fact Parliament’s proposal offers a better guarantee that this extension will be possible. I am therefore able to tell you that the Commission can accept almost all of Parliament’s proposals in this respect, with the exception of that stating that the reference period may only be extended by means of legislation if the worker in question is already covered by collective agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not believe that collective agreements should be favoured to the extent that the use of legislation is denied in instances where either the reference period has not been discussed or no agreement has been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Parliament’s position with regard to on-call periods, although it does appreciate Parliament’s concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make our views on this issue quite clear. The basic aim of the Commission’s proposal is to provide a guarantee of legal certainty, and I am sure I do not need to remind you that this problem has arisen as a result of the way in which the Luxembourg Court of Justice has interpreted the concept of ‘working time’. The Commission has chosen not to regard ‘inactive on-call time’ as working time for safety and health at work purposes, in order to leave the Member States free to take the measures they believe will best protect workers’ safety and health.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that Parliament’s proposal, as set out in Amendment 10, would provide the same level of legal certainty, and it could well leave the door open for further judgments that would lead to even greater legal uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, fully appreciate Parliament’s concerns, which it has outlined in the draft report. The Commission will therefore amend its proposal in such a way as to ensure that on-call workers are better protected. The inclusion of inactive on-call time in the daily rest period of 11 hours and the weekly rest period of 24 hours will not be permitted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to say a few words on the delicate issue of individual opt-outs. Although both Parliament and the Commission are critical of the practical implementation of this provision, the two institutions hold differing views on its future. The Commission is proposing that the issue be reviewed, whilst Parliament is calling for the opt-out clause to be abolished three years after the directive comes into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept this proposal as it stands. It is, however, willing to discuss it, and to work together with legislators, who are themselves divided on the issue, in order to find the best possible compromise. I am aware that this is a very political issue, and also a matter of principle. In view of this, the Commission will continue to engage in intensive dialogue with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to outline the Commission’s position on the individual amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments 2, 3, 12, 13 and 17 in full, as they either improve the text of the proposal or make it clearer. One of them introduces a provision regarding improvements to work-life balance, which I regard as a key issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept Amendments 1, 4, 8, 11, 16, 18, 19, 24 and 29 either in principle, in part or on the condition that they are reworded. In particular, I should like to draw the House’s attention to Amendments 16 and 18, on compensatory rest, and Amendment 19, on the reference period.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is unable to accept Amendments 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 14, 15, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 to 28 and 30 to 52, some of which relate to the individual opt-out that I have already discussed. As I said before, the Commission intends to seek a compromise solution to this issue. The remaining amendments deal with matters not covered in the Commission’s original proposal, for example Article 17(1) on the derogation for managing executives.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to thank Parliament for the high quality of the debate that has been held on this proposal. The dialogue between the Commission and Parliament has made it possible for me to state with confidence that the directive which we now have, and which serves as a symbol of a social Europe, does even more to protect the health and safety of workers, whilst ensuring that the latter are not jeopardised by the flexible organisation of working time called for by our entrepreneurs. It therefore helps to build a stronger and more modern European social model. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also the fault of certain political groups, because one-minute speeches never last for one minute, they always overrun. That can be dealt with in the Conference of Presidents. I would be happy to abolish one-minute speaking time slots in favour of two minutes. We can discuss the matter but we have to agree on it.</p>
