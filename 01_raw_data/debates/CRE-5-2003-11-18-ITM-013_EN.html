<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, the Commission proposal addresses the acknowledged need for urgent reinforcement of the current rules for identification and registration of sheep and goats, in particular in view of the experience acquired from the 2001 FMD crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">In its resolution on foot and mouth disease of December 2002, the European Parliament stated that the Commission should submit, as quickly as possible, a proposal to amend Directive 92/102/EEC so as to improve the identification of pigs, sheep and goats.</p>
<p class="contents">According to current legislation sheep and goats must be identified with an ear-tag or a tattoo linked to the holding. The keepers must keep an up-to-date register on the holding, and the competent authority must keep an up-to-date central register of holdings.</p>
<p class="contents">The main new elements of the proposed system are individual identification, double ear-tagging to ensure that identity is retained where one ear-tag is lost, and the introduction of a movement document.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of a reinforced system will have a positive impact in case of outbreaks of major animal diseases, such as foot and mouth disease, allowing for the rapid identification of the source of infection and limiting the further spread of disease. Furthermore, it will facilitate accurate tracing of animals in the framework of the animal disease eradication programmes financed by the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The technology of electronic identification for sheep and goats has progressed to such a stage that it can now be applied in practice. This is supported by the results of the Commission’s large-scale pilot project – the IDEA Project.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the implementing measures required for a fully-functioning system of electronic identification on a Community scale have yet to be developed. The proposal, therefore, provides for further guidelines and procedures to be adopted through the Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health, with entry into force of obligatory electronic tagging foreseen for 1 July 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware of the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal therefore includes options, which would allow Member States to defer the identification of lambs up to the age of 6 months, where sheep are kept under extensive farming conditions in free range, and to apply simplified identification arrangements to young lambs, up to 6 months of age, intended for direct slaughter.</p>
<p class="contents">The options decided upon will influence the likely costs to farmers of introducing the new system.</p>
<p class="contents">The estimation of the costs of introduction of the reinforced system on a Community-wide basis has to take into account the diversity of the sheep population and the sheep production systems in the Member States. In the absence of precise information on movements and other parameters, the estimate has to be based on the general structure of the various production systems.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis the overall costs of the reinforced system are estimated to vary between 1 euro (for traditional ear-tags) and 3.7 euro (electronic identification) per sheep per year.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal foresees that the Commission shall, if necessary, submit to the Council a report on the experience gained concerning electronic identification.</p>
<p class="contents">This report could be accompanied by proposals amending, if appropriate, the date by which electronic identification should become obligatory.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that this proposal will require significant efforts by both operators and authorities, but these efforts are both worthwhile and necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was the clear conclusion of the experience derived from the outbreak of foot and mouth disease.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also agreement that the eventual aim should be a cost-effective electronic identification system.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals from the Commission, which are the subject of this report, bridge the gap between present practice and the agreement to introduce electronic methods. The proposals envisage a complicated control system based on individual identification numbers and the recording of all these numbers when sheep and goats are moved. The proposals would certainly achieve the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, they do not take into account the differing methods of sheep and goat rearing in the Member States: the difference in farming conditions from mountainous regions to lowland pasture or the differing sizes of sheep and goat herds, which can vary from a handful to thousands. They fail to take into account the differing numbers in the Member States, which can range from a few hundred thousand to millions.</p>
<p class="contents">More seriously, the proposals would impose an impossibly costly and labour-intensive recording system where sheep numbers are large. The proposals are based on the current passport method which is used to trace the movement of cattle but, sadly, ignore the differences between cattle and sheep.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals fail to take into account cultural differences which, in other circumstances, we would be seeking to encourage.</p>
<p class="contents">If the proposals were to be implemented they would threaten the future of sheep rearing in Europe as we know it. I suppose that getting rid of sheep is a sure way of getting rid of disease.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development simply asks, in this report, that the differing factors should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Primarily, the committee unanimously wants batch control systems to be allowed as well as individual control, and for the Member States to be able to apply both systems according to circumstances. Batch systems can work. They do so now for pigs, though I would not claim that there is no difference between sheep and pigs.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee amendments – which the Commissioner managed not to refer to – make detailed and effective rules for both systems of traceability. Common sense and economics should dictate which is used.</p>
<p class="contents">Regrettably, Commissioner Byrne does not seem to have been listening to what has been going on in the Committee on Agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by quoting Commissioner Fischler, the Commissioner responsible for agriculture, who recently said: 'We want farmers to spend the bulk of their working days in the fields and not filling out forms.'</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the key to the whole thing because, as Mr Adam has said, we very much want to be able to trace sheep movements. However, we have to realise that in the UK alone there are 35 million sheep and there are probably up to 100 million individual movements of sheep. The idea that every sheep could be recorded with a 14-digit number when it is being moved is completely ridiculous.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me take you through a scenario. A thousand ewes with 1 200 lambs are taken to the hillside. Six months later those sheep return and some of them have lost their tags. The Commission still insists that they should have the same individual number. I say to Commissioner Byrne quite clearly – and I am sure he realises this because he is an intelligent man – that the idea that the lamb will have the same tag is absolutely ridiculous. We have to realise that if you make the law an ass, it will be seen as an ass and we must be very careful to bring in legislation that is practical.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee has voted for batch movements of sheep and it is clear that if those batches are moved you will be able to trace where they have been. If there is a problem with scrapie in sheep then the whole flock will be slaughtered, so individual numbers are not necessary. Provided that the holding number is on the tag, that is all that is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">As we move forward into electronic systems, we have to be absolutely sure of the cost to the industry of introducing this. We also need a system that will be practical. I have seen systems demonstrated in hotel rooms, but they have to be demonstrated on the hillside in pouring rain, to farmers and shepherds who can easily deal with that system.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these things have to be practical, because we need the sheep and lamb industry. I recently visited New Zealand, which has a lot of sheep. Sheep are necessary to the European Union, and we must be careful not to price ourselves out of that industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge the Commission to look at our report practically and wake up to the idea that we have got it right. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has produced a wonderful report and, throughout its production, he has shown great skill in introducing all those aspects which could improve it and make it more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been said in this debate, the identification and traceability of goats is an essential element in the control of animal health and, also, of course, food safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The problems of identification in this type of livestock are very significant; the movement of livestock which can take place within one year, which has an enormous influence on the problems of traceability, or the way in which the lives of this type of livestock are spent, which hinders adequate registration and identification by means of the current systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that it is very important to establish a sufficiently long transitional period during which we can adopt flexible measures in order to reach a date, naturally, when the electronic identification becomes obligatory for all the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we understand that the additional cost of an electronic identification system must not be an additional cost which solely and exclusively falls to breeders, but which must be taken on by society as a whole, since it is society which will benefit from the implementation of such a system of traceability and identification as ambitious as the one being proposed to us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By contrast, the Adam report recognises the practicalities of hill farming and of managing flocks on a large scale. It also recognises, as the beef labelling regulation failed to do, that the requirements of traceability for the purposes of disease control are different from those involved in providing information for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibilities of using individual and/or batch identification, the simplification of coding and alternatives to double tagging, as proposed by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, are all very welcome. Although I would prefer not to have had any date specified for the introduction of electronic tagging, I am glad that the committee has recommended a year's postponement and a real cost-benefit analysis, as well as calling for the EU – not farmers – to bear the financial burden involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Trials of the equipment to be used will also be of major importance. Can the chosen identifier be securely and safely located as far as the animal is concerned? Will both placing the identifier and using the electronic reader be feasible on difficult terrain and in adverse weather? Will the reader be robust enough to withstand these conditions?</p>
<p class="contents">These are issues on which farmers are rightly looking for reassurance. I hope it will be afforded to them.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by congratulating the rapporteur on his report and on the fact that it received the unanimous support of the Agriculture Committee. I hope for a similar outcome in tomorrow's vote. I join colleagues in urging the Commission to accede to our views. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From our initial Committee discussions it was evident that these proposals had been drafted with little, if any, appreciation or understanding of the sheep farming industry. Many of the Members who have visited sheep farms, or who are indeed farmers themselves, have become increasingly exasperated by the Commission's blind approach in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been visited in Strasbourg this week by a group of farmers from Wales who would be happy, if they were allowed, to bring sheep with ear-tags into the Chamber to give the officials an idea of the impracticality of what is being proposed. Like me, they want to improve traceability in this sector to avoid any future spread of disease, but this must be achieved in a realistic way.</p>
<p class="contents">In Wales, which has the highest concentration of sheep in the EU, you could not realistically at present expect to convince a traditional hill farmer, with an average age of 58 and an average annual income of EUR 10 000, of the benefits of investing in new and complicated technology, the set-up costs for which have been estimated at EUR 15 000.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to take on board the report's major recommendations, to come back with a comprehensive cost analysis for these proposals and to acknowledge the effectiveness of recording batch movements of sheep until such time as electronic identification becomes a viable and practical proposition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The IDEA project, implemented a few years ago by the European Commission, demonstrated that it is possible to implement an individual electronic identification system in the European Union. The proof that the system is viable can be found in the fact that Spain, a country which, together with the United Kingdom, has one of the most significant herds in the European Union, has just gone ahead with the purchase of a million devices which are placed in the digestive system of ruminants for the differentiation of the different genotypes of sheep and goats.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the foot and mouth crisis, which decimated the United Kingdom's cattle stocks, it is urgent that we implement an individual identification system like the one which is being discussed, in order to try to prevent the recurrence of this type of veterinary epidemic.</p>
<p class="contents">As a former chairperson of the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, I would like to congratulate the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the European Parliament because we have been able to achieve compromise positions in the report approved in the Committee on Agriculture. I would like to point out that, at the end of the work carried out by the Temporary Committee on Foot and Mouth Disease, the European Parliament expressed its support for individual identification, a position which was taken up by the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we will vote on tomorrow contains two compromise amendments adopted by the Committee on Agriculture, which respect the interests of the European Union's producers. One of them relates to the age from which the identification of animals must be carried out. According to the compromise achieved, this is six months for intensive breeding and nine in the case of extensive breeding. The second compromise amendment, presented by the rapporteur, sets the date of July 2007 for the introduction of electronic identification, which sends a clear message to both breeders and the industry manufacturing the devices necessary for the electronic system.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope that the results achieved in the Committee on Agriculture are fully adopted in plenary. However, I would like to express my support for the technical modifications introduced by our shadow rapporteur, in the only amendment which has been presented in plenary, relating to the document on the transport of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to end by congratulating the rapporteur, who has made the effort to achieve compromise and to work in favour of identification and therefore in favour of cattle breeding. Congratulations, Mr Adam. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Cox referred to the real concerns that exist in the UK, by saying that Parliament, the Commission and the Council are now committed to the concepts of developing subsidiarity and no disproportionate regulation. If that were so, we would have to look at these proposals within that context.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody challenges the need for better identification, but the truth of the matter is that the UK Government itself has calculated that the cost of introducing this system in the UK will be just short of GBP 100 million, a cost of between GBP 13 000 and GBP 16 000 per farmer. We heard from Commissioner Byrne that the EU has made its own estimate. I have more faith in the calculation of the UK Government than I have in the calculation of the EU authorities. The fact of the matter is that the committee has been unanimous in its view. The speeches that we will hear this evening will be unanimous in their view. They will be in favour of better identification but also of proceeding by way of practicality, flexibility, looking at operating different methods within Member States, and of having identification – certainly within the United Kingdom – on the basis of batch control numbers.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to the Commissioner that there is unanimity across this Parliament, from Mr Wyn, my political opponent in Wales, to Mrs Attwooll, who is from another party in the United Kingdom and Mr Adam, from the Labour Party. We are all unanimous in this view. It is a view that the Commission should take on board.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, I have not been terribly encouraged by the stance adopted by the Commission. Mr Adam has done a great deal to achieve unanimity, and I congratulate him on that, as other speakers have done. We have the facility of trying to persuade Mr Adam, if there is no movement on the part of the Commission, to consider having this report referred back to committee. I hope the Commissioner will be in a position to respond positively to the amendments that have been proposed by the committee. However, if the Commission simply closes the door on us, then I for one will be among those who seek to persuade Mr Adam tomorrow to ask for this report to be referred back to committee so that we can stress to the Commission that it must be a listening Commission – not just when people appear before the CBI in the United Kingdom but also with regard to the daily work we do at Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have known Mr Adam for over 14 years and he did not deserve this – he deserved better. He has done a tremendous job on what was a terrible proposal in the first instance.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that this will not work at ground level. I am totally in favour of what has been said about batch or flock identification. That will work, can work and is controllable. Anything other than that is totally irrelevant at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I will be totally in favour of electronic tagging, when we have the technology and when it is cheap enough. However, it has to be clearly assumed that that is something for the future. The Commissioner has to take on board one other very important point: the question of who pays, because sheep farmers cannot afford this. They have been battered for far too long. They are surviving in atrocious conditions to provide lamb for consumption in the European Union. To put this burden on them is totally unacceptable and for the producer it is unworkable.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a lot of respect for the Commissioner, but I have to say to him that it would be extremely helpful if his officials could put forward proposals after getting out of their glass ivory towers in Brussels and going to see the conditions people actually have to work and live in. Do you know what it is like at lambing time? Has anyone got a clue what it is like to lamb a flock of sheep day and night? Many farmers do not even sleep for days. This does nothing for the industry. We are over-regulating the industry; we are strangling agriculture by our regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am told that in the United Kingdom, if you buy a chicken sandwich, 85% of the chicken comes from Brazil or Thailand. Where is it traceable to? How can there be traceability there? The agricultural industry cannot take any more of this. I urge the Commissioner to reflect on what has been said here tonight. This is sincere and from the heart. This is the people talking. I urge you to reflect and agree with the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and give us more time to get a proper identification system that will work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 graphically and horrifically underlined the inadequacy of Council Directive 92/102/EEC on the identification and registration of animals, including sheep and goats. Therefore I broadly welcome proposals for a regulation reinforcing the provisions of that directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteur, Neil Parish, for the excellent and cooperative work they have done to bring us to this point. I fully support the position adopted by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on the proposals before us.</p>
<p class="contents">In theory all Member States favour an individual identification system, but there are two camps. Firstly those countries generally in favour of the proposals which, apart from France, tend to be the states with lower sheep numbers, including Ireland, and secondly those which maintain it would be completely impractical and too costly to implement an individual system in advance of electronic identification.</p>
<p class="contents">This latter group includes Spain, Portugal, Greece and very definitely the UK, where there are huge numbers of sheep and geographical factors amplify the considerable concerns of the sheep industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council presidency has now presented a compromise on the original proposals, which would drop all recording of individual sheep numbers until such a time as an electronic recording system is in place, and secondly would introduce compulsory electronic identification for sheep and goats from 1 January 2008, subject to a Commission report on implementation by June 2006. Thirdly, it would allow a derogation from compulsory electronic identification for Member States with flocks of less than five hundred thousand.</p>
<p class="contents">The official Irish position, ironically, is that we are in favour of individual identification on a manual basis because we introduced such a system in June 2001. We are normally the ones making justified complaints, and now I fully support my UK and Spanish colleagues and the case they are making on their particular circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in Ireland we are not in favour of the double tagging proposed, because this would result in a higher workload for flock owners and significantly increase the associated costs, such as tag replacement, without adding any value to our current system.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment in Ireland, a permanent sheep tag costs 30 cents. Two such tags would be 60 cents, before taking labour costs into account, plus the replacement rate, which by definition is very high in sheep because of their grazing habits.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already been through the pain barrier and currently have an individual identification system in place. That gives us full traceability of sheep on an individual basis from the farm of origin to carcass. This system was introduced to ensure that Ireland operates to the highest standards of disease monitoring and control and is at the forefront in terms of consumer assurance and food safety. Most importantly for us in Ireland, it gives us a considerable advantage in relation to the export market.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not want to go backwards and replace our current system – that is the official line, speak to the farmers if you want to hear what they have to say – with what amounts to no more than a flock identification system that will not give full traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise system would not allow the movements of an individual sheep to be traced. It would not provide any basis for scrapie control or genotyping, which has to be based on individual identification.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, Ireland is seeking an accommodation within the proposal to retain certain aspects of its current individual identification system pending the introduction of a compulsory electronic system. As colleagues have said, let us harmonise the objective but not necessarily the methodology. The long-term objective should be a cost-effective electronic identification system. In the meantime, there should be batch numbers for those countries who want them and individual tag numbers for other countries, like Ireland, depending on the scale of operations and the geographical factors involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither can the Commission undertake field trials as foreseen by Amendment 21.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to Amendments 4 and 7 concerning the role of the Joint Research Centre. However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 1 or 2, as reliable registration cannot be achieved through electronic identification only.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to the linguistic Amendment 12. However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendment 28, as this issue is covered by general rules.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to Amendment 14, as the responsibilities of the transporter shall include the assurance that animals are properly identified and registered.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also agree to Amendments 20 and 32, as regards the provisions of the mark, but the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 19, 31, 32 or 33, as animals shall keep the same identification code when means of identification are replaced so as to ensure traceability.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot agree to Amendments 30 and 32, by which animals shall be identified by an eartag or a tattoo in one ear only. The double tagging is essential to ensure that identity is retained where one eartag is lost. The second eartag can be replaced by an electronic identifier.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to Amendment 34, accepting that eartags may be made of metal or plastic and may consist of one or two parts, taking into account approval by the competent authority.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can agree to Amendments 8, 9, 10, 11, 15, 16, 25, 26, 39 and 40. However, the Commission cannot agree to Amendments 22 or 24, as the competent authority shall establish the database including the procedures for submission of data.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot agree to Amendments 35, 36, 38 or 41 with regard to batch-recording as the general system. Individual identification is essential for the effective tracing of animals for veterinary purposes, which is of crucial importance for the control of contagious diseases. Therefore, a general system based on batch-recording is not acceptable. Batch-recording does not achieve the results that are required by this proposal, bearing in mind that the batch may well be broken up again and again, in which case traceability becomes quite impossible. This is something that many people in the House will remember when we recollect the difficulties that were presented to the authorities in a number of Member States, including, in particular, the UK, in seeking to achieve good traceability at the outbreak of the foot and mouth disease crisis, where three weeks passed before there was effective identification in some cases. That was in a context, as far as I am aware, where 19 farms were infected by the disease from the time of the announcement of the movement order restriction to the implementation of that movement order restriction: only a matter of hours, not weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot agree to Amendments, 5, 13 or 29, as Community financing is not foreseen.</p>

However, it must be said that despite all the rigmarole of what the Commission would or would not agree to, the fact emerges that the Commission is not prepared to budge at all on the question of batch control. I take it that is the Commission's position. As far as the fundamentals of this report are concerned, the Commission has not moved an inch. That is what we will have to consider when we vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, this sort of marking, without Community funding, will place a great financial burden on sheep and goat farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Especially in Greece, where sheep and goat farming employs the farmer's whole family, day and night, 365 days a year, with no Christmas or Easter break and with an unacceptably low financial result in relation to the effort made and the capital invested, such an unreasonable and unfair financial burden would force numerous farmers to abandon their work and the countryside and would tragically reduce the animal stock. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, handicrafts which only make cheese from ewe's and goat's milk would close, with the result that unemployed cheese-makers would join the unemployed farmers, reducing the production of unique Greek cheeses based on ewe's and goat's milk such as feta.</p>
<p class="contents">Bold Community funding is more than needed in order to avoid all this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, the general introduction of electronic tagging of sheep and goats by 1 July 2006 is considered very rushed for Greece, where there are more sheep and goats than in the other fourteen Member States together, which is why this deadline should be extended by at least a year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
