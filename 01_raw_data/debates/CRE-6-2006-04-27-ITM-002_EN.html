<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gary Titley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Madam President, I want you to imagine a scene: it is a dark and stormy night, it is cold, wet and windy, and you are driving along unfamiliar roads – possibly even lost – when, all of a sudden, something is in your way. You are forced to swerve and you hit a tree, knocking yourself unconscious. At that point, a relatively minor accident could become very serious: you could be in shock, you could develop hypothermia, you could have bleeding which if not stemmed could be fatal. If you are not knocked unconscious, do you know where you are? Do you know anything about the emergency 112 number? Indeed, do you have a mobile phone or is your battery flat? In all of those circumstances a relatively minor accident could be lethal. That is because of what is known as the golden hour principle: if you receive treatment within the first hour you are more likely not only to have your life saved but also to have a reduction in the intensity of injuries.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we need eCall, which is a pan-European in-vehicle emergency call system based on the 112 emergency number. If you have an accident, a device within the vehicle will be triggered by the airbag going off, by a sudden rise in temperature in the car, by the car overturning or by sudden deceleration. When it is triggered it will send data – such as the time, location and identification of the vehicle – to a public safety answering point, which will then alert the emergency services who will come rushing to your aid. This device could also be triggered manually and have a voice call so you could communicate with the emergency services.</p>
<p class="contents">I know there are some issues about privacy, but let us be clear that this system works only when it is triggered in an accident and is not a device for tracing where you are when you are driving. This came out of the Emerge project, which was funded by the Fifth Framework Programme, and I should emphasise that much of the technology is here now and some cars already have it. However, there is no common platform.</p>
<p class="contents">We need this because 40 000 people are killed on our roads every year and 1.6 million people are injured. The cost is EUR 160 billion, or 2% of the EU’s GDP. We hope to halve the number of deaths by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Thus eCall is the first building block in the Commission’s Intelligent Car Initiative. Most measures are designed to stop accidents happening, but accidents will inevitably happen and it is in those circumstances that we need eCall. Research has shown that it will reduce the response time in rural areas by 50% and in urban areas by up to 40%. That will save 2500 lives, reduce serious injuries by 15% and so cut road-traffic accident bills by EUR 22 billion a year. It will also cut accident-related congestion by about another EUR 4 billion a year. Therefore, it is a great idea.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, it is a very complicated idea, because a huge range of stakeholders need to come together – the car industry, the telecoms industry, emergency services, public authorities – to get this introduced on a coherent basis on a common platform. That is why the eCall Driving Group was set up. It has produced a Memorandum of Understanding, which binds stakeholders to implement equal and agreed principles and an agreed timetable whereby we will have full-scale tests in 2007, PSAPs will be upgraded by the end of 2007 and we will introduce this in all new vehicles in 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">We have over 50 signatures, but unfortunately only seven are from Member States and ironically one is from a non-Member State – Switzerland. If there is no commitment to this scheme from the public authorities it will not happen, because the industry cannot justify the research without the commitment of public authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed? We need to publicise 112 as a lot of people do not know about it. This system requires enhanced 112, which involves caller location. Member States have an obligation to have it under the 2002 directive, but many of them do not. We need to have PSAPs upgraded to deal with this. Many countries are doing that at the moment, but there is still a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">This will cost money: the device in the car will cost anything from EUR 150 to EUR 450, but, if done properly, the price will come down. We need the PSAPs to be upgraded. This will cost about EUR 4.5 billion a year. However, set against savings of EUR 26 billion, there is a huge cost benefit to this device.</p>
<p class="contents">My message to you is quite simple: this is a great device, it will save lives, it will save money, but we need the public authorities to get their finger out and get on with this, because they are the ones who are dragging us back.</p>

<p class="contents">It is very encouraging to see that Parliament recognises eCall as one of the priorities of the e-safety initiative, if not the key priority, and the first building block for the Intelligent Car Initiative which I launched last February. I would also like to thank Parliament because it gives the Commission continuous support in the efforts to get the Member States on board. As the rapporteur said: the difficult part of the project is getting them to sign the Memorandum of Understanding. I really hope that your report will give a positive signal to the Member States so that we can have them all on board.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased also to note that Parliament shares our views on the emergency number 112 and calls on Member States to make progress in the use of this number. You know that the Commission has already taken steps, by organising a high-level conference on 112 in October last year and by setting up an expert group on emergency communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament would like to synchronise the introduction of eCall with the Galileo timetable. I agree that Galileo will offer better positioning performances once it is operational. However, our target is to roll out eCall as soon as possible, and therefore I encourage the industry to develop a solution based on currently available technologies, such as GPS.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with Parliament that the cost-benefit analysis is critical, especially in making a convincing business case for eCall and I would like to underline the figures that your rapporteur has just quoted. I think this cost-benefit analysis shows that not only can you save lives, you can also save a good deal of money. Some Member States like Finland have started their own analysis, which I welcome, and the Commission has started a very comprehensive study called eImpact.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that the industry can produce in-vehicle systems that fulfil the performance criteria with affordable prices when produced in large volumes, so it is a question of getting started and then introducing the system in all cars. We in the Commission do not intend to intervene with the industry on this issue, but we are encouraging equipment manufacturers to work with telecommunication equipment suppliers and mobile network operators in the design of the in-vehicle systems, which require reliability, robustness and functionality.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome Parliament’s call to the stakeholders to look into the use of incentives. Consumer studies indicate that, although they value safety very highly, consumers may not be willing to pay extra for safety features in cars. With the support of Parliament we will continue to pursue two lines of discussion on the issue of incentives, namely the financial incentives with the Member States and the possible reduction of insurance premiums with the insurance industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the issue of getting eCall to users in rural and isolated areas, I would like to point out that eCall is for all, including the more affordable car models. It is not a luxury car item but for all citizens and for all cars. How quickly its use will spread will of course depend on many things, for example, whether or not we manage to implement the incentive schemes. I believe that here there will be an after-market solution which will speed up the take-up of eCall.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that eCall is very high on the Commission’s priority list and I am pleased that Parliament has helped us by making it one of its priorities. We will therefore continue our common effort to commit Member States to eCall. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is crazy how many accidents happen on our roads every day; not even the most modern technology can rule them out completely. Over 41 000 people are killed on our roads every year, with over 1.6 million being injured, some of them seriously. In future, fitting vehicles with the ‘eCall’ emergency call system will save lives, in that the vehicle itself will call for help in the event of a serious accident. It will of course be possible to trigger the alarm manually, for example if one witnesses an accident or gets into a life-threatening situation oneself. It makes it possible for the emergency services to get so much more quickly to the scene of the accident, particularly when it is somewhere isolated and hard to reach, and this would cut up to EUR 26 billion per annum from the costs resulting from accidents, so the initial expenditure of four and a half billion would no doubt be money well invested.</p>
<p class="contents">Up to 7 000 lives could be saved every year by eCall, and it could result in 45 000 people’s injuries being less serious. If this is not something worth campaigning for, then what is?</p>
<p class="contents">Over one-third of all accidents resulting in personal injury happen at night, and over half of them happen to someone who is on their own. Even today, finding the victim of that sort of accident in good time is more a matter of luck; in winter, it is a regular occurrence that motorists who have had accidents on isolated roads succumb to their injuries, dying of hypothermia rather than as a direct result of the accident itself. After all, it is often the first hour after an accident – what doctors call the ‘golden hour’ – that determines whether or not it will prove fatal.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that the eCall emergency call system may be usable as soon as possible, the European Union should make it clear to the Member States just how important it is that a satellite-based system of emergency call centres and infrastructures be built up everywhere, and without delay. A system of this kind ought to be operational by the end of 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time as these infrastructures are being put in place, industry should see itself as being placed under an obligation to offer, from a specified date, all new vehicles equipped with eCall technology. Since it is in particular the purchasers of vehicles in the lower price bracket who are wary of spending more money on safety equipment, I would like to see the motor industry introduce the system throughout their ranges in order to reduce the costs to a minimum as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">eCall is also, and especially, vital to the life chances of motorcyclists, who are often not in a position to call for help themselves. The same applies in the case of HGVs and buses; ships and aircraft have long been equipped with a comparable system as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">In my electoral district, the emergency services, the police and the motorists’ associations, regional politicians, representatives of the media, and even the senior citizens’ associations are all hoping that eCall will be made mandatory. We have not got that far yet. I ask the House to adopt the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this case, the report combines innovation and forward-thinking with safety and a reduction in fatalities, a reduction in the fatalities on the roads which constitute one of the most devastating epidemics of our century.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased that this House is once again dedicating some of its time to road safety, and particularly at this early time in the morning, at last, rather than at night. As Mr Titley has explained very well, we must help the drivers and passengers of vehicles.</p>
<p class="contents">In my country we have just had an horrendous Easter holiday of journeys away and journeys back home. We thought that the downward trend in fatalities which began a couple of years ago with a special effort to combat road accidents was going to continue. That has not been the case and this demonstrates that we must continue to insist and continue to make progress on mechanisms that help to resolve the problems of the human factor. It has been shown that the main causes of death – that figure has not been reduced, although the number of accidents has dropped enormously, but not the number of fatalities – are essentially driver errors – that is to say, the human factor – and also delays in the arrival of the emergency services.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore also essential to make progress in the field of intelligent vehicles. I would therefore like to welcome and congratulate the Commissioner on her determination and enthusiasm in maintaining the eSafety programme and continuing to make progress with programmes on intelligent methods for improving road safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that this assistance, which is necessary for vehicles and for their passengers and drivers, should not be restricted to ordinary vehicles – top-of-the-range vehicles, firstly, since they will surely benefit most from these new improvements – but that it should be extended to agricultural vehicles, forestry wardens' vehicles, public works and emergency vehicles, those vehicles whose drivers and passengers are workers who normally use these vehicles to reach remote locations, in dangerous and complicated situations, and which are not generally the kind of vehicles that are equipped with this type of innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">We have therefore asked for the inclusion of this kind of vehicle, and in particular their drivers and passengers, to be studied as soon as possible, since they are of great importance to us.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to price, I entirely agree that we should move towards a system of incentives, by means of insurance or other kinds of incentive that have already been put in place in other countries for the renewal of the fleet, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that extremely fast progress has also been made on other road safety elements that are now entirely normal and accepted, such as safety belts and airbags. I therefore feel that that is the direction we must take with eCall as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing an emergency call system that is self-activating in the event of an accident or can be activated manually; we are also discussing studies according to which enormous numbers of people survive accidents if such a system is built in and if the necessary infrastructure – in the shape of such things as emergency call centres and standardised numbers – is in place in the Member States. I have to tell the House, quite honestly and frankly, that I regard these figures as grossly exaggerated.</p>
<p class="contents">When we debate road safety, there are certain Members of this House with an interest in this issue – and I will name Mr Vatanen specifically – who evidently think that the only things that matter are those things that have to do with costs and the installation of electronic gadgetry. Amendments aimed at bringing in measures that would really address the causes of accidents and have real potential for getting people to improve the way they drive, by, for example, abstaining from alcohol or adapting their speed to the driving conditions, get thrown out altogether by the Committee on Transport and Tourism.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear, then, that safety is no longer thought of except in terms of technology, and I do not think that that goes far enough, for, while it does indeed matter to me that the time it takes the emergency services to reach an accident should be reduced, my concern is primarily with the avoidance of accidents in the first place, and if that is what we are about, then it is much more efficient to do something about the problem of people who drive under the influence of alcohol or about getting people to drive at appropriate speeds – both of which are factors in most accidents – than to do no more than compel the fitting of electronic safety systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Reference has been made to the amount that these systems cost. The cost of their installation is currently estimated at between EUR 150 and EUR 300, with the ‘possible’ hope of its ‘possibly’ becoming cheaper.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the House really believe that fitting these things will be made any cheaper by being made compulsory by insurers or by the Member States? The fact is that, if they are, there is absolutely no motivation for industry to produce them any more cheaply. I find it quite incomprehensible that the costs of this are of no interest to those of you who are at the same time vociferously critical of the much lower costs involved in the single European driving licence and who have campaigned against it in certain Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the issue of the private sphere and of the increasing monitoring of every area of our lives. While I do believe that such measures are of use in some limited areas, I think it is wrong to talk the whole thing up as a great opportunity to save the lives of what are alleged to be half the victims of all accidents. I do not regard these studies as credible. If one, at one and the same time, rules out all the other measures that prevent accidents without cutting rescue times, then I cannot regard the Transport Committee’s accident avoidance strategy – which relies exclusively on high-cost measures – as a credible one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are, of course, various ways in which both the number of fatalities and the lasting impact of injuries can be reduced. As my fellow Member has already mentioned, these include the quality of the roads, the safety of vehicle design and more detailed transport regulations that can be enforced more easily. Among the measures offering rescue teams a better chance of arriving promptly at an accident scene are the reduction of the time taken between the accident occurring and the arrival of information on that accident, including its precise location. I warmly welcome the fact that apart from the seven Member States which have announced that they are ready to launch the system, four others have begun the process of adopting it. Our resolution calls on the 14 remaining countries to join the system, and I believe that that will not take long. Furthermore, I believe that the whole of the European Economic Area will sign up to this initiative, in addition to the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The roll-out of the eCall initiative is to be synchronised with the fully operational phase of the Galileo satellite positioning system, which should start in 2010. It would therefore be a good idea for eCall to be fully functional by this date too. A further prerequisite for the full roll-out of the system is substantial progress towards the use of the emergency number 112, as the Commissioner has correctly pointed out. In light of the fact that there are considerable costs involved in all new equipment, the equipment used should of course be both cheap and reliable. If insurance companies respond to the call to take into account the use of eCall, this will be a further incentive to speed up introduction of the initiative. It is true that some question marks remain over the implementation of the eCall system. The proposed resolution calls for the process to be speeded up, whereby the system could be launched by the target year of 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, it is rare that Members from almost all of the groups clearly welcome a report. We have witnessed that today. If reducing the number of victims of road accidents really is an important issue to you, I call on you to support the proposed resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The estimated 2 500 lives a year that eCall could save throughout Europe is significant and therefore it needs to be taken seriously as a means of curbing high levels of road fatalities. Legislation to take this on board is vital in Member States. It is vital that the emergency services, such as ambulances, police and fire services, arrive at the scene of an accident within the first hour – the golden hour – after the accident occurs.</p>
<p class="contents">As of today, 134 people have lost their lives on Irish roads since the beginning of this year. Some of these lives could have been saved by eCall. Unfortunately no technology can replace the driver’s fundamental responsibility to drive safely and adhere to the rules of the road.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, a disproportionate number of those fatalities on Irish roads have, sadly, been Eastern European citizens who are working in Ireland. The majority of these tragedies occurred on secondary roads and were the result of driving under the influence of alcohol, speed and, in my opinion, the fact that they were driving on the left-hand side of the road in Ireland – a practice to which they are not accustomed. To compound the situation, many of them were in left-hand-drive cars which they had brought from their own homes in Eastern Europe. It is heartbreaking for any family to lose a member through a road accident, but it is even more tragic and traumatic when the repatriation of a broken body is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">I earnestly call for an awareness programme to be put in place to alert non-Irish nationals on this issue. EU Member States badly need a cohesive, united road-safety policy, and the issue of which side of the road cars drive on in the Member States must also be looked at closely at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, mechanically propelled vehicles have become weapons of mass destruction on our roads and we have become somewhat immune to that destruction. We are elected legislators. Let us do all in our power to stop the carnage on our roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a question in this instance of swiftly implementing a European emergency call system that provides a precise indication of where the accident took place and that alerts the nearest emergency services. I believe that the main function of this ‘eCall’ system must and will be to save lives. If there is, in fact, one area in which emergency assistance is to be considered vital for the survival and the treatment of the seriously injured, it is indeed that of the roads.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I should like to draw your attention to a specific aspect of road accidents: accidents caused by, or involving, heavy goods vehicles. In 2003, of the 90 220 accidents recorded in France that caused the deaths of 5 731 people, 4 472 accidents involved heavy goods vehicles, resulting in the deaths of 720 road users, 107 of whom were drivers of heavy goods vehicles. With a 16.10% fatal accident rate, the seriousness of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles is two and a half times higher than that recorded for accidents as a whole. As the real crossroads of Europe's road network, France, together with its European partners, must think as soon as possible about implementing alternative solutions to road traffic, which today carries the greatest danger and produces the most pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to increase safety for road users, we must not only create emergency response systems such as the one proposed today, but also free up the roads by shifting road traffic to the sea and the railways, without forgetting the waterways. It is by combining all of these efforts, and not by limiting ourselves to systematic police clampdowns only on motorists, that we will succeed in significantly reducing the number of deaths on our roads. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We should even now be taking a look at the two new states, Bulgaria and Romania, for if this system is to be introduced there, the emergency call systems will have to be in place there too, and so I urge the Commissioner to get down to some serious talking with the Member States about the implementation of the joint decisions. I do not want to make threats, but Community law does state that we possess the power to legislate on matters of road safety, and I do not doubt that that includes emergency call centres, which are an essential precondition for road safety being improved.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore ask the Member States to at last get their skates on, for it is no use us leaving road safety matters primarily to them if they do not implement the joint decisions that have been reached on the subject. Let me appeal to you, then, Commissioner, to get down to some serious talking with the Member States and make every possible use of the options available to the Commission, for a system of this kind is of no value unless proper emergency call systems are available everywhere. As Mr Titley said, it is out in the countryside, rather than in the city, that help is needed when an accident happens, but for that to happen, the emergency call system must be available everywhere.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ewa Hedkvist Petersen (PSE). – </span></span>  <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I wish firstly to thank Mr Titley for the interesting and excellent work he has done and for the interesting discussions we have had in the Committee. Road safety is important, and this is a road safety issue. We have a perpetual disaster on our roads in Europe. Every year, 42 000 people die on our roads in daily accidents. We must therefore employ every possible measure to prevent such accidents. One possible measure for saving lives on our roads is eCall. We know that people want to see this measure put in place. People want disasters to be prevented and lives to be saved. We also know that people want to see help arrive quickly. We have also seen this in the case of disasters other than road accidents, for example in the case of natural disasters both in Europe and in other parts of the world. Help and the emergency services must arrive quickly. By introducing the eCall system, we can help make this happen.</p>
<p class="contents">As long ago as 2001, the European Parliament emphasised in a road safety resolution that, in our view, the EU’s road safety policy must also include measures for providing emergency help, medical care and rehabilitation, as well as guidelines for offering better medical aid to the victims of accidents. This is something to which the eCall system can contribute.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has listened to what Parliament said back in 2001 and now wishes to introduce E112 throughout the EU, this being a measure that would benefit road safety. It will make it possible for lives to be saved and for seriously injured people to obtain medical care more quickly, and this in accordance with the principle of the ‘golden hour’ whereby anyone who receives medical care within an hour has a much greater chance of surviving as well as of his or her injuries being less severe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important for the Member States to be committed to this measure if manufacturers are to make progress in this area, for we know that there are now major European motor manufacturers that are developing the relevant technical systems in their cars. These systems must, however, have their counterparts in countries’ infrastructures so that there are people to take the calls. There is, then, a need because the motor industry is already developing the technology concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 3 is important if eCall is further to be developed and if the Member States are to realise that it is important. If the European Parliament chooses to support this amendment, we shall be given another opportunity to put pressure on those Member States that are lagging behind. Equipping cars with intelligent aids needs to be an EU strategy where work on road safety is concerned, because cars are produced for the whole of the European market. We know that, if we obtain a larger number of intelligent systems, we can also introduce, for example, alcohol locks, which would be a really excellent way of preventing drink-driving. I wish finally to call for the report and the amendment to be supported. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">eCall can, however, help us to reduce this figure. While we know full well that it is not itself a means towards the end of reducing accidents – something at which we have to do much better and in which we have to catch up and will have to continue to do so – it is, as a system, capable of bringing about a dramatic reduction in the harm resulting from accidents, and can also help to build a real broad alliance between the Commission, the Member States, the motor industry, telecoms companies, insurers and, of course, the emergency call services.</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in providing universal access to the emergency call services, then that will be a small contribution towards helping the injured and towards ensuring that fewer people are seriously injured or killed. I do not want to argue about figures or about whether those under consideration are actually all accurate, which is a completely separate matter. If we manage to reduce deaths, and the number of suffering human beings, by 7 000, then that is worth every effort. On that assumption, this document will have a great deal of support from me – and, of course, from my group – and I would like to take this opportunity of extending warm thanks to the rapporteur and the Commission for the work they have done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The proposal for the introduction of the eCall system falls into this category; eCall can make our lives safer and no doubt help to save them, so let us make use of the possibilities afforded by this new technology.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three brief comments to make on certain points, some of which have already been addressed. One is data protection and respect for the private sphere. I am sure that Mr Titley is right to say that this system can be – and is meant to be – triggered only when and where appropriate, that is to say that it is not intended to track what people do in their private lives, but, rather than accepting this assurance at face value, we should establish in our own minds that this is indeed the case.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may turn to the financing of this, there is more and more talk – and rightly too – about the need for the transport system to be run more on the principle that ‘the user pays’. I have already heard a lot said today about this, and it has to be said that there is a great desire that others should pick up the bill for something that is intended to be of immediate benefit to the persons involved.</p>
<p class="contents">As for whether use of the system should be voluntary or whether its introduction should be mandatory, self-evident though it is that the system as a whole can work successfully only with the maximum possible number of participants, we should at least make the attempt to go for the voluntary option in the first instance rather than adopting a heavy-handed governmental approach straightaway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also welcome Mr Titley’s report and commend him for his commitment to this whole undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the eCall initiative is one of many measures aimed at implementing the action plan to reduce the number of road accident victims by 2010. I believe that the speakers calling for the eCall scheme to be extrapolated from the total package of measures under consideration by the Commission and the European Parliament are mistaken.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety of drivers and passengers is an issue of major importance for the Union. It is also very important for each individual Member State. In my country, Poland, the average number of deaths in road accidents each year is approximately 5 600. Any move to reduce the scale of the grief and suffering caused by such tragedies deserves wholehearted support.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive element of this undertaking I should like to mention is the significant drop in the number of deaths and serious injuries it would entail. In addition, the external costs of road transport borne by all citizens will be considerably reduced. I welcome Commissioner Reding’s statement concerning integration of this scheme into the Galileo system. It will enable us to benefit from the economies of scale achieved through development of the Galileo system.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly support those parts of Mr Titley’s report dealing with issues pertaining to respect for the privacy of drivers and passengers. Clearly, this venture should be dealt with as a complete package from the outset, as Mr Jarzębowski advocated earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw Members’ attention to the cost aspect. Parliament is, after all, considering a number of other measures in addition to the eCall scheme. I could mention the introduction of the euro 5 standards. The cumulative effect of all these measures on the cost of acquiring a motor vehicle could be significant. I therefore wish to appeal to Parliament, the Commission, the Member States and the Council of Ministers to devise an appropriate information campaign that would succeed in winning over the citizens of the European Union. It is not right to skimp on the installation of safety features such as eCall in motor vehicles. There can be no justification for risking loss of life or serious damage to health in this way. Nonetheless, it is incumbent on us to adopt solutions that will reduce costs to a minimum, especially costs to our citizens, because we do want them to purchase more and more new vehicles and replace older vehicles with new ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The eCall system proves that the European Union can give added value to the measures applied by the Member States to prevent and deal with accidents and their multi-dimensional consequences, especially when we think, as has been said, that this system could save approximately 2 500 lives a year, reduce the seriousness of injuries and help to save billions of euros in the overall cost of the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Member States signed the memorandum of understanding, as the rapporteur said, and I am delighted that my country, Greece, is one of them. However, cooperation must be extended to the whole of the European Union by 2009 if we are to have a single emergency number, with the facility to locate the scene of the accident. However, if this ambitious but very humane plan is to be implemented, real support is needed – as my honourable friends have said – from the automotive industry, from citizens themselves and from government departments, so there is good cooperation as regards the cost of implementing this plan and cooperation with the rescue and emergency services and, of course, with all the systems, such as the Galileo system: this means that we can make use of all the technology and the achievements of the European Union, not only for economic reasons, in the broadest sense, but also on matters which affect citizens' lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While it is primarily intended to prevent deaths and reduce human suffering, its economic benefits and the increased efficiency of road infrastructure should not be overlooked. It brings Europe added value in the field of road traffic safety, which, despite the single European internal market in transport, is still primarily – perhaps Mr Jarzembowski would like to take note of this – a matter for the Member States’ jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why this good own-initiative report of Mr Titley’s is aimed at calling on the Member States, firstly to sign the declaration of intent with respect to eCall as soon as possible, secondly to proceed with the technical implementation of the 112 emergency number and its specification, thirdly to inform the public about the advantages of the eCall system, fourthly to bring the debate on data protection considerations to a prompt conclusion, and, not least, and right now, to take into account the future new approach when modernising emergency call centres and emergency control units.</p>
<p class="contents">eCall will give us a foretaste of the possibilities that Galileo will open up to us, not the least of which will be that of creating a number of new jobs in a future-oriented sector, and that is one reason why it is worth our while being committed to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe it should be dealt with instead as an idea that is still at the general stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In this instance we are involved in an extremely valuable parliamentary procedure which does not involve endeavouring to adjust legal provisions to reality as we perceive it. On the contrary, it is about first trying to create the reality. In a sense, therefore, this is a kind of experiment, and it is never possible to predict the results of an experiment during its initial stages. I therefore support all the comments made with a view to reducing the number of amendments as much as possible. It is not appropriate to make provision at this stage for what will only become clear in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The eCall scheme is a particularly valuable initiative. Nonetheless, I am fully aware of the need for the second link in this chain of communications to function correctly if all the benefits of the initiative are to be felt. I am referring to the medical emergency services. I realise we are not dealing with the latter at present, but when I think of the shortcomings of Poland’s medical emergency services I cannot but be concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, it does seem to me that if Parliament adopts the eCall idea, this could act as a significant incentive to improve medical emergency services in Poland and elsewhere. We must rise to this challenge because what is at stake is priceless. It is no less than the life of human beings. We cannot fail to support all measures aimed at saving human life and it is abundantly clear that the eCall scheme is one such measure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come to bring fresh prominence to the issue of road safety, given that 42 000 lives a year are lost on the roads, as was mentioned earlier, a figure that must be brought down.</p>
<p class="contents">Introducing this system will guarantee a faster response to accidents and could help to reduce accidents and deaths on our roads by half. Accordingly, this is an objective that should unite the whole Union and all Member States, starting with my own country, which needs to act more quickly to assume its responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I should like to point out that the Commission’s statement refers to studies that the Member States are to carry out. I hope that the fact that the Portuguese, Spanish and French outermost regions are not mentioned does not mean that the implementation of the system has been postponed in these regions, which are the hardest hit by permanent handicaps. I feel that this should be an EU-wide implementation and as such should cover these regions.</p>
<p class="contents">A further aspect that emerged from the talks was the safeguarding of the right to privacy. I feel, moreover, that this report has brought a new dimension to the issue of road safety, in terms of preventing accidents and enhancing and developing infrastructure and equipment for accident victims, whereby important help is offered to people injured in vehicle accidents.</p>

This is our primary objective.</p>
<p class="contents">We have at our disposal more and more technological resources that are capable of saving human lives and of reducing the seriousness of injuries. Examples of this include the considerable progress made in technologies, systems, services and safety, not to mention the potential offered by the development of Galileo. In this debate and in the subsequent vote, our task is to provide a vital impetus for the eCall system to be developed and rolled out across Europe by 2009.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is vitally important to support this system, given the need to lessen the impact of accidents and help the victims. If accident locations can be found quickly, the arrival times of rescue teams, police and towing firms can be drastically reduced. The system may save thousands of lives per year and help to reduce considerably both the degree of seriousness of the injuries and the costs relating to accidents.</p>
<p class="contents">The eCall project should be welcomed and deserves Parliament’s support. Yet this is not enough, Madam President, Commissioner. This kind of initiative depends on competition between large numbers of public and private organisations, including the car industry, telecommunications operators, equipment providers, motorway operators and insurance companies.</p>
<p class="contents">All of the stakeholders have broadly welcomed the initiative. It is therefore essential that the Member States that have yet to act upon the Memorandum of Understanding on implementing eCall do so without delay. If so, this project, aimed at better and more effective road safety, will be more workable.</p>

This is of major importance considering the ever increasing level of international traffic.</p>
<p class="contents">The eCall system can, in addition to 112, make an important contribution to reducing the number of traffic fatalities in Europe, but its doing so is dependent on the Member States speeding up its introduction. That is true of the 112 system, but certainly also true of the eCall system, as my fellow Members have already indicated. Fortunately, the Netherlands can serve as a good example in this, because it is making haste, but this should be done on a Europe-wide basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not be expensive to introduce the eCall system successfully. Costs can be cut by making the best possible use of the technologies available, albeit obviously without putting the emergency help function at risk.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore strikes me that Parliament is missing an opportunity by not explicitly recognising the need for what is termed an open platform structure, which would, among other things, enable every car driver to call out the breakdown services using eCall technology. Service providers could then pay for the use of the technical infrastructure, and costs could thus be shared more. I sincerely hope that the Member States will consent to the use of the broad scope of technology, again, of course, without this being at the expense of safety.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament is united in urging the Member States to get a move on, and we in this House will monitor this closely in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of these is the advanced GPS emergency call system. This technology facilitates the first steps in the direction of intelligent vehicles, that is, safer vehicles, and thereby safer transport. I can only congratulate Commissioner Reding, and we hope that we will use the intelligent systems in transport in more and more areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The GPS satellite positioning system enables calls for assistance even without human involvement. However, Galileo, the European GPS system, already represents the next generation, and exceeds the functions provided by the currently used system by ensuring interaction. The introduction of Galileo, the largest new virtual infrastructure of Europe, will start in 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">I proposed the harmonisation of the introduction of the emergency call system with that of the Galileo system, and the Committee on Transport and Tourism supported my proposal. I address the same request to Parliament. Naturally, this will be costly, like any new technology. Therefore, it is of utmost importance that the system is introduced gradually, and the measures needed to speed up and encourage this process should also be developed. Also, we cannot disregard the natural incentive that can be offered by insurance companies through lower insurance premiums offered to those who install this intelligent emergency call system in their vehicles. The Transport Committee supported this proposal, too.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that it is imperative that we examine the experiences of our Member States following the introduction of the single European emergency call number, 112. The lessons we can learn from these experiences will be very useful at the introduction of the intelligent emergency call system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Viviane Reding, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Madam President, let me once again express my thanks to the rapporteur and in particular to the political groups of the European Parliament, who, together and almost unanimously, think that eCall represents an important advance that is in the interests of European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">With this strong support from Parliament, the Commission will continue its efforts aimed at the introduction of the pan-European eCall by 2009. In particular, we will pursue further signatures to the eCall Memorandum of Understanding, and we will follow the progress in implementing the appropriate emergency services infrastructure for 112. By the way, I have launched 11 infringement procedures against Member States, because they have to implement it. Parliament is right: let us implement it at once and in the right way so that it serves our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I will also work relentlessly with all other stakeholders whose commitment is necessary for implementing eCall, and I would like to inform Parliament that on 18 October 2005 I invited all the Member States to a high-level meeting to discuss progress and to obtain further commitment on the roadmap for the implementation of eCall as a pan-European in-vehicle emergency 112 call. There were 21 Member States present as well as Norway and the representatives unanimously supported the realisation of the in-vehicle emergency call, as well as the roadmap prepared by the industry. Since that meeting, my services have been in constant liaison with Member States, and several eCall conferences have been held at national level: in Helsinki, Lisbon, Budapest, Madrid and elsewhere. Therefore, things are moving. I am sure today’s action by Parliament will be very important in speeding this up.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also launching a Eurobarometer survey to collect citizens’ views on 112, on eCall and on other such issues. You will get the results later this year as soon as they are available.</p>
<p class="contents">While I am speaking about all the stakeholders, I would like to briefly mention the insurance industry. They said, and I quote, ‘there is a complete lack of any viable evidence to support the view that insurers will derive any benefit from eCall’. I would like to remind the insurance industry that eCall is not about making money, it is about saving lives, and I hope that there will be a review of this position after the very important vote Parliament is going to take.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to say a word about standardisation. Standardisation of the data transmission protocol and signalling are urgently needed to enable the design work and investments to go ahead and, here, commercial interest should not block the work of the standardisation organisations. We now have a full consensus on the eCall specification and functionality, and I would like to urge all stakeholders, and especially the mobile network operators, to support the appropriate standardisation work in ETSI and CEN so that this work can be finalised as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a very heartfelt ‘thank you’ to the rapporteur and to all Members from all the political groups who will help us, not only today but also tomorrow, to make eCall a very important European project. It needs the support of all of the European stakeholders. Today we have achieved an important milestone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Increased mobility comes at a high cost: each year 1 300 000 accidents cause over 40 000 deaths and 1 700 000 injuries.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, one out of two Italians uses his or her own car to get around. Twenty-six million Italians leave their homes each day to go to work or to school. Traffic costs the Italian economy more than EUR 4 billion each year, which equates to around an average EUR 200 per family. Italians are abandoning public transport in droves; in 1991 it was used by 17% of the population, but in 2001 by 12.9%. In Rome, there are seven cars for every 10 residents, which is absolutely the highest figure anywhere in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our country is so aware of the problem of road safety and of reducing traffic jams caused by accidents. Among the objectives the EU has set itself is that of halving the number of road accident victims by 2010. Ecall could save as many as 2 500 lives each year, reduce the number of traffic jams and help improve the efficiency of road transport at European level by reducing external costs, which have been estimated at EUR 4 billion in Europe and are somewhere in the region of 2% of GDP in Italy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
