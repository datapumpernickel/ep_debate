<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, I am sorry to have to discuss this report this evening, at this late hour, when it was initially scheduled for Thursday, which could have enhanced this debate on development cooperation. Unfortunately, however, this is the way things are.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the experience acquired over the past few decades in the field of development cooperation and the lack of significant results in this field have highlighted the need for a change in the focus of development policies, in order to improve the effectiveness of aid, reduce the chasm between rich and poor countries and thus fulfil the objectives of sustainable development that we have set for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certainly many and varied factors preventing the poorest countries from being able to board the development train and win the battle to eradicate poverty: external debt, first and foremost, the great shame hanging over developing countries, the fratricidal wars that devastate so many poor countries, the AIDS pandemic, corruption at every level of public life, but this failure can also be explained by the use of foreign models and the fact that development objectives have in the past been set without the participation of those receiving aid.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not be surprised, therefore, that the idea of capacity-building as an essential factor in improving the results of development policies has been gaining ground, in particular since the Rio Declaration of 1992, which recognises the fact that a country’s ability to follow the path of sustainable development is largely determined by the capacity of its people and institutions. The Committee on Development and Cooperation, which fully agrees with this principle, therefore organised a public hearing a few months ago on capacity-building and then agreed that a report should be drawn up on the subject, for which I was given responsibility as rapporteur. It should be noted that this report was unanimously approved, since it was unanimous in committee that capacity-building should constitute a fundamental element in development cooperation, essential to ensuring effective aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In order better to understand the scope of the proposals contained in the report, I believe it should be specified that, in my eyes, capacity-building is first and foremost a new form of understanding and, above all, implementing development cooperation policy which requires a long-term global strategy that is individually tailored for the various players according to the different environments represented by their society. This strategy should aim to improve skills and the conditions required for a country to be able to improve its levels of economic and social growth. All this should take place in support of national efforts to be carried out by each country for itself based on the plan drawn up by each country according to their specific interests and needs along the lines of what is being done, in particular, with strategy documents for each country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union and its Member States – although not only them, but all international donors – should therefore review their cooperation methods and change the focus of their development policies so that capacity-building, as a participative process based on appropriation, constitutes the basis for the policy, with the aim of enabling individuals, as well as bodies within civil society, to develop their potential and the skills that should allow them to achieve the development objectives that they themselves must also be in a position to determine. We should provide them with the means – in a word – to play a leading role in their own development, to which they have a right. In other words, help them to improve their institutional capacities and achieve the level of training that is necessary in order to open the door to development. We should also help them to diversify and improve production capacity, develop infrastructures and the macroeconomic framework required to attract investment, provide them with technical assistance to increase trade capacity so that they can integrate world trade and thus share in the profits it generates.</p>
<p class="contents">A development cooperation policy focused along these lines constitutes the most suitable instrument for progress to be made towards eradicating poverty and achieving fair, sustainable development for all. That, Commissioner, is why there is a need – I would say an imperative – for a Commission communication in this regard, to instigate action in the field of development aid from the European Union and its Member States and also the various formulas contained in the motion for a resolution on which we are to vote. For it is only by means of these policies, by providing the necessary means for capacity-building, that we shall be able to put an end to the injustice which means that 20% of the world’s population enjoys 80% of the world’s wealth, while 80% are deprived of the right to live in the dignity that is the inalienable right of each individual.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, Mrs Ferrer’s report provides very interesting ideas for developing the concept of capacity building and to describe the means to implement it. This is an area we have identified as a priority for our development cooperation. It is the main element in our overall policy statement dating back to November 2000, and adopted also by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">We are working to improve the strategic approach to European Union action on capacity building and are approaching it from the perspective of good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is therefore timely, because it comes as we prepare the communication on governance in Community development policy. This being said, capacity building is typically an area that has to be mainstreamed in all our interventions, and is increasingly recognised as a key factor in all areas of development. Our communication will give priority attention to three specific topics <span class="bold">–</span> governance in general, political governance and economic governance <span class="bold">–</span> three themes which we see as part of the broader agenda of capacity building.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the approach followed in Mrs Ferrer’s report on searching for a definition. Particularly relevant are the need to adapt capacity building to the context and the rather broad notion of capacity building, which includes not only the 'classic' inputs such as 'training and materials', but also a range of innovative aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The reference to the need to avoid imposing foreign models is also highly welcome <span class="bold">–</span> ownership has to be promoted. The different priority sectors mentioned also show an innovative approach to institutional development; the security issue, in particular, has indeed become one of the new political concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">The specific problem that we face is that of setting priorities within the area of capacity building, linked to the scaling-up of activities. The need for capacity building is accepted everywhere. There is interest in the issue and, in principle, there is a readiness to provide funds. However, when one takes a snapshot of what happens in practice in this area, one sees a patchwork of uncoordinated activities, usually very small-scale and attached to specific projects or programmes. If we really want to promote ownership, this situation has to change. What is needed is improved priority-setting by developing countries themselves and more coordination and harmonisation among donors to promote activities on a larger scale and over the longer term. In fact, the formula I keep using in addressing what needs to be done on capacity building is that instead of having it as an additional measure here and there in the actions we are implementing, we have to turn capacity building into hard-core, big-money development cooperation and not shy away also from agreeing to cover recurrent costs as part of the capacity building effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I agree with the criticism of the problems in assessing the impact of the Community-financed interventions within our statistics in the Commission. This problem is being addressed. It is one of many aspects of the same problem that we are working on. The communication will deal with this issue by devoting a chapter to current practices within the Commission and lessons learned. The recommendations of the rapporteur in this respect are very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by once again thanking the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Two or three of the people in the village would have an Internet connection at their disposal. Sixteen would own a telephone. Sixty-five of the inhabitants of the global village would have gone to school at some stage of their life, at least for a while. Every year in the village there would be one funeral, and at least two more children would be born there.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Bank classifies those living on an income of less than one dollar a day as the absolutely poor. This is a partly misleading indicator because it does not, for example, take account of how important public and community services are to the poor. Neither does it say anything about the significance of health, powerlessness, or insecurity.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides wealth we should also be speaking about power. Apart from the matter of wealth being amassed by just a few, we should turn our attention to how the common wealth is managed, as represented, for example, by common lands and areas, the oceans, most forest areas, natural diversity, the earth’s climatic system, public areas in cities, public libraries, schools, hospitals, and scientific and traditional knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The debate on globalisation and poverty is generally about one of the dimensions of poverty only: income and consumption poverty. Furthermore, the arguments in favour of and against globalisation are often tied to the economic definitions of poverty: its advocates say it increases GNP, and its opponents point out that food is becoming more expensive and unemployment is growing.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer culture and thinking that centres on the economy result in a paradox: the richer we are the more things are also in short supply, because globalisation alters needs and changes the nature of poverty. Many local communities, which have not been stripped of their natural resources or where the natural resources have not been destroyed, which have sufficient food and shelter, and where the community culture thrives, may be at least as good places to live as cities in rich countries. One consequence of globalisation, however, is that many members of what was once a prosperous local community become members of the global community and suffer as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason it is a very good thing that the excellent report drawn up by my colleague, Mrs Ferrer, argues the case for partnership strongly and on every page. It acknowledges those errors and mistaken attitudes of development policies which prevailed for far too long, such as the concentration on technical solutions and the reliance on foreign models. It recognises the need for a participatory process and grassroots opinion. I would also like to emphasise how important it is for people to have a right to their own natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only hope that this will be taken seriously in the Member States when development cooperation resources are distributed and allocated. In my country there were elections in March. During the election campaign nearly all the parties promised to increase appropriations for development cooperation. As a pious hope, it even got as far as the government programme; however, the actual implementation was left to the next government. Thus, preparations are not being stepped up, and in the globalising world we too will have to pay for that before long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an endogenic process, by means of which a society increases its social capital, through the activities of individuals, organisations and institutions, in order to carry out its duties and set and achieve its objectives in every field.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a very broad concept, which has been effectively summarised in the report we are discussing today, for which I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer. However, although capacity-building in the developing countries should affect all aspects of development, it must be based on essential capacities, which, in the opinion of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, are, on the one hand, organising civil society and strengthening democratic institutions, and, on the other, building individual capacity through education. All this should of course take place through certain minimum development requirements that guarantee the survival of the people. This means compliance with certain minimum basic health standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The organisation of civil society refers to the structure of citizenship and citizen participation in social and decision-making processes. All this should take place within the context of an endogenic dynamic and external aid, as we have requested of the Commission, should therefore be devoted to strengthening basic organisations, urban and rural citizens’ associations, local NGOs and traditional social institutions, more than to direct aid to the budgets of the countries receiving aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening the Commissioner has recognised that this report is timely and necessary and that it effectively details the capacity-building that must take place for development.</p>
<p class="contents">Strengthening democratic institutions is one of the matters pending cooperation in general and Community cooperation in particular. Democracy goes far beyond periodic elections and requires the implementation of flexible participation and dialogue mechanisms between citizens and institutions, as well as their democratisation, based on the concepts of good governance, transparency and combating corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">Individual capacity-building through education is the ultimate capacity-building system. The Socialist Group considers education to be a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> condition for development and reducing poverty, as we pointed out in the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">With this own-initiative report, the European Parliament calls on the Commission to join large aid organisations in including capacity-building among the general elements of its cooperation policy. I would like to congratulate Mrs Ferrer once again, as well as all the groups who contributed, with their amendments, to ensuring that this report contains guidelines for updating and improving the Community development cooperation policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is this point that I wish to pick out particularly in order to deal with it in greater detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst we support all the good proposals made in this report with regard to the urgent necessity of building capacity, they will be only halfway useful if the developing countries do not acquire widely-available access to modern information and communication technology, thereby leaping over the digital gulf. There are still, in New York, more telephone lines than there are in the whole of Africa. On average, people in Africa are still 50 kilometres away from the nearest telephone, let alone from the Internet. You may perhaps have read that it took three days for a recent massacre on the border between Sierra Leone and Liberia to become public knowledge, those three days being the time it took to reach the nearest telephone. What this means, in both a positive and a negative sense, is that capacity-building requires that it be possible to transmit information for such purposes as the speedy provision of help in disaster situations, for the transmission of educational material enabling great advances in capacity-building, for enhancing the competitiveness of local, regional and national economies, for empowering civil society, especially women, to improve health service provision and eventually also the development of administrative capacity, to implement innovative techniques – if I had the chance, the list could go on forever.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a necessary aspect of any capacity-building strategy, but there is a virtually total lack of any such strategy for Africa, where the need is greatest. In this respect, the Commission owes much to the ACP countries in particular, and I wish to urge most strongly that serious consideration be given, when examining all the concepts that have been set out so well in this report, as to how the communication gap can be closed, for it is demonstrable – there are calculations to prove it – that it results in economic failure for a very large number of people. To do so will be to the benefit of the capacity-building that Mrs Ferrer has described. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
