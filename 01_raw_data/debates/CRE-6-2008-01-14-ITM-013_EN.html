During the celebrations held in Malta two days ago the Presidents of the Council and the Commission and also Mario Mauro, Vice-President of the European Parliament, all congratulated Malta on the rapid progress it had made in the three years since it joined the European Union and on its transition to the Euro, which is going well and without any problems. In fact, despite the fact that the dual circulation period runs until the end of this month, I can state that after just two weeks almost all transactions are already being carried out in euros.

<p class="contents">It sends a negative signal to our citizens, who are concerned about the risks of social dumping. What does the Court say in this so-called ‘Laval’ ruling? It says that the Swedish trade unions were wrong to try to force a Latvian undertaking to sign their collective agreement, in particular with regard to the minimum wage. Under the 1996 Directive, however, posted workers have to observe a nucleus of mandatory rules for minimum protection in the host Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court rules that the Swedish system of collective bargaining was not applicable and that such rules could only be imposed by the law. The European message is thus no longer clear: on the one hand, the Commission prioritises flexicurity and the system of collective bargaining as a model; on the other hand, the Court of Justice discredits this model.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament and the Council must therefore clarify this issue. Otherwise, it would be like throwing the Bolkestein Directive out the front door only to allow it to sneak in the back, which would be entirely unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This year is the European Year of Intercultural Dialogue. One institution which does much to promote intercultural dialogue is the British Council. It is therefore of particular concern that Russia seeks to close the offices of the British Council in St Petersburg and Yekaterinburg. The work of the British Council in Russia is perfectly legal. It is regulated by a 1994 cultural agreement between London and Moscow. I therefore request that the matter be raised by colleagues with Russia in the context of our interparliamentary dialogue and that you, Mr President, use any opportunity which presents itself to express concern to the Russian authorities that a cultural matter, regulated by a perfectly normal agreement between two countries, is being trodden upon in an attempt by the Russian authorities to stifle political debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is no doubt that the motivation for the campaign is a noble one, as it relates to citizens’ health. However, in my opinion it is also highlighting issues which are not dignified and which discriminate against a large section of society, which has practically been criminalised due to its dependence on smoking. The heavy financial losses of pub-type establishments in the countries that introduced a ban on smoking in restaurants cannot be overlooked either. I presume that the attention that is given to smokers should also appropriately be given to the tobacco industry. It is not a secret that for decades some ingredients have been added to tobacco, such as nitrosamines, which are nitrogen compounds that cause cancer and an increased absorption of nicotine. In most cases the damage to a human being is caused not by nicotine but by these very admixtures. In my opinion, tobacco production and the composition of tobacco products should also be subject to regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Abhorrence at that murder reached this House when the McCartney sisters brought here and put their case for justice in respect of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Three years on, justice still evades them. Why? Primarily because the party which could help the most – Sinn Fein – is still more interested in protecting their own than seeing the killers brought to justice. Indeed, the situation has worsened, because pressure on Sinn Fein has been eased by their admission to government, with the result that, for the sake of maintaining that government, those like my former party the DUP are prepared to let Sinn Fein off the hook.</p>
<p class="contents">Tragically, justice for Robert McCartney is secondary to maintaining the ‘chuckle coalition’ at Stormont. Likewise with the more recent murder of Paul Quinn, undoubtedly by the military wing of Sinn Fein – it, too, will be shamefully whitewashed and swept under the carpet. That is what happens when you treat with the forces of terrorism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has also been a victim of this deadlock, this syndrome. Between the countries that are fearful of the effects of independence and those who dream only of validating their independence as soon as possible for various diplomatic reasons, Slovenia will initially have to ensure the cohesion of the Union by seeking first and foremost an internal compromise, if the EU’s foreign policy as laid down in the Treaty of Lisbon is not to be trivialised or even ridiculed.</p>

Slovenia and Italy objected to it. This led a year later to the signing of an agreement between Slovenia, Italy, the European Union and Croatia. According to that agreement the zone does not affect the Member States. In spite of that, the Croatian Assembly decided unilaterally last year that the environmental/fishing zone would affect the Member States as well from 1 January of this year at the latest.</p>
<p class="contents">The Assembly thereby made the lives of people living around the Adriatic difficult. This unilateral decision by Croatia presented problems for fishermen, for example, because it reduced their fishing territory and the port of Koper lost its access to international waters. The Assembly’s decision that the environmental/fishing zone should affect the Member States from 1 January of this year is contrary to the international obligation accepted by Croatia and gives reason to doubt its credibility. Obligations adopted by a country should not be violated in modern, democratic, legal states. It totally contradicts the political culture of the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that the two journalists and their driver, Al-Hassane, broke Niger laws by entering a prohibited area.

<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is essential for us to take action to help these two journalists: firstly, because they risk being sentenced to death, a punishment that is out of all proportion with their actions, and secondly, because Niger is considered to be a friend of ours and a country that we help a great deal. It would not deserve the reputation that this attitude could generate.</p>

The sad fact is that this Directive is being implemented in Ireland by the Irish Government by charging schools for water usage. Because most schools in Ireland are funded to a large extent by voluntary fundraising, this essentially means that parents must raise the money to pay for the water.</p>
<p class="contents">That would be bad enough, but the Irish Government has decided to blame Europe for this decision, when of course it is entirely a matter for the Irish Government as to what policy it implements in relation to implementing the Water Directive. The sensitivity of the issue arises because we are having a referendum in Ireland to make a political decision, and a cowardly political tactic to blame Europe for the Government’s decision runs the risk of alienating all the parents in Ireland against Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, in my view, a serious matter and I would urge the President of Parliament and the Vice-President of the Commission, who is here today, to make it clear to the Irish Government and to make a public statement to the effect that they are free to charge or not to charge schools for water and that they should not be taking risks with the future of Europe with cowardly political tactics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Georgia must find the strength within itself to step back from crisis. Parliamentary elections are in the offing. The country needs democratic reforms to continue and the people are expecting nothing less.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be wrong of us in the European Union to stake things on one individual. What we should do is support institutions, provide expert assistance, and honestly and openly point to any aspects which are incompatible with democracy.</p>

That is almost 30% less than the amount the Polish Government applied for. Poland has appealed against this decision to the European Court of Justice, but unfortunately it is not known when in the future the Court will rule on the matter. The Polish economy therefore has to adjust to the low limit set.</p>

<p class="contents">Imposing emission limits in this way, and sharing the burden involved unfairly, will not only slow down the development of new Member States such as Poland, but it will also impact significantly on the cost of living for their citizens.
