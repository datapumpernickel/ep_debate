<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Védrine,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am here to tell the House about the Presidency’s preparations for the Nice European Council. There are some very important items on the agenda but even so they far from reflect all the work that has been done and all the results that have already been obtained during the last six months.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will, naturally, only be asked to deal with issues which cannot be dealt with at any other level, primarily institutional reform, and to provide the general political guidelines and impetus. The President of the Republic himself is coming here on 12 December to present a report on the Presidency. The major issue facing the members of the European Council at Nice will clearly be the reform of the institutions and the finalisation of what we all hope will become the Treaty of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the European Council, Pierre Moscovici and I will still be holding a Ministerial Conclave, next Sunday, to which I have invited Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, as well as a session of the IGC, on Monday at the General Affairs Council. We will then get a more precise picture of how the negotiations are progressing in their final phase, on the eve of Nice. I hope we will have a full exchange of views with the President of Parliament at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">So today I will just be bringing you up to date on the main issues under discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Real progress on qualified majority and enhanced cooperation was made at the informal European Council of Biarritz. There was also a beneficial clarification of the issues around the Commission and the weighting of votes, allowing each Member State to get a better idea of the objectives and difficulties of the others. Pierre Moscovici reported to you on that on 24 October. We have been building on that foundation over the last few weeks taking all the points of view into account with a view to arriving at a compromise, but keeping our sights set on an ambitious agreement at Nice. We sometimes hear the Presidency accused of lacking ambition; there are no grounds for saying that today. That is clearly demonstrated by the texts submitted to the IGC, despite the extreme difficulty of the subject matter, and I really do sense a genuine determination to succeed on the part of the Fifteen.</p>
<p class="contents">Good progress has been made on qualified majority voting, which could be extended to another thirty areas, if some Member States make the effort to confirm this. Some countries still have major problems regarding the coordination of social security systems, tax, asylum, visa and immigration matters and trade negotiations on services – a very important issue. But we will approach Nice with a positive attitude, determined to make progress as many aspects of these sensitive issues as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Parliament is naturally one of the important elements in the debate. In many areas where qualified majority voting would be introduced the move to codecision already has majority support, and that goes a long way towards meeting your expectations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fifteen are now close to agreement on making enhanced cooperation more flexible. You discussed this on 24 October, and on several points the Intergovernmental Conference is reaching solutions close to those advocated by Parliament. The minimum number of participating Member States should be set at eight while the clause allowing appeal to the European Council, which currently constitutes a real right of veto, would be replaced by a power of retrieval. Parliament has made proposals on its role in triggering enhanced cooperation in the Community sphere. These will be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the CFSP, several Member States have emphasised its specific nature which, in their view, warrants special mechanisms, and they have been stressing that particularly in the last few days. We will be discussing this at next Sunday’s conclave.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Commission, two options were on the table at Biarritz: capping the number of Commissioners, or a Commission made up of one representative from each Member State. But a third solution has emerged from the negotiations which might allow everyone’s concerns to be taken into account. This would involve setting a ceiling on the Commission, to come into play once enlargement reaches a certain numerical level. That ceiling would be linked to a system of equal rotation. This at least provides a serious avenue to be explored in Nice, one that still remains to be defined and clarified but on which a clear majority of the delegations is ready to work. Progress has also been made on increasing the powers of the President of the Commission and a possible increase in the number of Vice-Presidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally on the weighting of votes in the Council, there are also two main options on the table since the Biarritz declaration: either a double majority or a simple reweighting. There is perceptible movement – I say that with caution because several Member States may not yet have determined their final position – but support has begun to emerge for a simple reweighting whose exact scope and conditions remain to be defined, of course. Several scenarios have been considered and studies carried out. It will be up to the European Council to decide.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add that we have not yet reached agreement on the distribution of seats in the European Parliament. Your own proposal has obviously been submitted by the Presidency and is one of the two options on the table. There too, a solution will have to be found at Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">To end this brief report on the negotiations, we have also made good progress on strengthening Article 7 of the Treaty which should in future provide for an early warning system in the event of a threatened violation of the European Union’s fundamental principles. On the other hand, the idea of a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights in Article 6, championed by the European Parliament in its recommendation of 14 November, and placed on the table at the IGC by the French Presidency, was vigorously rejected by several Member States. Some even asserted that such a reference would jeopardise the Charter’s proclamation. It may be regrettable, but I have to recognise the position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a word on the Court of Justice. The work is almost complete. All the delegations agree on giving the European Parliament the possibility of seeking the Court’s opinion on a draft international agreement. On the other hand, even though the Presidency has also proposed extending to Parliament the right of appeal to the Court under Article 230, several delegations are against that at this stage. I want to be as objective as possible about the situation before this very important Council. In Nice, as you know, our aim is to achieve a good agreement, which naturally means compromise, but compromise that is constructive, not regressive. At Nice, the Heads of State and Government and the ministers will devote all the time that is necessary to that discussion. They have even arranged for the Council to continue through Sunday if that is absolutely essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Finding an agreement which will enable the Union to operate after the new accessions currently in active preparation is vital for the future of the European Union and indeed the enlarged Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Nice European Council will also be tackling other major issues on which the French Presidency has worked with a great deal of determination.</p>
<p class="contents">First, the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I am glad the European Parliament approved the Convention’s draft by a large majority. It was also accepted by the Heads of State and Government in Biarritz. The conditions are now in place for the proclamation of this Charter by the three institutions at Nice. We will therefore have fulfilled the mandate laid down by the Cologne European Council and the European Union will have at its disposal a very strong benchmark, clearly setting out the rights and values in which it believes. The discussion on a possible legal status for this Charter will be pursued after Nice and could form part of a broader, longer term debate on the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council will also discuss the state of progress of the accession negotiations and hence of the enlargement. You yourselves debated this on 3 October. As you know, back in July, the French Presidency asked the Commission to step up the accession negotiations and move forward to the crucial issues, the heart of the matter, the problem areas, and prepare a detailed assessment of each candidate’s state of preparedness, the progress of all the negotiations and problems still to be resolved by and for each country. Our objective was to prepare an overview of the process and decide how to take it forward from this point.</p>
<p class="contents">At the General Affairs Council of 20 November we had a very good debate based on the excellent documents the Commission had forwarded to the Council. I think the stepping up of the negotiations has been widely welcomed and at the next General Affairs Council, and then at the European Council, we will be able to adopt a clear and ambitious line for the continuation of the discussions on the basis of the principles set in Helsinki, which should lead directly to the desired outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">At Nice, the European Council will be preceded by a summit meeting of the European Conference. A meeting of that conference has just taken place at ministerial level, at Sochaux. At the Nice meeting there will be an exchange of views with all the candidate countries on the reform of the European Union’s institutions, and more generally on the outlook for the future of Europe. Your President is invited, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">By bringing the existing Member States of the European Union and the countries which will eventually belong to it together around one table, I believe the European Conference plays a unique and valuable role. I hope we can profit from it even more in the future, notably by opening it up to other European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">A brief mention of the European defence system: some important decisions will be submitted to the European Council, but I will come back to that later, in the debate on Mrs Lalumière’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Nice European Council will reflect the priority the French Presidency accords to economic and social issues and all the issues where the European Union can really respond to the concerns of Europeans. The many statements the Presidency has presented before Parliament have clearly demonstrated this priority. Several goals had in fact already been set under the Portuguese Presidency, in Lisbon and Feira. They should be fulfilled, in economic terms, by building on the efforts to make the European Union give greater priority to growth and employment. The Lisbon European Council approved guidelines designed to promote an innovative and competitive European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim was, in particular, to enrich the broad economic policy guidelines and ensure better coordination with the employment guidelines. So a report will be passed to the European Council which will finalise the definition of performance indicators in spheres such as employment, innovation, economic reform and social cohesion. Similarly, employment guidelines are to be forwarded to the European Council together with an Autumn 2000 employment package.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, last Monday the Ecofin Council reached a decisive agreement on fiscal harmonisation. These matters had been under discussion for several months, not to say several years, arousing strong reservations on the part of some Member States. So this is a very important step forward by the whole Fifteen, and the European Council will certainly take formal note of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of Europe’s social dimension is a vital complement to the considerable advances on the economic front. In this sphere, following on from Lisbon, the French Presidency made the adoption of the social agenda one of its priorities. The Presidency invited all the institutions concerned – this Parliament, but equally the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, European social partners and the intergovernmental organisations – to contribute to drawing up this agenda. This social agenda, largely inspired by a Commission communication, was approved yesterday by the Employment and Social Affairs Council. This has been a good week for working conditions in Europe. The social agenda draws together the objectives and initiatives which need to be taken over the next five to ten years, particularly in the areas of labour law, social protection, social mobility, lifelong training, and the fight against discrimination and exclusion. It will be forwarded to Nice, where we naturally hope it will be endorsed.</p>
<p class="contents">The protection of employees’ rights and improvement of their working conditions have also been high on the French Presidency’s agenda. The European Council will thus be informed of the state of progress of the negotiations on the directive on the information and consultation of workers, and on the European company project, assuming these issues have not already been settled by then, as unfortunately they are running into persistent opposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Following on from Lisbon, the French Presidency had also set itself the objective of strengthening Europe’s knowledge-based society. Here the Council has approved a plan of action to remove obstacles to the mobility of students, teachers and researchers. This action plan will also be forwarded to the Nice European Council. So you can see that I am certainly not exaggerating when I say we have an important agenda and a very full agenda for the Nice Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Moreover, on the basis of the Feira conclusions for the implementation of a Commission Action Plan “e-Europe 2002 – an information society for all”, the Council has worked on progress indicators. A report on the measures the Presidency has taken in this area will be presented to the European Council in Nice. Consumer protection is an increasing concern for Europeans, for obvious reasons which I need not expand upon. The French Presidency set itself the objective of improving the definition of the precautionary principle. A group was therefore set up at the beginning of the presidency’s term in order to work on this. The resulting resolution will be examined tomorrow by the Internal Market Council, again with a view to the Nice Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Current events mean that the subject of food safety and, in particular, the establishment of an independent European food agency will be discussed extensively by the Heads of State and Government in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Another increasing source of concern for Europeans, related to the development of maritime traffic and the occasional disadvantages arising form this, is the safety of maritime transport. A first package of measures was approved at the October Transport Council. The Biarritz European Council took note of the Commission report on the necessary additional measures. I know that the European Parliament is working on the first package. You know, moreover, the importance which Member States attach to adopting texts quickly. Without prejudice to Parliament’s prerogatives, the Presidency has in addition called for the implementation of these measures to be brought forward, where possible. This entire area must be given fresh political impetus in Nice with a view to the final Transport Council on 20 and 21 December, for it is true that the French Presidency does not come to an end in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency wished to support the updating of the Commission’s 1996 communication on the services of general economic interest with some consideration of the place of public services or, to use the accepted term, general interest services in Europe. The Presidency wanted to restate the basic principles governing the Community’s approach in this area, including primarily the freedom of Member States to define and organise their own public services while respecting the rules of the Treaty. These principles will be highlighted in a statement which the Presidency wishes to annex to the Nice conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we have prepared a statement for the European Council on the specific economic, social and cultural characteristics of sport and its social functions in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">You can see that we have a very full discussion programme for Nice. Your President will naturally have the opportunity to express the views of your institution on all these subjects and to discuss them with the Heads of State and Government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Prodi,</span></span>   <span class="italic">President of the Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, next week the European Council meets in Nice. This summit gives the Heads of State and Government an historic opportunity that they cannot afford to miss. It will, indeed, provide the opportunity to address a range of issues: to focus on the road map for enlargement, to consolidate the Lisbon process and a social agenda and to proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights. These are all important issues, but today, at your suggestion, I want to focus on the important decisions to be taken in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">There are several aspects to this debate, and I will touch briefly on three of them: firstly, the need to close the Intergovernmental Conference by adopting a treaty that has genuine added value; secondly, our security policy on crisis management; and finally, the need to mark out the way beyond Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">First, then, a new treaty. The primary purpose of a new treaty is to ensure that the Union will continue to be able to function after enlargement. Our institutions, originally designed for six Member States, will soon have to manage a Union nearly five times that size. We must be ready for this dramatic enlargement. Any left-overs from Nice would hamper our progress. We require the candidate countries to meet all the criteria before accession: we too must live up to our obligations. This means ensuring that the Union can take effective and democratic decisions which fulfil the expectations of Europe's citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout last winter, the Commission devoted a lot of energy to explaining why and on what specific issues the initial agenda of the IGC was to be extended. In particular, in our written opinion at the end of January, we established the minimum degree of ambition necessary to secure a successful outcome for the Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">I am now pleased to say that the negotiators are close to an agreement on the provisions governing, for example, closer cooperation, the Court of Justice, the democratic values of Article 7 and deepening the involvement of European political parties in the democratic life of our Member States and institutions. I sense that we are approaching a reasonable compromise on the composition of the Commission and the weighting of votes in the Council. Provided that a number of basic principles are respected, I believe that the Conference can go ahead and reach an agreement on those issues that satisfies the expectations and needs of both large and small countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever the number of Commissioners, the important thing is to give the President of the Commission all the powers needed to run the College effectively. Similarly, any change in the weighting of votes in the Council must also guarantee that decisions cannot be taken against the will of the majority of Member States. And the simplest and best way to do so is through a double majority system, even if we are aware of the difficulties this will entail.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">So we are slowly moving in the right direction. However, there is one issue on which our lack of progress causes me great concern, and in the view of both our institutions, it is the single most important issue facing us as we prepare for enlargement. It is the issue of qualified majority voting. If the Union is to be effective, the Conference must make substantial progress on this, and that also means extending the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Member States naturally find it politically difficult to give up the right of veto in sensitive areas such as social policy, asylum and immigration, common trade policy, cohesion and taxation, even when this relates only to the technical changes necessary to make the single market work. However, if everybody sticks to their position, we will all be worse off. Indeed, mathematics and 50 years of experience show beyond a doubt that even modest enlargements make it far more difficult to reach unanimous agreements. In a Union of 27 or more Member States, the unanimity requirement will, quite simply, paralyse progress in every area where it is maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">Mark my words: if the Member States' veto on justice and home affairs is maintained, we shall be severely delayed in implementing the programme agreed at Tampere or even unable to do so. And I shall say so loud and clear to the Heads of States and Government at Nice. They must be under no illusions about this.</p>
<p class="contents">The particularly sensitive areas I have been talking about include trade policy. This is a subject I would like to dwell on for a moment, because the House made a point of highlighting it on today's agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, modern economic activity revolves around services. Under the present rules, certain aspects of negotiations on services are covered by the unanimity requirement, precisely because our Treaties were originally commercial treaties governing goods and not services. The problem currently plaguing our trade policy is that, because negotiations cover a wide range of sectors, including services, any progress whatsoever in goods as well as service sectors is almost inevitably held up by unanimity voting.</p>
<p class="contents">Our trading partners or, in some cases, we could say our adversaries, are delighted because they can count on 15 potential vetos, and, with enlargement, there will soon be many more. The situation is then made even worse on those occasions when one of the Member States places conditions, sometimes financial conditions, on its assent. The simple and natural solution – and this has, in fact, been a majority view during the Conference – would be to change the present rules so that qualified majority voting applies to all aspects of such negotiations, including services. Regrettably, the Conference's existing text is very complicated, very ambiguous and very long with its two Protocols, and yet, despite its length and complexity, it is also very weak. It does not provide the simple answer we need to the simple problem we have been facing for so long.</p>
<p class="contents">Much remains to be done if we are to find a suitable solution. For us, the final outcome of Nice will depend largely on the conclusions reached by qualified majority voting. I am committed to doing whatever it takes to reach an agreement that provides added value.</p>
<p class="contents">Inevitably, the question we shall be asked the next morning is: "Are you satisfied with the outcome?" The Commission will answer that question frankly and directly. At the next plenary session in Strasbourg, I shall tell this House whether, in my view, the enlarged Union we are all determined to achieve will be able to act effectively or not. When all is said and done, that is the criterion by which Nice must be judged.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Important decisions will be taken in Nice to ensure that the European Union is able to assume its own responsibilities in the world. The prevention of conflict and crisis management are traditional areas of Community activity. It is our task to fulfil our commitments against the backdrop of new ambitious objectives which the Union has set itself. This means that the Union must develop an autonomous capacity to take decisions and, where NATO itself is not involved, to launch and conduct military operations under Union command in response to international crises. In this connection, it will be particularly useful to develop fruitful cooperation between the European Union, the United Nations, the OSCE and the Council of Europe. I would stress that this in no way detracts from the fact that, for the Member States concerned, NATO remains the basis of the collective defence of its members and will continue to play an important role in crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">As we saw in Kosovo, crisis management is not just about imposing a cease-fire. It is also about keeping warring factions apart, rescuing and evacuating European Union citizens, caring for large numbers of refugees, supplying food and medicine, imposing and maintaining law and order, restoring calm after chaos.</p>
<p class="contents">However, crises do not usually erupt overnight. They are the culmination of a process of rising tension in a country or region. Therefore, one of the key aims of our common foreign and security policy must be to defuse tension and prevent it form turning into armed conflict. The Community already has many tools for this job. We have had them for a long time. For example, almost all our external aid programmes are geared to supporting democracy and stability. What we have to do is coordinate them better and make them more effective, and that is why the Commission is in the process of adopting the necessary internal measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is convinced that only an integrated approach to crises can guarantee the consistency and efficiency necessary for the Union to be able to play its full role on the international scene. Crisis management requires the Community to show an increased capacity to react, but this must be translated into action in a way that fully respects our institutional framework as established by the Treaties. We will, of course, need to cooperate with the other institutions and with the High Representative for the CFSP. In any case, we will have to make decisions about this framework now, because a crisis is the worst possible moment to set attributions and responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion which took place within the Conference itself demonstrated that there were issues that were ripe for debate after Nice: the incorporation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights into the Community legal system, as Mr Védrine said; the reorganisation of the Treaties on the basis of existing texts to present the aims and working methods of the Union to the public in a clearer way; making a clear distinction between the competences of the Union and the competences of the Member States; and last, but by no means least, if I am not mistaken about the tone of the debate and about the outlook for Europe's future, the issue of what the balance between the European Union's institutions should look like in the future, in the spirit of an institutional model, the Community model, which has stood the test of time.</p>
<p class="contents">We will undoubtedly have much to do after Nice, but that we will have to leave until later. For now, let us look to the immediate future under the French Presidency and focus on the priority of bringing Nice to a conclusion and paving the way to enlargement.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, may I say to the President of the Council that his country is confronted by a Herculean task, both as the EU presidency and as the French Republic. It has been stressed on several occasions – and I can endorse everything that President Prodi has said – that a formidable challenge awaits you on the issue of majority voting. If the reports are correct, France is the country that is still hesitant about a switch to majority voting on matters relating to trade in services.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President of the Council, how can you expect Germany to give ground on asylum and immigration policies? How can you expect Spain to give ground on the cohesion issue? How can you expect Austria to give ground on transport policy? How do you expect the United Kingdom to give ground on fiscal policy, when the presidency, the French Republic, is not budging? I urge you to move forward, so that you can encourage others to follow suit.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">If an acceptable outcome is not achieved on these issues, we shall not hesitate to specify exactly where the responsibility lies in the wake of the Nice summit. We also believe that, with regard to issues on which we fail to agree to majority decision-making at this stage, you could lay down in the Treaty that the switch to majority voting may be made by a unanimous decision of the Council, for if it is enshrined in the Treaties in that way, there will be no need to revise the Treaties and engage in a lengthy ratification process for each and every extension of majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke of codecision by the European Parliament. I welcome that on all issues which are subject to majority voting. But this means that the right of codecision must also apply to fundamental matters of European agricultural policy, where majority decision-making already exists. On the reweighting of voting rights in the Council of Ministers, I emphatically endorse what Mr Prodi, the President of the Commission, has said about the double majority being a democratic system, and it really ought to be an acceptable option for the French Republic to operate in this way in its relations with another Member State in a particular coordination process. So we do need a reweighting of voting rights with a view to ensuring that a majority of states which are home to a minority of the European population cannot ultimately make the rules; the unequivocal democratic principle must certainly prevail here.</p>
<p class="contents">And now to the Commission. We have been astonished to see the way in which the large countries have practised a policy of arrogance in recent months – and the term is not my own but has been used quite frequently by members of my group from smaller countries. The large nations have seen fit to exert pressure on the smaller ones so that the latter will agree to give up their permanent representation on the Commission. May I say to the President of the Council that it is certainly possible to discuss rotating membership of the Commission, but the small Member States' permanent seat on the Commission will only become negotiable once the office of President of the Commission has been strengthened, once he has been given the right to dismiss a Member of the Commission, for example. What we need now in the first instance is for the Commission to be strengthened as an organ of the Community; if you do that and furnish proof that we are not regressing into mere intergovernmental cooperation, if you strengthen the Commission, we can then start thinking one day about how to create a new system of representation. But we must heed this warning: respect the dignity of the small countries, because the small countries have always borne the brunt of disputes between major powers throughout the history of our continent; for that reason, we must uphold the dignity of Europe's small countries.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">As far as enhanced cooperation is concerned, I agree with what you have said. We are pleased that the secretariats are no longer on the agenda, and even our British friends, who normally adopt quite different positions to the majority of our group on questions of institutional development – while still remaining good friends – fully subscribe to our view that these secretariats must not be created but that all cooperation between Member States must be conducted within the framework of Community procedures. The Commission must be involved, Parliament must have a say, and nobody may be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me deal with the question of the Charter. The majority of our group take the view that the Charter should not only be ceremonially proclaimed but should also become European law. I know and regret that this will not be achieved in Nice. Further steps, however, will have to follow. We shall arrive at a result in Nice, Mr President of the Council, but let me say categorically that, if we only obtain a minimal result, the words of President Jacques Chirac will be fulfilled and we shall have no treaty. If the result is a poor treaty, a rather unambitious, minimalist treaty that does not lay sound foundations for enlargement of the European Union, the failure of Nice should be admitted and the baton handed over to the Swedes and later to the Belgians so that we can then achieve a result which, if all goes well, will be a good basis for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">We truly desire a result in Nice, but it must be a result that sets out ambitious aims, and my wish for you is that we achieve such a result, that we set an agenda which transcends Nice and focuses on issues such as the basic governmental structure of Europe and the division of powers, in other words what the responsibilities of the Union are and what are matters for the individual nation states. This is something else that we need for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">One last remark, which I make with absolutely no polemical undertone, is that in Strasbourg in January 1995 I heard François Mitterrand speaking. As we all know, he belonged to your family of political parties, and when I follow some of the party congresses in your country, I often wish that the European enthusiasm of François Mitterrand could be found in his successors. I wish you some of that enthusiasm, so that we can obtain a good result in Nice, a good result for all of us and for Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, we have heard the progress report of the President-in-Office of the Council, and now we are entering the home straight. I would like to make an appeal to the President of the Council, because we in the European Parliament are not mere spectators to what is happening; we are key players and we want Nice to be a success. Having heard your report, however, we must express our deep concern at the state of progress in the Intergovernmental Conference, especially given the objective of making possible an urgent commitment – enlargement – and, furthermore, making our institutions function in a democratic and effective way.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the President-in-Office of the Council will not object if I remind him of an occasion when the French Presidency, under President Mitterrand, was able to produce a final flourish: the Strasbourg Council at the end of 1989. I hope that now the French Presidency, under President Chirac, a fellow member of Mr Poettering’s group, will be able to do the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am going to refer to two positive points of progress. I am pleased with the progress that is being made in Article 7, in Article 191, with regard to the European political parties and to qualified majority voting in certain articles. Nevertheless – and I refer to what the President said – firstly, we are very concerned because, in an Intergovernmental Conference in which Parliament is not asking much, many things are being denied us. I would like the Council to comment on the fact that the cooperation procedure is being replaced by consultation in relation to economic policy (Article 99(5)), and yet unanimity is being maintained in Article 13 (anti-discrimination). With regard to enhanced cooperation, we believe that in the first pillar there should be assent from Parliament and, in commercial policy, I repeat our concern and our request for a strengthening, not a weakening, of Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we believe that there should not only be progress with regard to qualified majority voting, but that there should always be codecision in relation to legislative issues.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the composition and functioning of the three institutions, my Group agrees with the proposal of the joint resolution. We believe that Parliament, the Commission and the Council must have a joint and global solution based on dual legitimacy, which is able to ensure a balance. We cannot reach a balanced solution for one institution and leave another aside. I would like to say to Mr Poettering, who has become the advocate for the so-called small countries, that we are all small here, Mr Poettering, there is no large country: if there were one large one it would try to dominate the others. I would have preferred it if what he asked of the Council had been advocated by his Group when we discussed the distribution of seats in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I am going to refer specifically to an issue which is of great concern to Parliament – I noticed that the President of the Commission made no reference to it – which is the Charter of Fundamental Rights. This is an absolutely key issue. Every day we talk about the fact that we have to be closer to the citizens. The document which brings us closer to the citizens and which offers them guarantees, not only to the citizens here but also to those who may join us through enlargement, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We feel proud of this Charter and we do not understand the kind of negotiation that permits statements such as those which the President-in-Office of the Council has referred to, i.e. if we insist that the Charter is linked to the Treaties, then that is going to negatively affect its proclamation. I believe that this would even go back on what was agreed in Biarritz. I think this is completely unacceptable and, of course, it is a good argument in favour of ending the closed door method for the Intergovernmental Conferences, which has had its day, so that we can hold discussions in public and find out who could say such scandalous things.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I also hope that the President will not mind if I repeat that we believe it is important that we can advocate the Charter with dignity, regardless of what we do after Nice. Then we will even be able to discuss – as suggested by President Chirac in the Bundestag, not here – the European Constitution. We are prepared to do that and we believe that it may be an important step, but, of course, let us take steps forward, not backwards.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would like to make a final comment in relation to international policy. I listened carefully to what the President-in-Office of the Council said and I believe it is important that we maintain a sustained effort in relation to the dramatic situation in the Middle East and I would also like to welcome the progress that has been made in our foreign, security and defence policy. In conclusion, Madam President, I believe that we must make an appeal – and I do not wish to be over-dramatic – for Nice to be acceptable to everybody. I must of course say that we would pay a heavy price if in Nice we approve agreements in which the Charter of Fundamental Rights has been thrown in the dustbin.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – I agree totally with the sentiment of President Prodi that this is an historic opportunity and one that should not be lost. The Summit at Nice bears a responsibility for Europe and should in part fulfil a contract which we made at Helsinki last December and which we should deliver on.</p>
<p class="contents">Two things were said at Helsinki to candidate states in Europe. Two locks were placed on the door of enlargement. One was that those candidate states themselves must adopt and implement the 'acquis communautaire'; that is their task shared with us. The second lock on the door is that we ourselves, as fifteen, needed to recognise the fundamental need to reform how we do business in order to continue to do business effectively, indeed to begin to do business even more effectively than at present. That is the unavoidable and minimum requirement of Nice and it is a major and central target. We in this Parliament will be required at the end of that process to give or not to give our assent.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a major responsibility. I speak for a group which is totally committed to the earliest feasible enlargement of the European Union. I also say that we will listen with great care to what Mr Prodi and the Commission say by way of analysis of the Nice Treaty and to the candour which he promises. We ourselves will go through a very candid analysis. My appeal to you, Mr President-in-Office, is to present us in this Parliament a document worthy of this Parliament's assent and a document worthy of the scale of the historic challenge we face in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">That challenge is the reunification of our old continent; that challenge is an enlargement unparalleled in scale and that is what Nice must prepare us for. To do less than that is to fail Europe and this House, when it reviews Nice, cannot allow Europe to fail. I should like to say, with regard to a number of the specific points, that my group believes that, at this stage of evolution of the European Union, having one national for each Member State of the Commission still remains a sensible proposition and enhances the legitimacy of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It should not become an issue which traduces the Union into a false contest between the interests of the large and the small, when the common European interest should be the central goal. My group, at this stage, would prefer a reweighting of votes, the double majority, but you have explained that other issues are under review. We support enhanced cooperation but insist that it must be open-ended and open to all and not exclusive and must be based and rooted in a way which respects the 'acquis communautaire'. We are deeply attached to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and we do not want simply to declaim the Charter. If we proclaim it as something with meaning, it must find roots, and we still commend to you to root it in Article 6. We commend to you to give the proclamation a meaning in substance, even if it is not yet fully and completely in such a case judiciable. We support the review of Article 7 because the Austrian lesson has taught the need of it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nice is a test to see if our old continent is ready for a new, continental-scale enlargement. I believe that we can succeed but, Mr President-in-Office, we need your Presidency to mobilise the Council for Europe by animating the Nice Council to achieve something which is genuinely historic. There should not merely be constructive compromise, those were your words, there must be significant achievement. We will set the bar high and I hope together, Council, Commission and Parliament, we can clear that bar. I say this today, if the bar is compromised and is too low, we will refuse to consider it and we will do so for Europe and we will do it in good conscience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I might also add, on behalf of my group, that we are fully committed to enlargement taking place as soon as possible. However, it is important at this stage to discuss what is to happen post-Nice. For this we need vision, and this vision has been expressed over the last few months. Our group strongly supports constitutionalising the European Union Treaties, and this also means that the reform of the Treaties should be open, with civil society being able to participate in this process. We consider the Charter of Fundamental Rights to be a success. It certainly could have been worded better, and, indeed, it can be honed and polished after Nice. No doubt in time it will come to form a part of the European Union’s constitution. But we wish there were at least a reference to it in Article 6 of the Treaty on European Union, as our citizens should be already benefiting from this Charter.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards decisions that are at present closer to us, we cannot emphasise enough the importance of qualified majority decisions. The Nice Summit cannot succeed unless the system of qualified majority voting is extended. It is very important that the European Parliament is closely involved in the codecision procedure, as, otherwise, it will be even more difficult than before to decide on legislation. The European Parliament will bring transparency to this decision-making process. Let us take the example of environment taxation. In our discussions on climate policy we often criticise the United States of America for not wanting to compromise its sovereignty and enter into international agreements on climate protection, but there are Member States among us which also insist on keeping what they imagine is their sovereignty intact, and which do not wish to switch to a system of qualified majority decisions, for example, in the matter of environmental taxation. We have to break free from this.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi spoke on the subject of trade policy. We all certainly want the European Union to have a strong role in the globalising world, but, Mr Prodi, our group sees trade policy becoming open and transparent as a precondition to the Commission having more powers, and, at present, that is not the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would also like to say that it is important at present to ensure that the European Union does not become a community just for the big Member States. One issue Parliament has had problems with is that we should realise that Parliament’s size in the future cannot be categorically limited to 700, as this would also limit the manifestation of pluralism here in Parliament. That would result in a shift towards a two-party system, and that cannot be democratic. I would appeal to Mr Barón Crespo for understanding in this matter, as I have a feeling that the other Group Chairmen do support this aim to leave the matter of the size of the European Parliament to some extent open. This would be a very important position for Parliament to adopt, and we will be able to vote on it tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The euro bobs feebly up and down in the shallows, responsibility for BSE is shuttled about in a deadly game of pass-the-parcel, and, as the Union prepares to face the greatest challenge in its history, the governments, instead of vigorously addressing the urgent problems, are still embroiled behind closed doors in petty squabbling about the so-called Amsterdam leftovers.</p>
<p class="contents">The moment of truth is approaching in Nice. The summit will only be a success if it opts for truly comprehensive reform of the institutions and sends a clear signal that this Union is capable of enlargement. This means that there must be an efficient and strengthened Commission which is able to perform its function as the engine of integration. It also implies a balanced distribution of voting rights among the large and small states in the Council, and it means that majority decision-making in the Council must become the norm, even for key policy areas such as taxes, social policy, justice and home affairs. If democracy is to be strengthened, this naturally implies that majority voting must be accompanied by a right of codecision for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But success in Nice also means that there must be more than mere proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I find it quite intolerable that several governments have simply brushed aside the question of including a reference to the Charter in Article 6 of the Treaty. Let me say clearly, just as other Members before me have done, that in my view a reference to the Charter in the Treaty is just as indispensable as a broad public debate with the people of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To the Presidents of the Council and the Commission, may I say that the Union has no need of a military reaction force or of arms modernisation programmes that devour billions. The real success or failure of Nice will be measured by whether governments finally begin to take people's concerns and needs seriously. It is a good thing that thousands will be taking to the streets of Nice and actively demanding a socially responsive Europe. The European Union must attach foremost political priority to the struggle against unemployment, poverty and social exclusion. I note that the French Presidency of the Council intends to devote itself to this cause, but please, Minister, convey to your colleagues that deeds, not words, are what will count. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is highly like that, on the last night of the Council, measures will be adopted which our national parliaments will not have discussed properly and which they will then be required to ratify for the sake of a forced compromise. This is not an appropriate method.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters are particularly vague regarding the, to my mind, key issue of the potential extension of majority voting within the Council, particular on two truly vital issues. Firstly, Article 67 on the free movement of persons and on immigration policy. Commitments were made at the time of the Treaty of Amsterdam to the effect that this matter would not be opened for discussion again for five years. As usual, however, commitments have not been kept. As much as we think international cooperation is essential, we find it unacceptable to use majority voting to force the hand of one or more Member States on such issues of sovereignty. Another avenue must be explored, one that is more flexible and more respectful of the decisions of each Member State: the avenue of ‘differentiated cooperation’.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another area of uncertainty involving the extension of the Community procedures of Article 133 to the negotiation of international agreements on services, intellectual property and investments. Trade talks have already been communitised, but if the Commission is indeed speaking with a single voice, then this voice is not sufficiently controlled by the Member States. The disastrous consequences of this became apparent in the Uruguay Round. Let us not start again tomorrow with a new multilateral agreement on investment or new talks on agriculture post Seattle.</p>
<p class="contents">In trade policy, the key issue today is not extending majority voting but rather restoring the Council’s authority over the Commission and establishing proper scrutiny by the national parliaments. In a word, Mr President-in-Office, stand firm on this. Let us first step up democracy and restore the control of the Member States, then we shall look into transferring jurisdiction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it appears that all the speeches, including the last one, although from the most extreme positions opposite to my own nevertheless come to the same conclusion, and that is that, just a few days away from the Nice Summit, we are not on the finishing straight but, rather than resolving our problems by this antiquated intergovernmental conference method – which, as has been stressed, must be changed – rather than approaching good solutions, we have complicated matters and proposed solutions which are frankly unacceptable. I refer, of course, to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a Charter upon which we abstained precisely because we knew that you were bound to sweep it under the carpet after the Nice Summit, having deceived our peoples into believing that it was a binding document protecting and promoting rights. You do not even intend to incorporate it into the Treaty, evidence indeed that this text, this exercise was always destined to be laid aside.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned by the future of the Commission, the driving force of European integration which, when expanded to 20, 25 or 30 members, will clearly be reduced to an administrative secretariat, a technical secretariat of the Council, a body unable to play even the tiniest role in the institutional balance intended by the founding fathers.</p>
<p class="contents">Over qualified majority voting and weighting, there will, in all probability, be vetos from all sides which will paralyse the demands of Parliament and the public for a move towards democratisation of our system, towards making majority voting the general rule. I therefore appeal to President Prodi, who has rightly promised that he will tell us in Strasbourg whether or not the Commission will be able act effectively, whether or not the Union will be able to act effectively after the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, you are going to take part in the Nice Summit, you will in a way be the expression of the will of Parliament, albeit a timidly expressed will, the will which tomorrow will become clear when we vote on the document which has resulted from the compromise between groups and which we have not signed. Mr Prodi, present your objections to the Summit, assume the responsibility, not of establishing a role for us as the post-Nice panel of judges, but of playing right to the very last the card of defending first and foremost the European institutions, the Commission and Parliament in particular. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As a rule, the European Union’s laws are to be adopted by qualified majority voting so that all democracies in the individual countries can be voted down. There are still 65 categories of legislation requiring unanimity according to the Treaty of Amsterdam. It is now proposed that decisions should be made by qualified majority voting in 49 of these areas. We are therefore approaching the point of no return, beyond which a unitary State is unavoidable. The powers to be given to the EU by the Treaty of Nice treaty go beyond those exercised at federal level in many federal States.</p>
<p class="contents">The inner sanctum of the national States is now being penetrated, with majority decision making on aspects of social policy, labour market policy, taxes, industrial policy, culture, supranational parties and even our own salaries, so that we are becoming the EU’s highly paid representatives in the Member States instead of the voters’ representatives in the European Parliament, duly taxed in our own countries. Home affairs and legal policy are to be subject to majority voting as from 2004. Trade policy will make the EU countries resemble a State. We shall have to speak with just one disagreeable voice in the WTO. Decisions on foreign and security policy are also to be adopted on the basis of majority voting. Only on the subject of defence is unanimity still to be required. Otherwise, the right of veto will not figure very prominently in the new treaty, and countries without the right of veto resemble constituent States more than independent nations. Majority voting internally and joint representation abroad – this is clearly the blueprint for a State. What has been deferred to the constitutional conference in 2004 is not the content of the text but merely the icing on the cake of a text which may also come to resemble a proper constitution, that is to say a text containing firstly the Charter of Fundamental Rights, then the ground rules and, finally, an appendix listing the individual policies to which changes may be made without the need for tiresome ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">All that is missing is democracy. Democracy was forgotten en route. And that is the essential problem with the Treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice. More majority decision-making in which officials and ministers can vote down the electorate and elected representatives. In democracies, it is the other way around. Majority decision-making will destroy the right of veto for the Member States as parliamentary democracies, but the EU will not itself become a parliamentary democracy. With enhanced cooperation, the right of veto over treaty changes is also destroyed – not formally, but in practice – because a qualified majority will in future be able to ignore resistance from, for example, Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain or other places in which the undemocratic idea might arise of asking the electorate what it thinks. The federalists can achieve their desire for more integration, and the governments in Sweden, Great Britain and Denmark can ease their countries into the new arrangements once the decisions, binding in practice, have been taken. Nice will transfer so much power from the electorate that it ought to be treated as a genuine constitutional change and only come into force once it has been approved in referendums in those countries in which referendums are possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

While its extension to trade in services is an understandable aim, it has little to do with the main issue of institutional reform, which needs to be resolved as a matter of priority; the demand contained in point 7 of the joint resolution regarding the extension of external negotiating competence in the field of trade to cover investment has even less to do with this main issue. In view of the rather dim prospects of success, I do not think it would be a wise move to burden the Intergovernmental Conference with another complex and controversial topic. Given the current state of negotiations, it is doubtful whether even an extension of the conference to the Sunday, along with the customary extra hour that is gained when the clocks go back, would be sufficient to ensure that this question, along with all the others, will be properly resolved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe this is crucial if we are to take a major step towards rapid enlargement of the European Union. Just imagine what the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are making of the events in Nice. Elections have just taken place in Romania, and we have been shocked at the outcome and the rise of a very extremist party. Elections are due to take place in Poland and Bulgaria early next year, and how are we to motivate the people of these countries if the European Union should prove unequal to the task of producing a sound treaty in Nice?</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs some good news. A poor agreement would prove that our Heads of Government do not attach any priority to the enlargement of the European Union. How can we invest with a view to gaining broader support among EU citizens for further enlargement, if our own Heads of Government should prove unable to negotiate a sound treaty? But according to our heads of government, it is also a question of demonstrating that there is no adequate solution to the major issues confronting us in the European Union. BSE, security, foreign policy and defence, Europe’s competitiveness <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the United States; it is no longer possible for any issues of this kind to be resolved at national level. It is therefore no way to tackle the fact that the decision-making process within the European Union is still akin to wading through treacle.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Europe needs leadership, clarity, choices and decisiveness. That is what the people actually want to see. In view of the extent to which public confidence has been undermined with regard to the euro, people need to see that we are taking steps forward. So I feel it is the weighty task of the French Presidency to at last whip up some enthusiasm for Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is extremely sad that a situation has developed where large and small countries have come to take opposite sides. I feel it is a psychological error of the first order that such a huge amount of distrust has been generated. I would urge the French Presidency to do their utmost to overcome this divide, because it is extremely destructive.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe the Commission’s role to be essential. The Commission is, and remains, the driving force, and if the Commission does not emerge from Nice in a stronger position then it will be a black day for Europe. So I think what we need to do is work more with the Commission and less at intergovernmental level. We will assess the outcome of Nice on the basis of whether it leads to enhanced effectiveness, and efficiency, greater democracy and transparency, and that is what is on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Well, as far as Parliament is concerned, the issue of the weighting of votes within the Council and the number of Commissioners are essential matters. Even so, Mr President-in-Office, on this point we trust you to reach the best agreement. We understand that not all the elements are on the table yet, but I trust that wisdom will carry the day at the Nice Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Members of the European Parliament, the essential thing is primarily to make our voice heard where it might be useful. There are two points where it is useful and necessary. On the Charter, first of all. As practically everyone who has spoken before me here has said, we want a reference to the Charter in Article 6.2. Do not underestimate Parliament’s determination to achieve this. We do not find the principle of blackmailing into proclamation acceptable with regard to the conclusions the Biarritz European Council, even if it was an informal one. We still have a few days left to convince all European Union citizens, including those living in countries that sometimes feel that Brussels is plotting the worst, those for whom the development of a common foreign and security policy and an area of freedom, security and justice should be specifically incorporated into a code of values. We have a few days left to convince these people that the best safeguard against the Brussels behemoth is precisely, perhaps, to incorporate the Charter into the Treaties. Otherwise there would be the political paradox that a good development for the European Union is not acknowledged in the Treaties. There would be the legal paradox that the European Union had provided itself with a code of values and then agreed to carry on living with a treaty which makes reference to the values of another organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I should like to stress is, obviously, the scope of qualified majority. Mr Poettering condemned the responsibilities of parties on all sides. I, however, would like to remind us of our responsibilities: we cannot blow the case out of all proportion. If we want to actually overcome the deadlock on qualified majority in order to enable the European Union to accommodate new members, then everyone has to make some small concession.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, there are various proposals on the table. Regarding trade policy, the Commission has drawn up a proposal which must be carefully examined. We are in favour of developing democratic responsibility in this area. However, while we feel that this proposal needs to be examined carefully, it must also enable all parties to conserve the elements that make up their identity, particularly, no doubt, Europe’s cultural identity.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we shall also examine qualified majority voting according to the yardstick of extending the scope of codecision. In that respect, let me draw your attention to one specific point: the extension of codecision to the common agricultural policy. If we trust to democracy, then it is not normal for 45% of the EU budget to lie outside the scope of codecision. It is even in the interests of agriculture, at a time when health and the environment are areas covered by codecision. The recent decisions of the European Parliament show that it has some sense of responsibility and concern for the interest of the citizens of Europe. Its voice would be stronger yet and that of the ministers defending an agriculture that promotes sustainable development would also be stronger within the Council if it were to be based on decisions taken in this place under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause from the left)</span></p>
<p class="contents">These, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are the criteria according to which we shall assess the outcome of the Nice Summit. Let me also mention how highly we value the point you raised concerning services of general economic interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, we do think that the Nice Council conclusions should include a request that the Commission should draw up a framework directive in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps we should shift the focus to the issue of extending codecision with the Parliament. Parliament has proved itself a mature partner with the Council in the codecision procedure where it presently pertains. Parliament has also proved itself a serious partner within the drafting of the Charter, and it would be especially refreshing should British Prime Minister Blair publicly recognise that fact.</p>
<p class="contents">At present the spread of codecision is neither logical nor does it accord with precise criteria. Although the previous Treaty made some progress in extending the formula, it also brought in the crazy formula of codecision plus unanimity for citizenship, social security, the rights of the self-employed and also cultural policy. The Treaty of Nice should stop that practice and extend codecision to some thirty further policy sectors, including competition policy, farm and fisheries, structural funds, state aids, trans-European networks, research and development and also citizenship. At a time when crude balance of power questions are proving fairly problematical for the IGC, surely it is sensible for it to focus on building up cooperation and trust with the Parliament and developing post-national European democracy as fast as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like them, we will be unable to influence the outcome of the negotiations. Mr Prodi, I am extremely concerned at what might be the outcome of the final night of the negotiations, that night when the victors are usually those with the greatest resistance to tiredness and boredom, that night which everyone sees as the last chance to resolve the points which are still without solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the most negative, most undemocratic part of the intergovernmental method: the whims of the human element, the results of last-minute bargaining and the obligation to achieve a result at all costs. I am extremely afraid that we will end up with some rather strange measures such as a Senate of national Members of Parliament, a Mr Euro or a Mr WTO, further diminishing of Parliament's powers or further marginalisation of Parliament, or some other protocol such as that proposed on the WTO which, if it were adopted, would reduce the Commission to a puppy dog on multiple leashes held by many different owners, each one pulling in a different direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Those who are in Nice, out on the streets and in the dozens of forums and meetings scheduled will, in my opinion, at least be able to push for one result, namely that this will be the last IGC, that the hazy reflection on the future of Europe Mr Védrine spoke of will translate into the launch at Nice of a process which will establish the time frames and methods for drawing up and adopting a democratic European Constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word on the subject of Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, and the bold words we have heard this morning. Be careful lest we repeat the painful fiasco of the last enlargement when, after months of threats, the European Parliament gave in to the governments. I hope that this will not be the case this time as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I shall adopt a position on the Treaty of Nice when I see the outcome of the negotiations, but there is a somewhat schizophrenic feel to the debates here. At one moment, we talk about bringing the European Union closer to the people, and the next moment we are in the throes of developing a European State, which is out of step with what the people want. In my view, the most important thing to do at the Nice Summit is to set a timetable for when and how the EU is to become ready for enlargement. We are focusing far too much on how prepared the applicant States are, and we all too often ignore the fact that, for example, the EU’s agricultural arrangements and Structural Funds are enormous obstacles to enlargement. A decision in Nice to the effect that, for example, the applicant States must have the opportunity to participate in the next elections to the European Parliament could help put the necessary pressure on the EU itself, so that enlargement can become a reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will be built through concrete achievements, which first create a de facto solidarity.”. I think that it is timely, on the eve of the Nice Summit, to question the current state of this spirit of “de facto solidarity”, without which, European integration can be clearly neither genuine nor authentic. With regard to the conclusion of the IGC, what must take place in Nice is that an agreement must be reached which whilst correcting the deficit in the functioning of the European institutions, does not affect the existing balance between Member States and, of course, between these States and the Union. The very fact that this issue is being debated now is in itself a clear sign of the failure of a policy to strengthen ties of mutual trust between the countries that comprise the Union. We are not the only ones to say this; the French Presidency has also said as much through its minister, Mr Moscovici, who acknowledged in a recent interview that the positions that have been adopted during the course of this year, particularly by President Chirac and by the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Joschka Fischer, on the future organisation of the Union have had the direct effect of heightening a climate of mistrust between small and large Member States, which will inevitably be reflected in the results of the Nice European Council. I am talking here about the idea of creating a vanguard of countries centred on the Paris­Berlin axis, which would culminate in a remodelling of Europe or in a dangerous confusion between a heterogeneous Europe, which is healthy, and a two-speed or multi-speed Europe, which is dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the text of the proposal for a compromise resolution that we will be voting on reflects this unease to a certain extent, because its generic nature is clear to see. It is also, however, a text in which its authors, even in the knowledge that they risk predictable political failure, reveal a vision that is focused above all on the powers and competences of the European Parliament itself, and call for ever greater resources for parliamentary intervention without dedicating a single word to the crucial role of national parliaments. The reality is nevertheless quite different. We all know that the purpose of the Nice Summit is to finalise the work of a conference held between governments, who are accountable not to the European Parliament but to their own national parliaments, which categorically demonstrates the sovereign nature of this process of revising the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I wish to express the desire that the Nice Summit is a success from the point of view that I have been talking about, which is that its conclusions should express a joint formulation of the various national wills that come together and work together in an ongoing quest for cohesion and development, ultimately taking a few more steps towards the “de facto solidarity” of which Robert Schuman spoke. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, today at talks in the House, the President of Latvia directed this reproachful remark at us: "We have been doing our homework!" The question is whether the Heads of State and Government of the European Union have been doing their homework too. This raises a huge question mark at the present time. In Amsterdam, the Heads of State and Government failed their exams, and now they have to go to Nice to resit them. A failed resit has to be regarded as a crisis in any school career, and I fear that another mass failure may well be on the cards.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me use another metaphor. European unification is a marathon in which we have successfully stayed the course over the past few decades. The stadium is now in sight. Do we have the strength and determination to complete the final lap, or shall we miss the entrance to the stadium because we have lost our bearings? This is the question that has to be asked in Nice, and I hope that we have the strength to emerge from the enlargement process with a robust Union, because enlargement must not weaken the Union. For this reason, the European Parliament believes that two conditions must be fulfilled. The first is that qualified-majority voting must be extended, but this extension must not focus on areas of relatively minor importance. Forty areas can be listed in which voting by qualified majority is to be introduced, areas such as the appointment of members to the Committee of the Regions. I would gladly give up these 40 extensions if we could achieve majority voting in five areas where substantive progress can be made, such as trade, social policy, justice and home affairs, structural policy and taxation, to name the most important. Our appeal to the Heads of State and Government is that each of them should put his playthings into the communal toy box, so that the others will do likewise, rather than each waiting for the others to make the first move and then nothing happening at all. This, quite simply, is the situation in which we have been stuck for months at the Intergovernmental Conference, because none of them are willing to give up their toys. I hope that, at the start of the ministerial meeting of the intergovernmental conference, someone will have the backbone to give up his toys in order to pressurise the others into making a move.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the democratic deficit must not start to widen again. In Amsterdam, it was decided that qualified-majority voting should always be accompanied by codecision. Any derogation from this rule will fuel the democratic deficit and undermine the progress made in Amsterdam. I hope this will not happen. There are also a few leftovers to be tidied up in the fields of competition policy, monetary union and agricultural policy, so that a right of codecision can be established in these areas too.</p>
<p class="contents">At the Intergovernmental Conference, we must also strike a fair balance between the large and the small nations. I should like to emphasise that the population of Europe consider themselves to be represented in the European Parliament, and Parliament must reflect this. If the disparity between the large and the small members of the Council becomes too great, we face the risk of a legitimacy crisis within the European Union in a few years' time, because the small countries will no longer feel comfortable in the Council, fearing that they might become unable to defend their own identity.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, if the two conditions, namely the creation of an effective Union and the reduction of the democratic deficit, are not fulfilled, the European Union could be confronted for the first time with a situation in which this European Parliament refuses to ratify a treaty.</p>

It is now the eve of its conclusion and we are aware of the progress which has been made, the partial results which have been achieved, but frankly, over almost ten months of a major Intergovernmental Conference, there has been no <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> of the positions, Mr Védrine, and no definition of agreements, not to mention the fact that some of the topics indicated by Parliament in its resolution of 13 April, ranging from the regulation of the economy to the institutional implications of the common defence policy, have not even been debated. All this is serious cause for reflection on the tortuous and sterile nature of the method followed, a lengthy, repetitive, predominantly technical dialogue lacking the more weighty clarifications and negotiation endeavours at political level which did not take place until much later, in October, and then only on one occasion, at the Biarritz Council. The experience of this year has convinced us that, looking beyond Nice towards the future of Europe, the process of constitutionalising the Union must not be carried out by means of the – now dysfunctional – method of negotiations between government representatives. Nice must not be the occasion for the announcement of another Intergovernmental Conference, for this would generate misunderstanding and alarm rather than agreement and hope.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has made its contribution in the form of the resolution adopted on 21 November, which draws attention to certain points which are truly vitally important if the outcome of the Conference is to be successful, and I will not go back over them. I will simply say that these points are deemed absolutely essential by those who believe that it is necessary to advance integration into a larger Union and not to dilute or paralyse it. We are starting to doubt whether anybody, even at the highest levels, is fully aware of what is at stake. Recently, Mr President, we have, in fact, witnessed the emergence of an increasingly clear, worrying contradiction which very few governments appear to want to avoid: the contradiction between the courageous decisions which have already been taken, such as those on the single currency, common defence and the major, historical enlargement of the Union, and the reluctance to accept the institutional implications. If this contradiction is responsible for the negative outcome of the Conference, it will mean a crisis for European integration. Therefore, it would be better and healthier to have a clear-cut crisis arising from the failure to reach agreement at Nice, than an ambiguous crisis caused by deception aimed at concealing the Conference's failure to deal with points which are vital for the Union's enlargement.</p>

The French President and the First Minister seem to be more obsessed with their own political future than with that of Europe. The French Presidency has shown little enough consistency, and where it has this has mainly been in terms of its lack of neutrality and the preferential treatment it has given to the large Member States, and that at a time when the Union has never been more in need of a President who looks for consensus. In order to make room for the newcomers, all Member States need to move a little closer together, but they only do so when they really cannot put off the evil moment any longer. It seems as if some governments are already reconciling themselves to a new IGC for enlargement. The governments have lost sight of the urgent need for reforms because they are concentrating too much on their own position of power in the new set-up.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, many a country will emphasise that majority decision making must become the general rule, but at the same, will come up with so many exceptions that precious little remains on balance. If majority voting does not become the general rule then decision-making will become irretrievably deadlocked, as Mr Prodi rightly commented a moment ago. If this does not go hand-in-hand with codecision then democracy will be further undermined. The weighting of votes in the Council must do justice to the population numbers in the Member States, which means that it is quite acceptable for there to be some corresponding differences between the larger and smaller countries. All Member States must retain one Commissioner of their own during this enlargement round. Only afterwards should we decide on a new system on the basis of the experience we will have gained by then. If one thing is for certain, Europe is going to undergo radical change, and so let us not run ahead of a situation that we are unable to take stock of as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be very desirable to introduce a hierarchy into the Commission, i.e. Vice-Presidents, Commissioners and Under-Commissioners. In addition, this would afford Parliament more opportunities to discuss issues with politically responsible members of the Commission rather than officials who read out actual texts that they could just as easily have sent. The Charter does not deserve to be left in a vacuum, with no clear status. In failing to incorporate the text into the Treaty and only subscribing to it in political terms, we are opening the door to major problems of legal interpretation. Hence the Charter must be incorporated into a treaty text as soon as possible. I have this to say to the Heads of Governments: making concessions at the forthcoming summit is not a political defeat but a political triumph: the triumph of the new Europe over the old. Do not allow any shadows to fall over Nice, and let Paris be the City of Light again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We there said that “in accordance with the subsidiarity principle and the political and national diversity of the European Union, the amendments made to the treaties should specifically include recognition of, and respect for, the political and legislative powers of the Members States’ internal political units in their executive, legislative and judicial relations with the European Union institutions.” That aspect of subsidiarity has not been heard in our debate today but it is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">It bears also in a most important way on the question of the size of this Parliament.

Indeed, the wide majority vote returned only yesterday in the Italian Parliament is evidence of the unity of intention and preparation for this Council. However, we certainly consider it essential that the list of topics to be voted on by qualified majority voting is not extended and that the principle of one Commissioner per Member State is followed when establishing the composition of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential factor is that the irreplaceable role of the national parliaments is retained in the Treaties, precisely because this will facilitate the establishment of the new Europe. It takes no great genius to work out that 700 Members of Parliament can no longer be sufficient for a Europe of 27 or 28 nations, or the smaller countries will be at an unfair disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I would stress the considerable importance of providing our Europe with strong institutions to fill the institutional void being created by progress on the economic front with the euro.<span class="bold"> </span>As a result, the high dollar is benefiting NAFTA, Mexico, Canada and the United States.</p>

I believe that all the speakers are very concerned about the results of the Nice European Council. This is not a question – despite what my friend, Elmar Brok, has said – of two exams that we have to pass; Amsterdam and Nice. No, this is a much longer-standing issue. I remember the enlargement of 1995, when the question of institutional issues was already being raised, and I remember a letter from Chancellor Kohl in which he told us to approve enlargement and then the rest would be resolved immediately. We did so, the enlargement of 1995 went ahead, the discussion group presided over so well by Carlos Westendorp was created, Amsterdam arrived and now we are going to have Nice and practically nothing has changed, Mr President, we go round and round in circles on institutional issues and never find solutions which will allow us to cope with this hugely ambitious task of enlargement to 27 members.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what worries us and it worries all this afternoon’s speakers. This is the message that we wish to send to the European Council through you, Mr President. You should be aware that we are not going to judge this French Presidency on its considerations of the economic services of general interest, which is a very important issue. No, we are going to judge it on the mandate of the Nice Conference, which is the same as it was in Finland plus enhanced cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two aspects of this issue that are absolutely fundamental to this Parliament: How will qualified majority voting be extended? And with this extension, when the decisions are legislative, will there always be codecision with Parliament? That is the first consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The second one, Mr President, is the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Institutional issues are not of interest to many people, because they are complicated issues. The Charter of Fundamental Rights – I have had the opportunity to talk about this in many places – is of interest to people, because they understand and feel strongly about fundamental rights. I believe that in the Convention we produced good work. I believe that we have a good Charter and that this Council is going to waste a great political opportunity because, in the proposal you are making, Mr President, the proclamation – the one which my friend and group Chairman, Mr Poettering, calls a <span class="italic">freierliche Proklamation</span> – is a proclamation by stealth. You tell us to proclaim it and leave it at that. You do so as if you were taking care not to disturb anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that is the great political task of this European Council. If you fail to take advantage of it, I fear that you will return here after the European Council in Nice, other presidencies will come around and this Parliament will be tempted to follow Oscar Wilde’s advice, which was that the best way to avoid temptation was to fall into it, and therefore not approve the Treaty of Nice when the time comes.</p>

The stated aim of this review is to design more efficient institutions which will be able to cope with an enlarged Europe and, at the same time, to reduce the democratic deficit which certainly exists.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the text of the Treaty, as formulated to date by the Intergovernmental Conference, does not satisfy either of the objectives of the review and, consequently, does not satisfy either of the two evaluation criteria set by the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to ensure that the institutions operate more efficiently, we called for Council decisions to be taken by qualified majority rather than unanimously, although we did, of course, exclude all issues of constitutional significance. This has borne only meagre fruit, as Elmar Brok and Mr Méndez de Vigo explained earlier. However, the European Parliament is especially disappointed as regards the major issue of the democratisation of the European Union. From a democratic point of view, it goes without saying that qualified majority voting in the Council should go hand in glove, as far as legislative acts are concerned, with codecision on the part of the European Parliament. This does not always hold true. In the case of enhanced cooperation, no agreement has yet been reached on making provision for assent by the European Parliament in order to start the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, not only has the Charter of Fundamental Rights not yet been incorporated into the text of the Treaty; it has barely even been agreed to mention it in Article 6. Of course, I am delighted about the positive aspects, such as the issue of European political parties and Article 7, which have already been commented on. However, Nice will not be accepted on the basis of these positive aspects. Obviously, we shall be under great pressure to accept Nice come what may, with talk of the threat of institutional crisis if there is no Treaty. However, I fear that the crisis will be worse if the European Parliament caves in and accepts as adequate what is clearly an inadequate Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The national parliaments are waiting for our opinion. We have an historic responsibility. Let us not compound the disappointment which Nice will cause if it is unsuccessful by giving the people huge cause for disappointment in Parliament. Nice, if it is unsuccessful, can make amends, but if Parliament proves to be unreliable, it will take years to wipe the slate clean. A European Union without a credible parliament is a transient and a poor state of affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sector is currently one of the most centralised and untransparent. That was one of the main criticisms of the protestors at Seattle and it will continue to be one of their criticisms at Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of us believe that any shift of competence from Member States to the Commission can only be contemplated after a complete restructuring of the EU’s trade policies and processes as a whole, to infuse them with far greater democracy and transparency, and to ensure that they are based on true social and environmental sustainability. That means it is not only a question of the Parliament having a much greater role in decision-making on trade. That is, of course, important and I am surprised that others have not mentioned it as it has occupied much of our time in the committee. But it also means restructuring the Committee 133 itself: making it far more accountable; ensuring that its agenda and conclusions are accessible and that its composition is broad and inclusive. Only then, President Prodi, will some of us be happy to entrust the Commission with the hugely important areas of services, investment and intellectual property. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The recent Commission report on the progress of the countries from Central and Eastern Europe who have made application for membership is encouraging I must say. While not in any way detracting from the aspirations, and indeed the entitlement, of some of those countries to join the Community by 2002, it would not, I believe, be in their best interests, or indeed the interests of Member States, to achieve this deadline without first ensuring an orderly transition with minimum disruption to the economies of existing Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not forget that our ultimate goal is to create the economic and social environment to enable the EU to become a dominant player in world trade with the countries of Central and Eastern Europe playing their full part and benefiting from a peaceful and stable European economy. We have demonstrated in the past that this goal is achievable and as someone from a Member State that has benefited from a planned transition to membership, I look forward in a positive way to an enlarged and peaceful Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">However enlargement of the European Union must not dilute or dissipate the influence of smaller Member States with key national interests which must be protected. From an Irish perspective it is clear that we want to retain our right to nominate one member of the European Commission which controls the administration of the common agricultural policy, fisheries policy, transport policy and other important EU policy areas. I also believe it is important that we keep control over decisions concerning our tax affairs and social security matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In addressing you, I wish to raise an idea put forward by my working party within the PPE-DE Group, and not to discuss the problems that we have as Conservatives. We have major reservations on many issues, especially the Charter of Fundamental Rights, for various reasons. I do not wish to discuss that. I shall leave that to others. My main idea is as follows: to concentrate on what will happen after Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware, from the speeches made by President Chirac in this place in July, that at least three major topics stand out, namely the simplification of the Treaties, the sharing of jurisdiction between European, national and regional levels, what I might term the rights of states in the American expression (Section 10 of the American Constitution), and, thirdly, the balance between the institutions – though here we should especially, perhaps, consider the role of the national parliaments – i.e. how is our institution to be managed in future. We await a Commission report on this issue of governance.</p>
<p class="contents">Would it not be a good idea, before going any further, to consult our peoples and involve them in what we are doing, instead of waiting for the outcome, then subjecting it to a referendum, even though they do not know what has happened? So my third question is this: how is this business going to be managed? What is the timetable? What is the procedure? And who is to participate in the system?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, are we going to wait until the next IGC, until 2003-2004 before we can have a debate on these fundamental issues? In my opinion, this is something we should begin directly following the outcome of Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">My second area of concern is procedure. The Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is right, we have to forget the IGC, the wise men and the closed doors. We must instigate a major debate among the citizens of Europe, getting them involved in our debates. My third point concerns participation. The candidate countries should certainly participate, but not necessarily the countries with which we have not yet started negotiations, such as Turkey. I think that is going a little too far.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I urge you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council and Mr President of the Commission to give some thought to the provisions which would have to be incorporated into the Treaty of Nice in order for us to have this major debate and to avoid the utterly Kremlin-style approach of agreeing matters behind closed doors, in order to instigate debate with a view to a new European framework, whether or not it be constitutional, so that we may have direct contact with our electorate and may make a major success of the European Union in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbett (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I am speaking not just to the President-in-Office of the Council but also to all the governments of the Member States when I say that if agreement is not reached in Nice on these difficult issues those issues will not go away. They will not become easier to solve after Nice, they will become more difficult. So a final major effort is necessary over the next two weeks. This is no more so than on the issue of qualified majority voting. Every government is saying we need more qualified majority voting, but they all have their list of exceptions. The problem is if you put the lists of exceptions next to each other you will find there are very few areas of substance where it is agreed to switch to qualified majority voting. Everyone will have to sacrifice some of their cherished exceptions if we are to reach a result in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course some governments will be attacked in their Member States by opposition parties, by euro-sceptics, saying, “you are giving up the national right of veto”. But it has to be understood that if you have the right of veto then so does everyone else. So in a Union of 27 Member States for every veto you trade in, 26 other vetoes are being given up at the same time. Consequently, things that you want will no longer be vetoed by others. Everyone can gain from a system of qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to have more qualified majority voting on legislation it must go hand in hand with codecision, not only for the new areas which will come to qualified majority voting but also for the existing areas that already come under qualified majority voting. This is essential for democracy at Union level. To adopt European legislation you must pass two tests: acceptability to the elected governments meeting in the Council, and acceptability to the directly-elected MEPs in the European Parliament. These are two safeguards for the quality and the acceptability of European legislation. It is nothing to be afraid of. The working of the codecision procedure over the last year shows that it works. In more than three quarters of the cases we do not even need the Conciliation Committee; the two readings each in Council and Parliament are enough to reach agreement. If this is working here let us make it work across the whole spectrum of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is the question of the number of seats in the European Parliament. We know that a definitive solution must be in place for the parliament to be elected in 2009, which will, after all, last until 2014. By then I am sure we will have enlarged to at least 27 Member States. But a first transition will also have to be made for the parliament to be elected in 2004 because at least some new Member States will come in before or during the Parliament to be elected in 2004 which will last until 2009. We must make some room now for enlargement in that Parliament. If a lot of states come in maybe we will exceed <span class="italic">temporarily</span> the limit of 700, but a first adjustment must be made now. It is easier to make two small steps in this regard rather than one big step so I urge the President to persevere and I urge all governments to make the necessary compromises in Nice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My dear friend Elmar Brok referred in the House just now to examinations and what students do in order to pass them. Of course, one of the things which students do in order to pass examinations is to revise beforehand. I should like to tell you which points I think you should revise if you want to pass your examinations with flying colours.</p>
<p class="contents">The first thing you have to do in Nice, Minister, and I say this to you and through you to all your colleagues, is to adopt an agreement which maintains the correlation of powers – large and small – and interinstitutional balance.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, as far as the matter of the Commission is concerned, you know full well – we all know full well – that the problem with the Commission is not one of numbers. The problem with the Commission is a qualitative problem. In other words, we want a new Commission with 27 Commissioners, but we want a Commission which has a political role, which again has a political role, and the president of which has the powers needed for the Commission to do its job.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as voting in the Council is concerned, I think that the double majority is the best system because it is more representative and more objective. As far as extending qualified majority voting is concerned, we are agreed that, unless we make some sort of move in this direction, we shall encounter a great many problems. So I think that, as a first move, it should already be agreed that trade policy needs to come under qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as foreign policy is concerned, we now live in Mr Solana's bright and beautiful world and let me tell you – if we leave the common foreign policy solely within the framework of intergovernmental cooperation, then we shall be making a big mistake. The common foreign policy needs to be fully integrated into Community procedure because only then shall we have the necessary safety valves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I must, of course, mention the Charter, which affects millions of European citizens. I take the view that Nice must at least accept the compromise called for by the European Parliament, i.e. for the Charter to be combined with Article 6, paragraph 2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The President-in-Office of the Council addressed the issue of closer cooperation and said that we are on the way to reaching consensus on this matter. I should like to ask both Mr Védrine and President Prodi what role is envisaged or what role they advocate for the Commission in the field of closer cooperation in the second and third pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue concerns the overall agreement already considered here by my colleague and Chairman of the Socialist Group, Enrique Barón Crespo, which is, fortunately, part of the resolution that the European Parliament will surely adopt tomorrow. Today, neither in the Council nor in Parliament do we have distribution of power that is proportionate to size and to the number of citizens in each Member State. What we have is a balance underpinned by the principle of the dual legitimacy that exists between the Union of States and the Union of citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">According to how one sees the matter, however, what is being prepared now is a change to this balance and an increase in the representation of the larger countries, both in the Council and in Parliament. This is neither fair nor acceptable. I therefore wish to insist once again that within the Council, it is the double majority method that should be adopted for decision making, since it is not only more understandable but also fairer. I would also reiterate that the current method should be maintained in the European Parliament and that this linear reduction should be implemented when new Members enter Parliament. I believe that this latter approach is more balanced, fairer and takes account of an historical reality which those seeking to integrate Europe cannot ignore. This historical reality is that the Member States exist and there is a relationship between these states and their citizens, whereas there is not such a strong relationship between the citizens and Europe itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there is the issue of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The President-in-Office of the Council spoke with sincerity, for which I thank him. He said that some countries or governments even say they will not formally recognise the Charter if it is incorporated into the Treaties. It is unacceptable that such a statement should be made. What is a member of the European public supposed to think when they hear that governments are prepared to draw up certain documents but do not agree on these documents having legal force and status? What kind of message are we sending to candidate countries if we say to them that in order to join the single market they must accept whatever we impose on them, and yet we do not require them to ratify the Charter of Fundamental Rights? In other words, we are sending them the message that in Europe we treat consumers better than we treat the citizens of the European Union themselves. We therefore encourage and urge the Presidency once again to make every effort to ensure that there is at least one reference to the Treaties in Nice because this would be the best tribute we could pay to the work of the Members of the European Parliament, the Commission and even the representatives of the governments involved in the Convention on drafting the Charter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The story of Mrs Vike Freiberga is illustrative of the courage in adversity shown by the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe. As a seven year-old girl she was forced to flee her country before the advance of the Red Army, a fugitive hiding in ditches to avoid being strafed by Soviet aircraft. We might also choose to remember the heroism of Solidarnosc in Poland, the President of the Czech Republic Vaclav Havel, the generations in Hungary since 1956 who have sought to restore their freedom and independence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, Mr Védrine, we see courage and even heroism; on the other we look at the Council of Ministers, the IGC about to assemble in Nice: Do we see courage, resolution, determination to succeed? At the moment, as your address has demonstrated, we see disunion, squabbling and the prospect of failure. Will you be able at Nice to support the European Parliament’s resolution which calls upon the preparations to be secure so that the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe may vote in the next European Parliamentary elections in 2004? Will you, President Prodi and your colleague Commissioner Verheugen, instruct the Commission to open those chapters for the applicant countries who have achieved everything we have so far required so that at Nice we can look the peoples of Central and Eastern Europe in the eye and say: yes, we have succeeded in making the necessary reforms and within the lifetime of one Parliament you will also take your place in Brussels and Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that failure is an option. We have been talking about Amsterdam leftovers. Our public in the EU and the public in the candidate countries will not accept the prospect of Nice leftovers, of a second IGC in 2004.</p>

But there is far more than that at stake. The Nice Summit will not just address the issue as to whether the Member States are prepared to give up their Commissioner, it will mainly be concerned with their willingness to give shape to the type of European political cooperation that promotes the interests of the European citizen, transcending national interests.</p>
<p class="contents">It has frequently come to our notice of late that this political cooperation is totally absent. A brilliant example is, of course, the nationally motivated measures, and the reaction to the unrest over the high diesel and petrol prices; where concerted action could have given a huge boost to the credibility of European political cooperation in the eyes of the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing in mind the need to deepen the Union, the Heads of Government must change tack and extend qualified majority voting to a substantial degree. If we are serious about deepening European cooperation then it is absolutely vital to exercise effective democratic control over the European decision-making process. That is why qualified majority voting must always go hand in hand with Parliament’s right of codecision. Eighty per cent of all amendments tabled by Parliament in past months were adopted by the Council. So we evidently make an enormous contribution in qualitative terms.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mrs Berès said, it is of course untenable to draw a distinction and give us codecision rights in consumer affairs on the one hand, but at the same time, only give us consultation rights in agricultural matters. Let us just think back to the recent BSE-crisis. Just what are we supposed to tell our citizens?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Méndez de Vigo has just made reference to the Charter, and rightly so. This is a subject that is, of course, very dear to Parliament’s heart. It is the embodiment of the citizen’s Europe, this Charter of Fundamental Rights. But now that this Charter is to be incorporated in the Treaties in Nice, certain governments have evidently given vent to their opposition. We consider this to be unacceptable, because by incorporating this document into the Treaties of the European Union, fundamental standards and values of the constitutional state and the social welfare state are being embedded in the European structures.</p>
<p class="contents">I would warn our Heads of Government against taking an over-minimalist stance in Nice. As the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, said, qualified majority voting, together with codecision – Article 62 linking the Charter with the Treaties – is to be the litmus test for our Heads of Government. We have a saying in the Netherlands that goes: ‘if you set the standard too low you will trip over it’. Our European project must not be allowed to trip up in this way. Should we falter, this will provoke Parliament’s condemnation. So we are banking on success, but it is up to you to make it happen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are facing the greatest constitutional crisis they have had in a hundred years and all they keep saying is that their being able to have such a crisis shows how well-designed their system is.</p>
<p class="contents">If we could only take a leaf out of their book, i.e. put a little less emphasis on the things that are going wrong in our part of the world, and a little more emphasis on the things that are going well, then we would be a good deal happier than we are now.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with everyone who has said that the Council must be put to the test. I also have my doubts. I hope they actually do what Elmar Brok has advised them to do. If they follow his advice then they will make a success of it. If they do not, then they will fail. It is particularly important, to my mind, for social policy and the Charter to be recognised in the Treaty by some means or other.</p>
<p class="contents">But why is it that we always think we are doing so much worse than others are, even though there are no objective reasons for this? I think that to some extent it is down to a certain insecurity on the part of Parliament, and also on the part of the Council and the Commission, when it comes to putting across the message, but on the other hand, it is also a sure fire consequence of the below the belt attacks launched by the so-called ‘sceptics’. They have nothing to offer. What they offer is a Balkans type scenario, which is the worst thing imaginable. The Balkans is the sceptics’ ideal. To hear Mr Bonde talk, the Balkans is his ultimate ideal. We can expect no better of him. If we then see that these people have absolutely no alternative, would only bring us misery and would bring our industry into a much worse state than it is at present, then far too much notice is being taken of them. I feel it is also up to the Council to try to act not just for the sake of national interests but also for the sake of the common European interest, because united we stand, divided we fall, and we had better not forget it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although we now see the French Presidency, Mr President of the Council, playing a decisive part here, it is also plainly evident that we are still at square one today, just a few days before the IGC ministerial meeting. You bear responsibility for the success of this project; you, the President-in-Office of the Council, also have the power to make things happen. We should include not only trade in goods but also the corresponding trade in services, as well as investments, intellectual property and competition, in the range of matters which are subject to qualified-majority voting in the Council of Ministers and amend Article 133(1) of the Treaty accordingly. That is our basic demand.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the European Union account for 40% of trade in goods and services in the world, compared with the US share of only 20%. We therefore bear a worldwide burden of responsibility for the establishment of more open markets as well as having the opportunity to export our technological systems and services to many countries of the world. I have seen at first hand in our Committee on Constitutional Affairs that the great majority of government representatives support the reinforcement of the role played by the European Union and are demanding that. Apparently, however, it is the French Government which is needlessly stonewalling on this issue. Let us not forget that France, as a major economic power in the European Union, benefits directly whenever the EU is able to speak with one voice and successfully defend its interests in negotiations with representatives of the world's major trading areas – the United States, Canada and the countries of Asia.</p>
<p class="contents">We proceed on the assumption that France will defend with justifiable vigour her own vital interests with regard to her cultural identity, which is also related to the cultural identity of Europe as a whole. We are urging a compromise, with provision for unanimity where these interests are affected, but I believe there is some way to go before we can start to move forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unresolved issues have predominated, and the common ground has been narrow. Now, very few days before the ministerial meeting of the present Intergovernmental Conference, the signs are once again unpromising. This time, however, it is paradoxically the prospect of an emerging consensus that is causing us political headaches. As the days go by, it is becoming ever likelier that the agreement the ministers will reach, while not representing the lowest common denominator, will be a rather low common denominator, indeed a very low common denominator. Many of us therefore fear that what Nice will offer in the way of institutional reforms will not really enable the Union to implement a major enlargement process involving the accession of twelve or more new Member States, unless further, more extensive reforms are implemented. I venture to doubt whether consensus will be easier to achieve in the new extended family than it is now. One can but hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Besides, the overall result of the coming IGC ministerial meeting, another small but unfortunately far from delicate detail is causing me some concern. In the resolution on Nice that we are discussing here, the last clause in point 6 says in essence that Parliament too should have a right of initiative in procedures under Article 7 of the EU Treaty (breaches of the principles of democracy, respect for human rights, etc.). In general terms, this would impinge upon the central role of the Commission. The fact that the Commission has the sole right of initiative is an essential element of our Union. Granting the European Parliament a right of initiative in this highly sensitive domain would throw the door wide open to party-political despotism. Do the European Socialists, who tabled this proposal, intend to react to every election in which the Left loses its majority by initiating a campaign of European ostracism against the new government? I advise the House to beware of such a move and ask you to vote against this clause tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why the work awaiting the protagonists of the Nice Summit will be challenging and high level, commensurate with the ambitious nature of the projects.</p>
<p class="contents">President Prodi, it will not be easy for you, just as it will not be easy for the Heads of State and Government together with whom you will have to find a solution to the many issues under debate, including the vital enlargement, the reform of the institutions and the replacement of outdated mechanisms, and the proclamation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is the first real step towards the European Constitution in which we believe.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to freedoms, individual rights and scientific research, the peoples and their representatives who are present in this and the national parliaments must have the final say. That, Mr President, is why we are launching an appeal in this House to prevent Brussels and Strasbourg being reduced to forums for national party political issues. We are here to build the Europe of the future which will completely reform outdated mechanisms and to establish a social market economy which will create employment and generate development. We cannot do this without the involvement and firm support of the peoples, who must see the European institution as the defender of their rights and the guarantor of their future, not as the seat of the bureaucracy and petty feuds of a limited, primitive political system.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us all endeavour to ensure that Nice is not the end of the line but the launching pad for a major project. In short, we must all aim high, and, in order to do this, we must believe implicitly in what we are doing.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Védrine,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (FR)</span> Mr President, I wish firstly to thank the Members of the European Parliament for a very high standard of debate. A truly important and truly difficult European Council is coming up, and at such times a kind of tension can be felt generally. Sometimes it can even be discerned in certain newspaper articles and it comes as no surprise to experienced Europeans. This debate has been of a very high quality, very concise and very useful. It was also what I really came here to listen to. I shall take as much account of it as I can. I definitely intend to pass on the information to the President of the Republic, who will be chairing the Nice European Council, the Prime Minister, and my colleagues on the General Affairs Council next Monday. So in that respect it has been very useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, although this exercise is also very useful because it raises many relevant questions and suggestions, I have to say that I found the overall tone excessively negative. I do not think the general tone of the speeches, while they were incredibly varied and rich in detail, genuinely reflects what Europe is really like today. Europe is in fact making progress, considerable progress. Of course I hear your concerns and respect them, but they do seem to some extent to be at odds with that considerable progress. To take the example of the agreement which has just been reached on fiscal harmonisation, and it was unanimous, that is an agreement we have been trying to get for years. I think it was first mentioned in 1989 actually. So – as one of you said, referring to American optimism and the way Americans talk about themselves – we should also be capable of valuing what is working well and what is making progress.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards method, I honestly do not see what else the country holding the Presidency can do. Holding it does not give us any extra power or allow us to act in the place of the others. It brings responsibilities which we shoulder as best we can. I do not see what method could be adopted to deal with issues as complex as institutional affairs, other than taking the problems one by one, seeing what everyone’s position is, trying to identify what room there is to manoeuvre, asking everyone how flexible they can be, and making proposals which take account of that.</p>
<p class="contents">All that can be done, but if the Presidency feels that its approach and ambitions are being blocked, it cannot disregard the positions of the Member States. That would not be democratic. Take the Charter – you are fully aware how active the French Presidency has been on that subject. Well, several Member States were against the very existence of the Charter if it were to have legal force and that had to be recognised. Some Member States were even against mentioning social affairs or new rights. So we had to move on, we had to compromise, remembering that Europe’s history is littered with political texts that have had major impact on political ideas, thought and progress, in some cases even when they do not have, or do not yet have, legal force. This is a perfect example of constructive compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Once we had reached agreement on a text – and this is a good text, very well drafted by the Convention, it reads well, it has style – some countries then said we must incorporate it into Article 6. As a country we support that view, but what do we do as a Presidency? We proposed that during the discussions and several countries opposed it, threatening to withdraw their agreement to the very principle of the Charter if we insisted on Article 6. So it is not at all a case of not proclaiming it, and it is not a problem of transparency. Everything that is going on is totally transparent. Nothing is being concealed. Everything is being widely debated. You know everything about everything, but some countries only agreed to the text of the Charter on condition that it remains purely political.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the Presidency do? The countries making this an absolute condition cannot be excluded from the discussion. The Presidency must be democratic. You are always talking about democracy, but you have no monopoly on it. There is democracy in the General Affairs Council too, and in the European Council, at all the meetings, in all the debates. We have to take it into account. That is not a lack of ambition, in fact it is precisely because we have been very ambitious that we have been faced with strong resistance throughout this whole affair. It shows considerable ambition to tackle institutional reform. That strong resistance would not exist without strong ambitions. It is all related.</p>
<p class="contents">We are doing our best, if I may say so. Consequently, I doubt if there is any other way of making progress apart from clarifying the position of each country on each issue and coming to the European Council with the most honest possible presentation of them, after trying to get them to shift of course.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also say that I do not think there is a problem between ‘larger and ‘smaller’ countries. I use those terms for convenience, but I never normally use them. I do not regard any country that belongs to the European Union as a small country, whatever its size, because its membership means that it too has influence over all the great issues, so the classic distinction is no longer entirely relevant today. The sense in which the press uses the terms is quite clear.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of the Intergovernmental Conference, the only issue where people said there was a disagreement between larger and smaller countries lay with the Commission. That is inaccurate too, because the proposals made were not proposals by the larger countries to penalise the smaller ones. There was an appeal for everyone to make sacrifices, small, medium-sized and large countries. That was the starting point for the theory that there was a confrontation between the larger and smaller countries. That is groundless; that is wrong. It is not true on any of the three other important issues at the IGC and it is not true on any of the other issues at the Nice European Council. So that picture is inaccurate, and I think the sensible thing is to put it behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards what has been said on qualified majority voting, Mr Poettering will forgive me, but I thought it was a little bit facile to name just one country and act as if that country’s shift in its position relating to its own problems was sufficient to bring about a large shift in the others. That is exactly what we did as regards the Commission. In developing the idea that it would be advantageous in the future to have a Commission that was not too large to be effective and retained its full capabilities, especially its power of initiative, we demonstrated that we too were ready to make that sacrifice. Equal rotation affects big countries too, as actually at any given time they might not have a commissioner, just like everyone else. There is no discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">That shift in position did not spread. It did not prompt sacrifice by others. The same applies to qualified majority voting issues. At present twelve of the fifteen countries think there are issues where they cannot move to qualified majority voting, not now. They accept it in principle, they accept it for the long term, but they have legitimate democratic interests to defend, and in their view the right conditions are not yet in place. That is the situation the Presidency has to recognise. There is no link between the positions of the various parties. If one country has an internal problem, that does not make another country’s internal problem disappear. We have recognised that difficulty, regardless of our ambitions, and as a Presidency we have returned to it many times, at many meetings – we will return to it again at Sunday’s conclave – but I am here to tell you what the situation is. I cannot tell you exactly what you want to hear. I have to tell it like it is.</p>
<p class="contents">We have done a great deal of work, but we have run up against the same old problem and I do not think a shift in a single country can start the ball rolling, because yet again we are faced with very tough national, political and democratic situations in twelve of the fifteen countries. Of course, we must try to make progress, because this is not satisfactory. It is not enough and between now and Nice we will make further efforts to identify what room there is for manoeuvre. All the same I wanted to make that point.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not want to take up too much time. This has been a very interesting debate, but it has been a long one. We have another interesting debate ahead of us. I would simply appeal to you not to make a premature scapegoat of the Presidency-in-Office. There is no justification for that when the Council has not even taken place yet, and disappointment itself is premature because it is too early to come to any conclusions. I understand all about the waiting, the impatience, the hopes and ambitions. I understand all that, I am listening, I am taking account of it and I will try to ensure that we bear it in mind and apply it to the political decisions we face in the course of the difficult negotiations in Nice.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the French Presidency that is going to succeed or fail in Nice. There is nothing in the Treaties to say that the Presidency-in-Office can annexe the prerogatives and responsibilities of the other Member States, or the Commission, or Parliament, or anyone else. At Nice it is the Fifteen who must take responsibility. The Fifteen decided to start accession negotiations with twelve countries that want to move forward and want a more effective, stronger Europe at all levels. It is the Fifteen all together who will or will not find the clear, transparent and democratic answer to today’s problems. I am sure the Fifteen will find a solution to many of the problems you have raised with the Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you again and I know we can find the solution together. I think Parliament will be able to witness the establishment of the improved institutional mechanisms needed to handle the future development of the European Union which unites us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At this point, I would just like to mention a few specific aspects of the next few days and emphasise the Commission's determination to achieve a high level Summit which will, at last, make it possible for our institutions to function properly once the great process of enlargement that we are undertaking has been accomplished. I would stress once again that this is one of the few major political decisions that the world is expecting in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would further stress that the Commission's determination will target not only the points we have just discussed but also the consideration and the attention that will be given to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I am quite aware that it will not become a Constitution overnight, but I also know full well that it will be a constant reference point for us from Nice onwards with regard to the principles according to which the European institutions are to proceed and the principles which the European peoples are to follow to unite in preparation for future cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why it is so important that the Community method is consolidated at Nice, together with the value of the European institutions – the Council, Parliament and the Commission – and their ways of working together. Here, today, we may be showing too little regard for the fact that we are bound in a single process, that we are not a separate part of a system but a unifying element in the future Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr Védrine, you mentioned that the situation here appears to be too tense, and you also spoke of a certain pessimism. Well then, I would like to reply to your appeal with an appeal of my own. I am well aware that 15 countries will make the decisions at Nice and that the role of the Presidency is not to be a one-man-band, but I have also learned through experience what the role of the Presidency and the responsibility of the French Presidency are. In recent weeks, we have with great confidence and responsibility presented the French Presidency with a series of major decisions to be taken, aware of the role that France has consistently played in advancing the progress of the European institutions. Although, as you rightly said, we cannot place all the responsibility upon France, we do know that France must demonstrate its great leadership abilities as a driving force by example.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">There are two points, which it is my responsibility to stress unequivocally for they emerged this evening as very heated and very important. With regard to the reweighting of votes, it is France's responsibility to propose what is to be the fundamental balance between large and small countries, the balance between the population and the strength of each individual country: it is France which must find the way forward in the construction of a Europe which is the Europe of both peoples and nations, and this is what we expect from the Presidency. But we also expect something else from France. We are quite aware that France is not the only country in the deadlock of incompatibilities and decisions. There are France, Spain, Germany: all the countries save Belgium and Italy have reasons for being unwilling to change from unanimous voting to qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in my opinion, the Presidency's role is of fundamental importance in this case as well, because I am quite aware that, if France is able to interpret the general interest with regard to the decisions on Article 133, none of the other countries will be able to resist the change. We are all awaiting this step forward for it is not a step forward just for France but for the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This Minister, is what we expect from France, inspired precisely by the great confidence which we have in your country and in the leadership ability that we know France can display at difficult times in Europe's progress.</p>

<p class="contents">A number of members of a Marxist-Leninist group tried to disrupt the meeting and threatened the Chairman. This was an abuse of this Parliament's proceedings, a gross discourtesy to a distinguished guest and an event that could have had very serious consequences. Mr President, will you please instruct the Quaestors to identify the culprits, to identify how they obtained access to the Parliament and ensure that they are banned from future access. Will you also take steps generally to tighten security in appropriate ways so that there could be no recurrence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is sometimes difficult to get legitimate visitors and groups into this building but those with malign intentions seem to have no difficulty. We began this session by expressing our condolences for the latest victim of terrorism in Spain. It would seem that those responsible for the demonstration in the Foreign Affairs Committee may have connections with a Turkish terrorist group. I am sure that all in this House will join me in condemning all terrorism whatever its alleged motivation.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Turkey, we are making many demands of the Turkish Government and people as they embark on the long road to accession to the European Union. At the same time, we expect that opposition groups in Turkey will resort exclusively to peaceful means. I shall be placing a declaration to this effect before the House and I trust all Members will give it their support. Mr President, I would be grateful if you would report back to the House on the points that I have raised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yesterday, two people broke into the meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee, interrupted the proceedings and threatened our guest, the Turkish Minister for Foreign Affairs, both verbally and physically. It was a dangerous situation. As far as I am aware, the two intruders obtained access to the House on the authority of a lady Member of Parliament. I shall give the President the name of the Member in question and ask her to investigate the matter and to take appropriate measures with a view to preventing such disruptive and aggressive individuals from entering the House. The shocking thing is that this incident took place with the aid of a Member of this House. I find it absolutely scandalous that Members of Parliament can stoop to such methods.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to put a second point to the Bureau. In our present situation, we shall continue to have problems with the safety of our guests. I believe that we must take action, which we certainly have not done to any extent hitherto, in order to ensure that the guests of Parliament can feel like guests in this House and that they need have no fear of being subjected to threatening behaviour. To that end, we must put the requisite organisational and security structure in place, which also means our guests being directly protected by people who are trained for that purpose, because we naturally cannot employ foreign security staff to escort our guests. I believe we face a new challenge here, to which I ask the Bureau to respond. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am totally opposed to anyone at all threatening an invited Minister, even a Turkish one. Since we are talking about Turkey, however, I should like to point out that a Member of Parliament from my group, Mrs Uca, was representing my group until yesterday at the congress of one of Turkey’s Kurdish parties, HADEP. She was unfortunate enough to utter a few words in the Kurdish language before coming to her national tongue, which is German. The Turkish police force immediately prevented her from speaking not just in Kurdish, which in any case she had ceased to do, but even in German, and there had to be negotiations before she was able to pass on a message of greetings from my group in German.</p>
<p class="contents">Virtually the same day, a leader from the Cypriot Parliament, who has, moreover, already visited the European Parliament, Mr Christou, was refused a Turkish visa even though he was travelling, if you can believe it, to a tripartite meeting in Istanbul between Turks, Greeks and Cypriots, in a totally peaceable context. I therefore urge you, Mr President, to please ask Mrs Fontaine, as President of Parliament, to send a letter to the Turkish authorities, certainly in order to apologise for this shabby treatment of one of their representatives but also to remind them that Members of the European Parliament or indeed members of the candidate countries travelling to their country should not be treated in this way.

In this letter, Mrs Hautala made mention of our support and sympathy for the efforts undertaken by the President, Mrs Fontaine, to set up negotiations on our own Statute as MEPs. It is therefore a matter of the deepest regret to us that a meeting that was planned for 30 November was cancelled. We urge you in the strongest terms to call another meeting before the end of the French Presidency, so that the discussion about the Statute can be brought to a successful conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This excellent initiative was repeated this year and the second forum will be held on 12 and 13 December in Paris, which is to say at the same time as the European Parliament’s part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">This is, at the very least, poor manners with regard to the European Parliament, if not an outright snub, and, allowing for the possibility that the Members of the European Parliament have nothing to say about human rights, even though they have voted, by a very large majority, in favour of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, they will be absent from this European Union forum which many of them attended last year in order to debate with NGOs and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge that, in response, our official representatives are not sent to this forum, and that, next year, a date should be agreed when Members of Parliament may attend, which means the dates of the Strasbourg sittings should be avoided when scheduling this important meeting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
