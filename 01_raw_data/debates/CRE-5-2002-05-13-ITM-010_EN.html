<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pack (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I recall how, in my last report on sport, in 1996, I called for the designation of a Year of Sport. Now we have one, but it took until Viviane Reding's appointment as a Commissioner for us to get it. That is a fine thing all the same, and I am grateful, but when I consider the title we have given this year, everything in me tenses up – it really is nonsense! Why do we have to tie ourselves in knots when talking about sport? I wanted a Year of Sport, and now we have a Year of Education through Sport. We all know why we are going around in circles; it is because sport should not actually be an issue, although it is one, not only as regards football but everywhere! At every hour of every day, everyone is talking about sport. It is only in the European Union that it is not meant to have a part to play.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we have to engage in such contortions? Sport has always crossed national boundaries. Here in Europe, it is by means of a common agency that we are combating the reprehensible practice of doping in sport. So there is sport in Europe. With the TV directive, we are also concerning ourselves with sports rights. So there is sport in Europe. It actually surpasses my understanding why the EU governments are still balking at it, and that is why I hope that, the next time you assemble together, you will have learned something from the Year of Education through Sport and will make of it a real European-level task which will not, of course, be proceeded with outside the bounds of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">We adopted this Commission proposal with a very great deal of goodwill. Indeed, we had hardly any problems with it, but Parliament does, of course, table amendments. We went along with the proposal as regards finance. I told myself, of course, that I had done the decent thing by not asking for more money, and then the Council went and said it was still too much! I will bear that in mind for the next time, when I will again make demands, and then perhaps we will even get more than what you have proposed. Thus we have been very successful in some programmes. I actually wanted it to be an overnight success, but – alas – that was not the case. Things seem to have settled down in the meantime, though.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not done as the Commission said in every respect. In one area, we stated that we would under no circumstances be willing to spend more money this year on research and investigations. We stated that all the money allocated for this year must also be spent on tangible schemes either in this year or as an interim payment. We made an exception to this for evaluation. There is bound to be one after a year of this sort, but this one is not in the part we want to try and delete. We hope, of course, that the Commission will support us in this.</p>
<p class="contents">We tabled amendments to enhance and promote the contribution made by unpaid work to informal education, to promote the spread of ‘best practice’ and to create an on-line database. We want to support networks to spread the education role of sport, and we have shed light on the major problem of the many competitive sportsmen and sportswomen who are unable to gain educational qualifications, because they reached the peak of their performance during their schooldays and then, to some extent, neglected their performance at school.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Year is an important one, happening across Europe in the year of the Summer Olympic Games in Athens, and measures will be implemented at Community and national level to promote long-term cooperation between education providers and sports associations<span class="italic"> </span>and to better integrate sporting practice and sporting values into teaching.</p>
<p class="contents">As the whole business struck me as a bit too dry, I took the liberty of devising a climax for this sporting year, and my fellow members of the committee went along with me. Let us, I said, have an athletics competition between school teams right across Europe in 2003, at the end of which the competition's winners will be invited to Olympia in 2004, where the Olympic flame is lit. I thought this was a brilliant idea. Our world lives on images, great images, and these images also depict actions. I must say that I would actually have liked our dear Commissioner to be a bit more supportive in putting this to the Council. The Council is against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, all I want to say is that it does not cost much more, and there will, indeed, probably be no additional expense whatever, as we still have money in reserve. Of course, we do not always have to tell the Council that, but we do have money. We can do it, and we should be able to afford it. I really cannot understand why they do not want us to!</p>
<p class="contents">We will certainly succeed in carrying off the vote for first reading without difficulty. I wish the Council would get a move on, as we had to, and get its common position out by 31 May. I can include my colleagues on the committee in promising that we are willing to take it into committee as quickly as possible, and, if necessary, to use a trilogue to ensure that we do not have to resort to a conciliation procedure. I think though that the Council still has to take a few steps in our direction on that point. I would be very grateful if the Commission could help them in that direction. Again, many thanks for presenting this, Mrs Reding. We are grateful that it has at last arrived! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sport has been since time immemorial a favoured, successful and effective means of influencing, in a fundamentally positive way, educational policy and the educational values that underlie our life together in society. The promotion of sport and the partnership between sporting and educational facilities has a positive effect on teamwork, tolerance, solidarity, the campaign against drugs and violence, and on fair and healthy competition without recourse to doping. These are values that need to be rediscovered and promoted. This makes the choice of 2004 as the European Year of Education through Sport, and against the backdrop of the Olympic Games and Paralympics in Athens and the European football tournament in Portugal, very much to be welcomed. The Commission is proposing a total of EUR 11.5 million to finance it, EUR 3.5 million of which are to be paid towards operational expenditure in 2003, the year when preparations for it get underway, and EUR 8 million in 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed financial framework must be compatible with the upper limit laid down in the Financial Perspective and must not be allowed to result in cutbacks in other areas. For reasons of efficiency and for the avoidance of unnecessary administrative costs, a coordinating body should be provided for in each Member State. There is, in my view, no need for a formal requirement to consult a group of as yet unspecified experts who would decide on the financing or cofinancing of individual measures. Administration and evaluation of the programme should remain a public matter, that is, one for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision on the European Year of Sport is the right one, but it is continuity that brings success. This splendid scheme thoroughly deserves to be continuously developed, signifying as it does an investment in our young people growing up to be healthy and able to contribute to the integration of a healthy and united Europe. This investment in our future will pay dividends, for our young people are our future! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to emphasise two points on the reasons why I think this report is so important. Firstly, I think that we should not forget that sport is a great educational tool.</p>
<p class="contents">People have always talked about the qualities of sport – that it teaches us to value striving to succeed, or that it brings people together, for example. A million things I do not intend repeating right now.</p>
<p class="contents">However, what I do want to say – and if I may be so bold I would like to say I have some experience in this field – is that young people, especially children, do not usually, or would find it difficult, to forget what they have learnt through playing whilst practising sport. Sport has a great educational role in a wide range of fields, especially in areas such as the environment. This is just one of the many areas that can benefit from education through sport.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to emphasise is that we should not forget that we are living in a Europe in which differences based on race and culture are growing every day, and that we all have to make an effort to integrate into the European Union. Sport plays a fundamental role in this integration. This would be difficult to achieve with any tool other than sport, and any attempt to do so would entail enormous costs.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that 2004, European Year of Education through Sport, will be the driving force we all need to be able to ensure the inclusion in the Treaty of an article that makes specific reference to sport, and for this programme to be the starting point, and only the starting point, of what sport can achieve in the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The galleries are empty. All day long, there are young people sitting in the galleries and now their issues are being discussed there is, unfortunately, nobody there. Perhaps we can change that in the future, when proximity to our citizens might mean that people understood what goes on in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite that, I rejoice at the initiative that has been set in motion, and I would like to thank you too, Commissioner, for the way sport has been brought more into the field of vision of European policy and perhaps getting more attention. I am convinced that sport merits such attention, playing as it does a very large number of roles in society, for example, enhancing communication skills and social skills, personality development, preventing ill health and more of the same besides. Sport is a very important factor in social and economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">As an initiative, the Year of Sport or of Education through Sport is a very good first step, and one that needs to be followed by many more. Despite that, there is one criticism that I would like to address, one on which I agree with Mrs Pack. The title of ‘Year of Education through Sport’ is intended to restrict the events to schools. I cannot go along with that, believing as I do that clubs and organisations have to be involved in the activities and supported in doing so. Education through Sport does not only happen in schools, but mainly in clubs and in an immense number of sporting organisations. The Year of Education through Sport must also, I believe, make an impression on clubs and acknowledge the work they do.</p>
<p class="contents">I also expect there to be much discussion in this House of the values that sport embodies, about what, for example, fair play is, about the nature of amateur and professional sport, about what is meant by training and care for young sportsmen and sportswomen and a good deal else. Discussion must range far and wide. If we leave an area out, it will only be half a job and we will have wasted an opportunity.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Year of Languages was, I think, a very good example. It involved both the schools and every sort of educational organisation, making it possible to spark many initiatives and get many new schemes moving. We should take it as our example. It worked, and the same thing can also – must also – work in sport. Sport is movement! You should not be restricting movement, but encouraging it. That calls for scope for development and also for financial guarantees.</p>

Maybe this is overrating it a little. Who does not remember the sports days at school when we were young, in which everyone had to take part, whether they were sporty or not? They gave us a good feeling afterwards, a feeling of solidarity, and that is actually what we want to work on together this year. I therefore welcome the proposal to pronounce 2004 European Year of Education through Sport as an excellent initiative, and I should like to thank Mrs Pack for the thoroughness with which she has studied the proposal. I agree with her that the title sounds a little contrived. My personal opinion is that the title is formally correct of course, for sport does not have its own legal basis. A number of Member States were opposed to it, and in this way, a compromise can be struck after all. In my view, it also emphasises precisely the educational side of sport, something which I very much applaud.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I should like to make a few observations with regard to this plan. Sport at school is an excellent way of teaching children all kinds of human values, such as fair play, team spirit and tolerance; sport can even play a role in creating solidarity and understanding for your fellow human beings, and this is more than ever essential. You will understand where I am coming from, but sport helps in the fight against xenophobia and vandalism, certainly if the children in school teams are able to take part in competitions between schools, and at regional, national and also European level, as Mrs Pack suggests. A fine concept, whereby the European idea is spread.</p>
<p class="contents">The objections my group has in this connection pertain to the idea that such competitions should be organised and funded by the Commission. The Commission does not have the budget for competitions of this kind, and in my view, it is not up to the Commission to organise these. I take the view that this would sooner be a role for national Olympic committees.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point I should like to make is the fact that this initiative should not be restricted to one year. Sound initiatives should be followed up. I am confident, however, that Mrs Reding is already thinking along those lines and will unquestionably work on this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One third of Europe's citizens pursue a physical activity on a regular basis, making sport one of the most significant social phenomena in Europe in the 20th century.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is an excellent way to engage people in their communities. It can contribute to education and lifelong learning, as well as promoting qualities of leadership, citizenship and teamwork. The Year of Education through Sport should concentrate on the social inclusion aspect of sport. However, for this to become a reality, we need to provide better facilities within deprived communities. What I am deeply concerned about is the lack of group leaders and volunteers to run sports projects, especially in the more depressed regions. What will be in the programme to address this?</p>
<p class="contents">Also it is important that projects chosen should provide a firm foundation on which to build. The momentum provided during 2004 must carry on beyond 2004 – it should not stop there. It should become an established part of projects within our communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The involvement of local and regional authorities also during the year will be crucial to its eventual success, as they are in a unique position to ensure that the widest possible access to local community action is achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">Sport is not only a form of entertainment for the spectator. It also has a strong social dimension and it is this social dimension that should be one of the main themes during the year. All sports should be included, not just the mainstream sports – and we need to emphasise this throughout the programme. It is also important to link projects started under the European Year of Disability in 2003 with sporting projects for the disabled in 2004. No one should be excluded.</p>
<p class="contents">I thank the rapporteur for an excellent initiative and look forward to participating in the development of the projects throughout the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To start work on a dossier in 1995 or 1996 and to still be working on it today could really be called fighting for a cause. That is my first point and I would like to thank you for having shown such commitment. My second point is that I am a member of two parliamentary committees, namely the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, and the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities, both of which have the rather sad or dubious privilege of working long hours on a regular basis.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, this evening, I would like to bring together these two concerns and discuss both equal opportunities and sport. This is the purpose of my amendment, which I would like to come back to, as I think that this is a very important point. In its decision, the Commission is, in actual fact, highlighting discrimination alone. Yet, I do not feel that this aspect, which Mrs Pack has also emphasised in a recital, is sufficient. I think that sport, for girls and for women, is a factor which encourages identification and emancipation and that we must, therefore, give it the importance that it deserves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind you that the subject of equal opportunities in sport was highlighted during the Beijing +5 Conference held in New York in June 2000, and that Article 26 of the Helsinki report of September 2000 also mentions this issue. Furthermore, the IOC organised a conference on ‘Women and Sport’ in Paris in the year 2000 and the French Minister for Sports placed the issue of ‘women and sport’ on the agenda back in 1997; the success of this initiative speaks for itself. Thanks to this initiative, the media now gives coverage of sporting competitions for women. I think that we must take all of this on board. I know, Commissioner, that you intend to organise a symposium on ‘women and sport’ in the near future and this is something I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we must stress this point in the report. In the Mediterranean countries, for example, in Iran or in Algeria, women achieve emancipation through sport. Sport is therefore an important factor in emancipation. In France and in other countries of the Union, young immigrants manage to achieve emancipation, perhaps not through the right of vote and citizenship, but through their bodies and sport. Sport is therefore an extremely important social link, which is something the previous speaker pointed out. I would, therefore, like us to stress this point.</p>
<p class="contents">As a final point, I would like to mention that there is a problem with one of my amendments because the French word <span class="italic">mixité</span> has been translated into English as ‘mixed-sex sport’. In actual fact, I did not mean mixed-sex sport; I meant diversity in sport; women’s sport must be encouraged at school and at competition level. I have brought this translation problem to light, but I did not notice it until it was too late, and I hope that Mrs Pack will take this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, we know that the Olympic Games are approaching. We know that from one Olympic Games to another, the role that women play in sport is increasingly important. I would hope that this role is even more important in Athens than it was in Sydney and I know that I am not the only one who is hoping for this. Education obviously serves as a basis for what may come later, namely performance and competition. I hope, Mrs Reding, that these considerations regarding women and sport will be of interest to you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, we would like to take this opportunity to stress how important the initiatives and displays linked to the European Year of Education Through Sport will be, taking place as they will be in 2004, the year when the European Championship, the Athens Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games will all be held as well. It will also be an important year in terms of the Winter Olympics, which will be held subsequently in 2006 in Turin.</p>
<p class="contents">A year or so ago, Commissioner Reding announced this event here in Strasbourg, stressing precisely the wider impact of sport, a dimension which is not just linked to its purely economic role but also – and, I would add, in particular – contains social and cultural added value for European society as a whole. However, there are still great disparities in the world of sport and we must therefore focus in particular on the small sports clubs and<span class="bold"> </span>support their efforts in training young people.</p>
<p class="contents">You will also remember, Commissioner, the meeting I had with you on football transfers in Europe, on which occasion I suggested creating a European Sports Agency. I feel that this is still a very relevant project, although it must first be included in the Community Treaties on the basis of the declaration on the specific characteristics of sport made by the Fifteen at Nice in December 2000. Indeed, I feel that such a body would aid the dissemination and promotion of healthy sporting activity and a European-level sporting culture while, at the same time, encouraging cooperation between sporting bodies to combat violence, discrimination, racism and even doping.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Year of Education Through Sport will therefore be an extremely important event and we are ready to give it our full attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that if we want the European Year of Education through Sport – 2004 – to be a success, we must work hard to ensure that it does not end up as just another action that is set up by the EU but which never actually reaches the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, and so that this action does not go unnoticed, I think we need to make use of all the institutions at local, regional and national level that have been working for a long time to promote the educational value of sport. These institutions should contribute to this action in a coordinated fashion, contributing synergies, which is the most important thing.</p>

For years now she has done some really excellent work to promote sport and physical education. It is excellent that the Commission has set out to organise a Year of Sport. It was about time. It is regrettable that sport has no legal basis in Community legislation. There must be a separate Article devoted to sport, or at least it should have a clear mention in the article that deals with culture. This would not mean that the sports world would be deprived of its influence but that sports organisations would themselves be able to influence the decisions that apply to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Young people who go in for sport must be included in the EU’s various exchange programmes. The current practice, whereby sports-related projects get hidden away under other articles in the budget, is ridiculous. It is always better to call things by their right name.</p>
<p class="contents">Unquestionably, sport is also of educational importance, as the report mentions. For this reason I hope that the status of sport in the school curriculum will be seriously reconsidered. In many Member States schools organise important voluntary activities after the official school day has ended. Resources for these afternoon activities must also be significantly increased. Clubs that organise voluntary activities in the afternoon often do valuable work. Physical activity in the afternoon enables children to satisfy their natural need and desire for exercise. At the same time they are being offered something meaningful to do and social problems and exclusion are being prevented. Thanks to the clubs children do not need to spend long hours alone in the afternoon while their parents work longer days than before, there being no let-up in the labour shortage that is beginning to emerge. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are very few fortunate coincidences in politics but I am very pleased that Mrs Doris Pack is rapporteur today, because it was she who came up with the idea back in 1996. Mrs Pack, <span class="italic">was lange währt, wird endlich gut.</span> [It was worth it in the end.] Let us hope so!</p>
<p class="contents">When I became Commissioner, I immediately took up this idea and placed the project on the agenda. I know that it is not the European year of sport that you had wanted. You are also aware, however, and you have also acknowledged this, that the Community has no specific responsibilities in this area. However, this should not prevent us, as the Nice European Council urged us to do, from using the values that sport encourages to strengthen and improve existing Community policies and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the European Year of Education through Sport is of political, practical and symbolic importance. It is of political importance, as it demonstrates that the Commission is interested in fully harnessing the educational and social values of sport. It is of practical importance as EUR 11.5 million will be released to finance Community, national, regional and local projects and this money will be added to the appropriations that our partners have earmarked for this event, which means that, in 2004, further, ample resources will support the educational dimension of sport. And do not forget that the European Year of Languages was a great success. Why was it successful? Because it was taken up by the people, the citizens and by private associations. It enabled us to make progress. It stimulated a debate, and society itself took charge of it. So, ladies and gentlemen, often, all that is needed is a boost of this kind to bring about change.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it is of symbolic importance, because 2004 is an Olympic year. Yet, the Olympic Games are scheduled for the beginning of the century along with other events such as the European, intercontinental and world championships. The European Year will take place throughout the Union, and I think that the eyes of the whole Union will be on this event and it will be a wonderful opportunity to promote the social, educational and cultural values of sport, whilst reminding us of the roots of the Games when sport was not simply a business, but was a festival of culture and education.</p>
<p class="contents">I knew, Mr President, that I would find an ally in the European Parliament. Not simply because the idea was conceived here, in Parliament, but also because the Commission has always had the firm support of Members to place the ideas and values of sport on the education agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">It was a pleasure to read Mrs Pack’s report and I did so with interest. Not only does Mrs Pack support our proposal, but she also improves it in a number of areas. Some aspects of the report will however merit particular attention and will provoke some reservations within the Commission. They are not fundamental problems; rather, they are reservations that have been inspired by legal concerns, or quite simply because we believe that certain ideas that have been expressed exceed the framework of the legislative provision.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, Amendment No 7, which designates three specific sporting events in addition to the Olympic Games in Athens. I think this is tantamount to inviting speculation regarding the hierarchy of different types of sports and levels of competition in terms of media coverage and public interest. Since any list of this kind is highly contestable and most certainly incomplete, I think that it would be preferable not to list any of them and include all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Amendment No 22 and Amendments Nos 29 and 38 which refer to it cannot, unfortunately, be accepted by the Commission. It is not that I do not think the idea of organising inter-school competitions, of encouraging partnerships between academic organisations and sporting organisations, of benefiting from the symbolic and media impact of the flame is not both excellent and feasible – very much the opposite in fact – but the Commission itself has no authority to organise projects of this type. It has no competence in this area, I reiterate the autonomy of the sporting movement, on the one hand, and the autonomy of the Member States in organising studies, on the other hand. We cannot therefore impose such partnerships from above.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I myself believe that carrying out this type of project is extremely important as is the great symbolic value of the Olympic flame and truce, for example. Not only do I want to ensure that the text of the decision makes such projects possible but I also want to do everything possible, Mrs Pack, so that our partners, both schools and the Olympic committees, take the initiative as part of this European Year. In addition, I have good reason to be optimistic: look at the sport/school political action launched in 2001-2002! This was a pilot project launched by the European Olympic Committees and the Ministers for Education in the three pilot countries: the Netherlands, France and Italy, with the support of the European Commission. This test has already shown that yes, such projects are possible, that we can forge ahead and that we can find partners who wish to support this action.</p>
<p class="contents">On this basis, ladies and gentlemen, with your help, I think that, during the European Year of Education through Sport, we will find many associations, many bodies, many volunteers who are willing to help us. This is also one of the key objectives of this European Year, namely to encourage the educational institutions to work in partnership with sporting organisations. Formal training and non-formal education must be combined. Sport encourages values, such as teamwork, solidarity, respect for rules, respect for one’s opponent, thinking of others, so many elements which will be on the agenda during this European Year.</p>
<p class="contents">The year 2004 is an Olympic year. It is a year that will be marked by other prestigious events and sport and sportsmen and women will be making headlines practically every day. We must use the impact generated by the media to prove that, as well as sports played at a highly competitive level, which receive generous financial assistance, there is also considerable work being done by civil society, in particular based on the voluntary sector which we must support and encourage. It is this educational and social dimension in which the Community is interested.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also thoroughly prepare this year: so many things must be done in advance, for instance work, contacts and scheduling all need to be arranged. That is why I hope, Mr President, that Parliament will make every effort to reach a political agreement with the Council as soon as possible, in order to adopt a common position before the end of the Spanish Presidency, which is what the Presidency really wants. I think that this would be in everyone’s interest. It would certainly benefit the idea that, back in 1996, Mrs Pack proposed and desired; in other words, to place sport and its social and educational dimension in the limelight for the good of Europe, for the good of our societies. Thank you for your help. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
