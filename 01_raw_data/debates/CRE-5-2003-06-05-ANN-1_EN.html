<p>(EL)</p>
<p>1. As the honourable Member already knows, pending the European Parliament's opinion on the Commission proposal, which it is hoped will be returned by plenary on 5 June 2003, the Council approved a general approach for a decision on guidelines for the employment policies of the Member States at its meeting on 3 June. At the same time, the Council affirmed that access to the labour market is a major priority in the case of people with disabilities who, it is estimated, number approximately 37 million in the EU, many of whom are willing and able to work.</p>
<p>2. In the preamble to the decision, the Council recognises that the real integration of people with disabilities into the labour market will result in greater social integration and higher employment rates and will improve the viability of social protection systems. Therefore, the policy applied must respond to negative discrimination, provide an individualised approach to individual needs and create jobs by giving employers recruitment incentives.</p>
<p>3. Point 7 of the guidelines therefore calls on the Member States to promote the integration of and combat the discrimination of people at a disadvantage in the labour market, by increasing their recruitment potential, increasing the number of jobs and preventing all forms of discrimination. Within these frameworks, it is calculated that applicable national policies will need to have as their objective a significant reduction by 2010 in each Member State of the unemployment differential of people with disabilities, in accordance with all the national objectives and definitions.</p>
<p>4. At the same time, the Council has also adopted a resolution concerning the promotion of employment and social integration of people with disabilities. This resolution calls on the Member States and the Commission, within the framework of their respective powers, to continue efforts to remove barriers to the integration and the participation of people with disabilities in the labour market.</p>
<p>5. The resolution calls in particular on the Member States to ensure the transposition and implementation of Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation before the deadline is agreed. It also calls on the Member States and the Commission to reflect on the need for further measures to promote employment and social integration and to consider the possibility of taking measures, at national and European level, consistent with the objectives of the European Employment Strategy.</p>
<p>6. The resolution also encourages the social partners to promote the integration of people with disabilities, in particular in the mainstream labour market, through their actions and their collective agreements at all the relevant levels of social dialogue.</p>
<p>7. The Presidency believes that these initiatives are absolutely in keeping with the concerns expressed by the honourable Member. They are also in line with the political declaration by the Ministers responsible for integration policies for people with disabilities made in Malaga on 8 May 2003, which affirms that one of the main aims of the next decade is to improve the quality of life of people with disabilities and their families.</p>
<p> Finally, the Presidency would like to reiterate, as part of the undertaking it has made in this sector, that this political undertaking was also confirmed by the Ministers at the informal Council meeting in Nafplio on 23 and 24 January 2003, which emphasised the need for more extensive inclusion of disability issues in employment and social protection policies.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0336"></a>

<p>1. As regards consumer policy issues, the Greek Presidency has continued actively to work. On 19 May 2003, the Council held an exchange of views on the Regulation on sales promotion and a policy debate took place on the Directive on consumer credit. Guidance for future work on these files was established, in order to progress further during the second semester of 2003. Furthermore, the Greek Presidency continued promoting the dialogue with consumers' organisations.</p>
<p>2. At the same Council on 19 May 2003, two major steps on foodstuffs legislation were marked, which will have significant impact on the protection of consumers' health.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Directive on the conditions of use for the food additive 'E 425 konjac' which has caused the death of some human beings in third countries was adopted at first reading.</p>
<p>Secondly, a political agreement was reached on the modification of Directive 94/35/EC on sweeteners, regarding notably the authorisation of new products and the monitoring of authorised sweeteners, particularly the reduction of the intake of cyclamates.</p>
<p>Final adoption on this issue as well as on the labelling of allergenic ingredients, which is also an important issue for consumers' health protection, should be reached, with due regard to the European Parliament competencies, before the end of 2003.</p>
<p>3. During the second semester of 2003 the Commission is expected to present a certain number of proposals in sectors such as safety of services, E-confidence, enforcement of consumer rights, unfair commercial practices, fortified food, dietetic food. The Council is looking forward receiving them in order to engage the process of examination.</p>
<p>4. As regards developments, which have occurred during the Greek Presidency leading to greater awareness of the importance of preventive measures with regard to illnesses, the following can be mentioned:</p>
<p>response to the SARS epidemic,</p>
<p>progress made with the WHO's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control</p>
<p>agreement on a Council common position on the proposed human tissues and cells Directive.</p>
<p>The Council has already reported in this Assembly the results of the extraordinary meeting of the Council on 6 May 2003, in connection with SARS. The Council, at its meeting on 2 June 2003, held a further exchange of views on the SARS epidemic in which the importance of close and rapid co-ordination between Member States was underlined and delegations reiterated their support for the Commission's forthcoming proposal.</p>
<p>On 21 May 2003, the 56th World Health Assembly adopted the text of the World Health Organisation's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. The 'EPSCO' Council on 2 June 2003 agreed on the adoption of a Council Decision on the signing of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Council also reached political agreement on a common position concerning a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on setting standards of quality and safety for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human tissues and cells.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council also draws the attention of the Honourable Parliamentarian to the Council Conclusions on combating stigma and discrimination in relation to mental illness, as a result of the EU Conference on 'Mental Illness and Stigma in Europe: facing up to the challenges of Social Inclusion and Equity' held in Athens on 27-29 March 2003.</p>
<p>Finally, the Council at its meeting on 2 June 2003 reached agreement on two of the three proposals making up the 'review of Community pharmaceutical legislation': the proposal</p>
<p>for a Regulation on medicinal products and the proposal for a Directive on medicinal products for human use. It took note of a progress report on the third proposal; the proposal for a Directive on medicinal products for veterinary use.</p>
<p>5. The Italian Presidency intends to focus work in particular on:</p>
<p>collaborating closely with the Parliament on the second reading of the human tissues and cells Directive;</p>
<p>examining the Commission's forthcoming proposal to establish a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control with a view to reaching an early agreement thereon;</p>
<p>securing the adoption of a Council Recommendation on cancer screening, for which the Commission's proposal has recently been received;</p>
<p>securing the adoption of Council Conclusions on Healthy Life Styles, Education, Information and Communication following the Conference to be held on this theme in Milan on 3-4 September 2003.</p>
<p>achieving a political agreement on the proposed Directive relating to medicinal products for veterinary use in order to finalise the package on 'the review of the Community pharmaceutical legislation' with a view to transmitting the Common Position on all 3 texts to the European Parliament.</p>
<p>if possible achieving a political agreement on the proposed Directive related to traditional herbal medicinal products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0338"></a>

<p>(EL) The current regulation for financing farming development measures makes provision for special measures for young farmers in the form of a EUR 25 000 subsidy for the establishment of young farmers under 40 years of age who meet certain additional preconditions, together with a 5% increase in the limit of the total value of aid, expressed as a percentage of the eligible investment figure.</p>
<p>In the proposal to amend Regulation (ΕC) No 1257/99, the Commission did not propose new measures or the amendment of current measures. However, within the framework of technical discussions on this proposal, there was talk of the problem of young farmers and the issue of introducing additional measures was raised, especially in the form of an increase in the amount of the start-up subsidy or an increase in the maximum financing percentage (currently 45% and 55% for disadvantaged areas), together with the possibility of derogating from the application of the reference period in order to determine the amount to be paid to newly established farmers within the framework of the support regimes. Similarly, the issue was touched on of special treatment for newly established farmers, so that they are less affected by modulation measures and, consequently, by the gradual reduction in aid.</p>
<p>In the absence of any relevant proposals from the Commission, however, the Council is focusing its examination on the proposals for special measures submitted to it by the Commission. It is not possible at this stage for anyone to anticipate the results of the work and, hence, the impact which the reform will have on young farmers.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0340"></a>

<p>(EN) At its November 2002 meeting, the Council (GAERC) adopted its conclusions on Trade and Development, following the Commission communication on the same subject. These conclusions are in line with the joint Council-Commission Statement on the EC Development policy of November 2000, which highlights Trade and Development as a priority area of Community development activities contributing towards the overarching goal of reducing poverty.</p>
<p>In its conclusions, the Council pays particular attention to the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) inter alia by</p>
<p>reaffirming its commitment to assist LDCs in taking full advantage of the 'Everything But Arms' (EBA) initiative;</p>
<p>supporting the Commission's proposal to pay particular attention to the needs of LDCs in the allocation of resources for trade-related assistance;</p>
<p>inviting the Commission to consider further practical measures to facilitate exports from developing countries and especially from LDCs, particularly where such exports are confronted with administrative and bureaucratic procedures and problems that may create unintended obstacles;</p>
<p>inviting the Commission to work for an accelerated and streamlined WTO accession process for the LDCs.</p>
<p>In conformity with the Council conclusions of May 2002 which stressed the need to ensure greater coherence between EU development assistance policies and other EU policies of an external dimension (such as trade and security policies), the Council has invited the Commission to make systematic and thorough analysis of any direct and indirect effects of policy proposals on developing countries and their impact on sustainable development, and it has welcomed the Commission's intention to present a general review of the EU's trade-related assistance in 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0342"></a>

Applied to pension reforms, it seeks to co-ordinate the action of policy makers whereby mutual learning is seen as an instrument to identify best practices. This process involves the three pillars of pensions (public state schemes, occupational pensions and personal or private pensions).</p>
<p>Following the Joint Report by the Commission and the Council on adequate and sustainable pensions, the Spring European Council invited the Council and the Commission to maintain the momentum for co-operation within the open method of co-ordination framework in the area of pensions by delivering special studies focusing on common challenges for pensions systems.</p>
<p>In response to this mandate, the Economic Policy Committee (EPC) and the Social Protection Committee (SPC) have both outlined a programme of work to the Council.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member rightly points out, the growth of occupational pensions exposes individuals and institutions to a number of risks and challenges, including company insolvency risks. These risks may quite severely affect the individual's retirement income.</p>
<p>In this context, it is envisaged that the topics for further study by the Social Protection Committee would involve regulatory policies to ensure sustainability and effectiveness of the second (and third) pillar pensions schemes. In addition, the Economic Policy Committee should examine the feasibility of further studies on such issues as guarantees of private pension schemes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0346"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that, following the adoption of the Comprehensive plan to combat illegal immigration and the trafficking of human beings by the Council in February 2003, the Commission was requested to carry out a feasibility study on improving sea border control (point 63). This study is currently being carried out by the Commission, which is expected to present a final report of this feasibility study at the Justice and Home Affairs Council meeting on 5 and 6 June 2003. The Council is therefore not yet in a position to comment on future measures to be taken with regard to the control of sea borders nor on the feasibility of establishing a European Coast Guard.</p>
<p>The Council would like to recall that, in the framework of the Plan for the Management of the external borders of the Member States of the European Union, various joint operations were carried out to control and reduce illegal immigration by sea. A final report on the implementation of the above-mentioned Plan, including i.a. an evaluation of the results of these operations, will be presented at the meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 5 and 6 June 2003 with a view to its submission to the Thessaloniki European Council.</p>
<p>As usual, the Council will report to Parliament on these developments in due time.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0350"></a>

<p>Institutionalised childcare is for the time being the most widespread form of social care for children in Latvia. Since 1989 the number of children in all kinds of social care institutions has grown fourfold. This is largely due to the increasing number of families in economic difficulty. Unfortunately, the foster-family service is rarely used, one reason being that the local authorities do not have enough social workers who could work professionally with the child's family to facilitate the child's earliest return to his or her family.</p>
<p>Has the Council taken any measures in cooperation with Latvia to promote the development of long-term solutions in the form of community-based alternatives and the development of professional social work in local municipalities? What has been done to support families and to enable them to care for their children, as the family should have the primary responsibility for the child according to the CRC?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EL) The Council attaches the utmost importance to compliance on the part of candidate countries with the political accession criteria laid down by the European Council in Copenhagen and, specifically, democracy, the rule of law, human rights and the protection of minorities. Therefore, protection of the child constitutes a requirement for all the candidate countries and the Council has already had an opportunity to reply to relevant questions in relation to some of them.</p>
<p>In the present case of Latvia, however, the Council must point out that the Commission's regular report for 2002 on Latvia's progress towards accession only refers in passing to this specific issue, in order to record a positive development: the ratification by Latvia of the European Convention on Recognition and Enforcement of Decisions concerning Custody of Children. However, this issue is not included in the priorities laid down in the revised accession partnership for Latvia approved by the Council in 2002 or in other related unification documents, such as the Union's positions in view of the more recent meetings of the bodies of the relevant European Agreement, namely the Association Council and the Association Committee.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission strongly believes that the Union success in promoting Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) is ultimately based on widespread ownership of CSR principles by business, social partners and civil society. In this context, the Union Multistakeholder Forum on CSR has been set up to allow stakeholders to develop common answers to the challenges raised by CSR.</p>
<p>The Commission is part of the process as it chairs and facilitates the meetings, promoting constructive dialogue and consensus building in the identification of drivers, challenges, obstacles and recommendations for action. Also, it should be stressed that with the Forum the Commission has not given up its right to take the initiative on CSR: at the end of 2004, and on the basis of the analysis of the report detailing the conclusions of the work of the Forum, it will decide how CSR can best be promoted in the future.</p>
<p>With the Forum, the Commission has taken a 'gamble' on the willingness and ability of the parties (employers, trade unions, civil society organisations, business networks) to work together in a constructive way and to develop a common approach to CSR. This challenge has been accepted by all invited actors.</p>
<p>The Commission is satisfied with the progress made so far: each of the four Round Tables of the Forum has met at least once, the quality of case-studies presented has been good, and participating stakeholders have shown strong commitment as well as an open mind as discussions have moved forward in a constructive and cooperative climate.</p>
<p>In the coming months, the Forum, meeting at plenary level, will review the progress of the first meetings and prepare the next wave of Round Table meetings, which should enter into more focused and analytical discussions in order to allow for concrete outcomes to the exercise. These should include a clear roadmap recommending actions to be undertaken not only by the Union, but also by the Forum members themselves - whether alone or in partnership with others.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0327"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission can assure the honourable Member that it is extremely concerned that all corporate restructuring be undertaken having full regard to its social consequences. This is why, in January 2002, it launched a first stage consultation of the social partners on the social aspects of corporate restructuring. The intention is to establish, at European level, a set of principles to be followed in restructuring situations.</p>
<p>Two of the issues highlighted in the consultation document are relevant to the circumstances described by the honourable Member: the need to fully involve employees in the restructuring process through proper information and consultation procedures and the need to have regard to the local consequences of any restructuring proposals.</p>
<p>Directive 2002/14/EC of the Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2002 establishing a general framework for informing and consulting employees in the European Community<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> provides for information and consultation of employees in such cases.</p>
<p>There are other existing Community provisions which apply. Under the terms of Council Directive 98/59/EC dealing with collective redundancies, an employer contemplating collective redundancies is obliged to begin consultations with the workers' representatives in good time. Such consultations should cover ways of avoiding or reducing the number of workers affected and mitigating the consequences. Any alleged breach of the national legislation implementing the collective redundancies Directive would, however, have to be pursued at national level.</p>
<p>The same could be said of the European Works Council Directive, adopted in September 1994, which provides for worker involvement in management decisions within multinational corporations. This Directive constitutes a valuable instrument to ensure that workers' interests are fully taken into account in circumstances like the ones mentioned by the honourable Member, when decisions have a transnational scope.</p>
<p>The Commission hopes that the European social partners decide to fully address the issues raised in the Corporate Restructuring consultation document, by jointly agreeing a set of guiding principles which would govern socially responsible restructuring of business throughout Europe.</p>
<p>Industrial change has economic implications and an impact on employment and social cohesion. However, it also provides opportunities when anticipated, prepared for and managed.</p>
<p>Dialogue, transparency, proper worker involvement, anticipation, risk prevention and the development of employability are the key elements of a European answer to this phenomenon.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The European Employment Strategy has the leading role in supporting the implementation of the employment and labour market objectives of the Lisbon Strategy at national level. Within the Employment Strategy, special attention is paid to the situation of people with disabilities, ethnic minorities and other disadvantaged groups. One aim is to develop appropriate forms of preventive and active policies to promote their integration into the labour market. The proposed new set of Employment Guidelines also includes a specific target aimed at significantly reducing the unemployment gaps for people at a disadvantage in each Member State.</p>
<p>Within the framework of the European Employment Strategy, the Union also calls on Member States to secure adequate financial provision to support the implementation of the guidelines. However, no systematic information has been incorporated in Member States' National Action Plans on Employment.</p>
<p>The concrete implementation of employment policies remains a matter for the Member States. However, the Union promotes the labour market integration of people with disabilities mainly through the European Social Fund. During the present programming period 2000-2006, EUR 9.3 billion has been set aside for promoting equal opportunities for all in the labour market for the Union as a whole or EUR 650 million for Greece alone. This policy field targets all disadvantaged groups, which of course includes people with disabilities. The money is used to support a range of actions including work experience wage subsidies, work experience schemes, temporary sheltered employment and other intermediate labour market steps. In Greece, support is also provided for self employment, including the development of co-operatives for people with mental and severe physical disabilities. The mid-term evaluation of the Structural Funds, due by the end of 2003, will provide a more complete picture of both the financial allocation to people with disabilities and the effectiveness of the measures.</p>
<p>As people with disabilities would greatly benefit from a level playing field which would allow them to participate in society on an equal footing with non-disabled persons, the Commission is actively promoting a mainstreaming approach. Other policies and programmes therefore also deal with aspects related to the special needs of people with disabilities. The Social Inclusion process, in particular, recognises that disability is one of the factors that may cause social exclusion and poverty. The Common Objectives underpinning the Social Inclusion Process call on Member States to promote the social integration of women and men at risk of persistent poverty due to their disability. This requires policy responses across a broad range of policies including housing, health, education and training, and transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0290"></a>

<p>1. The Commission has not established such a plan. Member States are responsible for approving and maintaining the lists of establishments and facilities for the collection, storage and disposal of meat and bone meal and rendered fats. In the case of France, these establishments must respect legislation in relation to 'établissements classés pour la protection de l’environnement', and to this effect an assessment vis-à-vis public health is carried out before any new establishment is approved.</p>
<p>2. However, the Commission sent a memorandum to Member States in June 2002 clarifying the Community legislation<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> applicable to the disposal of meat and bone meal and rendered fats, and requesting data on the arrangements in place in each Member State to ensure safe disposal of meat and bone meal and rendered fats. Twelve Member States (including France) replied giving details of storage facilities, official controls, plans for disposal and recovery and export/trade. The analysis of the replies reveals that there are measures in place in Member States ensuring overall –</p>
<p>- safe storage</p>
<p>- regular inspection, supervision and monitoring of facilities; and</p>
<p>- sufficient storage, recovery and disposal capacity for the continuous disposal of current and ongoing production levels.</p>
<p>3. Also, the Commission’s Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) has issued a number of guidance documents<a href="#defann_12_2" name="refann_12_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to enable Member States to overcome possible shortcomings that may be due to inadequate collection, storage, handling and disposal or recovery methods. The guidance documents are intended for interested parties to ensure that prohibited meat and bone meal and rendered fats do not re-enter the food and feed chains, for the protection of animal and public health and the environment.</p>
<p>4. Concerning the outcome of the French « Mission Interministérielle pour l'Elimination des Farines Animales », the French government launched a call for tender in 2001 for the construction of plants for the disposal/recycling of meat and bone meal. Out of 13 dossiers submitted, only four were retained on technical grounds. France notified the Commission of the proposals for State aids, and the Commission has recently approved three dossiers in relation to energy recovery.

They have already designed their high-speed rail network and are currently building it as quickly as they can. Portugal is one of the European countries most in need of a high-speed link with the trans-European networks. A series of surveys have been drawn up, plans have been devised and rejected and decisions are constantly being put off.</p>

<p>(FR) Decision No 1692/96/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 on Community guidelines for the development of the trans-European transport network specifies what action is required on the part of the Community, with due regard for the principle of subsidiarity, in order to set up and develop a trans-European transport network (TETN). The guidelines constitute a general frame of reference for encouraging action by the Member States; the projects specified constitute a common goal, the achievement of which is dependent on the stage they have reached and on the availability of financial resources, without predicting the financial commitment on the part of a Member State or of the Community<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. However, the implementation of the projects identified as part of the TEN is the sole responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>Fundamental, however, to the revision of the TEN guidelines are the delays noted in getting the network up and running, which are of greatest importance in terms of the railway and cross-border projects, as well as other factors such as enlargement.</p>
<p>As long ago as 2001<a href="#defann_13_2" name="refann_13_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission proposed that the guidelines be revised to include a number of high-priority projects. This proposal applied to the whole of the Iberian (Spain and Portugal) high-speed train network and was agreed to by Parliament at first reading.</p>
<p>The revision process will also help to provide instruments to facilitate the implementation of the network’s priority projects<a href="#defann_13_3" name="refann_13_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>A second, more extensive, revision is currently being prepared following the setting-up of a high-level group made up of representatives of Member States and observers from the candidate countries.

Member States may choose to set certain conditions or limitations to such measures as they see fit, provided the latter do not conflict with other applicable Community law, such as the principle of non-discrimination.’</p>

<p>(FR) In its report on the state of the internal market in services, the Commission reviewed the various barriers and restrictions of different kinds capable of affecting the functioning of the internal market in services. Although, in identifying these restrictions, no reference was made to any one Member State, but rather to several countries, the honourable Member is quite right to highlight the existence of certain national provisions restricting multidisciplinary activities by making practices incompatible with each other, with especial reference to estate agencies.</p>
<p>It is apparent that incompatibilities of this sort are liable to affect an operator’s ability to engage in more than one type of activity, especially in a crossborder situation, and to restrict his right to the free provision of services.</p>
<p>At this stage, however, faced with the importance of restrictions of this sort being imposed on service providers and common to more than one country, the Commission would prefer not to embark on an analysis of national restrictions of this type as part of separate proceedings relating to a particular measure or Member State, but rather in the context of a more general approach.</p>
<p>The Commission is, in fact, at present engaged in carrying out a general analysis with a view to drawing up a comprehensive proposal for a framework directive which will remedy such deficiencies and enable every citizen of the Community to enjoy the freedoms to establish themselves and to provide services.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission believes that an ambitious Social Europe must be one of the Union’s core objectives. This does not mean an extension of Union competence on social matters.

In particular, in an enlarged Europe, retaining unanimity will be a recipe for inactivity.</p>
<p>The Working Group on Social Europe made a number of useful recommendations. The Commission is pleased that these have gradually been taken on board in the drafting. For example, it is now clear that the section of the Constitution concerning the democratic life of the Union will include an article devoted to the social partners. Equality looks likely to be mentioned in the article on the Union’s values.</p>
<p>Two areas deserve special mention. First, it looks unlikely that an article will be included defining the open method of coordination. This is to be regretted : such a definition could have clarified when the open method should be used, and would have given scope for guarantees of accountability and transparency.</p>

<p>In this context, and indeed extending this anti-discrimination policy to other areas as well as agriculture, would the Commission be prepared to adopt measures to put into effect this incompatibility between the receipt of Community aid and wage discrimination towards women?

<p>(FR) This request would seem to presuppose the addition of a new requirement to compulsory cross-compliance, a feature of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). The application of cross-compliance presupposes that the grant of direct CAP aid should be conditional on compliance with European regulatory standards in the areas of the environment, food safety, health, animal welfare and workplace safety at farm level. The scope of cross-compliance cannot be extended without limit, and the Commission has chosen to give priority to the area of workplace safety by adding, as Annex III of the proposal for a comprehensive regulation included in the reform package, four European directives on the subject.</p>
<p>Present discussions within the Council on the reform of the CAP are, moreover, tending to favour a reduction in the scope of cross-compliance rather than the opposite.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0310"></a>

<p>Chinese exports of canned mandarin segments will be the ruin of the Spanish mandarin industry in the harvest year 2003-2004 if the European Commission does nothing in the face of the massive influx of these products into the European Union. According to data published by Eurostat (and therefore in the Commission’s possession), exports from China increased by 120% in the harvest year 2001-2002 and triggered a decline of up to 20% in prices in the EU market. Several Spanish companies have already become insolvent and if the Commission continues to turn a deaf ear to the sector’s complaints, the harvest year 2003-2004 will see Chinese imports completely supplanting the remaining companies, which have generally already cut their activity rates to 30% of their production capacities. In the forthcoming harvest year Chinese products could completely absorb the Community’s share of the market, as has already happened in other importing countries (United States and Japan). Could the Commission explain why, since it already has the information it needs, it has not yet entered into discussions with China to at least try to reach a agreement with that country on voluntary export restraints?

<p>(EN) Under Rural Development, the second pillar of the Common Agricultural Policy, aid measures can be designed specifically to support for SMEs in the agricultural sector. A particular focus can be given to peripheral regions. Member States and/or their regions set up 'Rural Development Plans' according to their specific needs and for the period running from 2000 to 2006. These are subject to approval by the Commission.</p>
<p>Member States may select from a broad menu of measures that are contained in the underlying Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development.</p>
<p>Two of these measures are particularly relevant for SMEs:</p>
<p>Support for improving processing and marketing of agricultural products, and</p>
<p>Chapter IX, on the promotion of the adaptation and the development of rural areas, opens numerous possibilities to support SMEs within a broader scope: As example may deserve the setting-up of farm relief and management, the marketing of quality agricultural products or the encouragement for tourist and craft activities.</p>
<p>In addition, under the Community initiative LEADER+ SMEs can participate in integrated territorial rural development strategies of pilot character.</p>
<p>The Fifth Framework Programme aimed at fostering SME participation in agro-food related Research and Technological Development (RTD) projects through the 'Quality of Life and Management of Living Resources Programme' (QoL), and especially Key Action 1 'Food, Nutrition and Health' and Key Action 5 'Sustainable Agriculture and Forestry'. SME participation within collaborative, cost-shared projects in these Key Actions reached 14% (10,5% in terms of budget) well above the 10% goal that was fixed at the beginning of the Fifth Framework Programme.</p>
<p>Additional EUR 40 million were spent for co-operative RTD projects (CRAFT), which represented about 50% of the total QoL CRAFT budget. This mechanism helps finance groups of SMEs to work together to solve common problems. With the help of an RTD performer, such as an institute or university, SMEs with little or no in-house research expertise can receive a considerable boost to their competitive advantage and their ability to innovate.</p>
<p>Previous projects have included developing a high-protein ingredient for fish feed, a waste management system for the wine industry that uses bacteria to eat noxious substances, and innovative cutting and handling technologies for hardwood parquet flooring. The following list illustrates the variety of agricultural research carried out with the participation of SMEs as CRAFT projects.</p>
<p>The Sixth Framework Programme (2003-2006) will provide support to agricultural research though different sources, namely the priorities ‘life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health’ (development of basic knowledge and tools), ‘food safety and quality’ (research activities related to the food chain) and ‘sustainable development, global change and ecosystems’ (research activities related to agriculture-environment interactions). In addition, scientific support to the Common Agriculture Policy will be made available under the ‘Policy Support’ action line.</p>
<p>One of the objectives of the Sixth Framework Programme (FP6) is to ensure that at least 15% of the budget of the priority thematic areas is allocated to SMEs. To this end, an SME Task Force was created within General Directorate for Research and Technological Development to monitor SME participation in FP6, to identify and spread best practice, and to establish targets of SME participation per priority thematic area. According to a first progress report, 17.2% of the budget of total appropriations of the priority thematic areas are expected be devoted to SMEs.</p>
<p>In addition, an internal Innovation/SME Group within priority thematic areas 1 and 5 ('Life Sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health' and 'Food quality and safety') is developing and implementing activities to achieve the 15% goal for both priority thematic areas.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2003-0341"></a>

<p>(EN) Community humanitarian aid operations are conducted in strict compliance with Council Regulation<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (EC) N° 1257/96, of 20 June 1996, concerning humanitarian aid.</p>
<p>The provisions of Council Regulation 1257/96 ensure that humanitarian aid operations comply with the principles of International Humanitarian Law and with those governing humanitarian aid, namely the principles of impartiality, non-discrimination and independence.</p>
<p>Council Regulation 1257/96 states that the sole aim of Community humanitarian aid is to provide assistance, relief and protection to help people in third countries victims of natural and man-made disasters.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Regulation provides that humanitarian aid is accorded to victims without discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic group, religion, sex, age, nationality or political affiliation and must not be guided by, or subject to, political considerations. Furthermore, it provides that humanitarian aid decisions must be taken impartially and solely according to the victims’ needs and interests.</p>
<p>Community humanitarian aid operations are carried out by implementing partners such as non-governmental organisations which guarantee its impartiality in the implementation of humanitarian aid. Implementing partners also include international agencies and organisations entrusted by the international community with a humanitarian mandate such as the International Committee of the Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies as well as programmes, funds and agencies which form part of the United Nations system such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP), World Health Organisation (WHO) and United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF). The Regulation states that the independence and impartiality of non-governmental organisations and other humanitarian institutions in the implementation of humanitarian aid must be preserved, respected and encouraged.</p>
<p>The European Commission Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) puts the above into effect through an Annual Strategy Document prepared in consultation with implementing partners to ensure that humanitarian needs in all affected areas are addressed adequately and on a non-discriminatory basis. Particular attention is given to so-called 'forgotten' crises and needs, which do not attract political or media interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This Directive has now been formally adopted by the Council on 13 May, further the second reading amendments voted by the Parliament on 12 March.</p>
<p>This Directive is based on a fundamental principle of legal separation between the institution and the sponsoring undertaking. In the absence of a guarantee or insolvency insurance, this is a key element to ensure the protection of the persons receiving retirement benefits. This would ensure that in the case of a bankruptcy of an undertaking paying contributions to a pension funds, the acquired pension rights of the members and beneficiaries are preserved. This directive, which will enter into force in tow years, also contains a number of other stringent prudential standards that aim at protecting members rights .</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission has taken a proactive and leading role in responding to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).</p>
<p>As recently stated by the Council on SARS (6 May 2003) this has been undertaken through the Community Network for the Epidemiological Surveillance and Control of Communicable Diseases in the Community working under the Decision 2119/98/EC, and it has provided a very effective basis for the rapid exchange of information within the EU and for a co-ordinated response, in which the EFTA and Candidate Countries have fully participated in collaboration with WHO.</p>
<p>The application of health protection measures, including those undertaken to prevent the spreading of SARS during mass gathering, falls to the authorities of the Member States.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, concerning the prevention of SARS during events such as the Special Olympics, according to the information now available, only persons with symptoms are contagious and can transmit the disease. A close contact is required for transmission. A ‘close contact’ means having cared for, lived with, or had direct contact with respiratory secretions or body fluid of a suspect or probable case of SARS.</p>
<p>As recently stated by WHO (15 May 2003: Guidance for Mass Gathering: hosting persons arriving from an area with recent local transmission on SARS), a person who is symptom free and has not been in close contact with a suspected SARS patient may freely be welcomed without any other measures.

<p>In a number of recent judgments, the Court of Justice has established a precedent which may have major practical implications for the purchase of goods, works and services by public authorities and public enterprises.</p>
<p>The Court of Justice has extended the ban on discrimination on grounds of nationality so far as to require a form of advance publication of the wish to conclude a contract even if the value of the purchase is below the generally applicable thresholds and the procedures under the EU's directives on tendering therefore do not apply. The Commission confirmed this practice in its written answer of 13 May 2003 (<a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0273_EN.html">H-0273/03</a>). However, the Court of Justice does not specify a new minimum value of public contracts for which tenders must be invited or which specific criteria must be met in inviting such tenders.</p>
<p>Clear rules are needed in order not to muddy the waters over public procurement (minimum values of contracts for which tenders must be invited, procedures relating to invitations to tender, etc.) Are these in the pipeline?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member is aware, the Commission has already given an answer to her question <a href="/doceo/document/H-5-2003-0273_EN.html">H-273/03</a> during Question Time of Parliament’s May 2003 Plenary session<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In answer to the renewed question on whether the Commission intends to prepare detailed provisions applicable to contracts below the current thresholds, the Commission can only reiterate that to extend the detailed provisions of the Directives to all contracts irrespective of their value would be disproportionate and might consequently raise some criticisms of over-regulation and ensue excessive 'red tape'. In this context, the Commission has taken due notice of the fact that a number of Member States have already adopted national rules on how to ensure transparency and equal treatment for smaller contracts, for example by adapting the provisions of the Community Directives to procurements below the thresholds. According to the information available to the Commission, yet more Member States are currently envisaging the introduction of national measures for procurements below the current Community thresholds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
