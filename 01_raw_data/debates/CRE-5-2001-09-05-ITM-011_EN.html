<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">von Boetticher (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not want to address all the issues raised in the Commission’s proposal for a directive on data protection in electronic communications. Most of the proposals are well-founded and necessary, and have our support. This also applies to the work of the rapporteur, Mr Cappato, whom I would like to congratulate on his work.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one highly controversial issue, however. What is our position on direct advertising by e-mail? At present, there are four Member States in Europe which have opt-in systems, which means that commercial e-mails are banned if they are unsolicited, and are permitted only with the prior consent of the recipient. Most other Member States have an opt-out solution, with individuals having to register on Robinson lists if they do not wish to receive commercial e-mails.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have two options: Amendments Nos 42, 43 and 44 proposed by the Committee and the rapporteur call for an opt-out solution as a minimum standard, supplemented by Amendment No 61, which provides for review after three years. Countries which have an existing opt-in system can continue with this as an “add-on” to the minimum standard.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 53, 60 and 62 call for an immediate introduction of the opt-in system which would then be compulsory for all Member States. There are good arguments for both opt-in and opt-out and we will hear many more of them in this debate, undoubtedly presented with passion. I confess that I tend to favour an opt-in solution. Nonetheless, there is a serious decision before us today, and that is whether to adopt option 1, i.e. opt-out as the minimum standard, thus maintaining the status quo in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we have this situation? Firstly, we chose the opt-out solution as a minimum standard in the <span class="italic">e</span>-Commerce Directive a year ago, although this will also be reviewed in three years. It would be absurd, incoherent and contradictory to adopt a conclusive solution in this directive, whether it be opt-in or opt-out, just a year later.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, no one can predict the precise course of events. No one can say with certainty what the advantages and disadvantages of the two options will be in the next two years. Trade practices, citizens’ information requirements, but also their security needs are undergoing rapid change. It is quite impossible to predict how the commercial sector will respond to the new opportunities afforded by direct advertising by e-mail. It may be tempting to make comparisons with conventional mailshots, but this is inappropriate. Let us remain faithful to our original approach, without drawing any hasty conclusions, and wait for the outcomes of this House’s wise decision – which was adopted with an overwhelming majority – on the <span class="italic">e</span>-Commerce Directive: opt-out as a minimum standard, and the option of opt-in for Member States, with monitoring of the two approaches.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paciotti (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, the Commission communication on the safe Information Society complements the preceding initiatives, in particular the global plan of action for electronic communications in Europe, and will require further interventions in a field that is constantly evolving.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cederschiöld report approves of this initiative and enhances it with appropriate legislative measures and suggestions for cooperation instruments to increase the effectiveness of the fight against cybercrime and to ensure a balance between demands for the prevention and punishment of crime and respect for civil liberties. This balance, which is guaranteed in the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must always guide the actions of the European Union, and for this reason, too, the broad and accurate Cederschiöld report deserves our full agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s draft directive also deserves great appreciation; it aims to update personal data protection in the electronic communications sector and not to leave things as they are, since harmonisation is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, the Cappato report proposes useful additions to the directive which reinforce the limits placed on the invasion of privacy by public authorities, especially as regards forms of generalised electronic surveillance, which was discussed this morning. In this it will certainly be supported, even though, unfortunately, our legislative powers do not exist in this area. In other respects, however, the Cappato report reduces the protection of citizens’ privacy offered by the draft directive, particularly where we have legislative competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposes that European citizens’ e-mail addresses and mobile telephone data could be included in public lists and given out on-line only if the interested parties had given their prior consent. The Cappato report, on the other hand, proposes that e-mail addresses and mobile telephone data should be included on public lists and each interested party could ask to have them taken off.</p>
<p class="contents">An analogous difference, we have already heard, concerns the regulation of unsolicited communications for direct marketing purposes. The European Commission proposes that messages should not be sent except to those who have given their own express consent, just as now happens with faxes. The Cappato report proposes that the opt-out system could also be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">If you consider the speed at which a list of e-mail addresses could be circulated on-line and come to the attention of an unlimited number of people interested in sending unsolicited messages, and if you consider the cost in time and money of eliminating these unwelcome messages and sending requests to the various senders to stop forwarding them, you will have an idea of the burden on citizens of adopting the opt-out system. It is a prospect that runs the risk of discouraging and deterring people from using the net and e-commerce.</p>
<p class="contents">In an amusing article, an Italian journalist wrote: ‘I thought I had bought a little telephone, but found myself with a <span class="italic">tamagochi</span>, that Japanese toy that needs looking after like a baby. My phone company never leaves me alone; it sends me so many messages, like a teenager; it asks me if I want to take part in a competition, if I know about certain new discounts; it greets me when I go abroad, and then it welcomes me back.’</p>
<p class="contents">Just think when your mobile number and e-mail address are known not only by your own service provider but by all possible service providers in the world, who never confine themselves to selling goods but want their brand to please you, to seduce you and to belong to you.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want e-commerce to have a future, we cannot force consumers to spend their time cancelling unwanted messages or pursuing their senders to beg to be left in peace. There is no reason not to ensure the same protection for e-mail as there is for faxes; the highest level of protection of people’s rights will also ensure the highest consumer loyalty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The receipt of e-mail is considerably less free of strings for the receiver than the receipt of paper leaflets and brochures. The costs may total EUR 10 billion annually for receivers, not to mention the cost in time. We therefore need, just as with paper leaflets, “No thank you” stickers. Personally, I would gladly opt for self-regulation by industry, but in practice it is clear that “opt-out” is not sustainable. For this reason, the Liberal group will support the Commission’s proposal for “opt-in”. Meanwhile there is a bill before the US congress for an “opt-in” that paves the way for sound agreements worldwide, which is necessary in an age of unlimited communication.</p>
<p class="contents">Unwanted post will not be limited to the Internet. The mobile telephone sector will play an increasing role in the period ahead, so that companies and consumers will be saddled with high costs, while the infrastructure becomes very vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark concerns the storage of traffic data. I refer to the ECHELON debate of this morning. In my view it is an invasion of privacy if traffic data are stored for longer than necessary. As a result consumers will never gain the necessary trust in e-commerce. In conclusion, the rules within the Union should be harmonised. After all, our telecom companies work in a pan-European way and therefore need uniform rules so that legal uncertainty is ruled out. For this reason, subsidiarity in this field is not an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But that does not mean that they can force people to read what is there. I regularly receive unwanted advertising on my e-mail. I have often had to struggle through English language forms in order to fill in at the very end that I wish to be removed from the mailing list. Still, I am regularly unsuccessful. An “opt-out” arrangement is bad for the consumer. The latter is dependent on the goodwill of the company in actually deleting his or her name. Deletion itself is time consuming and at the consumer’s expense.</p>
<p class="contents">It is often claimed that good companies only mail in a targeted way. But first of all, in that case, supporters of the system are already assuming that there are a substantial number of bad companies that make a mess of things, and secondly, it may be well targeted from a marketing point of view if I receive information about baby clothes, but I do not want to download romper suits or nappies to my screen at my own expense. Well targeted from a marketing point of view does not necessarily mean either welcome or limited. If unsolicited advertising eventually really does take off, I foresee a situation where many people will turn away from the open Internet and e-mail. In that case freedom of expression will have suffered a great setback. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously the whole area of new technologies is one that has presented us with many problems as well as boundless opportunities. Unfortunately, however, as with most new opportunities, these have been hijacked to a huge extent by people of criminal intent who use them for illicit means. Therefore the onus is on us to ensure that we can put in place proper controls and measures, not with regard to access, but ensuring that parents can make certain their children will not be endangered by these new technologies and also that there is cooperation amongst the law enforcement agencies across the Member States. I welcome the fact that in the reports there is a role for Europol and Eurojust as well as between the Member States. I also welcome the establishment of the forum on cybercrime. This is an important area where we can bring all the actors together, including the manufacturers of equipment who can put in place certain things that can help us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is a forward looking plan when we look at cooperation with the United States of America and other countries throughout the world, to ensure that this new technology can be used for the benefit of all of mankind and not for those who want to avoid our legal structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Velzen (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (NL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, in the first place I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report, but on behalf of Mr Westendorp, the Chairman of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, I must lodge a serious objection to the procedure followed. It had been agreed that use would be made of a strengthened Hughes procedure, but little has come of that. I will not go into detail. The Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy has not wanted to hold up this debate because of the urgency, but we nevertheless wish to make a serious protest.</p>
<p class="contents">We are ultimately concerned here with two important political questions. In the first place whether we choose “opt-in” or “opt-out” or a mixed system for a certain amount of time. The second question concerns the nature and storage of traffic data. I myself am a supporter of “opt-in” and would like to mention a few arguments. Mrs Plooij has already pointed to the study by the European Commission which shows that European citizens alone spend some ten billion on junk e-mail.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider it a much more important point that public support for the knowledge society is waning. People are already sick of the fact that, for every two e-mails you are happy to receive because of whom they come from, there are 74 others that you do not want at all. Then you must actually pay for them. Mr President, that causes immense irritation, which in the United States has led to the new term ‘permission-based marketing’. One is asked in advance if one wants something. This is a form of self-regulation that we in Europe must also move towards. We are still lagging behind and we must establish a semblance of order. For that reason, Mrs De Palacio’s amendment is apposite, although it talks of 2006. It is true that in 2006 we can indeed move towards self-regulation, but we need “opt-in” for now.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, my third objection is that almost everyone talks about e-mails and, fortunately, a number of fellow MEPs have spoken on this issue. Just imagine, we now receive all kinds of welcome messages when we cross the French or Luxembourg frontier. We do not know what is behind them, because we do not have the impression that there is any further message behind them. So we have to call an end to this and that costs money. Imagine getting a message every two minutes in this Chamber from well-intentioned medium-sized and small companies about a new product. Who is going to foot the bill, Mr President? That is the question before us and we must give it further consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth, reason, Mr President, why I am in favour is that the majority of states – they no longer number four but actually seven – have chosen the “opt-in” system. Mr President, this concerns a fundamental question and I am requesting the Commission to give an answer. Why are two systems acceptable in e-commerce and not here? Have I understood correctly that the fundamental reason is that in the case of e-commerce, the harmonising articles were sidelined, not included and hence placed in parentheses? The core of this directive is that it deals expressly with harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second problem is, of course, what happens in practice if one Member State chooses “opt-in” and the other “opt-out”, since e-mails make no distinction between borders. I believe that the Commission will have to say something about both the costs and the question whether the two judicial systems can exist alongside one other.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns the possibilities of tracing. Of course we do not see the providers as tracing services and for that reason the restriction of the nature of traffic data and the term for storing traffic data are of essential importance. Therefore it is possible with the amendments in this field to prevent citizens from feeling that via e-mail and via our mobile phones a disguised ECHELON system is again being introduced. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am in no doubt that the forum supported by the Commission and Mrs Cederschiöld will highlight new issues and new problems. Moreover, the political front lines will probably not be the usual ones. This was also abundantly clear in today’s debate on electronic communications.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to point out that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party does not support Amendment No 55, for I think that the Committee’s proposal is clearer on the issue of storing communications data. A minority of the ELDR Group believes that we should wait and see how these systems work and that we should apply the principle of subsidiarity. We support Amendment No 61 concerning the supervision clause. Our approach is characterised by humility, for we do not believe that any of these proposals is the decisive factor. Rather, it is enlightened citizens who decide.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that many of those who will be making decisions in the House tomorrow are really not aware that the issue of <span class="italic">spamming</span> is, in large part, also regulated through the general data protection directive. We have a situation, for example in Great Britain, in which 44 per cent of all e-traders do not know that they are contravening this directive. Moreover, people do not know what service they can obtain. I believe that responsible and aware behaviour on the part of consumers is the most important thing of all.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from a country in which we have an opt-in arrangement, but we still cannot do anything regarding, for example, people who make use of changed addresses. We are constantly seeing different forms of <span class="italic">spamming</span>. I wonder if we shall begin to be required to have some form of register of addresses in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask the Commission whether it has considered addressing the issue in the transatlantic or global dialogue. What truth is there in what is said about America’s attitude? We have received different information about this. Many say that the Bush administration does not yet intend to do anything, that it is too soon and that there is a wish to monitor technical developments. I also wonder which rules apply if a European company <span class="italic">spams</span> outside the EU. Is it the e-commerce directive or this directive which applies in that case? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I am here, having shadowed it in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. I would like to commend Mrs Cederschiöld on the way that she has incorporated so many of the opinions of different committees into a very comprehensive report and also to congratulate the Commission on this initiative. I feel this is a very worthwhile and challenging document.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the problems with the report is that it contains a huge amount of material and potential actions and priorities will therefore have to be set. So this evening I should just like to address what I believe is a crucial problem that needs to be looked at in the short term: the whole question of how we encourage the development of electronic commerce to use these tools, to address the sort of business issues that some colleagues are already trying to frustrate, in my view, by moving prematurely to the sort of rigid opt-in arrangement that they are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">The e-commerce market is at a very early stage and is still underdeveloped. We do not want to choke it off by some of the things that we are talking about. But we do need to address the security issues.</p>
<p class="contents">A very important report produced by the British business association, the CBI, last week clearly showed that both businesses and consumers are discouraged from moving into the electronic commerce market place because of concerns about security. Businesses, particularly small and medium-sized businesses, are worried about the vulnerability of their enterprises to fraud and fraudulent transactions. I suggest to you that one of the things that we must work on is to ensure that small and medium sized enterprises get the benefits of this revolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumers are worried about getting involved in transactions because they are worried about the security of their payments. Those are the critical issues we have to tackle. We have to combine that with a regime that allows SMEs to use e-commerce in a targeted and effective way. So I will combine my remarks on both reports by saying that I believe we are taking the right course with Mrs Cederschiöld and the right course with Mr Cappato. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, therefore, becoming crucial to ensure that there is rigorous protection against potential abuses or even criminal acts. We talk of cybercrime, both in terms of fundamental rights and privacy and also in the context of services of general interest, bank transfers, investments, credit card fraud amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Cederschiöld is therefore right to call for a coherent European strategy which, on the one hand, ensures the freedom of the market and improves the security of information services and infrastructures and, on the other, fights against criminal activities that affect not only the interests of individual citizens but also public interest itself.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also discussing the report by Mr Cappato, whom I should like to congratulate on his work on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the telecommunications sector. This is a report that warranted a lengthy debate and which seeks to find a balance between the protection of private life, the legal aspects and the interests of industry. Apart from the issues concerning intervention by Member States when carrying out criminal investigations, the main issue concerns <span class="italic">spamming</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the position put forward by Mr von Boetticher on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but I must also add my own personal view: in terms of protecting the interests of consumers, I incline more towards the Commission’s proposal than to that tabled by Mr Cappato, more towards the opt-in solution than towards opting out. The question is whether it is effective, especially if it is only adopted by the European Union. This is an issue that concerns the Union’s relationship with its partners, something that has already been mentioned in this debate. I am sure that none of us wishes to see an e-mail system becoming increasingly unusable because it is swamped and blocked up by countless messages of this type, unsolicited and often of dubious taste. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that we should distinguish between three main areas, i.e. <span class="italic">from business to business, from business to customer</span> and <span class="italic">from customer to customer</span>. Then we should start thinking about principles. I do not believe that a separate solution is necessarily required for each type of technical communication. We are all familiar with the idea that you can attach a sticker to a mailbox. We have all learned to use the telephone, mobiles, sms, and e-mail. I think that the real challenge now is to think about how we want to use this technology and this range of information and advertising opportunities in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is important to take values into account here. I know people who say: I want to receive as much information as possible in a wide range of areas. I want to be able to decide for myself what I keep and what I throw away. There are others who say: I only want to receive the information which I have requested myself. We are also familiar with this concept with regard to debt payable to, and debt collectible by, the creditor. I think we should discuss this point in detail as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards <span class="italic">cyber war</span> and cybercrime, we should focus on three main points. We should step up research and development in this area, especially in Ispra near Milan. I think there is a great deal of work to be done in this area, especially as regards security in the Commission and the Parliament. We should think about the type of education and training we can offer in this field, e.g. at colleges of higher education and through university departments. I think that action is needed here. We must also think about the type of security infrastructure which should be available in the hardware and software fields in future.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that a separation of powers is also important. The prosecution services, the courts and the operators must work together to ensure that these systems are not abused. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Cappato and also Mrs Thors, Mr Bakopoulos and Mrs Schröder of the various contributing committees of the European Parliament for this report. I will start with the Cappato report.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that Parliament is now debating this important directive which forms an essential element of the electronic communications regulatory reform package. This will enable us to try and minimise the procedural delay which the data protection directive has incurred, as compared with the rest of the package.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to concentrate on two issues which have been discussed by so many. First, opt-in for unsolicited commercial e-mails and the question of traffic data retention for law enforcement purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears from the debate that the proposed opt-in for unsolicited commercial e-mails divides opinions in this House. This is understandable, since this is a complex issue and arguments on both sides of the debate have some merit. However, I am convinced that the Commission proposal for opt-in is best, for essentially two reasons. First, the internal market needs a harmonised solution, a simple and clear rule throughout the EU. It is particularly important in an economic sector which is so profoundly without frontiers as electronic commerce over the Internet is.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr van Velzen asked me a question about the applicability of subsidiarity in this field. I want to be crystal clear. It is legally impossible for opt-in countries to enforce their system with regard to mail coming from opt-out countries. These two systems cannot exist because the opt-out regime will override any opt-in systems. We can discuss subsidiarity but in practice it cannot work with the two systems. The opt-out system, especially, will override the opt-in system.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason is the cost issue which has been mentioned by many. It is very difficult to justify that the recipients of unsolicited commercial e-mail will have to pay for messages which they do not want to receive. Receiving paper advertising material in your traditional mail box is annoying, but at least you do not pay for it. You do not pay for the printing, you do not pay for the transport. E-mail marketing may well be the only form of marketing where the recipient carries most of the cost. In addition, removing unsolicited e-mails from mail servers entails a substantial cost for Internet service providers. For that reason, Internet service providers strongly favour opt-in solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must remember that the Internet is going mobile. This is starting now with SMS messages. But this legislation will concern all e-mails which will go in future to mobile terminals. That will be more disruptive than receiving such messages on your PC. Imagine the mobile device in your pocket beeping all the time to announce the arrival of yet another commercial offer you cannot refuse and you want to keep your mobile phone on because you want to be connected with the people close to you. Moreover, messages to mobile terminals may also entail an even bigger cost, if the subscriber is roaming like most of us gathered here tonight. We are roaming practically all the time. With the advent of the Mobile Internet, the costs and nuisance of unsolicited communications will therefore increase significantly.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Thors raised two questions. Firstly the situation in the United States. I had the privilege to participate in many discussions with the Members of the Senate and the US Congress in this field. Today, there are about 60 proposals in Congress on that issue. In general, it is agreed that the present opt-out system has a lot of problems, but the solutions vary. There are some who go for opt-in solutions, there are others who present different schemes to make strict rules such as that there should be a penalty for a company that does not take your name away as soon as you ask. I cannot say that there is one simple solution, there is criticism of the present opt-out practice. There are powerful Members of Senate and the Congress who advocate opt-in solutions. You will be able to contact these people especially when the Internet caucus of Congress visits Europe in the next few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the applicability of an opt-in regime outside Europe is concerned, the GATT agreement allows its members to take measures to enforce their data protection legislation within their territory. On this basis, the EU can require non-EU based companies to comply with its opt-in legislation. Mr Coelho asked whether it is difficult to control. In this kind of world it is very difficult to draft legislation which is 100% waterproof. But I am sure that opt-out will be much more difficult to control than opt-in. There is no harmonised system. There are hundreds of thousands of databases, practices, private operations and if anybody is optimistic I invite you to try. You could, for example, start by sending a letter to all those companies whose material you no longer wish to receive and then check how many will remove your name during the following days and how many respond to your request. It is something anybody can try. I have done it myself. I am not optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">The opt-in regime is one uniform legal solution. We have difficulties there but I am sure that they are less than with the present opt-out regime. For these reasons the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 19, 41 and 42. However, knowing how difficult this issue is, and how divided opinions have been in this House, we should also look for compromise solutions and I want to be open and constructive on this issue. We therefore welcome the constructive compromise amendments 53 and 62 which have been presented. The Commission is willing to look for solutions along the lines of these amendments, but subject to some redrafting and streamlining within the existing legal framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important issue I would like to mention is general traffic retention for law enforcement purposes. On this one, I have the impression that the Commission and the European Parliament are on the same line. The existing telecommunications data protection directive states that traffic data must be erased when they are no longer needed for the provision of the service and for billing. In addition, there is a clause referring to the reasons for which Member States may adopt specific legal measures in derogation of this principle in exceptional cases. These reasons include, inter alia, national security, defence, and the investigation and prosecution of crimes. We discussed these issues earlier today in this House. Since the rights protected in this existing and proposed directive are based on Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights – under the protection of privacy of home, family life and correspondence – any exception must remain within the rules established by the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">As we discussed this morning during the Echelon debate, it is important that the rules for both citizens and for the State are very clear and precise regarding the rights and obligations in this sensitive area. Therefore, the Commission can support Amendment No 4 which strengthens the recital text on this point. However, the Commission is not in favour of copying the same text into Article 15, as proposed by Amendment 50, as it may overstep the legal basis of the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, out of the 62 amendments submitted to plenary, 35 can be fully supported by the Commission. These are Amendments Nos 1 to 4, 7 to 10, 12, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21 to 29, 31 to 35, 37, 39, 45, 49, 51, 52, 56 and 57.</p>
<p class="contents">Another seven amendments which can be supported in part or in principle subject to certain drafting changes are 5, 46 to 48, 53, 60 and 62. I mentioned two of these earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">But there are 20 amendments which the Commission cannot support: 6, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20, 30, 36, 38, 40 to 44, 50, 54, 55, 58 and 59.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Cederschiöld report, I would like to thank the honourable Members of the European Parliament for the constructive approach to the Commission communication on cybercrime and cybersecurity. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Cederschiöld, and also Mrs McCarthy and Mrs Zorba, the draftspersons of the contributing committees. The report identifies key issues for further consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of the recommendations in the report are in line with the current view of the Commission on policy development to combat cybercrime and improve security.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one recommendation, however, of which I have to say that it is not acceptable to the Commission, that is Recommendation No 5 concerning the transfer of responsibilities for data protection within the Commission and to concentrating responsibility for certain other tasks in single units. This is a matter of internal organisation of the Commission which should be left entirely to the discretion of the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the other recommendations, in as far as they are not already parts of plans for policy development, the Commission will give them full consideration, and will see how far they can be incorporated in upcoming or new initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, this communication was issued in January this year. It has been sponsored jointly by Commissioner Vitorino and myself. This has been the first comprehensive policy statement of the European Commission on the issue of cybercrime.</p>
<p class="contents">In March, the Commission organised a public hearing. Over 400 people came to Brussels to attend this event, which shows the strong interest of the public in participating in this discussion. Next the Commission will shortly issue a proposal for a framework decision on combating serious attacks against information systems. This initiative addresses acts like hacking, denial-of-service attacks, and the spread of viruses.</p>
<p class="contents">In June, the Commission issued a communication on network and information security, which I presented this morning in this House in detail. This communication deals with preventive organisational and technical measures, and is complementary to the framework decision, which deals with ex-post criminal investigations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the technical level, as part of the Information Society Technologies Programme, the Commission is promoting research and development to understand and reduce vulnerabilities and stimulate the dissemination of know-how. IST projects focus in particular on the development of confidence-building technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">The first legislative initiative announced in the communication has already been issued: a proposal for a framework decision that includes measures to combat child pornography. I fully share the strong opinions expressed on this issue in this House tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">The communication has announced a forum in which the relevant parties will have the opportunity to discuss various issues to find an appropriate balance between network security, law enforcement powers, privacy protection and economic priority. An open debate is vital to achieve an effective, coherent and balanced policy approach and to assure confidence and trust among European citizens. Confidence and trust of the users is directly related to the take-up of electronic commerce and to the success of the Information Society.</p>
