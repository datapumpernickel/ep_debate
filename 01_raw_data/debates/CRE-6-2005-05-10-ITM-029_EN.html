I would like to place this proposal in its context. On 26 June 2003, the Council adopted a fundamental reform of the common agricultural policy which significantly changes the way that the European Union supports the agricultural sector. As far as potato starch is concerned, 40% of the aid paid to the producer has been decoupled and included in the single farm payment scheme. After enlargement, six of the ten new Member States have been involved in the potato starch quota system for the first time in 2004-2005 marketing year.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the potato starch production quotas were introduced in 1995, we have been trying to define a strategy to secure, enhance and promote the development of this very important sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I return to the proposal discussed today. It is of vital importance to preserve the stability of this fragile sector, while at the same time taking into account the fundamental changes due to the reform of the CAP and enlargement. Firstly, to roll over the quotas for two years instead of the three years foreseen in Regulation (EC) No 1868/94. This time-frame should allow us to analyse the initial effects of the CAP reform and enlargement on the potato starch sector and enable us to act quickly should the need arise.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to roll over the existing quotas which have provided a stable market in the eight old Member States taking part in this regime. I am well aware of the fears in certain new Member States that their quotas negotiated in their accession treaties and based on a historical reference period might be too small. As usual, the development of the potato starch sector in all Member States will be closely monitored in the years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission appreciates the contribution of the Agriculture Committee to the development of this area. Several of the proposed amendments, however, go beyond the scope of the Commission’s proposal, especially as far as the time-frame for the proposal is concerned. Because a prolongation of four years would not allow us to react quickly to possible imbalances in the European starch market, the Commission cannot accept this amendment in the context of the proposal at hand.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment concerning the transfer of quotas to new Member States certainly raises issues of great importance to the countries concerned. However, experience has shown that the starch potato yield fluctuates a lot, depending on climatic conditions. Allowing for the possibility of transnational balancing-out, with priority given to the new Member States, might incite starch producers in these Member States to increase the areas under contract, hoping for a transfer of unused quotas from other Member States, which could lead to a significant overshoot of their quotas in years when the climatic conditions in the European Union are favourable for potato growing, thus aggravating their situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first was the question of how long, or in other words how much longer the present quota system should remain in force, and the second was the question of how much, or in other words whether the quota levels should be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the first of these questions, the Committee on Agriculture decided that the quota system should remain in place for the next four marketing years, rather than for the two proposed by the Commission. The Committee was swayed by the argument that this should be a long enough period to enable potato and starch producers to prepare production plans well in advance. The two years suggested in the proposal would be too short a period for such plans, and it was for this reason that the Committee on Agriculture adopted an amendment proposing a longer period of four years.</p>
<p class="contents">A heated debate ensued on the second question, however, regarding whether or not changes should be made to quota levels. Much of the debate focused on the question of whether the new Member State had been treated unfairly, since the quotas they were allocated during the accession negotiations did not correspond to their production potential. Whilst the quotas for the 15 old Member States account for 89% of the total EU quota of 1 947 000 tonnes, those for the 10 new Member States amount to only 11% of this figure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind the Commissioner and the House that the figures show clearly that the 10 new Member States produced more potatoes that the 15 old Member States as recently as 1999, with around 1 400 000 hectares of potatoes grown in the old Member States as opposed to 1 600 000 hectares in the new Member States. The situation has altered somewhat in the meantime, as a result of a sudden drop in the quantity of potatoes grown in the 10 new Member States, but production levels remain very high. Poland, the EU’s largest potato producer, was given as an example during the debate. Although large swathes of Poland’s potato-growing areas have been abandoned, the country remains the leading potato producer. In spite of this, however, its production quotas are several times lower than those allocated to Germany, The Netherlands, or France. This reduced quota means that Poland, a potato giant, does not produce enough starch to meet domestic demand, and has to import large quantities of this product. The other new Member States, in particular Lithuania, are facing similar problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Conversely, it was pointed out that although the 15 old Member States have been allocated high starch production quotas, these quotas have not been filled for many years. Over the course of the past six years, for example, the quotas were only filled in 2001, and the shortfall in the remaining years ranged from 3% to 17%. As was noted, it is extremely unfair that certain countries fail to fill their quotas whilst others are struggling to survive because their quotas are too low.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture decided that both an increase in the overall quota and changes to the quotas allocated to individual countries would be out of the question. This decision was mainly motivated by a concern that the market would collapse if production increased. A broad compromise was reached within the Committee, however, which led to an alternative idea of a ‘balancing-out’, whereby countries would be provided with the opportunity to transfer any unfilled quotas. In view of the problems faced by the new Member States, the Committee on Agriculture has proposed a solution that will allow any quotas that have not been filled, as has frequently been the case in recent years, to be transferred. The new Member States would be the first to benefit. I should point out to the Commissioner and the House that this is an extremely good solution, as it does not involve increasing the total production quota, placing the market at risk or disrupting the delicate balance of the system. It would, however, provide us with an opportunity to redress the unfair allocation of quotas, at least in instances where quotas are not filled by certain countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to extend my very warm thanks to the members of the Committee on Agriculture, whatever their political persuasion, for having unanimously adopted this compromise proposal. I commend this compromise to the House and to the Commission, in the sincere hope that the proposal for a balancing-out will find its way into the new proposal for a regulation. I would also reiterate that this is an extremely ingenious and much-needed compromise, and one that demonstrates the solidarity between the old and the new Member States that we must aspire to. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem is that the Agreement on the Accession to the European Union has established a very small quota for Lithuania for the production of the potato starch – 1 211 tonnes per year, which constitutes only 0.06% of the quota of the European Union. The quota for Lithuania, as you know, was established according to the reference period of the years 1998-2000, the period of the lowest production of potato starch in Lithuania, and it does not comply at all with the present requirements. I would like to draw the attention of colleagues and members of the European Commission to the fact that this quota does not even ensure the minimal economically justified utilisation of the capacity of the factories of this industry in Lithuania. The industry of the production of potato starch in Lithuania is composed of only two factories. The total technological capacity of those two factories is 13 000 tonnes of potato starch per year. Thus at present the Lithuanian factories operate using only 9% of their capacity. If today’s quota remains the same for the next several years, that will mean the disruption of the industry of the production of potato starch in Lithuania. The minimal, economically justified utilisation of the capacities of the factories would only be 4-5 thousand tonnes of potato starch per year; therefore, Lithuania requests increasing its quota to at least 4 855 tonnes per year, and that would comprise 0.25% of the quota for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context I would like to emphasise that during recent years the potato starch production quota for the European Union has not been exhausted, and therefore Lithuania’s request to increase the quota from 0.06 to 0.25% of the general level of the potato starch production quota for the European Union definitely will not have an essential effect on the indicators of the internal market of the European Union. However, the most important thing is that if the potato starch production quota for Lithuania is increased, that would secure social stability, workplaces and the infrastructure of two regions of the country that are closely related with the operation of those factories. Of course, to destroy something is much easier than to build it, and the problem is that, upon disrupting this sector of industry in Lithuania, the after-effects would have to be compensated, including the financial ones, and all this is happening at a time when the forecast says that the consumption and demand of potato starch in Lithuania is growing and will continue to grow, and that within the cellulose and food industries it will increase up to 8 000 tonnes per year. Hence, there is no doubt that the potato starch production quota for Lithuania should be increased. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even though they are concerned with such a minor aspect of this policy, however, the report and its explanatory statement serve as an excellent example of the way in which individual countries are treated differently and incorrectly. Unfortunately, the candidate countries agreed to such treatment in their accession treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">Poland was a leading European potato producer for many years, taking second place only to Germany and France, and indeed this continues to be the case today. This is due both to agricultural traditions and consumer habits that go back many generations, and to Poland’s poor and sandy soil, in which farmers can grow only rye and potatoes. Poland’s starch production quota of 144 000 tonnes bears absolutely no relation to either the production potential of its 13 potato-processing plants, which is currently estimated at 220 000 tonnes, or to the amount of potatoes it grows. After all, more land is given over to growing potatoes in Poland than in any other country in Europe. This figure also bears no relation to the number of people either living in rural areas or working in agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though Poland is the third largest producer of potatoes, the limits imposed on it have meant that it has become a starch importer. The Polish Government therefore regarded it as only natural to submit justified proposals anticipating that the quotas, which had been underestimated and poorly negotiated, would be increased. In my opinion, no one should be ashamed of admitting a mistake. What is shameful, however, is to refuse to correct the mistake. The changes proposed amounted to a quota increase of only 40 000 for Lithuania and Poland together, even though 20% of the EU’s total quota, or in other words 200 000 tonnes, has not been filled in recent years. Although the amendments originally tabled by the rapporteur for the Committee on Agriculture reiterated the changes that had previously been proposed by the Lithuanian and Polish governments, however, they caused quite a stir. The Commission protested violently, and a long and heated debate was held in the Committee on Agriculture. At times I felt as though I was at a football match in which Poland and Lithuania, who have made the proposal, were on one side, along with the other new Member States, and the rest of Europe on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are debating the final version of this new report, which is the result of an ingenious compromise. My reason for dwelling on its history was to alert the House to an underlying problem that has now blown up in our faces, revealing the unequal treatment meted out to individual countries under the common agricultural policy. This inequality is a result of the mistakes made by those who negotiated the accession treaties, but it is also due to the changing face of agriculture and rural areas in Europe following enlargement and CAP reform.</p>
<p class="contents">My comments were also motivated by a desire to emphasise that the Wojciechowski report is both well thought-out and a good compromise, and that the rapporteur has managed to reconcile all the parties in this unnecessary conflict. The Socialist Group in the European Parliament, which I am representing, also lent its support to this compromise, which involves extending quotas for a further two years, or in other words until 2009, and sharing out the four-year quotas between Member States on the basis of the 2004-2005 quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">In common with the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I do not believe that two years is long enough to allow us to assess the developments that have taken place in the market for starch following enlargement, and it is my opinion that unfilled quotas, which currently stand at 19% of the total, should be shared out between the new Member States. I must also thank the rapporteur, and emphasise that this is an example of a good compromise and an excellently drafted report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems that we are discussing here only numbers, percentage or ratios. However, behind those numbers there are real people, members of their families and their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">I will try to give a short explanation. Lithuania, the country where I have been elected, has a quota that is ten times less than the country is capable of producing. As has been mentioned, there are two factories producing potato starch in Lithuania – both in rural areas. I would emphasise – in rural areas. Lithuania has an old tradition in the cultivation of potatoes; this culture yields well in our country. The capacity of the factories amounts to 13 000 tonnes per year. The economy of Lithuania, the fastest growing economy in the European Union, demands more and more of this product, that is, this product is necessary for Lithuania for its own needs; however, the production quota, which is only 1 200 tonnes per year, does not allow for Lithuanian factories to employ their capacity in at least a minimal, economically justified regime. Perhaps you fully understand what effectiveness of production this means, when factories are forced to use only 9% of their capacity. The present situation, that is, the production quota, forces businessmen to close those factories in rural areas. The people working and living there will lose their jobs. Moreover, the infrastructure of those two towns is related to the aforementioned factories – heating, water supply, etc. Thus, the closure of the factories will have very serious social consequences. The situation is even more irregular, since other Member States have much larger production quotas than they are capable of producing or consuming. So we get to the point that Lithuania is capable of producing, capable of consuming its own production, but the country is not allowed to produce; it is forced to close the factories. I think this is not fair and not in any way relevant to the main principles of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the issue of quotas is a very sensitive one; however, I am talking not about additional benefit, but only about the possibility to survive. The Ministry of Agriculture of Lithuania presented its arguments in detail to the Commission, but the Commission did not see the necessity to take them into account. Well, perhaps one can understand the Commission – the issue of quotas is really awkward. Maybe the Commission can behave that way since it is more distant from the people. But the European Parliament and the Members of the European Parliament must treat the peoples´ problems in a more sensitive and deep way, and not turn away from them, but take real decisions. One may say that these quotas have been agreed to. Yes, but this is bad, and they are not a ‘sacred cow’ that cannot be touched. If we see the problem, we have to take responsibility to solve it. We talk a lot and seriously about rural development and support to rural areas. We accommodate large funds for that; therefore, it will look unjustifiable if we destroy something that can effectively work, but then create something that would require more funds. Is this an effective and rational way? So, I think that the suggested compromise to allow redestribution of the unused quotas is a positive step, and it will enable the Member States and the Commission to find the solution concerning this matter. I would like to thank the speaker, Mr Wojciechowski, for his determination and the work done. I hope that the colleagues will support the report prepared by Mr Wojciechowski and approved and revised by the Committee on Agriculture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank him for his qualified and hard work in preparing this document.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the adoption of this compromise proposal would demonstrate our readiness to at least partly eliminate the unjust redistribution of land for the production of potato starch between old and new Member States of the EU. This is clearly evident from the example of Poland. When the Committee on Agriculture discussed this issue, it also addressed a broader problem of the discrimination of farmers from new Member States of the EU. After all, it has already been said in this meeting room that European Union farmers from an old Member State on the left bank of a river, farming under identical climatic and soil conditions, receive direct payments at the level of 400 euro, compared with only 50 euro received by farmers in a new Member State on the opposite bank of the same river. In an open discussion about this topic, the Committee on Agriculture pointed to an urgent need to exchange opinions concerning the implementation of common agricultural policy and to speak about the problem without prejudice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to use this opportunity to note that the discussions that took place in the Committee on Agriculture clearly demonstrated the readiness – and not only the readiness, also the interest – to organise such an open exchange of opinions. Farmers in my country, the Slovak Republic, also hope that such discussions could lead to eliminating the tensions arising from the unequal implementation of agricultural policy in different parts of the united European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At present, however, starch-production facilities in Poland operate at only around 60% of their production capacity, because the production quota for the country is set at 145 000 tonnes. This means that starch is one of the products we have to import, because we do not produce enough of it, even though we do not lack raw materials or processing capacity. Poland needs a production quota of at least 180 000 tonnes, and this was the figure it proposed during negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Powerful producer organisations have been in existence in Western Europe for over 30 years. Such organisations have only recently come into being in Poland, and they have suffered severe teething problems. In contrast, the starch-production facilities have adapted well. Producers invested a great deal of money in 2003 in order to meet EU environmental standards, and this is a further argument for increasing Poland’s quota. It should be added that the businesses concerned employ several thousand people, and they are mainly located in the areas of the country that have been particularly hard hit by structural unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that the amendments tabled will solve all our problems, but they are a step in the right direction. Even though half of all potatoes grown in Europe come from Poland, we will still be forced to import starch. How are we supposed to explain this to those involved in potato production and processing, and to consumers? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, debates on agriculture frequently leave one with the impression that by accident or by design, Commission representatives have large gaps in their knowledge of the new Member States’ production potential. The new Member States account for 30% of the EU’s total production potential for potato starch, which is the subject of our debate today. At the same time, however, the starch production quotas set for these countries amount to only around 10% of the production quota for the European Union as a whole. There is therefore no denying that the way in which these quotas have been shared out between the old and the new Member States is blatantly unfair.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is frequently stated during debates that it would be impossible to change anything agreed on during the accession negotiations. The justification for this is that if a country were to benefit from a change of this kind, the other countries would also want things to be changed to their advantage. This kind of attitude is unacceptable. Thirdly and finally, the Commission takes an extremely long time to respond to speeches and motions by Members of this House. We often have to wait weeks for a response, and the actual implementation of measures can take months. This state of affairs is also intolerable.</p>
<p class="contents">These reservations notwithstanding, I hope that the Commission, the Council and Parliament will succeed in reaching a compromise, if only on the issue of starch production quotas. Mr Wojciechowski has proposed such a compromise, which was adopted unanimously by the Committee on Agriculture, and he deserves every credit for having done so. Admittedly, this solution does not provide the new Member States with any guarantee that their starch production quotas will be increased, but it does at least make it an option. This is particularly true in view of the fact that starch production in the European Union has fallen short of current production limits by an average of 7% for each of the past six years. The same is therefore likely to be the case in future. The new regulation will make it possible for unused quotas to be transferred to the new Member States, and this will provide farmers growing starch potatoes in these countries, and in particular in Poland, with an opportunity to earn more money from their holdings. It will also enable the starch industry to improve its utilisation of production capacity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the points raised by several Members concerned the question as to why the new Member States did not get a higher quota from the very beginning. The potato starch quotas for the new Member States were negotiated in Copenhagen in 2002 and agreed by the candidate countries and the EU-25. They were calculated in exactly the same way as quotas for other Member States, taking an average of the production during a three-year reference period.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the example of Poland that was mentioned, let me offer a few figures. Average production in Poland from 1999 until 2001 was 107 317 tonnes; nevertheless, a quota of 144 985 tonnes was granted to Poland. Therefore, to talk of unjust quota does not seem entirely justified. I fully recognise the importance of Poland as a producer of potatoes, but let me remind you that starch quotas are based on historical production and not on the potential of the different Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The other issues concern the extension of the time frame to four years and the possibility of quota transfer to the new Member States. In my opening statement I made it clear that I cannot accept the amendments proposed in the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
