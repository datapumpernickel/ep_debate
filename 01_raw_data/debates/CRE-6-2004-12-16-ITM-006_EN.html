<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Borg,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I thank Mr Ribeiro for his report on the proposal to protect deep-water coral reefs from the effects of trawling in certain areas of the Atlantic Ocean. This is the first time I have addressed the plenary of this Parliament and it is satisfying that the first proposal that I am dealing with is focused upon the protection of deep-water coral reefs – an issue of great importance to us all. Doubtless, we will have many an occasion in future, both within this plenary and within the Committee on Fisheries, to discuss issues not only relating to conservation and the preservation of fish stocks but also relating to issues such as deep-water coral reefs.</p>
<p class="contents">Having studied the scientific evidence and considering the irreversible damage that certain fishing gear can cause to these unique habitats, we propose in this regulation to ban the use of bottom trawls and similar trawl gear in the areas concerned. With this proposal, we fulfil the commitment given at the Fisheries Council of 23 October 2003, when the new 'western waters' regulation was approved to ensure protection for these habitats. I am happy to note that the rapporteur recommends that Parliament approve these measures, as does the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety in its opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission welcomes the adoption of measures to minimise the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems. They show our determination to work for the integration of environmental concerns in the common fisheries policy, as envisaged in the reform of 2002, and as repeatedly called for by public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn briefly to the amendments proposed in the report before us. I can accept Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 3. However, I have difficulty in accepting Amendment No 4, since it is not in line with the legislation on the mandate that is given to regional advisory councils. These councils are to be consulted on the development of proposals for legislation, but consultation of them is not envisaged on the implementation of such legislation. As for Amendment No 5, the Commission has difficulty accepting the substance of this amendment as it is currently worded. The Commission is bound to review all proposals in the light of new scientific evidence. Hence, obliging the Commission to do so in a specific timeframe could also work against the spirit and purpose of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we need to be conscious of the fact that the production of scientific evidence is very much dependent on the Member States and, therefore, the Commission is not in a position to guarantee its availability as prescribed in the amendment, that is, within a specified timeframe.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 6, the Commission notes that while it could find such an amendment acceptable, it is not really necessary since the geographical application of the regulation is well known and already established.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendment No 7, in accordance with scientific advice, the main threat to the very fragile deep-water habitats is bottom trawling. Damage caused by other gear, in particular specific gear such as gillnets and longlines, may be real, but is very minor compared to the erosion effects of trawls.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, extending the prohibition on trawling throughout the European economic zone would appear to be excessive, i.e. would appear not to be proportionate since the majority of this area does not have submarine features threatened by fishing. In these circumstances, the Commission is not in a position to accept Amendment No 7.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has difficulty accepting Amendment No 8, because it would create a duplication of effort. Comprehensive revisions of the status of deep-water features are currently being carried out by the International Council for the Exploitation of the Sea, ICES. This is considered to be sufficient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ribeiro (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the process of drawing up, discussing and voting on this report in committee was quite a surprising learning process, showing that it is never too late to learn and to carry on learning.</p>
<p class="contents">I tackled an activity with which I was only superficially familiar and, in particular, I supplemented all the theoretical knowledge that documents and studying could provide. By contacting and receiving information from those connected with the activity, those who make it their difficult livelihood, those who study it thoroughly and seriously and those who have responsibilities within it, I learnt a lot and I know that there is still a lot to learn.</p>
<p class="contents">I started with the idea that we need to protect the environment, which is subject to attacks that are likely to get worse, and I found three questions taking shape: which predatory activities should be moderated or banned? Within what limits? Under what jurisdiction? After much listening and considerable thought, I became convinced that a ban on bottom trawling would not be enough to protect coral reefs and other formations, among which I would highlight thermal vents. It was proved to me that bottom gill-netting was equally predatory or even more so. That is why I explicitly included it. Why is there such resistance to its inclusion? Is it because powerful interests use that method? The Commission argues that it is because there is insufficient scientific evidence to prove the evils of the technique. Even if that were so, however, the precautionary principle should apply. The delimitation of the areas to be protected is defined in the Commission’s proposal by the criterion of degrees of longitude and latitude. I consider this option to be political and not technical, or at least not only technical but with a strong political meaning.</p>
<p class="contents">Not using the criterion of miles offshore means that the connection with national exclusive economic zones can be ignored or minimised as something to be forgotten. In view of the negotiations, after the period that ended in November 2003, to change the regulatory limits from 200 to 12 and then to 50 and finally to 100 miles, the failure of the Commission proposal to consider the situation created in the zone between the 100 and 200 mile limits is, in my view, serious and needs to be remedied.</p>
<p class="contents">All that brings us to the key issue of jurisdiction, starting with the simple omission of the national jurisdictions of Spain and Portugal, which was not omitted even in the previous proposal dealing with the United Kingdom’s jurisdiction over the reef formations of the Darwin Mounds off the Scottish coast. Might that mean that jurisdiction is attributed to the United Kingdom but is denied or forgotten – or hidden – in the case of Spain and Portugal? We are thus arriving at some really sensitive, fundamental issues, of the kind that life imposes when we get down to practicalities.</p>
<p class="contents">The principle of the European Union’s exclusive competence over the conservation of marine biological resources is thus enshrined in this proposal even before the ratification of the Constitutional Treaty. Such a decision is highly debatable and, for us, unacceptable, insofar as it represents the replacement of national and regional competence over part of the national territory, albeit under the sea, with exclusive Community competence.</p>
<p class="contents">The points that are clearly under discussion here are as follows: firstly, the balance between the exploitation of resources and their conservation. Secondly, this balance was achieved when and where fishing was not industrial and predatory and the conservation of marine biological resources was under national and regional jurisdiction on the basis of proximity, and there are therefore no grounds to replace this jurisdiction in order to remedy incorrect or lax practices. Thirdly, there are two kinds of fishing – costal fishing, which is, more or less, or still is almost traditional, and industrial fishing. The former is penalised, with a terrible impact on society and the regional economies, by the predatory nature of the latter, which, because of its economic and political power, will more easily continue its activities. Fourthly, the negotiations that are starting on total allowable catches and quotas are an indictment of equal treatment for what is different and a refutation of strategies which, on the pretext of protecting the environment, help the ‘big fish’ to swallow up the ‘little fish’ – and the word ‘fish’ can be replaced with others such as ‘boats’, ‘fleets’, ‘interests’ or ‘countries’.</p>
<p class="contents">My report and the draft amendments that I have submitted to the House for approval have the same intention as I have tried to make clear in this speech, in the hope that this House will vote for it. I am grateful for your vote and I am also grateful for all the help and collaboration that I have had in tabling this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">When we discuss this issue, we need to imagine how it would be if the destruction taking place on the sea bed were instead to happen on land. Imagine if forests were to be uprooted, if all the animals in them were to die and if the birds were to become silent. People would be up in arms. We would all drown in letters from anxious people demanding that the forests be protected.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, this is happening on the sea bed. The forests of the sea are coral reefs at the bottom of the sea, among fish that are unable to cry out. We here in Parliament must therefore speak on behalf of these bio- and eco-systems without a voice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has tried to express this voice in the form of amendments. I wish therefore to emphasise that the House should support Amendment No 8, which was adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety but which, unfortunately, was rejected by the Committee on Fisheries. We must investigate what other deep-sea habitats need to be protected so that we might obtain a complete list of these. We must, of course, do this in cooperation with the ICES to avoid duplication of effort, but we must take responsibility for this list’s being compiled.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to speak up for Amendment No 7, which picks up on the important aspect of there being equipment other than trawl nets that can damage the sea bed. That is why the rules should, of course, cover all equipment that may damage the sea bed, and it is wise to use the precautionary principle in these sensitive areas.</p>
<p class="contents">I think, however, that we should retain the Commission’s proposal concerning zones and thus vote against the second half of the amendment. The zones have a scientific basis we are able to accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">According to the Commission, protection is given to the areas around Madeira, the Azores and the Canaries, outermost archipelagos where the traditional fishing methods that have been used for centuries up to the present day have made it possible not only to preserve species but also to maintain thriving fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">At a time when we are witnessing growing concern about the maintenance of fish stocks and when various recovery plans are being set up in areas devastated by overfishing, the sustainable fishing practised in those archipelagos deserves that we should all encourage it and adopt a position to support and safeguard it. Besides, we are talking about areas where there is no continental shelf and therefore the places where fishing is possible are confined to small seamounts generally associated with those deep-water corals.</p>
<p class="contents">It can be said that there is a lot of water around those archipelagos but there are not many fish or fishing areas. It is therefore essential to safeguard and protect those areas from the destructive – highly destructive – activities of industrial fisheries. The emergency measures put in place are already a help but we have to have lasting solutions, and for that reason this Commission proposal is laudable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the proposed amendments to widen the ban on nets to include bottom gill nets make complete sense to me. Because of the anchors used and the risk of loss, they can cause ghost fishing and also seabed erosion, threatening the ecological balance of the deep-water corals.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the proposal for a ban should be widened to include gill nets and also to include the 200-mile zones, because this proposal is based on maintaining what existed until very recently. With my knowledge of the situation, I can guarantee that by adopting these proposals we will be helping to protect the environment and the sustainable kind of fishing that we think should be based more on prevention than on <span class="italic">a posteriori</span> cure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to tell him, however, that I find it quite incomprehensible in this report that, after the mistake was made to liberalise bottom trawling and bottom gill nets a year ago in Regulation (EC) No 1954/2003, this mistake is not being corrected in respect of bottom gill nets. Having read the documents produced by the Commission, which are quite specific in indicating that bottom gill nets are extraordinarily harmful and damaging to the environment, we are at a loss to understand why the Commission wants to impose this practice in the Autonomous Region of the Azores, where it has never been allowed. That is a backward step in nature conservation imposed by the Commission and by the European institutions, which makes no sense at all and is totally unacceptable.

The first concerned reefs off the north-west coast of Scotland, the Darwin Mounds, for which I was fortunate enough to be rapporteur. As with that report, it is essential to appreciate just how important deep-water coral reefs are for the marine ecosystem.</p>
<p class="contents">They can maintain hundreds of different species of wildlife, including many species of deep-sea fish, and they are a vital focus for fish reproductive cycles. In the case of deep-sea fish, gestation periods are extremely long and thus any negative impacts on the habitats will have serious effects on stocks, both in the short and the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still gathering research on the full impact of trawling on deep-sea coral reefs, but it certainly appears that in the short span of time since deep-sea trawling began, hundreds or possibly thousands of seamounts and coral reef systems may have been devastated.</p>
<p class="contents">The ALDE Group therefore fully supports the proposal and the amendments adopted in committee, particularly Amendment No 4 emphasising the role of regional advisory councils. We commend to you the other amendments as adopted in committee. We endorse plenary Amendment No 8 as well, since it is important to examine what other areas of deep-sea coral within the EU should be closed to harmful fishing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">We can also support Amendment No 6 and the first part of Amendment No 7, since that fits with the precautionary approach. After considerable thought, we cannot support the second part of that amendment because it could have the effect of leaving some of the coral unprotected. That is with real regret, since the motivation of the whole of that amendment is essentially one of conservation.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope very much that the Commission and the Council will both appreciate the seriousness of the concerns being expressed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As we all know, the impact on these environments – and this is also true for all types of marine environment where indiscriminate fishing methods are used – affects not only pelagic and edible sessile species, but also inedible sessile organisms and, more generally, it seriously damages key breeding environments. This leads to resource depletion and a resulting loss of economic potential, with serious consequences for local communities, particularly small-scale traditional fishing businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the reasons given in the international agreements referred to in the report, the protection of such environments is therefore an important way to achieve not only environmental protection but also stable social and economic prospects for the communities which persevere in the areas in question. This is true in general for all regions where fishing is a traditional resource which, as such, ought to be safeguarded, not only by limiting the industrial catch by fleets from other countries, but also by ensuring the continued existence of breeding habitats.</p>
<p class="contents">To that end, it is vital to involve the local communities, and especially those people involved in the sector. I therefore believe that the authorities, local firms and associations in the sector, with the help of the Community institutions, in addition to watching over the protected areas should also be responsible for the regular scientific monitoring of habitats, as well as for providing eco-friendly information and ensuring the professional conduct of those involved in fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">It would certainly also be a good idea to encourage the productivity of small traditional businesses by giving them modern tools for researching, identifying and catching their resources, so as to promote greater catch selectivity in the marine environment and to make it possible for businesses like those to survive competition from industrial fishing fleets, particularly Japanese and US ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should now like to make it clear that our group will support the Commission’s proposal, namely the Ribeiro report, as it was adopted in the Committee on Fisheries. We shall be voting against the amendments tabled, for the reasons I am about to give.</p>
<p class="contents">We are opposed to the inclusion of bottom set gill nets because, as everyone is aware, these are static nets. By their very nature, they do not erode the sea bottom. The amendment concerned refers to a possible biological disaster. At most, this could be linked to the loss of these nets and subsequent so-called ghost fishing<span class="italic">.</span> As the Commissioner stated, there is no scientific data relating to areas or species. This is why I think it is somewhat flippant and a bad precedent to ban or attempt to ban gear of this kind in the areas in question. Indeed, to follow the arguments through, the gear would have to be banned from all Community waters. It would be interesting to see if those who are in favour of a ban in this case would also be in favour of a more general ban.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the second amendment. On the basis of criteria derived from marine geology and biology, this amendment calls for the protected areas proposed by the Commission to be replaced by the 200-mile political criterion. It should be pointed out that, rightly or wrongly, that criterion is no longer relevant to fisheries management under Community law. I must emphasise once again that coral reefs are not located exclusively within a 200-mile radius from the Canary Islands, Madeira and the Azores. The scientific community accepts that coral reefs are generally found around a 1 000 metre bathymetric line. In accordance with the precautionary principle, the Commission has therefore gone up to the 1 500 metre bathymetric line<span class="italic">.</span> These lines do not of course tally with political and administrative demarcations. In addition, in this particular instance, the zones designated by the European Commission extend beyond the 200-mile limit in some cases. International waters are affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, these are the reasons why our group will not support the amendments tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was because, along with the whole House, I believe it is important to protect deep-water coral reefs. I am bound to say, however, that I have been very surprised at some of the comments made by the rapporteur subsequently. I endorse what Mrs Fraga has just said, and can only hope that little flags similar to those evident elsewhere in the Chamber do not suddenly appear in front of Mr Ribeiro.</p>
<p class="contents">I must emphasise that we do not support either the first or the second part of Amendment No 7. We certainly support the Commission’s proposal, but we cannot agree to the addition of bottom set gill nets without any scientific justification. The Commission’s proposal makes a reference to bottom set gillnets or similar gear. We believe that the addition of bottom set gill nets with no further qualification could be very detrimental to certain fleets. It could also act as a dangerous precedent.</p>

According to the United Nations, deep-water coral reefs are a vulnerable habitat which require special attention. ICES advises that the only way to protect cold-water habitats from fishing damage is to map the habitats precisely and to close those areas to the forms of fishing that cause damage. The only way to protect deep-water coral reefs is to prohibit the use of bottom trawls and similar gears.</p>
<p class="contents">It was early this year that this House recognised deep-water coral reefs, when the Darwin Mounds, off the north-west coast of Scotland, were given special status as an area of conservation. Now we turn to the other deep-water coral reefs off the Canary Islands and around Madeira and the Azores, and I hope there will be continuation of protection to those areas on a permanent basis.

Many of the fishing communities in some coastal areas of the Union, such as the Azores or Madeira, do not have any other alternatives at all for their livelihoods or their survival. In this case, it is the Commission itself that acknowledges that we are dealing with very sensitive ecosystems that are highly endangered and require urgent protection, particularly since there is a considerable lack of information about them.</p>
<p class="contents">The simple acknowledgment of such facts is more than enough reason to adopt any preventive measures that might stop the destruction of those habitats.

<p class="contents">On the possible damage by fishing other than trawls: according to the ICES 2003 report, trawls are the main cause of damage to deep-water coral reefs. There is little evidence of passive gear damaging coral reefs, although ICES mentions some of these effects. The Commission is ready to amend its proposal if there is new scientific evidence or if the Member States agree on such an amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the point concerning the extension of the protective zone to the whole EEZ, I would underline that the proposal delimited an area that includes most of the submarine mountains that have been kept in good condition. Extending the zone of prohibition would add insignificant protection and would therefore run counter to the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I would also refer to the question of the exclusive competence of the Commission with regard to marine resources, which is found in the Constitution and to which reference has been made. This is a principle which was already established by European Court of Justice case law, and all the Constitution does is to codify it. However, the Commission does not deny the rights of Spain and Portugal over their European Economic Zone. It is just that there is no need to mention these rights of jurisdiction since the area of prohibition is delimited by topography and by geographical features.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point made by Mrs Attwooll concerning the role of the regional advisory councils, there would be a legal problem and in order to accept that amendment the regulation on RACs would itself have to be amended.</p>
<p class="contents">On another point made by Mrs Attwooll, the Commission has recently tabled a proposal on conditions for deep-water fishing, which will lend protection to these important resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
