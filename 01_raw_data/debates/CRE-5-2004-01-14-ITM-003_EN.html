<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, as a former United Nations human rights fellow and indeed as a former chairman of the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, I am particularly pleased that my first address to Parliament should be on the European Union's preparations for the forthcoming session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights. The General Affairs and External Relations Council conclusions of 10 December 2002 contain concrete recommendations as to how the Council and the European Parliament can work more closely to achieve openness and transparency in the European Union's human rights policy. The Council is committed to putting those recommendations into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Enhancing the dialogue between Parliament and the Council on human rights issues is an important focus for the Irish presidency. Today's debate is a valuable part of that discourse. This is an area where we can make real progress if we work together.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has always been determined to assume its international responsibilities. The Union's size, wealth, history and geography all point to our Union playing a prominent role in the period ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights will remain at the heart of that role. A concern for human rights is at the core of European integration. We are much more than an economic area and an alliance of convenience. Ours is a Union which is based and built on values. Those values are essential conditions for membership. They are a compass that helps guide our external relations. We are committed to the principles of liberty, democracy, respect for universal and indivisible human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law. There can be no compromise on or denial of these principles.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has been at the fore in developing the concept of universal human rights. It was on our continent, Europe, that the idea of protecting human rights via written norms was first elaborated: the Magna Carta of 1215, the Bill of Rights of 1689 and the Declaration of the Rights of Man of 1789 are all landmarks, but they are not the only landmarks.</p>
<p class="contents">The attachment of Europe to human rights is not an abstract one: it was forged in the bitter experiences of European history – our common history. We need only look back to our own history to understand why the Universal Declaration of Human Rights refers in the starkest language to: 'disregard and contempt for human rights that have resulted in barbarous acts which have outraged the conscience of mankind.' That sense of outrage has been used positively in the past half century to construct a new Europe that has learned from and not forgotten its history.</p>
<p class="contents">This presidency believes strongly that human rights have a strategic part to play in confronting the major challenges of our time. There is no need to emphasise the close relationship between peace, security and stability on the one hand, and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, on the other. Our presidency will reflect the central importance of human rights in all our external actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Union can, rightly, be proud of the achievements of the last 50 years. We must never, however, become complacent. There is no part of the globe which is absolutely free from human rights abuses of one form or another. None of us in Europe, for example, is without fault: acts of racism, xenophobia and intolerance have not disappeared from our own societies. Believing in human rights means being ready to accept criticisms and working every day to strengthen respect for the freedoms that we all hold dear. We must remind ourselves, each and every day, that human rights are not for export only.</p>
<p class="contents">If human rights within the Union are respected absolutely, unquestionably and visibly, our foreign policy will be more effective and more persuasive. We will be in a position to demand respect for basic principles and values – upon which all individual integrity and human decency are founded – from the international community only when those principles and values apply without equivocation in our Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations Commission on Human Rights has played a pivotal role in the promotion and protection of human rights. It has been the standard-setter establishing monitoring mechanisms. The international community should rightly take pride in the Commission's unique contribution to this process and to the progress that has been achieved since the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">While much has been achieved, more remains to be done. The European Union remains committed to cooperating with the High Commissioner for Human Rights, the United Nations human rights mechanisms, special rapporteurs and representatives as well as with Treaty bodies. The European Union will reinforce its efforts towards achieving the United Nations Secretary-General's goal that the rights of all men, women and children must be 'at the heart of every aspect of UN work'.</p>
<p class="contents">Before addressing the preparations for this year's Commission on Human Rights, I would like briefly to address the outcome of last year's session, because it is indicative of the challenges that we face next March and April in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">The 2003 session of the Commission was challenging. The beginning of the session was overshadowed by the looming war in Iraq. The war started during the Commission's second week yet, and quite remarkably, the atmosphere, while occasionally fractious, was a significant improvement on the atmosphere of 2002. There was a more positive approach by all groups on a number of issues which had previously caused serious difficulties, most notably the follow-up to the Durban World Conference against Racism and on the rights of the child.</p>
<p class="contents">The return of the United States to the Human Rights Commission was another positive and welcome development. The European Union played a positive role at the Human Rights Commission. On individual country situations, the Union successfully tabled resolutions on the human rights situations in Burma (Myanmar), the Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Turkmenistan and North Korea. The Human Rights Commission adopted a resolution on Israeli settlements in the occupied Arab territories. The European Union also agreed a Chair's Statement on Colombia. However, initiatives from the European Union on Chechnya and Sudan were defeated and our resolution on Zimbabwe fell to a no-action motion.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of important EU initiatives fell in 2003. This was in significant part due to the composition of the Human Rights Commission. It also reflects the unwillingness of some regional groups to accept any condemnation of their members. It also reflects the very large number of proposals coming forward from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to thematic resolutions, the EU initiatives on the death penalty and the rights of the child were adopted by the Human Rights Commission. One of the more emotive issues addressed by the Commission, a Brazilian resolution on human rights and sexual orientation, co-sponsored by the Union, ran into vigorous objection, in particular from the Organisation of Islamic Conferences. This issue was remitted to the 60th session of the Commission and it is likely to be very sensitive in the upcoming session.</p>
<p class="contents">Before turning to the EU's preparations for the forthcoming Commission, I wish to mention the decision by the African Group in Geneva to challenge the nomination of Australia as Chair of the session. In line with the current system of geographical rotation, the Western Group has nominated Australia as its candidate for Chair of the next session of the Commission on Human Rights. The African Group in Geneva has indicated that it intends to call for a vote. We are very concerned about this development and its negative impact on the Commission on Human Rights. Australia enjoys the full support and the endorsement of the European Union and of all other members of the Western Group. Accordingly, the European Union has called on the African Group to reflect on its decision in advance of the election, due on 19 January 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the African Group can be dissuaded from calling for a vote on the Chair of the Commission. In making this call, I am guided by the need to work constructively with the African Group at the forthcoming session of the Commission on Human Rights and to improve relations with the Group generally in that forum. The President of the Council has already made our anxiety clear to move Africa up the agenda of the EU, so there is no question as to our goodwill on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the background outlined above, I would like to give you as much information as I can about the current state of the Council's preparations for the Commission on Human Rights. Time does not permit me to touch on every aspect of the Commission's work. However, I wish to share with this Parliament the essence of our approach as a presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">At a general level, the Human Rights Working Group, COHOM, has been working since last autumn on improving the Union's performance, based on our experience from last year's session. The first meeting of the Human Rights Working Group of the Irish presidency will take place on 21 January. In advance of that meeting, the various Common Foreign and Security Policy geographical working groups have been asked to present their priorities and their recommendations for action this year. With the help of this input, the Human Rights Working Group meeting on 21 January will identify countries which may have formed the subject of EU initiatives at this year's Commission. COHOM is also likely to request detailed reports from EU heads of mission on human rights situations in these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I should stress that no final decision on any initiative has as yet been taken. The Human Rights Working Group will take a final decision at a further meeting to be held on 4 February. If there are any particularly controversial issues outstanding, these will be considered by the Political and Security Committee and, if necessary, be decided by the Council at Council level.</p>
<p class="contents">The expressions of the Union's concern in regard to the human rights situations in countries will not be confined to formal resolutions. In the traditional statement under agenda item 9 – human rights situations in various parts of the world – the EU will refer to a number of country situations in the context of the thematic approach. The presidency intends to keep this draft as concise and as targeted as possible. We believe that by doing so we will have the maximum impact. Another effective approach is the type of human rights dialogue that the Union has entered into, for example with China and in the EU-Iran dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards thematic resolutions, again no final decision has been taken. However, the European Union is again likely to table resolutions on the death penalty and on children's rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations have also begun for a number of EU statements, including one on the follow-up to the World Conference on Human Rights and others on racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia, the right to development, economic, social and cultural rights, civil and political rights, integration of the human rights of women and the gender perspective, the rights of the child, contemporary forms of slavery and human rights defenders. This list is by no means exhaustive. It does, however, give you some indication of the very thorough engagement which is envisaged by the European Union in this year's Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The timing of this session for Parliament is very welcome because it means that the Human Rights Working Group will be in a position to take into account the deliberations of this Parliament in framing the Union's priorities for the Commission. The European Parliament's suggestions for initiatives are most welcome and I will be very attentive to any suggestions that come forward here today.</p>
<p class="contents">A major aim of our presidency is to achieve a fruitful and an effective session of the Commission. The climate of confrontation, which increasingly characterises debates in the Commission on Human Rights, is a problem which we will address with our partners. It is a problem that must be resolved, a distraction that the Commission on Human Rights does not need.</p>
<p class="contents">The actions of the European Union in the field of human rights are clearly perceived by part of the international community, for some reason, as being suspect. Unfortunately, the very principle of universality of human rights and the conviction that they cannot be constrained or limited by any social, economic or cultural exception are being called into question. Ireland will work very hard to counter this perception of the EU stance during our presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by reiterating the important and central position of the question of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the Union's external relations policies. Peace, security and international stability are founded on full respect for human rights. This is not empty rhetoric; it reflects the objective recognition of a reality that should be clear to all. It is also a reality that is destined to have an ever more decisive influence on governments' external policy choices. It must also inform the strategies of international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I wish to thank Parliament for the opportunity to outline the Council's preparations for the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights and to look forward to further developing the dialogue between the Council and Parliament in this vital area, which is so close to the heart of all democrats. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the Commission welcomes this opportunity to exchange views with Parliament on the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. I subscribe wholeheartedly to the statement that has just been made by Minister Roche. We need to fully guarantee the coherence between respect for human rights internally in the European Union and the central role that human rights play in our own external policy. The Commission would like to contribute to this debate on the basis of some of its specific points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Roche just mentioned, the Commission on Human Rights of the United Nations is no stranger to controversy. In the statement on the CHR preparations delivered on behalf of the Commission to Parliament last year, Commissioner Nielson noted that Eleanor Roosevelt, the first Chairman of the CHR in 1946, would be turning in her grave at the election of a Libyan Chair. To that sorry saga we must now add the African Group’s provocative indication that they will request a vote, and vote against, the Western Group’s nominated candidate for Chair – Australian Ambassador Mike Smith – which can only serve to embitter the atmosphere in Geneva ahead of the 60th session. Even by the standards of an increasingly politicised CHR – a body which saw fit to reject last year’s EU resolutions on Zimbabwe, Chechnya and Sudan – this is an unprecedented move. The Commission supports the swift efforts of the Irish presidency to mobilise a concerted EU and Western Group response, with a series of démarches in African and Asian capitals.</p>
<p class="contents">A final decision on the European Union’s country and thematic initiatives has not yet been taken and consultations continue between the Council Working Group on Human Rights and geographical working groups. As the European Parliament’s Annual Report on Human Rights noted last year, the European Union is one of the most active players at the Commission on Human Rights. The EU cannot carry that burden alone, and the search for goodwill and burden-sharing with members of the Western and other groups is vital. The EU must make best use of the revitalisation of the United States' interest in both the General Assembly Third Committee and the Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst acknowledging that EU and US views diverge sharply on several issues, the successful cooperation on the resolution on Turkmenistan last year shows that playing to the strengths of our relationship with the United States can pay dividends. Cooperation with Latin American countries – not least on the omnibus resolution on the rights of the child – stands as a good example of partnership with other groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, Brazil’s courageous, and inevitably controversial, decision to table a resolution on sexual orientation – an issue which will be re-visited this year – also demonstrates the value of encouraging important human rights initiatives from other players.</p>
<p class="contents">The potential success or failure of draft resolutions cannot, of course, constitute the primary factor in decisions on EU action. The very act of tabling a resolution sends a strong signal of concern and the situation of human rights on the ground must be a pivotal consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, in rejecting entirely justified resolutions, the Commission on Human Rights is falling far short of fulfilling its mandate to promote and protect human rights. Such resolutions do not only stand as a mark of the international community’s preoccupation with a particular country’s human rights record; they provide the basis for the work of country and thematic rapporteurs, charged with the investigation of human rights concerns. It is a mark of the lightness with which certain members of the Commission on Human Rights carry their responsibility to the institution that 35 of the 53 state members have failed to extend a standing invitation to those rapporteurs and other visiting mechanisms. We must make every endeavour in our dialogue and cooperation with such countries to prompt a more acceptable approach.</p>
<p class="contents">That is entirely in line with the EU’s determination to draw on the work of the Commission on Human Rights as an important element of our relations with third countries, to ensure that the approach we take throughout the year is consistent with what goes on in international human rights fora and to ensure that the mainstreaming of human rights in external relations is a meaningful process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission therefore welcomes this debate. We consider it an important contribution to the building-up of the EU position in the forthcoming session. I shall conclude by underlining the Commission’s intention to extend every assistance to the Irish presidency during what will undoubtedly be a challenging year for the EU in the Commission on Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gahler (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, every year, we have this human rights debate immediately before the UN Commission on Human Rights meets in Geneva, and every year we are able, in fact, wholeheartedly to endorse what the Commission and the Council have to say. The fact is that the principles that we proclaim are common to us all and there is no doubt in anybody’s mind that we give them our full support.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office of the Council has quite rightly said that human rights are an indispensable requirement if peace, stability and prosperity are to be secured. That, though, brings us on very quickly to the deficits, and the Commissioner has stressed that the Human Rights Commission does not really use its opportunities in the way that it could.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Irish presidency does honestly want to make action for human rights a keynote of its presidency. This is something for which Ireland has a very good record; it has produced such outstanding figures as Mary Robinson, who have distinguished themselves in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to something else – the Constitutional Treaty – your Prime Minister said today that he wants to do his best, but that he is not alone. Where human rights are concerned, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you are indeed, unfortunately, not alone. The chairman of my group said something on this subject this morning, to the effect that it would be a good thing if action for human rights in major States were to be given some substantial expression, that is, in joint communiqués. According to the old Prussian principle of administration that ‘government is done in writing’, that which is not on file does not exist, and if, in your dealings with Russia or China, you discuss things behind closed doors without mentioning them in a communiqué, then – politically speaking – nothing has happened.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore ask you, when you represent the European Union at meetings of the UN Commission on Human Rights, to support resolutions on China, on Russia and also on Iran. I am the rapporteur on Iran and believe that the present situation makes it necessary that we do this. Let me draw on a proposal by the House dating back some years and advise you not to concentrate on our 15 or 25 Member States, but to act in concert with all the democracies that sit on this Commission, consulting with all the functioning democracies around the world and coming to agreements on what your common concerns are.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Africans, one cannot but wonder what they actually want: appreciation on the one hand for the way in which they are establishing high standards under NEPAD, the new programme for African development, and for even establishing the peer review mechanism that we spent yesterday evening discussing, but when it comes to getting practical, they shy away, even objecting to Australia assuming the presidency – probably because Australia has taken a high-profile line on Zimbabwe. I regard all that as highly dubious, and we have to ask ourselves what we are going to do with the Africans. I said yesterday that I am very much in favour of us supporting those who do something practical in defence of human rights, but, contrariwise, that also means that we have to impose sanctions on those who do not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During this term, it has expressed several concerns that it hopes will be reflected at the session, and I would just like to mention five of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is ensuring that human rights are not subject to double standards. A failure to condemn flagrant violations of human rights in major powers such as China – torture, disappearances and the death penalty – Russia – with Chechnya – and the United States – with Guantánamo – would be unacceptable to the public. Large and small must be in the same boat.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue relates to the European Union’s decisions: its votes must reflect the concerns that Parliament has expressed in its annual reports and its resolutions, in particular with regard to strengthening international law as a guarantor of human rights in the world. Parliament has on many occasions highlighted the importance of ensuring that every country adopts the international conventions on the abolition of the death penalty, torture and antipersonnel mines. It has regretted and strongly criticised the pressure the United States has exerted on certain countries to force them not to ratify the Statute of the International Criminal Court. Moreover, it has emphasised specific topics such as violence against women and children in particular, which you mentioned as one of the thematic issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The third concern is that condemning terrorism and countries that shelter terrorists must go hand in hand with condemning all of the abuses and violations of human rights perpetrated today in many countries in the name of the fight against terrorism. This fight is certainly important, but it must not flout international law nor infringe upon human rights. This concern of the European Parliament, highlighted in its resolution of January 2003, will be clearly reflected in the 2003 report on human rights in the world, for which I am rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth issue, the right to reproductive health, which covers all of the services relating to sexual and reproductive life, was also given priority in that same report. I need not remind you that maternal and infant mortality, epidemics of sexually transmitted diseases and deaths following illegal abortions are the cause of more deaths today than any armed conflict. These tragic and unnecessary deaths continue to be the lot of the Developing World, and Africa in particular. We hope that the Council and the Commission will give a very firm commitment in relation to this right to reproductive health.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly and finally, the European Parliament welcomes the coordination between the Commission and the Council and hopes that this will continue. As in 2003, it would like an <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> delegation to be able to attend the next session in Geneva. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Human rights are a priority issue, which must be applied in a universal and indivisible manner, regardless of the cultures on which each country is founded.</p>
<p class="contents">I was extremely pleased to hear the President-in-Office of the Council say that human rights were going to be a key element in the Irish Presidency’s work. I am also pleased to hear that the European Union must not just defend human rights with a view to exporting them, but that there must also be work to ensure that human rights are always protected and respected in the various States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, loutish acts of racism and xenophobia, or those associations that advocate certain cultural identities, must be completely outlawed. I would also point out that, since the European Union is a continent with a significant amount of immigration, it is possible that some of these actions will be directed at immigrant groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I cannot naturally refer to all the points that I believe must be argued at this session in Geneva, I will just refer to three specific ones: firstly, the issue of Cuba, where illegal detentions are taking place, specifically for crimes of opinion; in this regard, guaranteeing freedom of expression, of association and of meeting is a priority issue. The European Parliament awarded the Sakharov prize to Oswaldo José Payá in 2002 and I believe this is an issue that we must be concerned about.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on that very island of Cuba there is Guantánamo. I am not going to go too far into this, but there are 700 people there, awaiting trial in a situation which is legally indefensible. Finally, there are also other countries such as North Korea where people are being imprisoned in situations that we can only condemn.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself have lived for many years in a country in which human rights were not guaranteed and I believe that the European Union must be committed to defending these rights here and throughout the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fight against terrorism is now held up to justify any repressive, authoritarian or discriminatory measure. Freedom of expression and freedom of movement, indeed all democratic rights at times, are suffering in many countries, including under George Bush’s administration, which has just established a specific procedure for officials of airline companies from 10 countries to enter American territory.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the world, there are also numerous examples of an offensive against those men and women who campaign tirelessly for human rights. In anticipation of the next session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, I would like to mention a few of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am thinking of Sihem Bensedrine, a writer, journalist and former spokesperson for the National Council for Liberties in Tunisia, who was attacked in the middle of the street a few days ago in Tunis on her way home. A group of 15 lawyers lodged a complaint on her behalf and Sihem Bensedrine blamed, and I quote, ‘the political police’. As usual, the Tunisian authorities rushed to deny the existence of any such police.</p>
<p class="contents">The many recent interventions by this courageous and passionate campaigner to denounce breaches of human rights in her country in the European media, before a parliamentary committee in Germany or even when her last book came out have certainly not seemed to please the Ben Ali regime. The harassment suffered every day by Tunisian human rights defenders shows that the Tunisian regime has not made progress, despite the shocking statements to the contrary made by the French President, Mr Chirac, in Tunis in December. </p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, freedoms as fundamental as the freedoms of expression, of opinion, of association and of assembly continue to be violated every day, treating the European Parliament’s repeated requests with disdain. This assessment is also shared by Mrs Hina Jilani, the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on Human Rights Defenders. In my view, the European institutions, the Council and the Commission, must shilly-shally no longer and must, at the session of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and in general, assert an unambiguous position regarding this regime and use their influence to demand respect for all freedoms. The credibility of the EU-Tunisia links must measure up to this requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the very recent release of political prisoners in Morocco, and in particular that of the journalist Ali Lmrabet and several Sahrawi prisoners who had been in jail for many years. Their release is proof of the importance of international solidarity. I would like to take the opportunity provided by this debate and by the forthcoming visit by Kofi Annan to Brussels to receive the Sakharov Prize to reiterate demands that have already been stated here but which are still relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to talk about the issue of Western Sahara and to call on the governments of the Member States to give their full support to the current efforts of the United Nations. As the deadline has been set for 31 January, there is an urgent need to put pressure on Morocco to accept, as did the Polisario Front so courageously, and to implement without any further delay the UN peace plan, which at last provides for the self-determination of the Sahrawi people through a free and democratic referendum. The Council and the Commission have the resources to help bring this about.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the situation in Palestine. The people of Palestine have had enough. Every gesture of goodwill, like the Geneva peace initiative adopted by Israeli and Palestinian leaders, is immediately scorned, to say the least, by Sharon. Accusations of treason, the circulation of black lists, fatal shootings by the Israeli army in the Occupied Territories and the sentencing of young, refusenik soldiers are just some of the blows to the very idea of peace in the Middle East. The escalation continues to be dangerous and bloody. In this respect, I can only welcome the beginning of the next session of the Court in The Hague, which is due to give a ruling on the legitimacy of the ‘wall of shame’. However, as regards condemning breaches of rights, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and the European Union must assume their responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wuori (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FI) </span>Mr President, 2003 was an exceptionally gloomy year for international human rights. The year began for me in South Africa, where I was working for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which had been investigating the legacy of apartheid, and I would not want to see inequality, racism or discrimination on anything like the same scale ever again anywhere. We are now, however – real or imagined terrorism having become a factor in any analysis of the world order – in real danger of sliding towards global apartheid.</p>
<p class="contents">As we happily swear by the notion of multilateral security based on cooperation, the European Union, as a Community of values and in its human rights work, which has a key impact on security, has been a disappointment in terms of practical work in this area. Amnesty International<span class="italic"> </span>published a report this week called<span class="italic"> Human Rights begin at Home</span>, in which EU human rights policy came in for some heavy criticism. Amnesty<span class="italic"> </span>complains, for example, that the governments of the Union’s Member States often do not even take the trouble to reply when it contacts them.</p>
<p class="contents">We, too, however, have experienced the same sort of frustration in relations between the European Parliament and the Council. Major violators of human rights, such as China and Russia, just get away with it year after year. Parliament’s expressions of concern have in these cases, as in many others, come to nothing on account of the passive attitude of Member States, differences of opinion between them, and the commercial and other sordid interests they have lurking in the background. Good intentions, both in the thematic and geographical sense, therefore often remain inexcusably empty, futile gestures. What is needed is muscle and effect: I refer here for example to statements on human rights and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">The country holding the presidency, Italy, at any rate chose children’s rights as its theme for its human rights forum. With respect to these, one nevertheless fears that the guidelines for children and armed conflicts agreed in December will not be effectively implemented, as was the case with the action programme against torture before it in 2001. The new European security strategy will, meanwhile, remain without any sustainable content unless it is anchored to a consistent, coherent and credible human rights policy which the Council also wholeheartedly embraces.</p>
<p class="contents">All eyes turn now to Ireland. Unless there is a wind of change both in our bilateral relations and in the United Nations we will have to prepare, not just for a combination of virtual farce and disaster, such as we saw at the fifty-ninth sitting of the Commission on Human Rights, but also for the fact that we will be wasting what is historically a golden opportunity right now when our work could have crucial, not to say epoch-making, importance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite all the Union’s efforts, however, human rights are still being violated in too many areas, not only in the rest of the world but even within the EU itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Trafficking in human beings, trafficking in organs, new forms of slavery that demand our attention in the third millennium, the unregulated use of the Internet that all too often breaches our countries’ laws and becomes a vehicle for paedophilia, for the trade in human beings and for spreading information among terrorists who have no respect for human life and dignity – these are just a few of the many examples we could give.</p>
<p class="contents">We must call on the United Nations to ensure that rights that are violated in so many countries today are respected. The children that are forced to work or become guerrilla fighters in order to survive are also those children who in our rich societies see their images and their bodies used for commercial activities, in violation of the rights that their age confers on them.</p>
<p class="contents">Too many words and statements have been uttered in reaction to urgent situations which actually require strong political decisions, such as the decision to stop the use of children to advertise or promote income-generating activities, and the decision to make certain economic relationships with third countries conditional on respect for human rights. Those countries that do not have a secular system but one based on enforcing the <span class="italic">sharia</span>, with everything that that religious law entails in violation of human rights, should be made to face clear decisions by the Union and the international community. Although cooperation remains a way of getting closer to the population, maintaining normal economic relations with governments that breach the principle of human rights would be wrong and would clearly contradict all the fine words we have uttered in recent years. We ask the Irish Presidency, with the support of Parliament, to put forward the need for stronger and more political statements at its next meeting with the United Nations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A picture of growing government repression in Vietnam emerges from several reliable sources, some local and this applies even more to the second half of last year, 2003. To illustrate this, I should like to give some details of the national situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Even official figures show a doubling in the number of death sentences in 2003 compared to 2002, particularly for drugs and economic crimes. In addition, citizens are being arrested on allegations of spying or criticising the government on the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">The Protestants in Vietnam’s central highlands are undergoing particular suffering. They are subject to constant ethnic and religious persecution, including the ultimate government sanction of deprivation of their livelihood, their land. Incidentally, Hanoi has strictly forbidden these hill tribes to maintain contact with the outside world. Gatherings of more than two people are also prohibited. It is no wonder that these people, known as Montagnards, are attempting to flee their heavily militarised territory, which is resulting in a refugee crisis. All in all, we are seeing shocking breaches of human rights here.</p>
<p class="contents">Council and Commission, I trust that you will call the Vietnamese authorities to account for these matters via the global forum of<span class="bold"> </span>the UN Commission on Human Rights. It is of practical importance that the United Nations demand that Hanoi grant their special rapporteurs for freedom of religion or belief and for refugees access to the central highlands.

The question is this: do we agree that, when we speak of ‘human rights’, we also mean civil and political rights? In other words, do we agree with the position of Kofi Annan, who recently declared that democracy is a human right in itself, as can be inferred from Article 21 and others of the Universal Declaration? The question I am asking is a very important one, and one that also arose from a conference on democracy and human rights held in Yemen a few days ago, organised by <span class="italic">No Peace Without Justice</span>, at which fifty countries from the Arab world released a statement that very clearly affirms this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is a comment: the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva is, of course, not only a recent instrument – it was founded in 1993 – but also a very weak one, and precisely because of its weakness it has become extremely politicised. It is a body that never has sufficient, clearly defined financial means, not to mention institutional powers or human resources. In short, it is at best a whistle-blowing body, but one which even in these terms has never done its job properly, precisely because it is composed of opposing blocs in which everyone protects the members of their own regional group.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, while it is quite right to be concerned about the African Group’s questioning of Australia’s nomination as Chair, it must be added that it is also true that last year Europe abstained on a call for a vote against the nomination of Libya as Chair on regional grounds. Perhaps it is worth remembering this, Commissioner and Minister, because if we had adopted a clearer position last year – not as regards the Chair’s country of origin but as regards the standard of application of human rights in that country – perhaps today we might have some extra cards in our hand with which to support the Australian candidate.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly a proposal: I do not believe we can make any further progress with simple, albeit necessary, criticisms towards various countries, from Tunisia to Vietnam, and we could add a whole list of names. I believe the problem is to strengthen the institutions responsible and thus the policies. For instance, I still do not understand – and I have been asking this since 1995 – why the European Commission does not have a Commissioner for human rights. It is a complete mystery to me, and nobody has ever given me an answer.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe that the episode of the Australian candidacy itself reinforces the need to create a community of democracy and of democracies within the United Nations. Only a strengthening of the institutions can make a policy progress from words to deeds; so far there have been plenty of words but certainly very few deeds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union therefore has the moral obligation and responsibility to defend and promote fundamental rights and freedoms. Consequently, we have the obligation and responsibility to improve the operation of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and to make it the world’s political conscience, and I am pleased with what has been said here in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It also has the obligation and responsibility, however, to condemn with great clarity and courage the violations of these rights which are taking place, wherever they happen and regardless of the economic or foreign interests existing between the European Union and the countries where these violations take place or the motivations leading to the violation or jeopardising of fundamental freedoms and the principles of the Rule of Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Not to do so means covering them up, becoming accomplices in them, accomplices in what is happening in Chechnya, in Guantanamo, in Cuba, in Tibet or in Iran. In this way, the Union would also be clearly contradicting the principles and values on which it is based and would lose all credibility, and without credibility it will not have the authority necessary to promote and demand from others respect for the principles we claim to defend.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not sufficient, however, to condemn. We must also implement the recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights and ensure that others implement them. Otherwise, our commitment will be purely rhetorical, and through rhetoric alone, however long the list of declarations adopted may be, it will be difficult for us to make a more humane world a reality for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, the Irish Prime Minister, on presenting the programme of the Irish Presidency of the Council, made a particular reference to the issue of human rights. The Geneva session offers an excellent opportunity to demonstrate that the words spoken this morning, which we have all applauded, truly respond to the will to ensure that the Union actively fulfils its commitment to the world to defend the fundamental freedoms which form the basis of the Community edifice.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced, having heard what you have said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that that will be the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fava (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, we welcome the statement by the President-in-Office of the Council that there can be no compromises on the subject of human rights. Unfortunately, the experience of the European institutions shows that the reality is often quite the opposite.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say a few words on two subjects on which I believe Europe should summon up all its political prestige and use it in Geneva. The first is the death penalty. The Italian Presidency’s about-turn on the resolution for a moratorium on the death penalty at the United Nations General Assembly, which was announced by the Presidency but never tabled, is a serious occurrence that has left the European Union exposed and, above all, has eroded some of its political authority. This shows that even on a subject apparently as widely agreed on and as precious as human rights and the abolition of the death penalty as a judicial solution we are held hostage to many governments’ petty self-interest. This is a battle that must be fought at a political level, starting in Geneva.</p>
<p class="contents">In China last year 3 138 executions were recorded; there were also plenty of executions in many so-called liberal democracies, from Taiwan to Thailand, from Japan to India to the United States. We cannot address a matter like this on the slippery slope of political convenience and, above all, we cannot expect it to be a battle based purely on principle and evidence, because it is not like that. This is shown by the fact that the Governor of Illinois recently decided to commute 167 death sentences, and I believe it was because he felt the impetus and pressure of international public opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point, Mr President, concerns journalists; in other words, the right to speak out and not to remain silent, which is a fair indicator of the real quality of a democracy. In the last ten years more than 400 journalists have been killed, and for very few of these do we have any legal certainty. In the last six months there have been 228 arrests and 250 unjustified trials, many of which were in countries that belong to the so-called group of western democracies; the latest case emerged only two days ago and involves Turkey. Among other things, we believe that the forces of repression against journalists and press freedoms have learnt to use more underhand methods. Violence against the freedom to speak out and not remain silent is committed and consummated also by gagging, censoring and taking broadcasts off the air; unfortunately, these are practices that have also recently found a place here in our countries, including my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect we want to call on the Presidency to exercise a rigorous and courageous mandate, a political undertaking that I should like to try and define in the matter of human rights with just two words, which are the words Parliament has always sought to convey to the Commission and the Presidency: on human rights we will not tolerate any exceptions or any omissions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That led to the adoption here a few years ago of a directive against discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in employment and elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">In the course of the enlargement process, we have consistently and successfully insisted that penalising sexual contact between persons of the same sex be abolished before a country could join the European Union. In this House, we have also repeatedly reminded countries such as Zimbabwe and Egypt, with which the European Union has concluded agreements, that they should put an end to discrimination and punishment of sexual contact between adults of the same sex.</p>
<p class="contents">We make ourselves very clear on this point every year in our reports on human rights in the world and within the European Union. It is only logical, therefore, that we also raise this policy at the United Nations. As has already been said, last year, Brazil presented the UN Commission on Human Rights with an initiative to include combating discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in the human rights policy of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, that proposal will be further elaborated and then raised again. This elaboration will probably include mention of discrimination on grounds of sexual identity. That is a subject on which the European Court of Justice passed a landmark judgment just last week. My group hopes, therefore, that the EU delegation will support this Brazilian initiative in full – every last part of it – and also cooperate on elaborating it further. All further attempts to destroy this initiative by countries minded to do so must be prevented, in cooperation with at least the EU Member States that are members of the UN Commission on Human Rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At long last it gives me an opportunity to remind our European Parliament of its commitments on the question of indigenous peoples and in particular on our institution’s dialogue with those too-neglected peoples and its representation to them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my duty, Mr President – and you know what I am talking about – to remind you again of our 1994 resolution on action required internationally to provide effective protection for indigenous peoples, which in fact called for the setting-up of an interparliamentary delegation composed of Members of this Parliament and representatives of indigenous peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">After ten years’ hard work, the indigenous peoples have for their part succeeded in creating and organising themselves in an Indigenous Peoples’ Forum. On the Union’s side, however, we are more than discreet; I would even go so far as to say we are not present. The proof is that neither the Council nor the Commission have made any reference to indigenous peoples and Parliament itself has still not arranged its delegation.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remedy this lack of consideration for a question that nonetheless affects peoples on five continents. I shall therefore be proposing that the Union invest its resources and its will in organising the next Indigenous Peoples’ Forum jointly with the UN here in this place and in ensuring that the rights of these populations also remain among our priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This has been a superb debate, and what has struck me listening to it has been the extraordinary range of issues addressed. As I mentioned at the outset, this debate is greatly appreciated by the presidency: it provides a timely reminder and an opportunity to exchange views with Parliament some two months before the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights opens in Geneva. Members of Parliament – including the last speaker – have, in making their meaningful and fruitful contributions, highlighted areas in which there is still much work to do.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all the Members who contributed to this debate and to assure them that the Irish presidency will see to it that the points they have raised will be brought to the attention of the appropriate Council instance as we prepare for Geneva. Members have cited a considerable number of country-specific issues, as well as several thematic issues, which need to be worked on. It would be invidious of me to select specific issues from among all those which have been commented on today.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me simply say that my colleagues and I have been very careful to note the contributions and will ensure that we go through the record methodically.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to refer to one point made by Mrs Bonino. The Union has been a strong supporter of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights since its establishment over a decade ago. Secretary-General Annan has yet to appoint a successor to High Commissioner Sergio Vieira de Mello following his tragic death in Iraq. Let me assure you that this presidency will provide broad and strong support for the Office of High Commissioner at the Geneva meeting, not least because we owe it to the memory of the distinguished incumbent who was cut down in Baghdad, a man who did so much for the cause of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by again thanking the Members who have made contributions today. I can assure them that their contributions will be taken on board. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A Member of Parliament raised the issue of the fight against terrorism and its impact on human rights. I would like to reiterate that the Commission is of the opinion that the European Union should support the Mexican resolution on protecting human rights in the context of the fight against terrorism, in the 60th session of the UN Commission on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Tunisia I would like to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Commission has recently published a communication on human rights in the Mediterranean, in which we clarified our position on the human rights situation in Tunisia.</p>
<p class="contents">Third, I would like to associate myself with Mr Roche's remarks as he paid homage to Mr Vieira de Mello, the former High Commissioner for Human Rights, who was tragically killed in Baghdad.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comments concern Mrs Bonino's remarks. I could even go as far as to say that I share her view. As you know, the Commission said last year that it would be a dangerous precedent to change the way the President of the Commission is chosen by replacing the concertation and acclamation procedure with a vote. Therefore we are prepared to support the efforts of the Irish presidency in avoiding making such a choice a source of conflict. Such a conflict cannot but undermine the credibility and role of the Commission on Human Rights, which is important for us.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mrs Bonino, I would like to draw your attention to the fact that last December the European Council decided to hand the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia, based in Vienna, a specific competence concerning the guarantee of fundamental rights in the European Union, therefore creating the basis for what one could call an agency for fundamental rights in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to fundamental rights outside the Union, the responsibility lies with my colleague, Mr Patten, whom I am replacing today. When it comes to the internal policy of the European Union, I am sorry to disappoint you, but I am the Commissioner responsible for human rights! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
