<p class="contents">I would like to start by saying that I fully agree with Mr Cohn-Bendit that the EU-Russia summit was more than a discussion on Ukraine. It was an occasion to further deepen our relations in various fields and therefore I am glad that we are holding this debate on the EU and Russia today. I hope that you will forgive me for not staying for the full debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU and Russia have come closer in more than one respect. With the ratification of the PCA (Partnership and Cooperation Agreement) enlargement protocol and the Russian ratification of Kyoto, Russia has underlined the importance it attaches to its strategic partnership with the European Union. This strategic partnership is also important for us. Together we can handle not only difficult issues of mutual importance but we can also address important international issues such as the environment and the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The four common spaces form an essential part of our strategic relationship; they show that we want to be more than just close neighbours. We want to be good neighbours. During the last six months we have made substantial progress; we have been able more or less to complete negotiations on two of the four spaces, namely on economics, research, education and culture.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope that at the next summit in May 2005 in Moscow we will be able to reach agreement on all four spaces. In the EU, we see those four spaces as interlinked. The EU wants to lift the level of cooperation between the EU and Russia to a higher level, but this has to be across the board. There can be no picking and choosing. Furthermore, we will do this – and I have not set aside fundamental principles and objectives for the sake of a quick compromise. It is important to note that, whilst negotiations on this basis are ongoing, we will try to intensify EU-Russia relations wherever possible whilst respecting our principles.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some very important issues, such as the Kyoto protocol, where we have to move forward and we cannot wait for a final agreement on this basis. Both Russia and the EU have agreed that the WTO accession is important for Russia. The EU has offered assistance in the WTO negotiations with other partners, but we have insisted that Russia should take WTO rules seriously. Russia should thus increase the confidence of foreign investors. It also means that Russia should be willing to solve economic disputes. In this respect the EU recalled the unresolved issue of Siberian overflight payments at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still some work to be done in the common space of freedom, security and justice. The most important issue is the question of the EU's desire for readmission agreements, which is linked to the Russian desire for visa facilitation as well as the long-term objective of a visa-free regime. For the EU a readmission agreement is an essential element of this common space, therefore we are not willing to compromise just to obtain a result. We want a good result – and that is in the interests of our people.</p>
<p class="contents">We consider respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms to be of paramount importance and therefore an importance element of this space. We raised the issues of Chechnya and the situation in the Northern Caucasus as well as the position of the media with our Russian partners during the summit. Unfortunately we were not able to make substantial progress since opinions continue to differ. But I hope we will be able to maintain a frequent dialogue on human rights issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This discussion is a two-way street, therefore we had no objections to Russia raising the issue of Russian-speaking minorities in the Baltic States. In my view, we gave the Russians a clear and satisfying answer to these questions.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU asked Russia about its objections to the notion of a common neighbourhood, which we consider to be important for the common space of external security. Unfortunately, here we have different views as we have seen with Ukraine, but we will continue to try to convince Russia that working together to create a stable, democratic and free common neighbourhood is not only in the EU's interest, but also in Russia's: it is a win-win situation. We should look to see where we can find common ground rather than just criticise each other.</p>
<p class="contents">On the common space of research and education, including cultural aspects, there was agreement in principle to establish a European training centre institute in Moscow. This will enable Russian citizens to understand the European Union better. Furthermore the EU appreciated Russian support on ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the fight against terrorism, during a visit by Gijs de Vries, our counter-terrorism coordinator, President Putin said that Mr de Vries was highly valued by his Russian counterpart. His counterpart will visit Brussels shortly. Moscow was very interested in EU policy developments such as document security. Russia also wants to exchange data with Europol, Eurojust, etc. The EU is in principle ready for this, but first Moscow has to ratify the Council of Europe's Convention on Data Protection. President Putin committed himself to this and I hope that this commitment will bear fruit shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussions on external relations were primarily focused on what the EU considers to be our common neighbourhood, in particular Ukraine, Belarus and Moldova. It will not come as a surprise to you when I say that the discussions on Ukraine were long, intense and very frank. They took up the whole working lunch. We agreed on a number of important issues. The current situation should be solved in a peaceful manner without any violence. Secondly, Ukrainian law should be respected. Thirdly, we should try to avoid a deepening of the rift between the Ukrainian people. Whoever becomes President should be the President of all Ukrainian people and the territorial integrity of Ukraine should be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already referred to the telephone call that Prime Minister Balkenende made to President Putin this afternoon, so I do not think I need dwell too much on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to Ukraine we discussed a number of other international issues. In view of the limited time and given the fact that the views of the EU and Russia on, for example Iran and the Western Balkans, coincide to a large extent, I will not go into details now.</p>
<p class="contents">The relations between the EU and Russia are of strategic importance. Russia needs the EU, just as the EU needs Russia. During the Dutch presidency we have been able to intensify our relations and bring the four common spaces a lot closer. Furthermore, the EU has managed to speak with one voice during the past month, which has not always been the case with such an important dossier as EU-Russia relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this can be seen as progress. The EU and Russia have had and still have differences, but that is only natural. Russia has to get used to the fact that in more that one respect we have become closer neighbours, whose interests are not always identical. However, we are able to discuss those issues freely and in a very frank manner, and that is essential for a strategic relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the next presidency will be able to inform you that we have complete agreement on the four common spaces that form the basis of this relationship. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrero-Waldner,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Nicolaï, although much has, of course already been said, I should like to start by stressing once again that the EU’s enlargement has made Russia a much more important partner for us, as it is the European Union’s big neighbour, and we want it to be a strategic partner. We must be able to discuss all issues with Russia, both with regard to where we want to make progress, but also with regard to international issues, even if we sometimes have differences of opinion. At the summit on 25 November, it became clear that we could talk in a very good, business-like atmosphere, and the discussions were also very detailed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Nicolaï has already mentioned that we, of course, want to have the four large areas together as a package. This package was the focus of our negotiations. In addition, as he also quite rightly noted, we discussed international issues, with Ukraine taking up a large part of the time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission saw it as particularly important to maintain the quality and integrity of this package as regards the four common areas. We did not want the individual parts to be negotiated separately. This was what we had agreed on, and this will remain the framework in future. Whilst wishing to express my thanks to the Presidency of the Council, the Commission also played a large role in enabling us to continue with this position. I am confident that intensive further negotiations will allow us to reach an overall agreement on this package in May.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of the package’s contents have already been mentioned. In the common economic area, the conditions must be created for a strengthening of economic relations. This means that trade and investment must be promoted, existing obstacles must be eliminated and, above all, that legal and administrative provisions must increasingly comply or be made compatible. We have also decided – and I believe that this is an important point – to initiate a dialogue between the European Union and Russia on energy, and, above all, to utilise successful cooperation in this area as an engine for other areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We also raised such issues as the investment climate in Russia and, in this connection, the situation of YUKOS. Above all, we stressed the need for transparency, stability and predictability. We have also decided, as Mr Nicolaï mentioned, that the common economic area will particularly deal with environmental issues. This will make it possible for us to take a common approach to the challenges of environmental policy, and we have of course welcomed Russia’s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. This will make it possible for us to step up our bilateral cooperation, but above all cooperation in international forums on climate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">In the second area, the area for freedom, security and law, we decided to continue our intensive discussions, during which equal account must be taken of the aspects of security, on the one hand, and freedom and law on the other. It is important for us that it should be in this area that we anchor the basic questions of protection for fundamental rights, of the principle of the rule of law and of human rights. We agreed that it is in this area that we wish to deal with issues relating to easier travel and issues of asylum and return. In addition, this area will continue to deal with issues such as terrorism, organised crime, corruption and trafficking in human beings. In addition, we offered to step up our cooperation in the fight against drugs, for example with third countries such as Afghanistan, or also with the United Nations, which plays an important role in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Chechnya, we made an offer to Russia to assist in the reconstruction of the country, as soon as the security situation makes this possible. With regard to the area of external security, this should make it possible for us to implement genuine cooperation on all issues relating to conflicts in our common neighbourhood, so that we can promote common care for stability and security in the region. It did of course become clear that we still need to convince Russia that cooperation on issues of common security is in both our interests; we also discussed the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the fight against terrorism and civil protection as part of closer cooperation. We also, finally, want to extend our cooperation in the field of research, education and culture. Our goal in this field is again to promote contacts between our societies and, above all, to continue to promote innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course we discussed a number of individual questions, of which I would particularly like to draw attention to three; firstly, on the Commission’s suggestion we decided to set up this new forum in which we wish to discuss all issues relating to regional cooperation. In addition, we want to set up a new sub-committee in the framework of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, where we will also be able to discuss issues relating to Kaliningrad. In our opinion, it is important to discuss not only issues relating to transit, but also, and above all, issues relating to economic and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we agreed to hold regular consultations on human rights issues, including the issues of minorities and fundamental rights, which Mr Nicolaï has already mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we reached an agreement on an Institute for European Studies in Moscow.</p>
<p class="contents">You will all be aware that the situation in Ukraine was a priority at the working lunch, and we referred very clearly to our position, which we set out earlier. I can say that we agreed that the situation can be resolved only by peaceful means and within the framework of the Ukrainian constitution. We said that the Ukrainian people had a right to decide its own future and the future of the country.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all the differences of opinion on this issue, we should not forget how much also connects us with Russia, this large country and our partner, and we must therefore do everything in our power to eliminate differences, to make progress and to find joint solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today is her first appearance at a Brussels plenary session, though I know that this afternoon’s debate is her second one. The truth is that you have taken up your responsibilities at a very delicate time on the international scene; you have been at the International Conference on Iraq; you have met on the sidelines with the Quartet to deal with the relaunch of the Roadmap for the Middle East peace process following the death of Yasser Arafat; you have had to attend this European Union-Russia Summit; we have the political crisis in Ukraine. You will have plenty of work to do over the coming days, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">With enlargement, the Union has clearly extended its borders with some new neighbours. You have referred to the new neighbours to the north; Russia, Belarus, Ukraine and Moldavia and it is true that we are currently linked to Russia by means of an Association Agreement which is based on principles and values to which the European Union is fundamentally committed; principles and values, Commissioner, which I believe have not on this occasion been compatible with the Russian authorities’ comments on the European Union’s position on Ukraine, since they have said that the European Union’s position could lead to a bloodbath in that country. I note that President Putin has put that right, accepting the results following his meeting and talks with the German Federal Chancellor.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, Commissioner, this Parliament is completely and utterly committed to human rights; they are not just for one country, for one region or for one continent; they are of a truly universal worldwide nature. In our relations with Russia, we cannot stress the good things and forget about the bad. The ratification of the Kyoto Protocol is clearly one of the good things, and the bad things include, as you have mentioned, the human rights cases in Chechnya and the Yukos case, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, Commissioner, that it is important for the Commission to have a defined policy of friendly relations, but on the basis of our values; to this end, we must also closely monitor the measures taken recently by the Russian authorities, in terms of the always difficult balance between security and freedom, following the attacks in North Osetia, in a decentralised manner. It is, therefore, very important, Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, that we enhance those relations. Russia plays an extremely important role in terms of the stability of the new neighbours, and has fundamental influence in the Balkans and also in Central Asia, it has nuclear weapons, it participates with us in the Quartet and we must therefore develop a strategic association and cooperation, not at any price, but based on the values and principles that we as the European Union hold dear. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to lend my full support to this and to all the other points you mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we have not yet achieved such relations is perhaps due to the fact that the basis of trust between Russia and the European Union is perhaps not yet quite as it should be. In turn, this is due to the fact that Russia feels almost hemmed in by an enlarging European Union, and now, faced with developments in Ukraine and the South Caucasus, is, so to speak, worried for its own existence and field of influence. I am not saying this in order to justify Russia’s position, but this position must also be viewed from a psychological viewpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union – and I am therefore also grateful for what you and the President of the Council said – must explain to Russia that democracy in countries neighbouring Russia, combined with the rule of law, will ultimately result in stable economic conditions in Russia as well.</p>
<p class="contents">It was therefore vital not to say, with regard to Ukraine, that there is a Russian candidate and an EU candidate, but to say that there can only be candidates elected by the Ukrainian people to be their president. What is at stake, as you have already mentioned a few times today, is that Ukrainian interests should prevail.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of dialogue on energy as well, it is vital that the Russian partners also understand the psychological situation on our side. The fact is that we will have a major interest in Russian energy supplies only when we are sure that energy will never be used as a political weapon and that the supply will not be cut off on political grounds, in other words, only when there is an open investment climate in Russia. Cooperation with Russia in the field of energy will then be much improved, as I have just stressed.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the fight against terrorism, we do indeed have common interests, but – while I will not deny that the armed forces or the police need to be deployed – our methods differ. As we have always stressed in connection with Chechnya, however, it is also important to fight the causes of terrorism, and in many cases these are poverty and poor economic development.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the issue of human rights, I am fully in favour of dialogue. We have nothing to hide. We also have nothing to hide with regard to the treatment of Russian-speaking minorities in the European Union and with regard to the situation of such minorities, as we have done a lot for them, and it is to be hoped that we will continue to do so. Yet we must find Russia prepared to engage in this dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, there is something else of great importance that we must communicate. In recent discussions with Russian journalists in Berlin, I was asked why it was necessary for Russia to justify itself to the European Union. No, Russia does not need to justify itself to the European Union! Russia must justify itself to its own people, and, in common with the European Union, Russia must also justify itself to the world at large. We are all committed to the goals of democracy and the rule of law. When Russia feels itself to be just as committed to them as is the European Union, its situation will improve. It is therefore important for us to build relations, in the interest of Russia and not only in the interest of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia is our neighbour and, because of its size, history and position, the country can play an extremely important role and be a constructive partner on the continent of Europe. We have many shared interests and problems that we must solve together, and our group supports the partnership with Russia and wants it to be strengthened, deepened and developed.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, however, that the Russia strategy has not been any great success so far. It feels rather as if we are treading water and not getting anywhere. Russia is unwilling to appreciate that cooperation is based upon give and take and that the EU’s policy is based on certain values that cannot be negotiated away and that must be seen as a clear thread running through everything we do.</p>
<p class="contents">There is reason for feeling very uneasy now, following the latest developments in Russia. I am thinking of the concentration of power in the Kremlin, of the media situation – in principle, media freedom is a thing of the past – and of the lack of a political solution in Chechnya. I am also thinking of very recent developments, namely Putin’s support for Yanukovich in Ukraine and, earlier, for Lukashenko in Belarus. Relations between the EU and Russia are in a critical phase, and we cannot describe the latest meeting as anything other than a failure, even though I genuinely admire and sympathise with your optimism, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">You stated that a decision had been made in favour of deeper and more organised cooperation when it came to human rights and minorities. I hope that this will lead to something more practical so that this forum does not just become a talking shop that skates over the surface of issues, but is a place in which difficult issues genuinely can be solved. It would be interesting to hear more details from you about this decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is her first debate here and I look forward to good cooperation. I have listened carefully to what you said, Commissioner. You said that we have offered to help the Russians in the country’s reconstruction as soon as security is guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">That, Commissioner, is putting the cart before the horse. That is not the right way of going about things. After all, we all know there is no peace in Chechnya, that a peace process is being imposed that has no support base and that human rights are being violated on a daily basis. We all know that the situation in Russia is extremely serious. I have gleaned this from the most recent book by Anna Politkovskaya, an independent journalist who writes in her new book ‘Putin’s Russia’ how in Russia, human rights are being violated on a daily basis, how the grip of central government on the press is being tightened every day and how the power of the KGB/FSB is increasing. We can all see that the situation is serious and that in Chechnya, a true peace process must be put in motion. That is where the European Union comes in. Indeed, we are next-door neighbours and we can play a role in that respect. Not by building houses over there, but by organising a true peace conference. That is why it surprises me that the Russians do not even want to get involved in talks with ordinary citizens, with representatives of the mothers of soldiers who are worried about the fate of their children, who are worried about peace and about human rights being observed, and who want to go and talk to representatives of the Maskhadov Government and Mr Zakayev. I am also surprised by the fact that the Russians are even putting governments, including the Belgian Government, under pressure to deny Mr Zakayev access to this country and to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">That is unacceptable. That is something we as MEPs cannot accept and against which we must protest. If an important group in this Parliament wants to organise a dialogue between mothers of soldiers and Mr Zakayev, then this should be covered by parliamentary immunity; if not, Belgium is not worthy of retaining the seat of the European Parliament here in Brussels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In recent days, the second of these has become particularly apparent, that is, the fear of Russia as a major partner and a major country to the East. The European Union has an inferiority complex that overshadows its relations with Russia, and today a strange kind of judgment is being passed on Russia for its position on Ukraine. It has been said that Russia is interfering in Ukraine’s domestic affairs. Yet what action is being taken by the European Union and our representatives? They are travelling to the country as observers, but becoming involved on behalf of one of the candidates. This should not be the case.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is something quite different. If we wish to demand democratic standards of Russia, we should first demand them of ourselves, and do everything in our power to ensure that we observe these standards. We are not entitled to pass judgment on Russia in this matter. Why is the EU interfering in such a manner in the sovereign decisions of the independent Russian state, when President Putin has warned us against interfering in the Russian sphere of influence? Russia has a right to its own opinions, and it is our strategic trading partner. Kaliningrad, which borders directly onto the European Union and Poland, should be of the utmost importance to us, as it is a window onto the world in terms of trade. Yet as a result of our panic-stricken reaction to the events in Ukraine, Russia has tightened restrictions on people passing through border crossings, in particular those into Kaliningrad. We have much to lose by adopting such a schizophrenic approach in our relations with Russia. Relations with this large country should be stepped up, not restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to add that the EU has interfered enough in the domestic affairs of independent states, in this case in those of Russia. The result of this has been that, against our wishes, the areas in the east of Ukraine are being pushed into Russia’s hands. I should like to end my speech with an old Roman maxim: ‘first, do no harm’. This is particularly true in the case of relations with Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my opinion that both the Presidency and the Commission have given way on this issue in the face of Russia’s disapproval, expressed on a number of occasions before the summit, of the position taken by this House and by the Members of this House. I refer to the view that the PCA should be treated as one package in negotiations with Russia. In a certain sense, this has meant that our votes on this issue have been disregarded. I should like to say one more thing with reference to discussions on Ukraine. The country with which we are negotiating a road map for implementation of the PCA and the country actively interfering in the electoral process in Ukraine are one and the same country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does, however, show a certain lack of respect for the European Parliament, and I very much hope it will not be repeated in future.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted this debate is taking place today. It would have been wrong to replace it with the debate on Ukraine, as Ukraine is one country and Russia is another, even if Russia, or part of Russia, still thinks or wants to think in terms of the Soviet Union or the Tsarist Empire. I am also delighted for a second reason, namely that Mr Barroso and Mr Putin had major differences of opinion at the recent summit in The Hague, and that these differences of opinion did not merely relate to Ukraine. The sight of self-satisfied politicians shaking hands has generally been a bad omen for the average citizen, especially in the East.</p>
<p class="contents">What conclusions can be drawn from relations between Moscow and Brussels, or in other words between Russia and the European Union, over the past few years? The most obvious conclusion is that these were not in fact relations between Brussels and Moscow, but between Russia and the individual EU Member States, in particular the largest Member States. They were relations between Russia and France, Russia and Germany, Russia and Great Britain and Russia and Italy. Moscow chose its own partners for bilateral relations and played off the EU and, to a large extent, large countries against medium-sized and small countries. Our only reaction therefore has to be to act in solidarity within the framework of a united EU. Russia is an important and difficult partner, and we should not give it any opportunity to develop imperial and superpower-like tendencies. Europe, both Western Europe and Central and Eastern Europe, cannot afford to allow this to happen. It is not in Russia’s long-term strategic interest either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we are linked by extremely close economic ties that benefit both sides, yet on the other hand, tensions are increasingly being felt between the two parties in the political sphere, and very far-reaching differences of opinion are becoming apparent. In spite of what is said by some in Europe, and what was said earlier by some of the Members of this House, we should not fear such differences. On the contrary, our experience of countries which were in the so-called Soviet sphere of influence for many years has taught us that a genuine partnership and respect from the Russian side will only become possible if we state our views clearly and firmly, even if these views are extremely critical of certain aspects of Russian politics.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to congratulate Mr Balkenende and the entire Dutch Presidency for their clear and firm approach during the EU-Russia summit on 25 November. In the days after this summit we saw that we were right in our assessment of political events in Ukraine, and this continues to be the case today. I should also like to remind Mr Rogalksi that Ukraine is not a part of Russia, and so speaking out in defence of free and democratic elections for the Ukrainian people does not constitute interference in Russia’s domestic affairs. Ukraine is a separate state and a separate nation, and I should ask you to bear this in mind. Thanks to the position taken by the Dutch Presidency, the EU is gaining face in the eyes of the European nations, after a long period during which too many European leaders pretended not to see, or indeed did not see, the problems which arose with regard to relations with Russia in the past, such as the centralisation of power at the cost of a still-fragile democracy, Russia’s policy on the Caucasus or the reconstruction of the Russian ‘sphere of influence’. I should like to thank Mr Balkenende for the position he adopted during the EU-Russia summit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The administration in the United States has adopted a strongly unilateral approach. It is conspicuous in trade disputes and the Iraq war, and has given rise to an estrangement of sorts. Our relations now require much effort. Immigrants have formed a new group of American citizens that voted for the Republicans in the last elections. Defence Minister Donald Rumsfeld has said that we have new Europeans in the same way. In fact we have enlarged and in this way brought new blood to our numbers. These newcomers, however, have had a different relationship with the United States (not for very much longer, in my opinion, as our work gradually hones that relationship), and Russia, through a grim and difficult history as part of the Soviet Union or as one of its satellites.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first Parliamentary Cooperation Committee met last week, and it was then that the issue was raised for the first time, though certainly not the last. Last week’s summit, in my opinion, was largely unsuccessful. We did not achieve consensus on four areas of action that we share. They are only part of the whole. We know the reasons. The problems relate to both America and Russia, but relations with Russia are virtually at a standstill. There has been some progress: acceptance of enlargement and the partnership pact, the Kyoto Protocol, and so on. There is, however, a long list of problems with regard to the investment protection accord in Chechnya, which has been mentioned here too.</p>
<p class="contents">We have discussed common values with the Russians at many summits. But just how much do we share the same values? Are we drifting away from one another as far as our values are concerned? If they are very different for very long it will not be long before we drift into the area of sanctions. What does the Commission intend to do to halt this drift and ensure that Russia does not sail off into the void, as it were, perhaps towards the east and Asia? What could the Commission do about this?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my sincere belief that the outcome of the summit needs to be debated in the European Parliament, so let me stress a few points that were discussed during the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament should welcome the 14th EU-Russia Summit in the Hague while regretting, however, that it has been a failure as far as substantial progress on the establishment of the four common spaces is concerned. We should strongly support the efforts of the Council and Commission to use the opportunity provided by the summit to underline that Russia, the partner of the European Union, carries a great responsibility in our common neighbourhood, and in Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also firmly reject the allegations recently made by the Russian authorities that the European Union and the international community, by expressing their support for the Ukrainian people’s right to exercise their constitutional rights, is encouraging violence in Ukraine. In this context we should express our concern about the centralisation of Kremlin powers at the expense of democracy, independent media, the regions, the rule of law and human rights, especially with regard to the situation in Chechnya and the Yukos affair.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time I believe that ratification of broad agreements between the Russian Federation and certain Member States of the Union is one of the keys to strengthening the EU-Russia partnership and encouraging mutual understanding and trust.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Kaliningrad region, as an important factor for the overall development of the Baltic Sea area, was also discussed in the Hague. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to call on the Russian Duma and the leadership of the Russian Federation to start a dialogue on the development of a separate action plan for the economic and social development of the Kaliningrad region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sometimes, those connections were made willingly and, at other times, unwillingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Russia thus continues to play a large role in terms of stability, especially in the area around the EU’s eastern borders. It must not, however, actively side with the dictatorships there or impede the development of democracy. If this happens, the EU must be vigorous in its condemnation.</p>
<p class="contents">The events in connection with the election in Serbia a few years ago, which resulted in Milosevic’s departure, are very reminiscent of what is happening now in Ukraine. Then, the crisis was resolved peacefully, and we must ensure that this crisis too is resolved peacefully. In that case, Europe needs, on the one hand, to show itself prepared to cooperate with Russia and, on the other hand, to emphasise that Russia should not interfere in other countries’ internal affairs, irrespective of the common history these countries and Russia may previously have had.</p>
<p class="contents">If Russia seriously wants to be a strategic cooperation partner of the EU, it must be clear that the cornerstones of such cooperation have to be freedom, mutual respect and the democratic values shared by the EU countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no specific questions for Mrs Ferrero-Waldner but wish to emphasise that neither the EU nor Russia should ever have interests in another country other than an interest in democracy and that this must be both a basis for, and an objective of, cooperation between the EU and Russia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Russia and ourselves take different views, and that is why the Summit has communicated so little on the issue. Instead, there are Europe’s open evaluations. There is extraordinary development in Ukraine. A nation of citizens, such as Russian manifestly is not, is being born. It is Ukraine’s hour now. According to our documents, however, Russia has great responsibility, – in my view, the greatest. Ukraine’s chairman of Parliament made a start by announcing that Ukraine has only two alternatives – either the division of the state or bloodshed. It looks like the Russian President would be in favour of completely restarting the election process, so that the opposition leader could be eliminated. If the resigning president of Ukraine is going to listen to such advice and announce a decree to organise not just the second round but completely new elections, Russia will be responsible for the consequences. This would become a provocation for hundreds of thousands of people, who could lose patience leading to a loss of peaceful civil order. If they were to occupy the presidential palace, as happened in Georgia, they could be met by the gunshots of a foreign army. The European Parliament or the European Commission – I am directing my comments to Mrs Ferrero Valdner here – could officially ask the Russian Government, or at least its representatives, if the reports by the Moscow press about Russian special armed forces being brought into Kiev dressed in Ukrainian uniforms are correct. Extreme as the situation appears, it is difficult to understand the sympathy expressed for the Russian president – who got involved so unnecessarily – as if he cannot lose. Fourteen years ago, we in Lithuania were similarly aware of the majority in the West feeling sorry for Mikhail Gorbachev. That had a bad effect on the Kremlin, and Gorbachev lost a lot more influence. A politics designed to restore the Russian empire has now already been defeated in Ukraine, even though President Putin remains a force in the world. He has two alternatives – either acknowledge the Ukrainians’ right to have their government and democratic state or spill blood and be left with blood on his hands like Gorbachev. President Putin’s friends should speak directly with him, not via Mr Kuchma, and unanimously advise him to choose the first option. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, I should like to re-emphasise that this summit was not, as I see it, in any way a failure; on the contrary, it allowed us to make significant progress. As I said before, the EU insisted on quality and on putting together a package that really does enable us to push through our concerns and our values, which are of course very important to us.</p>
<p class="contents">The big question is how difficult questions are to be dealt with. This year has already seen us asking ourselves this question, and it was decided that it was important to set clear priorities, to be open, to deal with all problems, and to stick to common positions – and we succeeded in doing all of this, which was an important step and a positive one. This was something to which the Commission attached particular value, and I am glad that all the Members of this House helped us to achieve this goal. The issue at stake here is the finding of mutual interests, but this presupposes care before links are forged, and must be founded on values rather than on interests.</p>
<p class="contents">One example of a success is that at the WTO negotiations we came to a bilateral agreement on private transport to and from Kaliningrad. As already noted, we have set up two sub-committees, which I believe is important, and this has been approved by Russia. We have major tasks ahead of us, which include migration, visa issues, returns and cooperation in border regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reply to Mr Staes, not having done so before as there was of course a lot going on at this summit. I can tell him that Mr Barroso made it clear to the Russian delegation that a political solution in Chechnya does of course enjoy support from Europe, the Commission and the entire EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
