<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poos (PSE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, it is a true honour for me to be able to present to you this report on Council reform in the presence of Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, representing the Council and Mr Barnier, representing the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This own-initiative report does not concern the Council alone. It also concerns the European Parliament and Commission in equal measure, as they have the same interest in ensuring that the three institutions work well, and are efficient and coherent. In an enlarged Union, it is imperative that the Community institutions improve their ability to make decisions and increase their reaction time. I do not believe that it constitutes any insider dealing to state that today the Council is the most badly organised institution. This is a serious problem, since this institution, which has both executive and legislative competences, is still, in spite of the changes made to the Treaty, the European Union’s main centre of power. The Council has already lost much of its effectiveness. In my report, you will find a long list of dysfunctions. The Council itself had carried out some preparatory work three or four years ago and I used this and other work as a basis. Since then, however, nothing has been done, although some other preparatory work was carried out by former – and very key – figures on the international stage, and I shall mention, in particular, the <span class="italic">Notre Europe</span> working group led by Jacques Delors. One of the dysfunctions that I must emphasise particularly is institutional digression, which has primarily been at the expense of Community procedures, along with the Commission. The rise in power of the European Council, combined with the weakness of the General Affairs Council, has re-established the intergovernmental method of preparing decisions. The aides, or ‘sherpas’, used by the Heads of State, have reintroduced a method that is reminiscent of nineteenth century secret diplomacy. Mini-summit meetings, like the one held at Ghent, have brought back the tendency to place control in the hands of a chosen few, a dream that some have never given up on since the Fouchet plan of the 1960s. In order to correct this digression, I recommend nothing more and nothing less than going back to the Treaty. We should ask the European Council to stop tackling detailed issues and to stop acting like an enormous vacuum cleaner that tries to deal with all the important decisions. You should not bite off more than you can chew. What is even worse is that the European Council now causes the institutional system to come to a standstill. No one dares to make a decision anymore. Everything is now referred back to those at the top. The European Council should restrict itself to giving general guidelines on European policy, as laid down in the Treaty. We must re-evaluate the General Affairs Council, enabling it to resolve conflicts between the specialised Councils and ensuring that decisions are coherent. To this end, it is essential to have a single channel for preparations, and the same single channel for preparations could also be used by the European Council. We must demand that the ministers in the General Affairs Council do not deal with European affairs at a brief monthly meeting, where an in-depth discussion of the items on the agenda is not possible due to the limited number of ministers attending and the unacceptable practical conditions. The proposal for a resolution suggests a number of practical solutions, which can all be implemented immediately without having to amend the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I would like to draw the attention of Members to the proposals on improving collaboration with the European Parliament. They concern the presence of Council ministers at our important debates as well as speeding up the legislative procedure from the first-reading stage. With regard to transparency, I hope that the European Parliament and the Council will support the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, which proposes that Council discussions be made public when it is working on legislation. This obviously requires considerable reorganisation of the agenda and discipline in the conduct of meetings. If the Council did not meet behind closed doors when carrying out its duties as co-legislator, citizens might also perceive it as a second legislative chamber, which is, in fact, a task that the Council already fulfils today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Therefore, the task is, without doubt, fraught with danger.</p>
<p class="contents">You are right in thinking that the Presidency was very interested to read Mr Poos’ report on Council reform. Mr Poos has had a remarkable political career spent in many European forums and is consequently well acquainted with them, both internally, having been a participant, and externally, having observed them from a critical standpoint.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, I would like to say that the Presidency fully supports the analysis, perhaps not the description, but the analysis stating that we need to improve the way in which the Council is run.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki European Council of June 1999 has already acknowledged that substantial changes in the Council’s working methods are necessary, and pointed out that these changes must be gradually introduced from now on so that by the time of enlargement, the Council can smoothly accommodate a larger membership.</p>
<p class="contents">The same Council also approved operational recommendations to achieve this. The main thrust of these recommendations is very similar to some of the proposals made in Mr Poos’ report. I shall mention just a few.</p>
<p class="contents">The recommendations stressed, therefore, that the main task of the European Council should be to provide the necessary impetus for the Union’s development and to define general political guidelines. They emphasised that the General Affairs Council is responsible for overall coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">There was also a call to improve coordination of European policy within Member States. The recommendations stressed that the Committee of Permanent Representatives (COREPER) has responsibility for the final preparation and presentation of all agenda items to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The final recommendation was to restrict the number of formations of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">These recommendations, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, were implemented in parallel.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, the General Affairs Council has therefore followed the practice recommended at Helsinki, to divide its agenda accordingly into two parts: external relations issues and horizontal questions, which include overall policy coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council has also reduced the number of formations of the Council to sixteen, in order to improve the coherence of work, and to prevent fragmentation of the EU’s activities. The role of COREPER was clarified in the Council’s internal rules of procedure. Public debates are now organised on new and important legislative proposals, and on the programme of the General Affairs Council and the ECOFIN Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The first assessment regarding the implementation of the Helsinki recommendations was presented by the Council’s Secretary-General at the Gothenburg European Council in June 2001. From this, it emerged that progress has been made, but a great deal still needs to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, certain measures were, for example, not completely implemented. The European Council of Gothenburg gave explicit recognition to this and pointed out, as the Secretary-General underlines in his report, that other reforms for the Council’s structures and working methods are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this, the Secretary-General was requested to formulate specific proposals for measures, preferably during the European Council of Laeken, which must guarantee the effective operation of the Council following enlargement, by means of better preparation for council meetings, clear coordination between the different council formations and more efficient working methods, so as to enable the Council to take the necessary decisions by June 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, the Belgian Presidency will continue to implement the Helsinki recommendations. Parallel with this, the General Affairs Council has intensified its coordinating role.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, from now on, the presidency will report to the General Affairs Council on the most important dossiers which are being discussed in the other Council formations. This list is drawn up so as to allow the General Affairs Council to carry out fully its horizontal coordination role pertaining to all activities of the different formations of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The object of this exercise is to make the Council activities in its different formations more coherent, and to ensure that these are better tailored to the general objectives of the Union. Furthermore, this also reinforces the role of the General Affairs Council in the context of the preparation of the European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Additionally, recent events in the United States have clearly illustrated that overall coordination of the Union’s activities in the fight against terrorism is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council of 17 October looked into a report of the presidency on the activities of the different formations of the Council in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">With this report, the presidency has drawn up a roadmap comprising all Council initiatives and activities, each time indicating those responsible for the implementation, the deadlines and the progress made to date.</p>
<p class="contents">The General Affairs Council has asked for regular updates of this roadmap. After all, this is an important instrument which enables progress to be evaluated for each formation of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">During its next sitting on 29 October, the General Affairs Council will once again pour over this updated roadmap. This initiative clearly illustrates the capacity of the General Affairs Council, if necessary, to guarantee general coordination of the Council’s policy. Furthermore, this initiative should help re-confirm this coordinating role of the Council in general.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, there are other reforms needed to improve the operation of the Council. There is no doubt that the report requested from the Secretary-General will, therefore, prove useful in generating further thoughts on this issue. And that also applies, of course, to the report by Mr Poos and the EP resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I am not surprised by the quality of this analysis, given the experience and expertise that Mr Poos has gained over many long years and which he is now putting to use at the European Parliament. I would like to say that, having begun by voicing our overall appreciation of the report, the Commission also supports the reforms that you put forward for the Council. Transforming the Council into a structured and efficient body is in the interests of the whole European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Your report takes up many of the suggestions and comments that we at the Commission have expressed in the past, and particularly in our recently published White Paper on European Governance. These options for reform are all the more interesting since they can be made – as you have said – without altering the current Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">With reference to the Council, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would obviously like to say that, from my point of view, each of our institutions is autonomous and has primary responsibility for its own reforms. We know very well, however, that each of the institutions is concerned with how they all function. It is in this spirit and within these boundaries that I would like to give you the European Commission’s impression of the other institution, in other words, the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, within the framework of the debate on the future of the European Union, we must carry out an in-depth examination of the institutional set-up, the role of each institution and the amendments that need to be made to the Treaty so that our Union has a genuine institutional framework that is both more democratic and more effective. That is why I think, Mr Poos, that your report is an extremely important element, which will spark off the wide-ranging debate about to open on the institutional framework of the EU, its effectiveness and its democratic legitimacy. Nonetheless, the debate on the most fundamental reforms in the run-up to 2004 cannot be an excuse for refusing to immediately adopt the reforms that the Council can already implement in the existing Treaty. Furthermore, one of the objectives set out in the White Paper is to ensure the Council functions as efficiently as possible. Apart from the different views that might be expressed on one point of detail or another, there is some convergence on the analysis of the dysfunctions that we have found – and of the reforms that need to be carried out. This convergence is evident in the report that you are presenting, Mr Poos, in the White Paper and also – as Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck stated – in the Trumpf-Piris report, which was drawn up by the General Secretariat of the Council itself. The operational conclusions of this report were widely approved at Helsinki by the European Council and were also widely implemented in the Council’s internal rules of procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">It falls within the remit and it is the duty of each institution – I would like to reiterate this – to continually examine whether that institution is working efficiently. The Commission wanted to do this by adopting the White Paper and proposing the administrative reform drawn up by my colleague, Neil Kinnock. I believe that the Council will have to do this one day, as will the European Parliament, and the Commission will do all it can to support these two institutions in this undertaking. In this respect, I would like to reiterate that the Gothenburg European Council has already asked the Secretary-General of the Council to submit detailed proposals on this issue for the meeting at Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to emphasise – without going into the details of each proposal in your report, Mr Poos, that all we need is political will to successfully complete this assessment and improvement work. Obviously, this must be shown by the Member States governments as well as by the institutions themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least two points that deserve particular attention. On the one hand, the concept of the legislative Council and, on the other, the role of the General Affairs Council. We are well aware, ladies and gentlemen, that the Poos report defines the three functions of the Council, which are to legislate, to take decisions regarding government and to coordinate policies. Consequently it is very clear – and the Commission supports this – that the Council must be organised differently so that it operates within the framework of one or another of these three functions. Therefore, the legislative Council should basically work in complete transparency, with open debates and public votes. Admittedly, the number of sectoral Councils may be too high, but it is primarily the lack of coordination between these sectoral Councils, which means that, unlike the European Parliament, in which the Assembly takes the final decision, the Council arm of the legislator has much more difficulty in coordinating its various decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation calls for particular consideration of how determined we are – as you mentioned in the report – to encourage consensus between Parliament and the Council from the first-reading stage within the codecision procedure. Mr Poos, although the Commission fully supports the determination to bring about swift agreements, we must ensure that they do not have a negative effect on the coherence of texts that the Commission proposes. Under the Treaties, the Commission has the exclusive right of initiative and the responsibility of protecting the common interest. The Commission therefore hopes that the determination of Parliament and the Council to bring about consensus at first reading ensures that the Commission will be fully involved in all aspects regarding substance and procedure, in order to guarantee this coherence in the texts adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I would like to reiterate that the Commission has been given the exclusive competence to hand down a judgment to protect the common interest at this stage of the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">You are also quite right, Mr Poos, when you point out in the report that the crux of the debate is, essentially, how the General Affairs Council functions. It is extremely difficult, in just one monthly meeting, to take decisions on all the issues relating to EU external policy, including those on security policy, on maintaining the single institutional framework of the European Union and all the horizontal and institutional issues, such as, for example, the recent regulation on access to documents or the coordination of the EU response to the tragic events of 11 September, as well as coordinating sectoral policies. The Commission is fairly well placed to judge the degree of variation in the subjects dealt with by the General Affairs Council, as there are times when we require several Commissioners to represent us at the same session. We therefore support your view, Mr Poos: the various formations in the Council need a central body responsible for coordination and, at the moment, it is very difficult for the General Affairs Council to do this. We must therefore avoid a situation where the General Affairs Council becomes some sort of Foreign Affairs Council, because there is no other formation in charge of coordination. Furthermore, is it necessary to create a new General Affairs Council, made up of ministers who fulfil a coordinating role within their governments and who wield the necessary political authority, as you suggest? This would, in any case, enable the European Council to be freed from arbitration and from policy coordination, so that it can fully devote itself to its real job of providing political impetus and defining guidelines for the European Union. However, creating this sort of Council raises a whole raft of political, even constitutional, issues, as you yourself admit, in some Member States, particularly in those that have a coalition government.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, ladies and gentlemen, I would just like to thank Mr Poos once again for the extensive, excellent and very thorough piece of work that he has done and for the useful proposals contained in the report. Quite frankly, I do not believe that it is the Commission’s role to respond to one or another detailed comment regarding the way the Council functions because, as I have said, each of our institutions, quite naturally, functions autonomously. This, however, does not prevent us from performing a global assessment where there are no taboo subjects, to repeat the phrase that Mr Verhofstadt used this morning, when he stated that there were no taboo subjects where the wide-ranging debate and the Laeken Declaration are concerned. The issue of how to improve collaborative work, particularly in the field of legislation, is not a taboo subject either. The Commission would like to say that it is also in its interests to work with an efficient Council and that the two messages contained in this own-initiative report, in other words, that we must guarantee coherent action as well as a certain level of political representation in the Council’s decision-making, have certainly been heard, Mr Poos. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, led by our coordinator, Mr Méndez de Vigo, have, of course, been committed to supporting his work. This report, though, sets alarm bells ringing. When the report observes – an observation that I welcome, although I regret its accuracy – that the coordinating role of the General Affairs Council has been undermined, the Commission's right to take initiatives weakened and, finally, government-level cooperation in Council built up to the detriment of cooperation at Community level, then that is cause for alarm as regards the Council's ability to operate.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The Foreign Ministers, who at present constitute the General Affairs Council, can no longer perform this duty adequately. They travel around the world – which is after all what they are meant to do – spend a few hours in the Council, leave their deputies to represent them and are not there for the vote anyway. That is why the Council should, for once, take its Rules of Procedure, more specifically Article 11(4), seriously and check how many Ministers are actually present at the concluding votes.</p>
<p class="contents">We need, then, a new General Affairs Council. Let us call it a Council of European Ministers, meeting weekly, or more often if necessary, in Brussels or, of course, in the national capitals, and always available within their governments. We also insist on something to which Commissioner Barnier has referred, namely that the Legislative Council which meets in public to decide on laws – not in committees, but in final rulings – needs to be separated from the Executive Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we will reach the point where this can be established and that a Council of European Ministers – as I wish to call it for the sake of simplicity – conceived along these lines, will also be able to coordinate the work of the various Councils. Some of their voting procedures are utterly different, and the European Council must then again be asked to give authority to the Council, so that the ladies and gentlemen can deal with the matter again. Things must change!</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to address one point which is not particularly topical but is intended to point the way ahead. It concerns the need to find a successor to occupy Mr Hombach's position. I recommend that we should not appoint a sort of Hombach Mark II to this position, not because I have anything against Mr Hombach, but because, in institutional terms, we need to go in a new direction. I think these duties should find a home at the Commission, so that the Commission, which has the Budget resources at its disposal, can also take responsibility for these issues...</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">…. so that we can eventually achieve the transfer of the High Representative's functions to the remit of the Commission, where a Vice-President would take them over.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Please let me make a final observation, which is not directed at my esteemed colleague Mr Poos: I hope that the present members of the Council have the strength and insight to come to the right decisions while they belong to the Council and not only after becoming honourable Members of this European Parliament.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I have asked to speak in this debate firstly in order to express my personal gratitude and that of my group to Mr Poos for his wonderful report. It really is a piece of work carried out with knowledge of the subject, not only because he is a veteran of the Council, but because I witnessed perfectly, ten years ago when we were preparing the Treaty of Maastricht, how Mr Poos, then a member of the Council with the government of Mr Santer, along with Mr Santer, showed the same attitude of openness, cooperation and solidarity towards Parliament which he is now proposing in his report. The result was the Treaty of Maastricht, which gave us codecision. I believe that we must salute his coherent and serious political track record.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to codecision, we are not just dealing with a reform of the Council as such, but we are an interested party in the matter. Codecision has allowed us to develop a shared culture in which the Council, for the first time, has been opening up to Parliament. We must consolidate this. There is a very important step proposed by the Poos report, which is that the Council, in legislative session, should act publicly. If there is an insufficient number of Ministers, they could apply the rule applied by Parliament: that votes should be nominal, and if members are not present, they should not be paid allowances. These are therefore measures which can be applied straight away and which do not have to await the reform. From this point of view, I believe that Mrs Neyts-Uyttebroeck, whose path has taken the opposite course, having moved on from Parliament to the Council, can introduce a degree of freshness into the work of the Council. I hope she can cooperate with us.</p>
<p class="contents">A final observation, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen: we are on the eve of the Convention; we have fought for it in Parliament and we believe that we also have to cooperate positively in the process of reforming our institutions, which are interdependent on each other, in a way which means that we cannot reform one without taking account of the others.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I believe that we have to teach by example. We are awaiting the Council meeting on the 30 October, from which we want a unanimous position from the Council with regard to the Belgian proposal on taxation, in order to bring about the statute of Members once and for all; we also believe that the package of anti-terrorist measures is a great opportunity to demonstrate to our co-citizens that we are united. And lastly, the President-in-Office of the Council will allow me to point out that we would like her, with a view to Laeken, between the White Paper on Governance and the Mandelkern report, which is with the Council, to present us with a coherent proposal which is not based on a reduction of Parliament’s legislative powers. That would also help the reform. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Poos has much long-standing experience of how the Council operates. I hope that the Council will take his views on board. I assume that this issue will come up at the convention and that, as Mr Verhofstadt said this morning, there will be no taboos.</p>
<p class="contents">Precisely what shape is to be taken by the Council’s work is not of course something we Liberals have any reason for taking a view on, because it is not our task to regulate these matters. There are nonetheless certain issues in which we think we can become involved. Transparency is one such issue. For us, transparency in the EU’s work is important when it comes to all the institutions. It is a key to winning back people’s confidence in the European project. At present, the Council meets behind closed doors and legislates for millions upon millions of Europeans. That is not acceptable. Everyone talks about this, and everyone criticises it. Very minor reforms take place, but these are not enough. The legislation must be a matter for public debate. A separate department must be formed within the Council in which the ministers meet entirely openly and in public in order to legislate. There must, moreover, be proper Minutes issued afterwards. The members of this legislative Council must of course be politicians, not officials, with clear mandates from their respective governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue which worries us rather, and which Mr Poos also addressed, is that of all the overhyped ‘mini-summits’ which assume an enormous amount of importance. A great many decisions are made during these meetings of rather doubtful status. We hope that less emphasis will be placed on these meetings and that they will instead be transformed into working meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an increased tendency in the Council – not so much in the country that at present holds the Presidency, but in many others, especially Sweden – towards intergovernmental activity and a desire to strengthen the Council at Parliament’s and the Commission’s expense. We view this development with great concern, because more intergovernmental activity and more decisions behind closed doors scarcely lead to a more democratic EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that it was a sort of Barnum Circus, where everyone talks but hardly anyone listens or actually seeks agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the rapporteur and the majority of his proposals, and so I would like to use the time available to me to send two messages from our group to the Council, in particular. The first is that, even if the Council were to approve Parliament’s proposals tomorrow morning, we would not be able to resolve the fundamental democratic imbalance and we would not be able to stop the intergovernmental drift. The only way to genuinely improve the democracy and efficiency of the Union is by strengthening the Commission and Parliament and removing the Council’s right of veto.</p>
<p class="contents">The second message is a call to reflect on what Commissioner Barnier has said, namely that despite the positive elements and the endeavours of the Belgian Presidency, it would currently be impossible to reform the Council without a grass roots debate among its members on the very nature of the Council. I am sure that ideas vary among the Union’s Member States on the Council’s future, and I therefore call strongly upon the Presidency to assume responsibility for organising this debate on the future and to ensure that practical steps are taken which open up the way for rapid progress along the path outlined by Mr Poos, pending more comprehensive reforms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we must see this report as a positive contribution to the preparations for the future structure of the Union, a Union which must of necessity be an autonomous, independent political entity, secure in its cultural and social traditions, which can serve as an effective response to the confusion brought by a hegemony such as that we are currently witnessing.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union must assume a new role. In a situation in which alliances are being disbanded and reformed on a global scale, Europe comes across as weak, appointing dubious triumvirates to represent it on the world stage when it needs to be united and firmly autonomous in presenting and maintaining a line of peace and social justice to eradicate the threat of terrorism. The reforms proposed by the Poos report are necessary and achievable, and we support them. These are small but important steps, worthy of due consideration by the Council and Parliament. They will also contribute greatly to resolving the democratic deficit, endowing the Council with a new institutional role and a closer relationship with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This fundamental political and external security action and its mandated representative can only be effective if decisions are taken in a context of joint responsibility between all the countries rather than with some of them being excluded. The Council has to understand this. We are not just complaining for the sake of it: this is a democratic requirement for the well-structured, transparent running of the Union and will benefit the Union as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much welcome Mr Poos' report and very much hope that when it receives overwhelming support from Parliament, as I believe it will, the Belgian Presidency will convey the importance of the report to the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">We hope also that the Belgian Presidency will lead the drive, as it were, to rock the consciences of the members of the General Affairs Council as to what their role and function must and should be. Regrettably, the General Affairs Council has very much receded into the background in terms of its effectiveness. The Council has been undermined by the expansion of specialised Councils and by the European Council itself and this is very regrettable. The General Affairs Council, as Mr Poos says, must remain a powerful political body and it must not be allowed to become a super Coreper. If it does, nobody will have an overall view of what is happening; where we should go and how we are to prepare for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The work of the Council must be more consistent, and greater coordination is needed in the administration of the Council. I feel the Council should confine itself to defining the general political guidelines of the Union and should not intervene in the questions of specific detail. It is very much in the interests of better decision-making within the Union to have an effective Council which is transparent and exercises all the duties conferred upon it by the Treaty. Also, Ministers who attend the General Affairs Council meetings must have all the powers required to carry out their tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all too familiar with Ministers appearing at General Affairs Council meetings, taking the television cameras on the way in with their one or two one-liners and then going on their way. The Belgian Presidency-in-Office shakes her head in disbelief. Madame, I know, I was there! I saw it for myself on more than one occasion and things have not improved since I left. In actual fact, they have got much worse, and that is something that must be aired. We want the General Affairs Council to do its business. We would like the Presidency for the time being to do its business and we also want the Commission to do its business.</p>
<p class="contents">We respect, and must respect, the three institutions and the role that they have to play. This Parliament cannot afford to sit back and be silent if we see the role of any one of the institutions, be it Parliament or the Commission or, indeed the Council, being sidelined for any particular reason by any small group of Member States for any political reasons they may have at any time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These three gentlemen will, over the next 14 months, be responsible for the adoption of the majority of laws in the EU. The permanent representatives of the countries which hold, or are to hold, the presidency – Belgium, Spain and Denmark – are clever diplomats who live in the shadows. They meet every week in Brussels and negotiate the larger part of our laws. Seventy per cent of these are prepared by their subordinates and aides. Fifteen per cent of them they deal with themselves. Another 15% are placed on the ministers’ desks, and the permanent representatives brief or deputise for the ministers during the formal adoption. The meetings take place behind sealed doors so that no one can see how far we are from that democracy in which we are united in believing in the fifteen Member States. It does happen that a matter is discussed in public and finds echoes in the national parliaments. Indeed, it may directly entail a brief or negotiating mandate for the minister. However, that is the exception. As a rule, we as voters and elected representatives have forfeited the larger part of our democracy, which is administered by 15 permanent representatives and their officials. The solution to this democratic deficit or embezzlement, for we know, of course, who have absconded with the power, is simple: to read our constitutions and return legislative power to the elected representatives. Let us recreate the core of democracy whereby the electorate can go to the polls and new majorities can be obtained and new laws adopted. That core does not exist in today’s EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The day after one of the worst spectacles that the European Union and, in particular, its Council of Ministers has ever provided to the citizens of Europe, the excellent report by Mr Poos, the former chairman of the Council of Ministers, appears, which not only shows us the way forward – it gives an outline that should be displayed on all the churches or public buildings in the European Union, just like the theses used to be posted on the Wittemburg church. We have witnessed a European Council, where the dispersal of the institutions, the dispersal of the Council, split up into asides, factions and the most diverse formations, had a detrimental effect on the work of the Belgian Presidency, which did nothing to cause this of course. Now we are reiterating the great principles and calmly and dispassionately saying how Europe should be run, and where it is failing, because we are not applying the wise recommendations and thoughts of Mr Poos, which are also enhanced by his years of experience, of someone who has an insider’s view of the Council of Ministers, and of the European Council full stop. I therefore think that the vote on this report is a great moment for Parliament. Unfortunately, Europe in practice does not provide any inspiration at all, which is one of the main reasons why the work of the EU, the image of the EU and the weight of the EU are insufficient. Therefore, if this text can be an element that the Belgian Presidency, in the run-up to the Laeken Summit and the Laeken Declaration, may largely take into consideration by saying ‘ladies and gentlemen, this is the way forward, this is the Community method and this is how things should be run, so that at least we are trying to put our house in order’, then this text will be worthwhile, and I hope it will receive Parliament’s unanimous approval tomorrow. In any case, the radical Members will support it unreservedly. We think that this is the way forward, that this is how we get there, that we must see European integration and not European destruction, which is, unfortunately, what the Council all too often gives us the impression is being allowed to happen. It is not really the Council itself, but its members, its actors, who certainly demonstrated at Ghent, as they did at Nice, that they are very capable of breaking up the institutions, and that they are actively working towards this goal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission has for some time been pressing on with this sort of internal reform process. The European Parliament is occupied in creating the same sort of conditions by means of the Corbett report, which is currently in progress, provided we can achieve these without amendments to the Treaties becoming necessary. I believe this should be done by both these institutions and also by the Council, which will have the greatest problems simply by reason of the increase in the number of its members. For when I consider that in future, when there are 27 members at a meeting of the European Council, it will take an hour and a half simply to deal with the precedence of delegations and then that the statements made by every delegation will make even lunch difficult – and of course we cannot go without lunch – then it clearly does not go without saying that we will be able to work effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">This has nothing to do with the effectiveness of a Council Presidency, but exclusively with the structures. That is why it is extraordinarily important that we really do tackle many of Mr Poos' proposals in this area, which can be realised by simple amendments to the Rules of Procedure and without Treaty amendments. I believe we have to do this for two reasons, namely to increase efficiency and for the sake of greater transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Efficiency can only be increased by the burden of the General Council no longer having to be borne by one pair of hands and in the context of one organisation. Meeting up constitutes Item A, we do a bit of foreign policy, then all 27 of us meet the President of Kazakhstan, then move on to Item B, which is legislation, and all this with seamless transitions from one item to the next, so that half the participants are always in a press conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office of the Council, I may be exaggerating a bit, but I fear that the reality is rather like that in some areas. It would in fact be necessary, for this reason, to move over to an Executive Council concentrating on foreign policy in particular. We really should be in a position to formulate a coherent foreign policy in the Council, provided that it is an intergovernmental organisation, and must make it clear that one effect of transparency will be a Legislative Council whose votes will be publicly taken and publicly explained.</p>
<p class="contents">We will only win people’s acceptance of Europe if they know who took what decision and for what reason. That is a fundamental issue when it comes to gaining our citizens' acceptance, and only in this way can we, by means of the codecision procedure, bring about the public interaction of Parliament and the Council, so that the citizen and the media have the chance to reach a fair judgment and hold to account those who are responsible, or believed to be responsible, for wrong decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it to be urgently necessary that the work should be made parliamentary in this way and that this should be the means by which it is also made political. We are engaged in the work of legislation, which in many fields is regulated by officials who share in the decisions. I find it hard to reconcile this with our democratic conceptions and so I would like to ask you to take the initiative on this point in Laeken, because we can achieve a great deal without amending the Treaty and should also be preparing ourselves in this way for enlargement of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Audacious because it immediately proposes a set of amendments to improve the workings of the Council. Cautious because it acknowledges the viability of the amendments without needing to modify the Treaties. And realistic because it recognises that it is also becoming politically necessary to make considerable improvements to the workings of both the Commission and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The report’s proposals even consider the idea that improving the institutional workings of the Union will require major adjustments to the balance of established power which, without endangering the workings of these bodies, guarantee the full participation of all Member States. I would say, as a matter of fact, that this is the fundamental issue. The broad objectives for the European Union in economic, social and security terms and for its external representation will only be achieved in the short term if Europe as a whole, through its various public opinions, and the fifteen Member States, through their representatives in the various bodies, attach priority and urgency to improving political cohesion on the basis of fully egalitarian participation.</p>
<p class="contents">Passivity, a lack of clear definition, division and disputes between countries, which prevent changes from taking place, help maintain the status quo, prove right those who see the European Union as nothing more than a group of merchants whose primary concern is to divide up the limited financial resources it has available in a way that is not always fair or equitable. Strengthening the institutions, improving their workings and efficiency, drafting and producing Community policies for security and for our external representation is absolutely essential, but this must be carried out by all fifteen Member States without exceptions and without cabinets. For this reason, the report warrants our support and our admiration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I congratulate the rapporteur on his efforts although I cannot share his optimism. I do not believe that this mini-reform can solve the problems of the Council nor do I see the political will to carry it out, unfortunately. I hope that I am wrong and Mr Poos is right.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the golden age of the General Affairs Council has passed and it seems unrealistic to believe that the European Council is prepared to reinstate the powers which it has taken away from it. European policies are not external policies but internal policies of the Member States and the important decisions must not be reserved for the Foreign Affairs Ministers. They already have enough to do with the common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutional triangle is still essential to the good functioning of the Union, provided that each of its elements continues to adapt to the new requirements. In the case of the Council, we are facing a quagmire whose deficiencies can only be remedied: a) by recognising the decisive role of the European Council; b) by giving the General Affairs Council the task of effectively preparing its decisions so that they are not relegated to national bureaucracies; and c) by organising all the specialised Councils into an efficiently-structured system.</p>
<p class="contents">This efficiency will not be achieved without abandoning the now obsolete system of a rotating six-monthly Presidency, replacing it with a longer-lasting Presidency. Effective political action cannot change its priorities every six months. My group raised this issue in the debate of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, although, out of respect for the focus of the report, we do not insist on this point. The Poos report has the merit of proposing to the Council some minimal reforms, which are likely to lead to a process of self-reform which is becoming increasingly essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be pleased if it achieved that objective at least. We would all gain from this, even those of us who believe that Council reforms can only be achieved by the Convention because they need to be far more in-depth. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And quite rightly so. However, it is not enough. These general principles only acquire substance and translate into practice if they permeate the organisational structure of the entire European Union. Which is precisely why we should welcome Jacques Poos' motion for a resolution. It is one of the most important texts to pass through the European Parliament. The rapporteur demonstrates that a great deal can be done in the area of both democracy and efficiency without revising the Treaties, merely by applying them more accurately.</p>
<p class="contents">Taking the report as my starting point, I should at least like to highlight the following: first, the way in which the Council is organised is so complicated, with its 27 sectoral formations which have a fragmentary effect on its work. It addresses individual trees, but rarely the wood as a whole. The General Affairs Council should meet more frequently, but with the ministers present, not just in Brussels but, if possible, at the meetings too. If the Council is to work, national administrations and governments need to adapt to the European institutional attitude and modus operandi. As for relations between the Council and the European Parliament, there is good cause to increase the numbers of days' presence, although personal appearances in Parliament by the President-in-Office of the Council and transparency do not necessarily mean that the Council has to be reformed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I note that the Europe issue has increased the volume of work and deserves greater attention. The members of the Council need to make a reasonable division between their national and European duties if they are to make a more effective contribution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to comment on three points in the report which I consider extremely important. The first is item 9, which refers to the Council's two areas of work, namely the legislative and the executive. I think that Mr Poos is quite right to say that a distinction must be made between the legislative Council, that is, it must be clear when the Council is acting in a legislative capacity and when it is acting in an executive capacity. This is extremely important and, I think, needs to be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns collaboration between the Council and the European Parliament. It would be unfair to the Council not to say that certain steps have been taken, but that does not mean that more are not needed. I should like to comment on two paragraphs in Mr Poos' proposals which I think are very important. The first is paragraph 18, which refers to the role and the relations which the High Representative for the CFSP should have with Parliament. I should like to ask the Council to bring Mr Solana to order. The High Representative needs to learn that his relations with Parliament come within a certain framework and are governed by certain rules which he would do well to understand. The second paragraph is Paragraph 19. I was delighted at the excellent example set by the Belgian presidency this morning, when the President-in-Office of the Council reported to the European Parliament in person, and I should like to congratulate Mr Verhofstadt for this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, which I think is very important, is the huge issue of transparency. It is an issue which concerns all the institutional bodies of the European Union. It has been raised by other Members, such as Mrs Malmström, who has done an excellent job on the issue of transparency, as, of course, has Mrs Maij-Weggen, but what I want to say to the Council is that European citizens are not just interested in what the Council decides; they are far more interested in why it decides what it does. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is bad for Parliament and it is bad for the Commission. The lack of transparency and efficiency, which have often been referred to here, also affect our work and give us a bad image in the eyes of the EU's citizens. That is why reform of the Council is urgently necessary, as must be emphasised again and again. Mr Poos has produced useful and valuable suggestions as to how such a reform might now be possible without the need for a new European Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view that people have a right to know who votes and which way when it comes to laws and regulations that affect their daily lives. The Legislative Council urgently needs this public character. I do not believe that the number of Councils on various sectors is the problem. The problem is the deficient coordination within the Council and also within the governments of the Member States. Changes must be made here. I believe we must follow up this idea of sending a permanent minister to Brussels who would take over the coordination of government policy at national level.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs added further items to the agenda, for example, the issue of the Council Presidency when there are at least twenty-five Member States, or also how the European Council is to be defined. What is that? An organ, a super-board, or is it part of the Council? This reform is urgently needed, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, and we hope that you can do something even before Laeken, and that, in Laeken, the Council will again be on the agenda with a view to the future Treaty on the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We sometimes say in connection with the Pope that there is no need to be married to be able to talk about marriage. However, in the case of Mr Poos, we can say that he has every right to talk about the Council as he has formed part of it for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">How badly the Council functions at crucial moments was evident at the Ghent Summit where three Prime Ministers had made prior arrangements outside of the Council, where the President of the Council made essential statements on the evaluation of the attacks on Afghanistan which were subsequently not backed by the Council, where various Prime Ministers made various statements following the European Summit, where decisions were taken on a payment issue of banks in relation to the euro, but where no decisions were made on crucial anti-terrorist measures proposed by the Commission and Parliament and where, to cap it all, an embarrassing dispute arose between the President of the Council and the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">That is how the Council comes across to the public. And that negative image dominates the entire decision-making process and the way the Union is viewed throughout the Union. How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union functions better and to improve the Council’s image with the citizen? How can the Council be reformed in such a way as to ensure that the Union’s entire institutional structure is more democratic and open? In my opinion, a few factors are of crucial significance in this.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Council must confine itself to its original brief, namely to express the view of the Member State governments, under the supervision of the national parliaments and the European Parliament. Secondly, the Council must coordinate its tasks more effectively, thus ensuring that the General Affairs Council and the joint committees speak with one voice. In my view, the number of joint committees could be cut down even further. Thirdly, the General Affairs Council should function far more forcefully on the basis of solid positions of national members of government for European affairs, preferably in the capacity of Minister. Belgium set a good example in this connection. Fourthly, where legislation and the budget are concerned, all Council meetings should be public, which means that both discussions and decision-making should take place in public and reports that are compiled on these should also be made public. Fifthly, in the case of legislation, including the budget, only ministers should be granted a right to vote, which means that it is not acceptable for them to be replaced by, for example, the permanent representative or by officials. In my opinion, the Council should function entirely in line with its actual task as a Federal Council, much like its German model, so that it becomes crystal clear to the citizens what its role is in the democratic process of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly hope that the report by Mr Poos will play a key role in the forthcoming IGC and above all, I hope that the Council will take to heart what has been expressed here in Parliament in the way of criticism, but also the odd word of praise. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is entirely unacceptable in a democracy for laws to be made behind closed and bolted doors on behalf of 380 million people and without there being any public scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important position adopted in the European Parliament’s report on Council reform is therefore to be found in Paragraph 26, concerning the need for openness and stating the European Parliament’s request that, when the Council acts as legislator, both the deliberations and the votes should be in the public domain, as well as Parliament’s particular request that, at the beginning and end of all legislative procedures, public debates be held in accordance with Rule 8 of the Council’s Rules of Procedure and that Rule 9(1) of the Council’s Rules of Procedure be implemented. It also states that the results of votes and the explanations of vote referring to legislative texts must be published.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this future openness, the European Union will be democratised. It will lead to greater pressure being exercised by electorates and to greater supervision of the Council by national parliaments. It is about time! In turn, that will lead to growing demands for a concentration of the EU’s tasks and the need to limit the EU’s powers of decision-making. In other words, the report we are adopting today will have long-term consequences. I believe that we are thus coming significantly nearer the objective formulated by former Commission President Jacques Santer in 1995: Do fewer things, but do them better. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think, however, that I ever spoke about the Council in the way some of you have today.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would also like to tell you that there is one thing I do not understand. In the year that I have been part of Belgium’s federal government, I have taken part in the General Affairs Council, I have chaired the Agriculture Council for several months; I have been a member of the informal External Trade Council and, for a long time now, I have been part of the Internal Market Council.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I would point out to you that even in the space of a year, I have gained some experience of the way Councils work and of their various formations. I would like to tell you, for your information, that it is very rare to have a majority, not to mention almost all the ministers of Secretaries of State attending meetings, and this is true for all the formations I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to tell you, so that you know, that the image some of you have painted here today, that is, of a Council whose ministers turn up when the cameras appear and who leave when the cameras go away, that this is not, in fact, what actually takes place.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, this is just to remind you. It draws my attention to the criticism voiced by certain individuals who condemn absenteeism amongst MEPs in this European Parliament, that I have always refuted, who, looking, for example, at the number of people present for this debate today would say, ‘Where is everybody?’</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I must also tell you that there is no question of Council ministers receiving subsistence allowances.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that I have said, ladies and gentlemen, is solely for information purposes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
