Firstly, I would, however, like to congratulate you all on having been elected to Parliament, and I hope that you will succeed when you take on your new tasks in your careers and lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The unyielding Balkan crisis overshadowed the budgetary procedures relating to the fiscal year 2000. The preliminary proposal of the Commission for the year 2000 budget had scarcely been completed when it became clear that efforts would be required from Europe to repair the damage caused by the conflict in that area and, in particular, in Kosovo. In addition, other recent events, such as the earthquakes in Turkey and Greece and the recent development in East Timor require those having control of the budget to react swiftly. Efforts such as these also place huge demands on finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The largest task of this budgetary procedure has been in the development of finances for the rebuilding operations in Kosovo. This became clear when the year 2000 budget was considered for the first time at the meeting with the parliamentary delegation on 16 July. On the basis of the aforementioned meeting, this matter became the most important issue of the negotiations between the parties with budgetary control in the year 2000 budget procedure. If the parties concerned are willing, it is however possible to find a solution which is satisfactory for both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Both bodies having budgetary control presented their views on rebuilding Kosovo at the meeting held on 16 July. The rebuilding of Kosovo, and the solution to the Kosovo question, is the central prerequisite for the success of the budgetary procedure of the fiscal year 2000. The results of the first Conference of Donors held on 28 July are, however, encouraging from this point of view. Moreover, the estimates of damage which have been specified point to the fact that a complete financial package needs to be devised. Similarly for its part, the Union will respond to the financial needs arising from the earthquakes in Greece and Turkey and the needs in East Timor, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, I would like to introduce the results of the first hearing of the Council regarding the year 2000 budget, after the fruitful Conciliation Meeting arranged with the parliamentary delegation. Our procedure is based on the new agreement between official bodies drawn up on 6 May 1999 concerning an improvement to the budgetary procedure and discipline with regard to the budget. It is important to observe both the framework proposed in the new agreement between official bodies concerning expenditure, and also the detailed procedures contained within it to improve co-operation between official bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">We dealt with the matters affecting the financial year 2000 in accordance with the following principles. Firstly, in the autumn, under the new agreement between official bodies, the letter of amendment is examined. This relates to expenditure connected with agriculture and with the agreement on fishing, so that it is possible to take account of new estimates on the need for grants without, however, excluding a reduction in the level of grants in terms of less agricultural expenditure. Secondly, it has been decided to observe commitments as regards construction tasks. Thirdly, a clear focus is defined for the budget allocations allotted to other policies, and it is the intention to retain some flexibility within the framework of the maximum figures of the categories of the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">When we studied the preliminary draft budget in general terms and also the overall growth, we started from the assumption that in preparing the year 2000 budget, at least the same degree of discipline would be observed as in the preparation of national budgets. Our procedure, as regards administrative expenditure, was based for its part on the following principles: firstly, the growth of all relevant expenditures is limited, excluding unavoidable exceptions; secondly, after the possibilities for restructuring of activities have been thoroughly studied, new measures are established in a limited way for known areas and, thirdly, concerning evaluation of those measures, the procedure will not be changed or corrected for reasons of political expediency except in particularly well-founded cases. We also consider it appropriate to observe the approach used in approving the 1998 and 1999 budgets and to decide on the total allocations to be bestowed on small official bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the above-mentioned principles, agreement has been reached on a number of important decisions of the expenditure category, which I will briefly introduce now.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agriculture is concerned, we followed the same discipline in our decision as we applied to other areas of the budget. We introduced a fixed reduction of EUR 375 million for allocations relating to marketing. We retained the allocations proposed for expenditure relating also to rural development and accession measures which were in the preliminary draft budget. The section of the budget relating to agriculture would also be based, as far as possible, on current information and, in accordance with this, the Commission will update the information for the preliminary draft budget during the autumn by means of a letter of amendment. We will continue to examine the expenditure associated with agriculture on the basis of that letter of amendment in order that we may be able to draw up a final decision on the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided, with regard to construction programmes, to reduce advance payments of commitments with regard to the new construction programmes by 3.5%in the year 2000 instead of 4% as suggested in the preliminary draft budget, which means that the payments would be reduced by EUR 1,023 million. This reduction is necessary in limiting the growth of payments to 2.8% as opposed to the Commission’s recommended 4.7%. It does not require any change of regulations nor does it reduce the reserved funds for construction which will be received by the Member States during 2000-2001. As regards construction work, we also take into account the request put forward by the European Parliament during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and we decided to create a new point in the budget for Community urban initiatives. Commitments for this would be EUR 102 million and actual payments would be around EUR 28 million. The commitments which we have allotted constitute one seventh of the sums agreed for the entire fiscal period.</p>
<p class="contents">In discussing the expenditure associated with internal policies, we stressed that it is important to stick to those principles which form part of the discipline of the budget for the new agreement between official bodies, and part of the improvement of the budget procedure. We paid particular attention to the estimates of payments for possibilities of use and the size of approved programmes within the co-decision procedure. Commitments have also been reduced by EUR 129 million and the allocations for expenditure by approximately EUR 216 million.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the strategy promoting the accession of new Member States, we have reduced the payments by EUR 121 million. We considered that smaller payments were required to promote the strategy for accession, and that it did not call for funding at the levels proposed by the Commission in its preliminary draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as administrative expenditure is concerned, we determined the total administrative allocation for all official bodies, including the European Parliament and the Parliamentary Ombudsman, to be EUR 4,664 million, which means an increase of 3.6%on the allocation for 1999.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the view of the Council, the resources to be directed towards aid and rebuilding work in Kosovo are definitely to take priority in the draft budget. In the view of the Council, they may be taken from the maximum grants of the new financial framework relating to expenditure connected with external actions by redeploying those funds. For this reason, we decided to make a provision for rebuilding Kosovo, which contains a commitment of EUR 500 million and EUR 280 million of payments. This provision was made by reducing the usual grants which the Commission had allotted to other points of the budget in its preliminary draft for other external actions. The Council does not consider it necessary to change the upper limit of category 4 to restrict expenditure for the year 2000. The creation of a provision of EUR 500 million, approved by the Council, is based on the preliminary estimates of the amount required, which the Commission presented. In the course of time these figures may even prove to be overestimates. On the other hand we must be prepared to allocate funds to improve the situation in Turkey following the earthquake, as well as for the needs of the humanitarian aid required for East Timor.</p>
<p class="contents">As for external actions, we decided in the Conciliation Meeting with the Parliamentary delegation on 16 July to increase commitments by EUR 7 million to EUR 40 million which the Council intended to include in the draft budget for the expenditure relating to Community foreign and defence policies. We approved the budget structure for the expenditure in question and your proposal relating to the nomenclature.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now summarise the Council’s decisions on the effect on grants included in the draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the commitments total EUR 92.3 billion. This is a reduction of EUR 4.5 billion or 4.7% in comparison with 1999. Payments total 87.9 billion, which is an increase of EUR 2.3 billion or 2.8% in comparison to the budget for 1999. As a second point, the total sum of payments corresponds to 1.09%of the Community’s gross domestic product. Thirdly, the upper limits for external actions and internal policies leave latitude to the tune of EUR 222 million and EUR 22.5 million below the maximum sums of the Financial Perspective.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to thank all those members of the delegation from the European Parliament who took part in the discussions of the Budget Council held on 16 July, and also all of those people who are no longer Members of Parliament. In addition, I await with interest the continuation of co-operation with the present Parliament, and in particular with Terence Wynn, who I would like to congratulate on being selected as Chairman of the Committee on Budgets. I also look forward with interest to a continuation of co-operation with both rapporteurs responsible for the fiscal year 2000, Jean-Louis Bourlanges and Kyösti Virrankoski. Our common aim is to secure the successful outcome of the year 2000 budgetary procedure, a task which our official bodies have been capable of carrying out in previous years. The successful co-operation of those having control of the budget is based on mutual trust. For this reason I hope that both budgetary powers will stick to the these issues for which a consensus was reached in the unofficial trialogue held last week, and that supplementary budget 4/99 can be approved as it is without amendments or delays arising from any amendments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that, within the context of turning the European Parliament into a genuine parliament, we are doing something that never ever happens in State institutions. It is the incoming government – which won the elections – which presents the budget and it makes no sense that the Commission that has resigned now obliges us to debate a budget which, in any event, has been initially drawn up by it.</p>
<p class="contents">I say this in the context of European construction. Mr Prodi, you have said that you want the Commission to be a genuine European government and Mr Poettering, Chairman of the main political group in this Parliament, has even spoken of this role for Parliament in relation to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add – and I am sorry to cause any Member uneasiness – that the new Members like myself have felt most uneasy because we are dealing with amendments to a budget which we did not know and approving amendments to a budget which has still not been presented. It is an absurd situation and I believe that – although I do not want to request any measures at the moment – legal measures will be required in the near future.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The budget procedure for the financial year 2000 does not in fact begin today. Instead, we have already previously had a debate on the subject in this Parliament. At that time, the Council had been dealing with the matter, and we are now about to discuss what the results of the Council's recommendations are. Now, it is quite simple. We have a Commission which is still in office and of which Mr Liikanen is a member, responsible for the budget. The new Commission only takes office when we as a Parliament tomorrow approve its appointment and after the Commissioners, at 12.00 p.m. on Thursday in Luxembourg, have taken their oath of office before the European Court of Justice. From that time on, Mrs Schreyer is responsible. Until then, Mr Liikanen is responsible, and that is why he now also takes the floor.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have only very few comments regarding the draft budget adopted by the Council: it proposes a cut of EUR 430 million in commitments and EUR 1.7 billion in payments. While these cuts are quite normal at this stage of the budget procedure, they are this year supplemented by a substantial redeployment of EUR 430 million in category 4 - external actions - to finance the Kosovo reconstruction of EUR 500 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Although redeployment appears necessary to finance this new priority, one must take account of the fact that too great a redeployment risks destabilizing the budgetary and political balance in external relations. Redeployment should be the main source of financing of the Kosovo action but it may have to be supplemented by other means.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as agricultural expenditure is concerned, the new Commission will come back at the end of October with new forecasts in its now traditional letter of amendment which has been agreed by the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I take note of the Council’s overall concern to improve the situation of the outstanding commitments by following most of the Commission’s requests. In category 2 - structural actions - where payments can be reduced due to the proposal to adapt the payment on account from 4 to 3.5%: this can be done without major difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, however, I would like to draw your attention to an important inconsistency in the Council’s decision. The Council proposes to increase the Commission’s administrative expenditure by only 0.9% while it foresees an increase of 3.5% for the other institutions. The Council has achieved its reduction by assuming that the Commission would increase the number of vacant posts and thus realise important savings. This aim goes against what the European Parliament has wanted for many years and what the Commission has undertaken to do, namely to reduce the number of vacant posts.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the key to success in this year’s budgetary procedure is the financing of the EUR 430 million needed for the reconstruction of Kosovo and of Turkey following the earthquake. I am sure that the new Commission will look into this matter as one of the first priorities and come forward with a balanced proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On this occasion the Commission is not presenting anything – it is the Council which is presenting its draft budget. And on an occasion like this the Commission is not necessarily the enemy - in fact it is quite a friend. The opposition is these people here! Let us not lose sight of the fact that a budget has been presented to us today.</p>
<p class="contents">That is no condemnation of the President-in-Office, for whom I have great regard. Also Mr President, as you said, this process has gone on for several months. A lot of people have been involved and a lot of hard work has gone into it. I want to name two people who have been very much involved. One is Mr Samland, the previous Chairman of the Committee on Budgets, who left Parliament at the end of the last mandate. He worked tirelessly right up to the end to make sure that we could get the cooperation between the Council and Parliament that we need to get the budget we all want in the year 2000. The other person I want to thank is Mr Liikanen. As Commissioner - or Commissioner-designate - this is probably the last time you will sit here on a budgets issue. We have not clashed over the last few years but have had opportunities to try and solve a lot of problems. You deserve the praise of this Parliament for the work you have done in the budgetary areas and especially in some of the areas where you have tried to change things within the Commission. I should like to wish you well for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that has got the nice bits out of the way. Let us now get down to the budget. Let us not get this debate mixed up with tomorrow’s debate on the supplementary and amending budgets 1, 3 and 4 for 1999 because, when the President-in-Office says that this spirit of cooperation is based on mutual trust (that is what I wrote down) between the institutions, I only have to remind the Council of what it did with supplementary and amending budgets 1 and 3 and our reaction to it. That had nothing to do with a spirit of cooperation and it certainly did not breed mutual trust.</p>
<p class="contents">I am reminded of a story I once told Mr Liikanen. Mrs Dührkop, when she was the rapporteur, likened the harmonious relationships to a symphony being played on a grand piano. It reminded me of a famous comedy duo in the UK – Morecombe and Wise – where Eric Morecombe was playing a grand piano and making an awful noise and André Previn said to him “You’re playing all the wrong notes”, to which he replied “I’m playing all the right notes, not necessarily in the right order”. We have to get the right notes between the Council and the Parliament playing in the right order if we are to have this harmonious relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President-in-Office, you reminded us of those areas where we did get agreement in the trialogues, about the letters of amendment in the autumn, about the commitment appropriations in the Structural Funds and about what our clear priorities should be. You also said that the budget should have the same discipline as national budgets. We have always considered that this Parliament’s Committee on Budgets and Parliament itself are extremely prudent. They do not go out of their way to make problems in the budget or to waste taxpayers’ money.</p>
<p class="contents">Our problems are caused in the main in Member States, where 85% of EU money is actually administered and 85% of our problems occur. If we had more cooperation with the Member States we would not have as many problems. Also, there are many Member States’ national budgets which are running deficits. That is one thing we cannot do.</p>
<p class="contents">On the different categories, on Category 1 I would agree with the President-in-Office when she said that agricultural expenditure should be based on up-to-date facts. That is why we agreed on an ad hoc procedure; that is why we agreed on the letter of amendment in the autumn. But for the life of me I cannot see why you have actually made cuts in Category 1. If we are waiting to find out what the latest situation is, why have we made reductions in Category 1 already? It just seems to be an exercise of taking money out of the system because that is the thing to do to please the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Category 2, we may have the commitment on commitment appropriations but we certainly do not have the same understanding when it comes to payments. Taking EUR 1billion from payments, once again, is just a burden for the future. The Member States have to pay some time. It is no use trying to dodge the fact or hide it away. It will not go away. That money has to be paid for sometime. We would argue that now is the right time and that decision should not be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking at the reductions made in Category 3, there are many areas where we will disagree and agree to disagree.</p>
<p class="contents">In Category 4, the 10% across the board cut – I am now speaking for Parliament before it has decided this – I would assume is absolutely unacceptable. Yes, Kosovo is a priority; yes, we do want to make sure that funds are available for East Timor and earthquake victims in Turkey. But the way to do that is by a revision of the financial perspective. That will be our position, I am sure. Yes, we want a solution. We do not want confrontation between our two bodies but at the end of the day we want to make sure that development, other sections of Category 4 and external expenditure are not disadvantaged. If money cannot be spent then we will look at those areas where it may have to be reduced. But a 10% across the board cut is not the way to do it.</p>
<p class="contents">On Category 5, the sad part is that we still see no solutions being proposed by the Council on how to solve the problem of pensions within the institutions. I am sure my colleagues Mr Bourlanges and Mr Virrankoski will add to my comments. We look forward to our first reading next month when the Council will get a pretty good idea of our opinion of its draft budget.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a debate taking place between the Council and Parliament. As far as I know, the Council-in-Office is not currently involved with the appointment procedures. I think that this is a shame, because I would have been delighted to appoint Mrs Siimes. But this is not our role. Tomorrow we will be appointing the incoming Commission. I am also delighted to have this last opportunity to deal with Mr Liikanen in his present role, before the metamorphosis which will have taken him, the day after tomorrow to a new post. I would like to take the opportunity this debate has given to me to say that although our exchanges have sometimes been rather harsh, we have always appreciated the talent, seriousness and the extremely open and cordial nature which have characterised the way we have worked together.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I have to say that the Commission’s draft budget did not really impress us, and that we are disappointed with the Council’s budget proposal. The reason this draft failed to impress us is that it was brought in at a time when the Commission was not really in a position to make sound financial forecasts. This made its work appear somewhat unreal, particularly because it could not, and with good reason, absorb the crisis in Kosovo and its financial consequence and, finally, for reasons which do not strike us as being particularly satisfactory, because it refused to respond to the concerns expressed by Parliament on the issue of administrative reform. In our budgetary advice, we had asked for a progressive dismantling of the TAOs.</p>
<p class="contents">In our budgetary advice, we asked for a detailed evaluation of personnel requirements and of the capacity to act that the Commission thought it had with its current staffing level. We did not find you to be particularly enthusiastic on these two points.</p>
<p class="contents">We were disappointed Madam President, I shall not pretend otherwise, with the Council Budget. We found category 1 disappointing. We still do not understand why, for what purpose, with obligatory expenditure, you are enforcing massive reductions across the board. The argument given to us by certain representatives, according to which this is due to the changing monetary situation, seems to us, I must remind you, to be contrary or opposed to the very precise rules of our financial regulations. </p>
<p class="contents">Nor do we understand why, in category 2, you have reduced payment credits even though there might be several technical justifications for them.</p>
<p class="contents">In category 3, we can see clearly that although you may have performed a good job for the large programmes, which means all those which stopped at the co-decision stage, everything that concerns Parliament directly and specifically, on the other hand, you have sacrificed. You defend what is ours, you defend what belongs to both of us, but what belongs to us alone, you hold in contempt.</p>
<p class="contents">In category 4, you know the extent of the problem. You have tried to fit into this category a whole range of problems which do not fit: the “fishing” agreement on Morocco, and especially the enormous funds, estimated to stand at around 500 million for Kosovo, and that is without expanding the category any further. The result of this is that your proposal would be, as we say, robbing Peter to pay Paul – to sacrifice the priorities established by yesterday’s legislative and budgetary authorities for the sake of tomorrow’s priorities. We do not feel that this is a good policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In category 5, finally, we note a great reluctance to tackle the problem of pensions. We consider this to be a serious matter. We would also like to see a little more solidarity in supporting the much-needed changes to the Commission’s administrative structures. I think that, to sum up our complaint about your budget proposal, you seem to be simultaneously insulting the past, the present, and the future.</p>
<p class="contents">You are insulting the past, for the reasons I have just mentioned. As soon as you think that tomorrow’s priorities should be financed by sacrificing hitherto accepted priorities, you are acting unacceptably. We know, and you were quite right to remind us, that the Commission will have greater responsibilities in terms of foreign policy. It must fulfil these responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">You are insulting the present, because you are making no provision for the efforts necessary for credit payments.</p>
<p class="contents">You are insulting the future finally; by the way you are ignoring or treating indifferently the high stakes which await us in the areas of administrative reform and retirement.</p>
<p class="contents">So we will be having a constructive dialogue, Madam President. I have confidence in your ability to co-operate. But I want you to know that our dialogue will be difficult. We will not accept the interinstitutional agreement that we signed and ratified becoming a yoke around our neck. Co-operation, yes. The sacrifice of the European Union’s fundamental priorities, no. We will certainly ask you for a revision of the Financial Perspective whenever this proves necessary. </p>

At the same time I want to thank Commissioner Liikanen especially for his valuable co-operation. Your work with Parliament has been transparent, decent and honest.</p>
<p class="contents">My own maiden task relates to the administrative course of the year 2000 budget, which affects more institutions than the Commission and the Council. The combined budget for these institutions is EUR 1,288 million. This is a 3.66% increase on last year’s budget. The addition is remarkably large though it is within the framework of the currently valid agreement between official bodies. The budget of the European Parliament does exceed the share agreed by Parliament itself in accordance with the gentleman’s agreement, which is 20% of category 5, because it currently stands at 20.3%. This naturally means that some pressure for cuts is directed at Parliament’s budget in the hearing.</p>
<p class="contents">Recently, the European Parliament has observed great discipline in budgetary policy. In the staffing policy of the official bodies, great moderation has been observed, which meant that staff increases were less than in the previous five-year period. Between 1995 and 1999, Parliament’s staff increased by eleven people, and likewise, the staff of the Court of Justice increased by eleven people. The Court of Auditors received a considerable increase in resources in 1997, and it grew to have a total staff of 49 officials. The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as the Committee on Regional Policy increased their staff by ten people. This has been achieved by employing a deliberate staff policy and by redeployment of tasks. We therefore have a good inheritance which we should cherish.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a change is threatening this development, in which the EU is attempting to save taxpayers’ money. Different institutions are aiming to gain substantial increases in the number of posts. In connection with this, it must be stressed that the European Parliament is an important example. If the European Parliament attempts to increase its own staff considerably, this is a clear signal to other institutions. The same can be said concerning the promotion of grades. For this reason, the European Parliament has to create alignment in this budget hearing concerning the budgets for the next few years. Now it must be decided what kind of disciplined staffing policy the European Parliament wishes to follow, because it has quite a lot of authority in this matter. I want to stress that in leading the way for the other EU institutions, the European Parliament cannot evade its responsibility in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">My predecessor in this post, Edith Müller, drew attention to activity-based budgeting<span class="italic">.</span> Put concisely, Parliament directs money to official bodies for administration as a lump sum, and each official body can itself decide on the basis of its own unique organisation about the salary grades to be imposed and increases in those grades. I support this idea fully. The fact of the matter is that activity-based budgeting is the only sensible way of developing administration of staffing in the different institutions. It is not particularly sensible that the Committee on Budgetary Control and the President of the Council discuss the establishment of one C-grade when there are 1,776 C-grades in Parliament. It is much better to discuss allocations and grant them without analysing them in minute detail.</p>
<p class="contents">This point of view also accords with the report from the Group of Independent Experts. It emphasises the need for personal responsibility as well as economic responsibility at lower levels of the official machinery. The only means of stressing this responsibility for improving the administration as well as for improving the supervision of the financial management is to delegate this power and responsibility to lower levels. At the same time, we must improve one urgent problem in particular, namely the slow payment transactions of the EU. It is incongruous and objectionable that the EU needs longer payment times than Member States or enterprises whose budgets can be many times the size of the EU budget when compared.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of staffing policy must be regarded as an important part of EU policy. Activity based budgeting, the division of allocations and responsibility amongst lower levels of the administrative machinery, an efficient monitoring of monetary transactions as well as emphasising personal responsibility still require a lot of work. These issues must be clearly borne in mind when staffing legislation is reformed in the next few years. Therefore, and for this reason, it is possible to strongly agree with the Council’s demand that the Commission must set about preparing new regulations on staffing. With these thoughts in mind, I would like to consign the Council’s budget proposal to a reading in the European Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to focus on commenting closely on one issue, but an issue which is important, called category 4 or, put more precisely, Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first place, and as I said in my own speech, my view is that the question of providing the necessary finances for Kosovo will surely come to be one of the most central and dominant elements of the autumn budgetary process. The Council view has been that we make the creation of a reservation for Kosovo a priority. It is true that part of the funds allocated to category 4 have been cut, but the Council cuts expressly mean a reduction with regard to the Commission’s proposal when compared with 1999. In accordance with this view, most of the allocations belonging to category 4 have grown in comparison to the budget of the past year, and on the other hand, there are also points under category 4 to which no cuts at all have been applied. Within the framework of these regulations, Kosovo has been regarded as an absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the references made by both Mr Wynn and Mr Bourlanges concerning the agreement between official bodies and other financial means other than those newly allocated, I can state the view of the Council to be that it is possible to limit the reservation for Kosovo by means of a completely new allocation or by a transfer of allocations, but the Council is honouring the agreement between official bodies and all of its points. I have stated on many earlier occasions that we have to expect consistent estimates of the requirements concerning the rebuilding of Kosovo. Up to now the results of the estimates of what is required have been encouraging to the extent that the estimates of what is required for aid have fallen rather than increased as matters have progressed.</p>
<p class="contents">In the agreement between official bodies, it is stated that before the financial framework is exceeded, other ways of attending to finances will be clarified, and this the Council has done in accordance with its own views. On the basis of current information, we assume this to be sufficient, but we are, of course, ready to debate this issue in the light of better information because, as we all know, acceptance of the budget requires that both official bodies with budgetary control come to a consensus on the issues. As I stated at the outset, if we go down the path of effective co-operation and trust as well as a desire to seek mutual solutions, we will surely be able to reach the end of this process, or the year 2000 budget, together.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
