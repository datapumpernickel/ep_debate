Instead, I have the honour of presenting Parliament’s budget before the Commissioner presents the larger budget to us.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur for Parliament’s budget, I am in a position to submit a proposal to you which, in my view, has three main features. First, and I set great store by this, the budget which we have prepared for you is a highly economical one. Secondly, we have learned our lessons from the justified complaints of the Court of Auditors and the Committee on Budgetary Control, for which we are all to blame. Thirdly, and this is a particular matter of concern to me, we have strengthened the European Parliament as the institution which represents the interests of the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">What have we focused on in Parliament’s Budget 2001? I should like to outline this briefly with reference to five main points. First: in the area of buildings policy, and this is an extremely important point, we must draw the right conclusions from the objections raised by the Court of Auditors. In other words, first, we must make the remaining payments in Brussels as quickly as possible – and we are putting the conditions in place for this – so that we can reduce costs – that is particularly important to the taxpayer – and, secondly, we must solve the problem of Strasbourg, of this building here, in a way which does not give cause for complaint. Both are provided for by figures in the draft budget.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must also exercise extreme restraint in the area of staff policy in the coming year. We cannot allow Parliament’s staff numbers to increase exorbitantly just because there is some financial room for manoeuvre. And we must also solve the problem of promotion in the autumn in a way which is acceptable to all institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must prepare ourselves for the enlargement of the European Union and this applies to Parliament even more than to the other institutions. However, this does not mean – and this is a particularly important point – that we will decide as early as next year on which new languages we can offer in our interpreting services and therefore which countries will be allowed to become members of the European Union in the first round and which will not. That is the wrong way forward. It is not the job of the budget to make such fundamental political decisions. They need to be taken elsewhere; in other words, we do, of course, need to talk to language schools in the candidate countries and we must develop and build up programmes, but we must also, of course, be clear that we cannot anticipate decisions which need to be taken at a political level first.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to see the Commissioner is now with us. I have taken over your role insofar as we are discussing Parliament’s budget first and shall then move on to the Commission’s budget. No I do not want your job, only you can do it, the role reversal does not stretch quite that far!</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must take account of the increase in the responsibility of the European Parliament since the Amsterdam Treaty entered into force. The current Members of the European Parliament have more responsibility and more work in comparison with all their predecessors than ever before and naturally that also makes itself felt when it comes to preliminary work and technical equipment. I should like to thank everyone who supported me in this matter of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">My fifth point is that this increased responsibility must also find expression with regard to groups in the European Parliament. I want to see a political parliament fighting for just causes and that means widening the basis for group work; it also means – and I make no bones about the fact – limiting the official services of the European Parliament. That is the only way of achieving a parliament with an enduring public profile. I was pleased to note that the Bureau of the European Parliament is thinking along the same lines and that one of the vice-presidents from my group is preparing a report on the subject. That is the right way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I have taken note of the amendments to my report proposed by my fellow delegates with a great deal of interest. I hope you will understand that I can support very few, because they no longer follow, in fact, they abandon the line which I presented in the Committee on Budgets and which was adopted by a majority in the committee. We must prepare for enlargement, but we do not need to start recruiting interpreters from the candidate countries as early as next year.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the buildings policy must be considered with a view to enlargement, but I see no need to do so in the Budget 2001. We need to be a bit more realistic in our approach to the important question of enlargement. We moved into a new building in Brussels three years ago, we moved into a new building here in Strasbourg a year ago and if we tap the taxpayer on the shoulder again so soon after and say we need more buildings, more office space, he is only likely to agree to so much. We need to take account of that in our calculations. A budget with EUR 987 million is not very much in comparison to the budget of over EUR 90 billion which the Commissioner will propose shortly, but this is the taxpayers’ money and we must take our decision as the trustees of that money. The taxpayer expects us to take a prudent approach not only when we draw up the budget, but also when we implement and carry it out. We shall have to discuss this again in September during the first reading of this budget, once all the documents from the budget discharge procedure have been submitted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like today to thank the Bureau of the European Parliament, especially the vice-president responsible for budgetary questions, Gerhard Schmid, for their constructive cooperation, especially during the conciliation procedure between the Bureau and the Committee on Budgets. My thanks also go to the corresponding departments of Parliament’s administration for their prompt and conscientious preliminary work, without which this set of figures could never have been drawn up. However, I should also like to extend my special thanks to my colleagues in the Committee on Budgets for their fair cooperation. Bringing divergent opinions together to a consensus, mostly with too little time to spare, is not always easy. So my compliments to all my comrades-in-arms and finally, of course, a heartfelt thank-you to the secretarial staff of the Committee on Budgets for having prepared everything promptly and reliably in these difficult times. I think I can present you with a budget which has earned Parliament’s confidence.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Elles (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent work that he is doing for our House in terms of getting value for money out of our budget. It is not right that we should be expecting the Commission to do a whole range of things in putting their House and their budget in order unless we also take the same kinds of rigorous steps. The approach which has been taken is absolutely correct, not only in making sure that we do not simply give money away if we have a little spare in the budget, but also where we have asked the Secretary-General of Parliament to come forward with a number of reports: for example, in paragraph 6 of the resolution where we have asked the Secretary-General to look at and identify job needs in the same way as the Commission so that we can match job needs to the staff which we have available in the longer term. That quite clearly is a way of long-term planning which is very sensible at this stage of Parliament's life.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three things which I would like to emphasise in particular in this Parliament Budget 2001. The first is a plea from an individual parliamentarian that we should make sure that we have a date firmly fixed for the second network computer in our offices. It is a matter of frustration for many of us that our staff can access the net with their computers, of course, Parliament's computers, but if we as parliamentarians bring in our own computers, we do not have a place to plug them in and work effectively. It is important to have a date when this facility will be available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, on a matter of communication, under paragraph 21 of this resolution, I would like to draw the House's attention to the fact that we have on many occasions in these debates called for all Commission and Parliament offices in the Member States to work together within a European House framework by 1 January 2000. As we have now gone past that date and there are still one or two Member States, in particular my own, where Parliament and the Commission have different offices and where in terms of financing Parliament's office well over 70% of the expenditure goes on bricks and salaries, it does not leave much for communications. The sooner we can make sure that the image of the European Union is reflected by one European House, the better it will be.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point refers to the question of the implications for enlargement. I would like to support what our rapporteur has said that we cannot suddenly leap into beginning to authorise posts for preparing enlargement if a political decision has not yet been taken; all the more so, because in Parliament's estimates, as I have understood them, we have in front of us an assumption that we are going to have more languages as a result of enlargement. Yet we have had no debate in this House to know how we are going to handle not a limited enlargement but an extensive enlargement following the Helsinki Summit late last year, with potentially 12 or 13 new countries, that is 27 – 28 countries with over 20 different languages. How, Secretary-General, are we going to handle this if we do not have some thinking from the Administration as to where we are going to put them all? Are we going to have rooms which we are going to have to adjust for over 20 languages so that in every room where there is a discussion in this Parliament every person has the right to use their own language?</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that in the last Parliament a lot of work was done on this by Vice-President Cot. His report was never released to Members. We never saw it as a report on suggesting how the hub and spoke system should work – the relay system for interpretation – nor, indeed, did we really have any thinking about the freelancing possibilities with modern communications where we can dispatch a large amount of our translation material to people who are in the Member States, rather than recruiting a whole range of people to come and work in Luxembourg as fixed and permanent employees of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I strongly support the compromise which has been put forward by our rapporteur asking, by first reading, for the Secretary-General to come up with a strategy of how to handle the whole question of languages in Parliament and enlargement. I suspect the Commission might wish to do that as well, because it is a problem which rightly, in this amendment, relates to interinstitutional matters. I very much hope that the Socialist Group will change their mind, get their heads out of the sand and realise that this is the problem which we have to tackle and that it is better to do it now rather than later.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Gill (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, let me also start by congratulating Mr Ferber on a comprehensive estimate of Parliament's revenue and expenditure. I support the thrust of this report, which is in line with the policy of budgetary rigour, because the major challenges that this Chamber needs to address are greater accountability and transparency which will involve embracing institutional reform with vigour; secondly, the forthcoming enlargement of the Union and thirdly, a drive towards improving efficiency through effective budgetary control and better use of resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main priority has to be to explain to European citizens what we are doing, why we are doing it and how we are doing it. We must win the confidence of the European taxpayer and we can only do this by improving accountability through simplifying – not mystifying – the work of Parliament, by reducing jargon, by improving the process of approving legislation and improving the legislative machinery and by making a clear connection between what we do here and how it benefits the individual. We are going a long way towards achieving this transparency through the introduction of activity-based budgeting and the proposal we have in this report to put appropriations for political parties in separate budget lines will contribute significantly to achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">These virtues are all the more important as we move towards the challenge facing the EU at the moment of enlargement. We in the Socialist Group strongly believe that the European Parliament should be giving every encouragement to candidate countries in their preparation to joint the EU. I have the impression that there are those in this House who appear to be frustrating this process of enlargement by placing unnecessary obstacles in the way and often using spurious arguments to limit the preparation for enlargement: for example, the rejection of the proposal to fill the 35 vacant posts in the language reserve between 2001 and 2002. The reason given, and also outlined by my colleague Mr Elles, is that we believe that this will pre-empt discussions with accession states. Do we seriously believe that this small step will influence all the institutions as to which countries are in the first tranche and which are in the second tranche? Do we really believe that by committing less than half a per cent of Parliament's language budget the political decision will be made and taken out of our control? I am somewhat confused and if I recall correctly, the rapporteur agreed previously and argued vigorously for setting up an interinstitutional recruitment agency in his last report.</p>
<p class="contents">What is the point of approving a joint operation whilst at the same time we are preventing any recruitment of people? I strongly favour planning properly for enlargement because experience has shown that there is a long lead-in time for the training of interpreters and translators. It is necessary if the admission of the new Member States into the Institution is to run smoothly from a language point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I agree that we should not at any stage prejudice political decisions which have to be taken at a later date. On the other hand, we should avoid giving out discouraging messages to the applicant countries that are currently making great efforts to get themselves in shape to join the EU. I reiterate that we should not pre-empt any political decisions to be taken on enlargement. We need to plan and to be imaginative and to be creative as to how we prepare for enlargement because nothing will be more damaging to the EU if we make a bad job of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">What we also need to do is have a vigorous implementation of reform to prepare for enlargement. Very recently the President of the European Court of Justice warned that it would be unable to cope with enlargement of the EU. The average time that it takes for a case to be heard has risen from 17 months in 1988 to 23 months last year. That is a very long wait. What we need to do is to have reforms, not just in the areas of staffing and procedures, but we also need to have a new approach in terms of buildings policy. It is vital that the preparations are made during the coming financial year to ensure that Parliament's buildings are able to accommodate new Member States of an enlarged EU. It is also important for provision to be made to set up information offices in the countries which have applied to join the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">It is widely acknowledged that the systems that we have at the moment were set up for the EU when we only had 6 Members and they are creaking at the edges in terms of the Union of 15 Members. How are they possibly going to be effective with 25 Members? It is important that we plan and prepare.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a relatively new Member of Parliament and while I see a lot of good work going on in the committees, I am acutely aware that as a result of the new responsibilities in the Treaty of Amsterdam there is a need not just for individual support for Members but also scientific support for committees. Since the Treaty of Amsterdam came into force Parliament's workload has increased very significantly and it is important that this is taken into account in this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's Work Programme now incorporates a very large number of codecision procedures and these procedures have significantly increased our workload. If we are to convince the people of the EU of the importance of the European Parliament's work and persuade them to take it more seriously, we need to improve our systems of working. That is why I welcome the report's emphasis on the common statute for Members and assistants and I hope that we can adopt this as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been disappointed by some aspects of the report's focus. It focuses too much on the minutiae of detail in sometimes preventing administrative changes in staffing and frustrating strategic vision. I am concerned at the wisdom of putting 30% of the appropriation into the reserve for security services as the rapporteur proposes. There is a contradiction in the rapporteur's argument. He has always focused on outsourcing of Parliament's services. Here we have an example of outsourcing that is not working. Rather than reducing the budget we should be looking at how we improve security services, and the question we should be asking is: should we have our own security services or should we be retendering it rather than just reducing the budget?</p>
<p class="contents">I am also disappointed that the report ignores one of the biggest inefficiencies we have. Members of the European Parliament are the only parliamentarians who have no say in the location of their seat. A seat on three sites is the most incredible waste of time, money, travel and transport. Surely, when we are looking at budgetary rigour we have the right to address this issue because until we do so the general public will be confused about what we are doing in so many places. It also confuses the roles of the organisation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Parliament Budget is essentially an administrative budget, since wage costs constitute the largest item of expenditure. We are currently experiencing a significant period of change in administration, as we are aiming to introduce activity-based budgeting, to emphasise greater personal accountability and to improve the reallocation of resources. This is why, last year, Parliament approved an appropriation of EUR 300 000 for this year’s budget for the investigation of the efficiency and improvement needs of parliamentary administration.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is why it is somewhat surprising that already at this early stage, i.e. before the investigation has even started, important decisions are being made on administrative development. In the Budget, appropriations for wages are being increased by an enormous 12.2 %. This increase is so huge that no other institution could even contemplate an increase of administrative costs of this magnitude. Already, at this early stage, the intention is to spend this increase on the creation of 33 new posts and, apparently, 12 more will be created as a result of the amendment by the Bureau. For the sake of comparison, I would like to refer to the 1995-1999 period, during which Parliament established a total of only 11 new official posts. It is worthy of special mention that in this proposal, a new post is even being created for the Financial Control Department, despite the intention to abandon prior inspection altogether. In addition, the Budget contains a significant number of new staff promotions. Such being the case, I cannot agree with those who claim that a policy of budgetary discipline has been observed in the drafting of this Budget. On the contrary, this Budget is uncommonly slack, and this will make it difficult to gain the approval of the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it is necessary in this context to address the issue of the policy of the European Parliament in its capacity as an employer. Administrative reform, activity-based budgeting and downward delegation of accountability require consultation with the staff. Reallocation of resources is necessary, and consequently also reform of staffing regulations. Thus it would have been proper to save for the future such tools and opportunities for negotiation, with which these reforms are supposed to be furthered, and to refrain from granting new benefits before there has even been an opportunity to negotiate comparable administrative reforms with the staff.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Ferber’s report does not just contain political aspects but is in fact largely composed of administrative aspects. I will start by quoting and commenting on a number of political statements. </p>
<p class="contents">My group wholeheartedly agrees with the line taken in the report that the Council and Parliament should draft a statute in the short term and should do this in joint cooperation. They should compile a statute for the Members of the European Parliament, and, independently of that, a statute for the Member’s assistants. We support this and hope that it can be brought to a conclusion during the course of this year. </p>
<p class="contents">The report also contains a political comment regarding the separate budget lines required for the parliamentary groups on the one hand and the European political parties on the other. We must avoid hidden subsidies for European political parties at all costs. We all know that it will be some time before a statute is drawn up for the European political parties and I welcome the fact that, in the meantime, the Secretary-General has been asked to establish transparency in the use of appropriations by the parliamentary groups and the political parties. </p>
<p class="contents">Quite apart from this, the report also covers many administrative aspects. For example, we have been asked to pass judgement on the fact that the Directorate for Committees and Delegations must comprise five A posts, two B posts and one C post, and that one A post and two B posts must be added to the Directorate-General for Personnel. It is not because I am new, I think, that I have great difficulty in passing judgement on this. In my opinion, it is mainly up to a manager to take responsibility for the precise detail of personnel policy. It is also very difficult for the groups if it is decided in the plenary how many additional posts are to be created within the political groups. Surely, a great deal depends on the organisation of your group and maybe not every group wants to work in exactly the same way. I think that we should really re-think the system. I understand that during the reform of Parliament, consideration will also be given to allowing groups to take responsibility for their own affairs and I wholeheartedly support this. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to comment briefly on the support which has been requested for the parliamentarians. We have agreed that a study will be carried out which will also be linked in with a study commissioned by Mr Rothley into what exactly it is that the parliamentarians need in the way of support for their work. I struggle somewhat with the fact that we are running ahead of this study’s conclusions because we do not give our verdict on the Bureau’s conclusion in Mr Ferber’s report. The Bureau concludes that expenses for assistants should be increased by 20%. In failing to pass judgement on this, we are giving the impression that we have accepted it. I am not against this increase, in principle. What I do object to, however, is running ahead of the report and I am also opposed to it because I am sure that in September, it will transpire that we will need to prioritise various issues. For example, the rent we pay for the buildings may increase. We will need to decide whether we want to inject more funding into other institutions in preparation for enlargement. We will no doubt return to these points of criticism in September when we will have the precise figures in front of us. As such, it is not really a criticism but I do object to running ahead of a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Perhaps this is due to the fact that the rapporteur is a member of her own group and, for once, she is therefore confining herself to making observations rather than sending a letter. I find this rather strange, but perhaps she has not yet said her last word. We shall see, in time.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to say is quite simply this: the situation is nonetheless rather surprising. On the one hand, we have engaged in a policy of rigour resulting in all our budgets and discharges being obstructed by a Parliament that is rigorous to the extent of obstructing discharge to the Commission, and even obstructing discharge to the European Parliament itself, out of fear of problems, lack of endorsement or money wasting attributable to the duties of officials who are required to shuttle back and forth between Luxembourg and Brussels, costing the taxpayer a fortune.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet on the other hand, in the Ferber report, Members of Parliament are awarding themselves fortunes. We are awarding ourselves a second computer, claiming that one is not enough. We are awarding ourselves a 20% pay rise from a zero-growth budget. We are awarding ourselves a 20% increase to the budget heading for funding for our assistants because we are more than anything afraid that the rules will stipulate that this contract will have to be accompanied by a statute which would specifically require welfare contributions to be paid, and so, as insurance against the worst case scenario, we are increasing this line by 20%.</p>
<p class="contents">After checking up, I have not found a single budget item in the Community, whether in the field of humanitarian aid, research, or agricultural expenditure where there are plans for an increase. Moreover, generally speaking, the objective is to reduce the budget. But not in this case! Within the European Parliament a second computer is being awarded, 20% additional expenses and, as the Court of Auditors was particularly tough on the political groups, a paragraph is included, which, I quote, “Underlines emphatically the increased workload and the particular responsibilities of the political groups.”</p>
<p class="contents">This paragraph does Parliament no credit. If we adopt an attitude, we cannot express any indignation at waste while at the same time putting forward a budget of this type. On behalf of the radicals in this House, I must inform you that I shall be voting against Mr Ferber’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are in agreement and we are very happy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the rapporteur, in drawing up this draft budget for 2001, has been rigorous, has made optimum use of resources and has, at the same time, been imaginative and looked to the future. We congratulate him wholeheartedly.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, we are talking about a European Parliament for the 21st century, when we will have to face three fundamental challenges. We will have to respond to the MEPs’ new obligations, as laid down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, incorporate new technologies into our work and react immediately to the huge administrative, organisational and political obligations presented by enlargement of the European Union. These three challenges faced by the European Parliament should be set in a context of great budgetary rigour and complete transparency in the use of public funds.</p>
<p class="contents">We must consider – and the rapporteur has done this – what kind of Parliament we want in the future. Do we want a more administrative and bureaucratic Parliament or do we want a more political one? Do we want a European Parliament that is centralised or do we want one which is compatible with a European Union which is becoming increasingly federalised but at the same time more subject to subsidiarity and decentralisation?</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – and I agree with him on this – that the rapporteur wants a Parliament that treats the MEPs’ political work, both in Strasbourg and in Brussels, as well as in their individual political constituencies, as a priority. In this case it is necessary, as he says, for there to be new information points, new IT resources and new staff – if necessary – to help MEPs carry out their bureaucratic tasks. I hope that in September new appropriations will be provided for these lines.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that Mr Ferber has reacted to the report of the Court of Auditors on the funding of the political groups. An independent budget line will allow us to present a clearer and more transparent public image until we finally have a statute for the European political parties. Let us not forget that these parties are the cornerstone of European democracy and there must be no doubts as to whether they are being funded in the correct manner.</p>
<p class="contents">We fully agree with the rapporteur’s view concerning the linguistic staff necessary for enlargement. We must initiate the preparatory administrative measures. Six new countries – with at least five new languages – in 2004 means that we will have to make a great effort to adapt. In order to fill these vacancies, we will need to know the exact order in which the candidate countries will join the Union, and that is something that cannot happen now or in this budget.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support all Mr Ferber’s amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have enjoyed extremely positive collaboration over recent weeks and months, cooperation marked by the fact that we expressed our opinions in no uncertain terms on the points where we diverged widely, but when you can reach a common line, then that is the path you should take.</p>
<p class="contents">The challenge which faces us has been described. One can in fact do no more than repeat it. In the wake of Amsterdam – and I say this now in anticipation of what is yet to come in relation to this Parliament – we must reconcile the powers which Parliament now has with its potential, because at present they do not stand in a very balanced ratio. We must ensure that we can achieve equality in arms with the other legislative authority, namely the Council, both in respect of the scientific service and scientific research. We cannot allow the potential of this democratic and directly-elected Parliament to lag behind what the Council can do. If we take our work seriously, if we take ourselves seriously, we must operate under the same conditions so that we really can stand up for ourselves. There is no point in the President of our Parliament just putting her mark at the bottom of the page. That is not enough; it is the work beforehand which is crucial and it needs to be carried out seriously and it needs to be carried out well. In this respect it is both right and important – and I expressly disagree with Mr Dell'Alba here – that we prepare ourselves properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can there be any question of exorbitant cost increases now. Mr Dell'Alba knows full well that, thanks to a clever buildings policy – let there be no mistake about that – we have been able to release considerable funds over recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">Having scrimped and saved this money ourselves, we then need to use it to good purpose. To good purpose means improving the potential and capabilities of this Parliament. We are still within the 20% margin which we set ourselves and we are keeping to it. At no point do we go over Parliament’s 20% share of administrative costs. I think that shows that our approach is very serious here and we do not want to promise any cloud cuckoo land.</p>
<p class="contents">Another challenge before us – admittedly we have been pushed into action here by official discussions in various quarters – is the need to bring some transparency into this Parliament. We shall accept this responsibility and take up this challenge. Not because we are afraid of being forced to do so. No, we want the public to know that we have nothing to hide here. We are endeavouring to create a serious basis for what we do here, i.e. financing for the groups, and we want a set of rules so that the European political parties and party organisations can raise funds. You cannot call for this sort of development at European level without financing the basis commensurately, that is quite right. The basis must be clearly visible so that our citizens know what money is going where. We shall do everything we can to make progress on this point and to bring more transparency into the process, so that everyone can see what money is going where and can judge if it is appropriate or unsuitable and criticism can then be levied where criticism is needed. And it is needed. However, we must head off criticism on procedural grounds or because we have accommodated certain sums under various budget headings. Transparency is needed here and, as we said last year during the budget debates, we have our work cut out here.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment now on the question of enlargement, because that is the only point on which we disagree with Mr Ferber and, above all, with our colleagues in the PPE group. What worries me here is that Mr Stoiber’s visit to your group last week had a greater impact than we all feared. My next comment is addressed to my honourable friend, Mr Pöttering: it was you who said at a European Union conference “onwards and upwards”, and that enlargement should be speeded up for political reasons, because we cannot afford to put it on the back burner. But, when we are specifically called upon to move forwards, we should do so decisively. I know that the issue of when and how enlargement should take place can be the stuff of first-rate political debate, a debate which could set the axe at the very roots and I call for extreme caution here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as specific preparations are concerned, we need, for example, to make preparations for more buildings. And if you do not start looking for buildings, for example in the candidate countries, until things are so far down the road, you will be faced with prices which make your hair turn grey. So we need to get our act together and make preparations which allow for sound financial management. As far as preparing for new languages is concerned, if you read the Cot report, called for by the honourable Member of your group, Mr Elles, you will see that we shall have an additional 460 language combinations in the future. According to one estimate, this will mean another 500 translators and interpreters. Do you expect us to believe that you are suddenly going to jump up like a jack in the box with a list of people who are highly specialised in Estonian, Latvian, Czech, in all these new languages which we shall have? No, preparations need to be made now. And in order to avoid falling into the trap, as Mr Ferber rightly explained, of taking administrative decisions which anticipate political developments, we must, of course, ensure during the course of the year that we have a precise discussion on the distribution of these posts between the various languages. We shall support the release of the Cot report – that is one part of Mr Elles’ motion. We are in favour of discussing this during the course of the year, but we are expressly against saying as of now that we refuse to fill the 35 posts. That would be frivolous and would send completely the wrong signal to the Member States and to the people who hope to become an integral part of the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a lot in this report which has been well thought-out and which it is very easy indeed to support. I want to talk about an issue which, in the long term, will be very important for Parliament and for the EU as a whole and which many Members have already touched upon here today, namely the language question. </p>
<p class="contents">Rarely perhaps is the linguistic diversity of Europe seen so incredibly clearly as in a debate in this Chamber in which eleven different languages are being interpreted between. Naturally, this is expensive and time-consuming. Yet it has been assumed without question, throughout the history of the EU, that whoever is present here should be able, if at all possible, to speak their own language. </p>
<p class="contents">A good deal in the report under discussion is based on the assumption that the EU will be enlarged by six new Member States in 2004. What is more, that may be an underestimate. A few days ago, the Commission said it was its own objective to be able to welcome ten new Member States by the year 2005. I am among those for whom the greatest challenge for the EU is an enlargement whose ultimate goal is the reunification of a Europe which has always been divided by artificial borders. I nonetheless believe that it is more realistic to proceed on the basis of the somewhat lower figure quoted in the report by the Committee on Budgets. Even that figure is awfully large, bearing in mind the number of new languages involved. </p>
<p class="contents">Proceeding on the basis that there will be “5+1 countries” in the first round of negotiations – a lot can obviously happen during the next few years, but these six countries nonetheless have a two-year head start in terms of the negotiations – this means that five new official languages will be added to the eleven we already have at present. There is no question of these newly welcomed countries and their languages being treated any differently from the way in which the existing Member States are treated. It must equally go without saying that Hungarian, Polish or Estonian Members of this Parliament should be able to speak their own languages, just as we existing Members are entitled to speak ours. Nor can we put ourselves in a situation whereby a country with access to trained interpreters and translators can become a Member State of the EU, while another country which does not have professionals of these kinds cannot. That is precisely why it is so important that the issue is highlighted right now. That is what the rapporteur is doing, and I think it is excellent. We must not, in a few years’ time, find ourselves in a situation in which the issue has still not been resolved. </p>
<p class="contents">We should also be clear about the fact that things are happening very quickly right now. We are dealing with countries which are developing very rapidly, which means that we too must act quickly in order to have settled the language question by the time these countries join the Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These types of reports are never easy and he has done a good job. My only criticism is that Amendments Nos 4 and 5 should have been tabled in someone else's name for the PPE Group. By saying that I am being consistent: I said the same to Mrs Müller in the Green Group when she did that. I shall explain why shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament demands that the Commission and the other institutions are prudent with taxpayers' money, and we think the same should apply to the European Parliament. As chairman of this committee, I have discovered that your loyalties are spread very wide. I have a loyalty to the committee, and when the committee takes a decision I feel duty-bound to defend that decision. I have a loyalty to the rapporteur, and that is why I have made the comments before because the rapporteur should reflect the opinions of the committee. I also have a loyalty to my political group which has given me this speaking time. This sometimes leaves me bereft of my own loyalties to myself and what I want to say. I was somewhat sympathetic to what Mr Dell'Alba was saying because we have to be careful of criticising everybody else if, at the same time, we are giving the impression that we are ignoring that prudency and just doing what we want to do. I am not saying that we have done that. However, if that is the impression we are going to give, we have to be very careful and realise the consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, the Ferber report has tried to balance the needs of Parliament coming into a new millennium – new needs, enlargement on the horizon – and to make it function effectively. Not all the decisions will be taken when we vote this report through. The first reading will be time when the final decisions are taken, and cognisance has been taken of that.</p>
<p class="contents">When they see a budget of EUR 965m, the newspapers will easily deduce that is over EUR 1.5m per Member. The British newspapers will be full of GBP 1m per MEP – that is what they cost!</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are trying to reduce those costs, especially on buildings. If people would look at what is being done with the buildings: we are trying to reduce the payments over the shortest possible time, thereby reducing the total burden on Parliament's budget. One only has to look at paragraphs 15 to 18 to see how serious we are about the buildings policy. The policy of ramassage has been a great success for this Parliament. What we have done with the Belliard building may not be ideal but at least it is a step in the right direction, and it is now off our backs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of the great problems in our institution is that we have no statute for Members, assistants or political parties. What is being proposed is to try to make some headway towards resolving those factors.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has to be this way, as we have been through a tricky time, and there are permanent tensions and glaring contradictions. It seems that we expect everything and, at the same time, we expect nothing at all from the European Union’s priorities, as we can see from the level of budgetary transposition – or lack thereof. It is our ability to take advantage of something that could potentially transform tensions and to reduce the amount of contradictions which will make the difference between the stagnation and the consequent decline of the project and the dynamism that its implementation requires.</p>
<p class="contents">Have the competences of the European Parliament increased substantially with the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam and the consequent extension of the codecision procedure to further areas of policy, for example? If that is the case, we would have to provide Members of the House with a greater ability to carry out their mandate, more and better information and we would have to ensure that the political groups are more accountable and that the staff of the European Parliament is more efficient. Does enlargement require subtle changes in the membership and functioning of this Parliament? If it does, then we need to prepare for them, anticipate the challenges and how to respond to them and not fall into a situation of ‘wait and see’, which would leave us trailing in the wake of events that we can neither prevent nor influence.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to the European Union as a whole. We are at a turning point and, now that we have reached this point, nothing will be the same as it was before and things will not remain as they are now. Now that economic and monetary union has been achieved, the euro cannot be a point of arrival but a starting point, which, in time, will bring about and require further changes. Now that the process of enlargement has been launched, fundamental changes are required as well as renewed ambition. The need to make the economic sphere correspond to the political sphere is becoming increasingly clear. We are swinging between deepening and dilution, solidarity and selfishness, decisiveness and delay, coherence and contradiction and convergence and divergence. By increasing the influence of core principles, amongst which I would highlight subsidiarity and social and economic cohesion, we will be able to launch and see through new initiatives. I congratulate Mr Ferber on the care he has taken over this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, David (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as other colleagues have said, dealing with Amsterdam and preparing for enlargement are major challenges for this institution.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned – and we should be very clear about this – new challenges require new resources. As the rapporteur has indicated, you start by looking at existing resources and see where staff and resources which are under-utilised or no longer appropriate can be transferred.</p>
<p class="contents">Once that has been done, in the new situation in which the European Parliament finds itself, there is no alternative but to expand our budget. I hear what Mr Wynn, the chairman of the committee, has said about prudence. Prudence is in danger of becoming a false goddess: if we put too much emphasis on prudence it will be at the expense of the efficiency and the effectiveness of this Institution. There is a delicate balance to be struck, and I know that in his report the rapporteur has striven towards it.</p>
<p class="contents">I broadly welcome Mr Ferber's report. However, there are three fronts to which Parliament needs to pay more attention between now and September. The first, as other colleagues have mentioned, is the issue of languages. I had the honour of sitting on Mr Cot's working group on multilingualism. Frankly, if this institution wishes to continue to practise multilingualism – and perhaps that is a debate we should have – there is <span class="italic">no</span> alternative but to start recruiting now. If we leave it any longer, once we start enlargement we will not be in a position to continue multilingualism. The decision will be taken for us. We were almost in that position with Finnish at the last enlargement. As Members will notice, the Finnish interpreters do a good job speaking English and other languages because we could not recruit Finnish-speaking English interpreters. We shall find ourselves in that position again come the next enlargement unless we take hard decisions now. So I want Parliament to rethink the 35 language posts.</p>
<p class="contents">The second area where we still have much to do as an Institution is informatics. We have come a long way, but there are further benefits to be obtained from informatics. In particular the President of the Bureau is looking at how to reach a position where every Member has a portable computer with access to the European Parliament's computer system so that, no matter where they are in the world, they can get their own committee reports, agendas and so on. That does not require a massive increase in investment but it does require new money – an increase in Parliament's resources.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, again, something I have heard you, Mr President, talk about: the issue of legal advice. The new Amsterdam situation means that when we pass amendments and resolutions in this Chamber we have to be more aware of the legal consequences as well as the political consequences of what we are deciding. We need to enhance the legal advice we have as a Parliament to support us through the conciliation and other procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to make it clear that I am not asking Parliament to spend massive amounts of new money. However, to spend one or two per cent more in order to ensure that we remain effective is worth it, and we should look at prudence in the context of the wider demands of this Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course it is not the Commission’s job to evaluate individual proposals, but I would like to welcome the fact that Parliament is endeavouring to ensure that, in future, the buildings policy will reduce the burden on the budget from interest payments. Of course, I also welcome, from the point of view of interinstitutional relations, that your proposal has remained, as it were, within category 5 of the agreement. The agreement makes provision here for this joint estimate of personnel and administrative costs to be distributed between the institutions on the basis of a specific ratio and you have based your proposals on that distribution. I think that again shows that many aspects of the financial perspectives facilitate work and planning, especially where firm agreements are concluded between the institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, what is important is that you have paid a great deal of attention in your report to the question of enlargement and staff policy in the translating and interpreting sector and, of course, the question of what measures are taken here is a highly political one. More importantly, preparations do, of course, have to be made and you have pointed out – even though the question looks somewhat different from the point of view of the individual institutions – that it should be a matter of interinstitutional concern to address the subject and find a solution. In this respect, congratulations once again on your report, especially on the fact that the report on the Budget 2001 looks beyond the Budget 2001. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
