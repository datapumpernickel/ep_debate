Intrastat, the statistical collection system on the transport of goods, is met with little appreciation by industry, as the latter is weighed down by the red-tape involved. Indeed, not only does industry need to provide data on the products in question, it is also required to provide information which does not fall within the remit of the companies directly involved in the transaction but within that of the transport companies which they use. </p>
<p class="contents">The basic regulation stipulates that providers of statistical information shall make use of the combined nomenclature, which comprises more than 10 500 entries, in order to classify goods. This combined nomenclature is a tariff and statistics nomenclature which is used for the trade between Member States and that with third countries. </p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the SLIM Initiative, the simplification of Intrastat has been set up as a trial project. The SLIM Intrastat working party has proposed to simplify this nomenclature and better tailor it to the real needs of the user without adversely affecting the link with the nomenclature for the transport of goods with third countries, or the connection with other statistical nomenclatures. </p>
<p class="contents">In fact, this proposal was carried by representatives of professional organisations and by companies alike because they themselves have contributed to the effect of the recommendations. Indeed, the simplification must first and foremost benefit small and medium-sized companies. </p>
<p class="contents">The number of codes is restricted and, as such, the classification and codification of goods by companies is simplified without them needing to take any special measures. This proposal, along with all other measures to simplify the system, can only benefit industry. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Community could take the initiative here and propose at international level that the set-up of the harmonised system be reviewed and better tailored to the needs of international trade in the 21st century. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to inform you that a tripartite consultation, held over the course of three meetings by the European Parliament delegation, finally led to a compromise during the meeting of the Conciliation Committee. The report was adopted unanimously without amendments within the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. I would, accordingly, be indebted to the MEPs if they were to cast a unanimous vote on this tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We entirely support his proposal to push this through without any amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Why are we supporting this so strongly? Anything in today's world that is going to simplify life for businesses without, as Mr Beysen points out, affecting some of the key business statistical information they need to plan their businesses has to be welcome. As someone who has founded and started small businesses himself, it is a very frustrating thing when you are trying to manage a business to be asked to fill in statistical returns, taking resources from your business that you could well be using on developing new sales and moving your business forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Reading Mr Beysen's report, the history of this proposal is rather depressing. I was not in the last Parliament, and it is clear that Parliament has put a lot of work into this, but it has taken three years to get to the point where we are now. It may well be that Mr Beysen's report hides a deceptively complex set of variables that the Commission has had to deal with. Nevertheless, it seems to me that if we are going to make serious progress on slimming down legislation, making the environment for small businesses better – and that after all is an aim of the Lisbon Summit, we have seen that – we must get better at approaching these sort of projects.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I would like you to assure us this evening that you are making a serious effort to move more quickly in this area; and also, given the benefits of new technology moving forward in this area, with many more business-to-business transactions being handled electronically, more business-to-government transactions being handled electronically, that you are planning to exploit that technology in such a way that statistics can in future be collected automatically. Both more reliably and automatically and also, as Mr Beysen says, "internationally as well".</p>
<p class="contents">The final area, Commissioner, is to look at ways in which we can work with you as a Parliament to speed up the approval of the process. Surely it should not be taking this amount of time to work on largely technical areas. Mr Beysen was talking about the way that Parliament has been working internationally on some of these issues. Surely we should be setting our own house in order first. If you want a special committee within the Internal Market Committee to look at small business issues, simplification issues and statistical issues, then ask us to work with you and for heaven's sake let us not have to consider these proposals again when we had to wait three years to make serious inroads into what ought to be a comparatively simple area of progress.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the reasons we should take this advice is that it was hard enough to reach this modest compromise in the Council as it was, and we would not wish to jeopardise it. That does not mean, however, that we can actually be satisfied with this compromise; it is only the first step along the way.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">If you ask companies what they think of the EU internal market, more often than not you hear people say that they are positive about everything on the whole, that it is an OK thing as far as they are concerned. There are two problem areas. One concerns the disparities in VAT levels and the other relates to the statistics and numerous forms that have to be filled out. We are well aware that business people like to whinge; it goes with the territory. But when you hear these comments in Austria, of all places, a country that is more than a little resourceful when it comes to forms and bureaucratic requirements, and which found itself to be even more snowed under after joining the European Union, it really makes you think.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I can cite examples of companies that have to report the official registration number of lorries they are expecting to collect goods as much as three to four weeks prior to their anticipated arrival. The next important step is to raise the simplification threshold to a minimum of EUR 200 000. The Commission was asked to examine this step via the Council Decision. We also know from past experience that, in principle, the Commission is very much in favour of taking this step. Therefore, might I ask Commissioner Solbes Mira what initiatives we can expect the Commission to come up with and will there be another proposal to this effect? Likewise, more simplification measures are called for within the framework of the SLIM 2 project.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In 1997, the Commission presented proposals for the simplification of the basic regulations for the Intrastat system, reducing the list of variables to be introduced into declarations and also simplifying the nomenclature of the products used for exchanges.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that each time a simplification of this type is produced, we have a debate between, on the one hand, the necessary reduction in administrative charges to reduce the cost to companies and, on the other, the lack of information resulting from reducing this information.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, the Council reached an agreement on the basis of the Commission’s proposals by amending them, and Parliament is reaching a solution which in our view is an intelligent and practical way to partially resolve this contradiction.</p>
<p class="contents">We are happy to accept Parliament’s proposal and we believe that the idea of reducing the number of products exchanged to ten, only indicating the country of origin or destination of the products and their value, may be a good way of resolving the difficulties which I referred to earlier.</p>
<p class="contents">You also ask us to analyse the change of threshold from EUR 100 000 to EUR 200 000, which would exclude a greater number of companies from the obligation to present statistical declarations.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said before, we consider the work of Parliament’s committee to be excellent and we therefore support and accept it totally. I would like to congratulate them on their work.</p>
<p class="contents">However, you have raised a couple of issues. Firstly, Mr Harbour asks how the process can be speeded up. The Commission is not concern about the delay. We are prepared to accelerate the process as far as possible and we are interested in reducing the cost to companies to a minimum. Nevertheless, we must recognise that we have two problems which we must address in a different way.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the selection of the ten most relevant products for the purposes of the declaration, that will have to be done by means of the normal comitology procedures. However, we hope that excessive time will not be required in order to arrive at these results.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the increase in the threshold from EUR 100 000 to EUR 200 000 is a problem which requires the necessary cooperation of the Member States, which is already under way, and as soon as we have the opinions of the different Member States, we will be able to make the specific proposal which will allow us to apply this increased exemption.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mrs Berger asks us which additional initiatives we are going to take. You have said correctly that this is a first step for us. We believe that it is essential to go further with this process of simplification.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore state that we are committed – as we have already said publicly – to continuing with the SLIM and Intrastat initiatives and, above all, with the Edicom actions in favour of companies, bearing in mind that the Council has approved the report on information needs which are essential for economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot give you a specific date for the new proposals, but I can assure you that we are working on them and that Parliament and the Council will receive the new proposals from the Commission as soon as we have the basic information from the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
