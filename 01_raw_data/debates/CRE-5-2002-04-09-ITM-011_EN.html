<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Florenz (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, as rapporteur I regret the fact that a relatively interesting report on the issue of how electronic scrap is to be recycled in Europe in future is being debated in the middle of the night.</p>
<p class="contents">When I tell people in my constituency at home that we discuss subjects like this at anything up to midnight, nobody believes me. But the administration cannot seem to find any other solution. I am often asked why we need a directive of this kind. Do we need yet another European law to address the issue of electronic scrap? The answer is relatively simple. We have seven to eight million tonnes of scrap in the European Community every year, and every year there is an extra million tonnes. That alone is sufficient for us to acknowledge that we are really not just talking about scrap here, but about recyclable material which future generations should not be deprived of, and which should certainly not be dumped on landfill sites.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to the European Parliament's first request. In the course of our various deliberations and committee decisions, we have written a ban on disposable equipment into the directive, which should send a message to the European public that an electric shaver should no longer be thrown into the dustbin, but that it should be collected separately, because it is recyclable. The EU Member States, and above all my own country, have very limited ambitions in this area and believe that it is not necessary to make such demands of the Member States and of Europe's citizens. The Member States have an equally low level of commitment as regards what collection targets we should aim for in future. The Member States believe that an optional collection rate of 4 kg is the right way to go. I can only say this: why should a Parliament like ours bother with this report if the end result is not binding and is actually lower than the targets already being achieved? Because the United Kingdom, believe it or not, is already achieving far more than we are calling for, namely a binding 6 kg collection rate.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point here is of course who meets the costs. Opinions on that are divided in this House as well. I believe that the Commission originally brought forward a very good proposal, which it unfortunately subsequently departed from again. With regard to costs, there are two models, one for historical waste and another for new equipment. As far as historical waste is concerned, the costs should be borne collectively, because this can no longer be achieved individually. You know that there are a great many orphan products; there are non-branded products and it is no longer possible to allocate precisely those products. That is why collective financing is needed here.</p>
<p class="contents">However, up to the point of collection, for example in the city centre, the costs are to be borne by the companies. There are a few individual Members of this House who believe that in future even a toothbrush should be collected by the producers from the user's bathroom. I am of course exaggerating somewhat, but I want to make it clear that enormous costs are involved here: exactly 50% of the costs are incurred between the front door and the collection point. I am convinced that in many cases this will impose a heavy burden on medium-sized companies throughout Europe. That is why I believe that in future the costs borne by companies should be from the collection point and not from the front door.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of collective historical waste, we have proposed an alternative form of cost allocation with the voluntary visible fee for companies. That also helps to answer the question of whether there will be any retroactive effect in this area. Particularly in cases where costs are borne collectively, and are separately identified, this issue of retroactivity, which we debated so passionately in this House when we were discussing the end-of-life vehicle directive, might be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the financing of new products, as I see it, and as this House in general sees it, we are looking at individual cost allocation. There are many good reasons for doing that, and in fact that is where there is scope for innovation and motivation, because, in future, companies will have to accept that their fridges will be returned to their yard. They will at long last have to find a way of dismantling them more easily and more cost-effectively. It is precisely for that reason that we are proposing individual responsibility here. We would not grant the Member States any individual scope for decision making; it should be the companies that do that on an individual basis. As far as I am concerned, it is very important that costs should be borne up to the point of collection in this case too.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at present going through the implementation of the end-of-life vehicle directive, on which this House also decided that companies should pay everything, so that the companies are now saying – and I mean real blue-chip companies in my country – that if you pay everything, you should also set the price! It is precisely that which is not consumer-friendly. That is why I would really like to warn you against thinking that collection from people's front doors is a consumer-friendly act, Mrs van Brempt. It is not, because the companies alone are then responsible for how high the collection and recycling costs actually are. There is then no third-party control. I am enough of an entrepreneur to know that it is an opportunity for companies, if you say – as the Council and unfortunately now Mrs Wallström too are saying – that the costs should at least be borne from the collection point. We will then end up again with exactly the same patchwork quilt that we were trying to get rid of by means of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have said that we want to harmonise the various different regulations in Europe in the long run, with the aim of achieving comparable rules. That was one of my great ideals and reasons for getting involved in Europe, because I said that this enormous internal market should take advantage of its synergies. And then – because we are such good people – we go and allow for individual and even 15 separate options in this internal market. That just cannot be right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this directive serves those Member States which are already working hard, achieving targets and have built up systems and that we are anxious that those Member States, and I particularly have in mind countries such as the Netherlands and Belgium, should be able to keep their existing systems. I would have to be crazy if I wanted to penalise those countries and say that they have to adopt the European system now. Of course not, they should achieve the targets, and if they comply with those targets and rates and guidelines, then they should be able to keep their financing systems over a period of about 10 years.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few days, industry has written some angry letters, because a decision in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy missed the target, namely how can we prevent free-riders in future when it comes to new products? You all know about those special offers just before Christmas, when big companies buy 10 000 fridges in the Pacific Rim which are then marketed any old how through some kind of agent, and then, all of a sudden, once the fridges have been sold this agent and importer disappear and the SMEs who then have to foot the bill are the ones that suffer. Industry itself has to develop guarantees to protect itself from free-riders. Industry is clever enough to protect itself against such free-riders, or, if you will excuse the expression, these wolves. I regard this as a very up-to-the-minute form of protection for SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a rather euphoric tendency, Commissioner, to overuse the word ‘re-use’ in this area. Re-use sounds very good at first, but is it really as good as we think? A ten-year-old fridge is an incredible power-guzzler. The amount of water consumed by a twenty-year-old washing machine is phenomenal. So re-use is not necessarily the best solution – it needs to be considered with a critical eye. I hope that you will agree with me.</p>
<p class="contents">I have made a very modest 10% increase in the rate of recovery, because in the foreseeable future we can expect a ban on landfill. I have left the recycling and re-use rates, because they are entry rates and because industry, including smaller industries, needs to follow these entry rates. It is no great feat to increase the rates by 20% – for example, for a mobile phone like this – and nor is it a political masterstroke, but the vital issue for me is what they do with the recyclable material. We are seeking a ban on six dangerous substances as quickly as possible. We have brought this forward from 2008 to 2006. Commissioner, I would be pleased if you would follow these initiatives and motivate your colleagues in the Member States. They were not particularly ambitious about the electronic scrap regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have every sympathy with your complaint about the timing of this debate. However, and this is by no means false modesty, I must point out that it is neither the administrators nor the President of the Parliament that sets the agenda, but rather, in all their wisdom, the political group chairmen. If the powers that be decide that we should discuss issues like NATO and defence, for which we have no responsibility, during the day, then so be it. Many of them base their actions on the principle that detailed knowledge simply obscures their judgment, and then we end up with agendas like this. I cannot do anything about it either!</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I fully support the idea behind this directive but there are certain tests to which we should submit the proposal and our amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, would existing successful arrangements for dealing with electronic waste be allowed to continue? I believe there is a danger that they would not. Parliament's amendments emphasise individual producer responsibility so that none can escape the net of the directive, but this means changing existing collective responsibility systems. The rapporteur has dealt with this by allowing for such collective responsibility agreements to continue for 10 years after the entry into force of the directive. That will create two systems in one EU and lead to distortions of competition. I look forward, with some trepidation, to the problems which we will encounter at conciliation on that one.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, are we legislating with open eyes about the cost of what is proposed? No, we are not. The cost impact assessment in the original proposal is inevitably inadequate. The British Government has done a cost-impact assessment, learning from the fridges debacle. It has estimated a possible annual implementation cost for this directive at EUR 500 million, with a maximum save in landfill costs of approximately EUR 15 million a year. Do we have similar estimates from other countries? No, we do not. Will they legislate without counting the cost? Yes, in all probability they will.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, should we consider the interests of small businesses? Clearly the rapporteur thinks not because he has deleted in Amendment No 15 the possibility of giving micro-companies five years' grace to comply with the directive and take advantage of the technical changes that bigger companies may pioneer. I very much regret this and will not support that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, does what we are doing help responsible companies? Not yet. As it stands, the directive creates the possibility that some companies may end up paying for free-riders on the system. We look forward to hearing the Commissioner's reply on Amendment No 92.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, are we being fair to local authorities? No, the amendments ignore them.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, is it wise to increase the recycling targets? No. It is not done on the basis of any assessment of cost or practicability. Parliament habitually increases targets – any targets. It is a very bad trade union habit and one that we should get away from. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Brempt (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. The rapporteur has already emphasised the importance of the directive, which, like many in this Parliament, I support. I also endorse his important additions to the directive, such as the duty to collect all electronic waste, the higher compulsory collection target of 6 kg which, as the rapporteur has already stated, is very realistic, and thirdly, the very important compromise which we struck with the different groups at first reading in this Chamber and which we must continue to support, namely individual producer responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Without revisiting these three points at great length, we can, in my view, ensure in this way that less new waste is produced, which is, therefore, the best prevention possible, that waste will become more environmentally-friendly and that it will be easier to recycle. I therefore believe that these points are essential to this Parliament, and I would like to pre-empt events slightly and inform the Council that we will be able to back these three principles when we leave for conciliation – hopefully unanimously, or at any rate jointly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are a few points on which I fail to agree with the rapporteur. Something which he himself dwelled on for quite a while was the question as to how far this individual responsibility extends and who is now responsible for paying for collection and the collection points. If we do not address this, then it will be the local authority that will be picking up the tab, as Mrs Jackson said. I must say, I am not in favour of this. If we wish to implement the principle of responsibility and of ‘the polluter pays’ to the letter, then we will need to ensure that manufacturers bear their share of these costs. Consequently, we must at any rate ensure that Amendment No 67 of the rapporteur is not supported on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">Waste prevention also means that products must be re-used as long as possible. I certainly agree that certain refrigerators which use up far too much energy should not be re-used, but since there is now a tendency for these products to have increasingly shorter life spans, we can ensure that products that are being made now can be re-used in future. This is also an essential social objective, which I want to support 100%, and I therefore ask you to back Amendment No 73.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the consumer is concerned, it is also important to us that he should be informed of the dangerous substances currently present in products, such as mercury, lead and such like.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to finish off on a controversial note, namely the topic of light bulbs. I should like to broach this subject again, mainly because it is an aspect that has been lobbied heavily for, and I sometimes have the feeling that the more we lobby in this Parliament, the more productive it seems. In my view, it is too ridiculous for words that we should keep light bulbs outside the scope of the directive, while many other, often less polluting products <span class="italic">are</span> included.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on a final note, I should like to support you and the rapporteur in the fact that we are holding this debate far too late in the evening, and that attendance is disappointingly low. A fellow MEP said to me today: surely this is sheer madness. It is undoubtedly the most important directive we are bringing to the vote this week in the plenary session, and yet we are discussing it at an impossible hour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Starting off in Britain, which still has a poor recycling record, the WEEE Directive looks like the future. But when you visit Denmark or the Netherlands where electrical and electronic waste is routinely collected, you see that the Commission directive is really only an attempt to harmonise and build on the best practice of the present. It is only those of us who still live in the past, Mr Bowe, who find it challenging and ambitious. It certainly will play a major part in waste-management policy and that is for the good. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party wants to encourage recycling, good product design, best-use resources and reduce pollution. We strongly support the principle of producer responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a lot still to be agreed between Parliament and the Council through the conciliation process and the fact that we are going to be engaged in lengthy discussion is a tribute to the rapporteur, who has done so much to bring all the political parties in this House together so that we are united and will almost certainly secure qualified majority voting on many amendments tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I welcome his latest compromise proposal on paying for the costs of dealing with orphan waste. I do not believe that large legitimate manufacturers should have to pay the costs created by other companies, whether they be free-riders or small organisations. I am pleased that encouragement is now being given to re-use materials where environmentally appropriate, and I thank my colleagues across the House for the support they have given me in opposing the development of these so-called clever chips.</p>
<p class="contents">My words may fall on some deaf ears here but I would ask Members to consider giving their support to a couple of amendments I have tabled. Amendment No 82 attempts to address the concern of cable manufacturers by making clear that financial responsibility for WEEE rests with the producer of the finished equipment and not with individual component manufacturers. I thought we were all agreed on that point.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 71 represents a plea for help for plastic recyclers. I conclude by saying with a certain mischievous glee, as someone who has campaigned for better recycling in my own country for 30 years, that I rather hope that this directive puts a bomb under my own local authorities and recalcitrant government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I too should like to add my words of praise to Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, the rapporteur. In addition, I should like to thank the other shadow rapporteurs for their fruitful cooperation. This is modern environmental policy. We are supporting pioneering businesses, instead of what we usually do, namely coasting along at a European mean rate, and granting the countries that are lagging behind another three years’ respite.</p>
<p class="contents">Nearly the whole of Parliament will be voting in favour of individual producer responsibility tomorrow. This is new. Nine years ago we saw the adoption of the packaging directive. We Greens were on our own with our plea. We opted for producer responsibility rather than individual responsibility in respect of recycling cars. And now, tomorrow, the long-awaited moment will arrive. Individual producer responsibility. Why are both major groups now adopting the Green line? One reason is that pioneering businesses have now started lobbying. Electrolux in Sweden deserves credit in this respect. A year ago, Philips was still opposed to the concept, but it is now keeping a low profile. The well-known environmental principle is: the polluter pays, not: polluters pay. And certainly not: consumers pay, as is the case in the Dutch system.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a collective system in the Netherlands. Everyone – every consumer – pays a waste disposal fee. This system encourages laziness in producers. Responsibility for individual products stands for innovation, which benefits the environment and, ultimately, pushes the price down for the consumer. If a business makes a product which lasts twice as long, the recycling costs will be twice as low. If they stop using dangerous substances, they will not need to pick up the bill for disposing of these later on.</p>
<p class="contents">The new regulation will enter into force in 2006 if it is up to Parliament, or in 2007 if it is up to the Council. In my view, this would be a good time to review the Dutch system as well. In that case, we will be able to avoid the two Europes which Mrs Jackson referred to, and we will not have to wait for the ten years on which we agreed as a compromise. We must, however, convince the Council tomorrow, as the Council has produced shoddy work. Countries can choose between an individual or a collective system. That does not work. We have one market and we thus need one system for the whole of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problems associated with waste are among the greatest environmental problems we have to tackle, and we like the idea of finding an overall solution whose objectives are, in the end, to reduce the total quantity of waste, to increase the amount of recycling and, at the same time, to reduce discharges of hazardous substances in connection with the treatment of waste.</p>
<p class="contents">A cleverly thought-out directive can also give a boost to better product design on the part of the big manufacturers. Even at the first reading we had achieved fairly broad compromises in Parliament, and I think it has been a strength that we have been able to retain most of these compromises at the second reading too. It also means that we are in a strong position in relation to the Council of Ministers when we reach the conciliation stage. I would thank the rapporteur for his valuable cooperation and open-minded attitude.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the directive on hazardous substances, there is one aspect we are particularly pleased with, and that is the proposal that a ban on hazardous substances such as lead and cadmium be introduced by no later than 2006. Nor must this present any obstacle to those countries which wish to progress more quickly and which already have more progressive legislation in quite a few of these areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Where the WEEE Directive is concerned, the fundamental issue for us is that of manufacturers’ direct liability, which must be as clear as possible. On the one hand, it is an issue of principle that manufacturers should pay their own costs. On the other hand, direct and total liability on the part of manufacturers means that there would be a genuine incentive for product development and for making different products as easy to recycle as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council’s proposal can be improved in a number of further respects. For example, small manufacturers should be included. We also wish to avoid the problem of free-riders, to which I think Amendment No 92 may be a good solution. We also, of course, support the demands for higher recycling quotas, as well as the specific minimum levels of collection per person. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to congratulate Mr Florenz on his report. I support the thrust of his approach. However, there are a few points with regard to which we must continue to keep a check on reality. I am talking about light bulbs, television tubes and fire retardants.</p>
<p class="contents">Light bulbs only have a limited impact on the environment. The separate collection of these is not environmentally effective. It is therefore not sensible to ban lead in the glass of light bulbs. This would result in light bulbs becoming very fragile, which would be a problem, particularly during manufacture.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons of safety, I am in favour of the use of lead in television tubes. If we were to prohibit lead in these, we could definitely expect more accidents to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">In actual fact, the same applies to fire retardants. I am in favour of the ban on brominated fire retardants, which have clearly been demonstrated to be harmful. However, I believe that to prohibit all fire retardants would be taking matters one step too far.</p>
<p class="contents">The disposal of gases with a considerable global-warming potential is not very effective. The contribution which would be made to controlling the greenhouse effect is virtually zero.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, I should like to call attention to the risk of electronic waste being dumped in countries outside the European Union under the guise of re-use. The Member States must therefore ensure that only usable electrical and electronic equipment which will actually be re-used is exported to countries outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to ask the European Commission, namely Mrs Wallström, when she will be reviewing the batteries directive. The European Commission’s argument has always been that this review proposal could become a reality as soon as the proposal for a directive on electronic waste has been drafted. I hope that this is now the last time I will have to prompt the European Commission on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, because they are going to test the capacity and will of the electrics and electronics sector to maintain an attitude of active commitment to the protection of the environment, but also because they are going to test the capacity and will of the European institutions, Parliament in particular, to take a realistic and coherent approach, that can be adopted by the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mr Florenz, has had a difficult task in his attempt to produce a solid and effective proposal that can be accepted by all parties concerned. Now, as is apparent from this debate, in dealing with a complex and pioneering initiative in this field, there are still, in my opinion, many gaps and problems coming to light in its practical application. Two of these are of particular concern to me. One such example is consumables, such as those that have been mentioned here tonight. I believe that if we use this concept in an excessively wide sense we will be jeopardising those Member States who already have collection systems in place, in breaking up existing re-use circuits, inasmuch as we would be favouring recycling over re-use, before asking ourselves the question whether we are favouring the most ecologically sound system.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like to refer to ‘free-riders’. I believe that the compromise amendment presented is an appropriate solution, given that it did not seem logical that, taking the issue of individual financial responsibility as an example, we should have to make product manufacturers who disappear from the market or those who refuse to be identified responsible for their actions. I think we should take on a demanding approach with manufacturers who do not face up to their responsibilities with regard to waste, in order to defend those responsible manufacturers who have no reason to take on costs caused by these ‘free-riders’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has worked very hard on it and moved it quite fast, in parliamentary terms. When you consider the full implications, what he has achieved has been quite phenomenal. This is the most extensive recycling scheme we have ever seen in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we live in an increasingly throw-away society where we produce more and more waste. What I am pleased to see with this proposal is that we are finally moving in the direction when the days when we can throw fridges, televisions, toasters, mobile phones and other electrical goods into a landfill are over. We all want to see a new era in which environmentally-friendly electric goods are fully recycled or reused. We all need to play our part in this as consumers and become habitual recyclers.</p>
<p class="contents">But are these proposals going to help us? Furthermore, are Parliament's amendments going to make things better?</p>
<p class="contents">In large part I can say ‘yes’, but not entirely. Too rigid an application of the principle of individual responsibility will cause major problems for small- and medium-sized enterprises across Europe and prevent sensible collective schemes being implemented. Enforced mandatory separation of electronic waste at each household, which could then, when non-compliance is found, be threatened with punishment is not a sensible way to encourage the cooperation of consumers nor is it, in every case, technically feasible.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we really want to include consumable spare parts and sub-assemblies in this proposal even if they add contamination and enormous technical problems to the recycling process? Does not everyone realise that small firms throughout the European Union need some extra time and assistance to cope with their full responsibilities and do this job properly?</p>
<p class="contents">All this leads me to think that we need a bit more time. After tomorrow's vote we should all pause for some thought about how we can make this directive fully environmentally friendly, cost-effective and attractive to the public. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In another part of Finland, where ‘Rosk'n Roll’ operates, waste is collected and advice dispensed in return for a special eco-fee. Europe’s fifteenth largest waste recycling company also operates here – on the principles of the market economy. Eight kilos of WEEE waste per person is collected.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we have something to learn from this practical example, as we also have from the matter of oil waste at sea and the way in which it is treated. There must be common systems in which the principles of the market economy apply. There must be no benefit from throwing things away.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the rapporteur’s proposal because I believe that it fulfils these requirements.

<p class="contents">This will mean that electric and electronic waste will have to be collected and recycled instead of dumped – as in my own country – with negative effects on the environment. Producers need to be responsible for their own products to ensure that future products live up to a more environmentally responsible design. For example, the insides of televisions can now be made completely of plastic instead of plastic and metal, making them easier to recycle. Such producers should be rewarded for designing to reduce waste at competitive prices. Consumers need to be involved in this process in order for the directive to be a success. Easy access to collection systems is absolutely essential and consumers must be able to return products free of charge.</p>
<p class="contents">Making producers responsible for their own brand products will lead to improvements of design and have a direct effect on the costs. The loosely-framed common position must be tightened up to discourage free-riders who do not take responsibility for their own waste. Here I welcome the amendment on orphan waste products.</p>

I would like to comment on two great causes of concern. The first is that existing collection systems could be destroyed. I do not share Mrs Jackson's viewpoint, in fact I believe that they could continue to operate. But it would not be unreasonable if some change were necessary after ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, cities and municipalities are terrified that it will be incredibly expensive for them. However, it need not cost the municipality anything at all, because they would of course be able to recover the cost from consumers via waste charges. I regard it as being very dangerous to take over costs from producers at least from the collection point. In view of the late hour, I will take the liberty of becoming literary: I almost regard this as an un-European way of doing things.</p>
<p class="contents">One final word about Finland. I am sorry for the Finns that things are in such a mess there, but it not the only thing to go wrong in Finland. They even want to build a new nuclear power station! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We support all amendments that reinforce the environmental objective. However, the environment does not benefit from European rules that are opposed to collective systems. Producers must be individually responsible, that goes without saying. Producers must be encouraged to use eco designs, I agree on that score too. However, individual funding is not the answer. Different makes of hairdryers, electrical toothbrushes, hand blenders, kettles, TV sets etc., hardly differ in terms of recyclability. Individual funding will therefore hardly benefit the environment. Collective systems, however, are less bureaucratic and more practical. There is therefore no reason why collective systems should only be called upon in exceptional circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the waste disposal fee. Why should this not be visible? I can understand the underlying rationale, that environmental costs must be incorporated in the price, but should this be done invisibly at all costs? Would it not be more transparent if it were mentioned? Visibility would certainly enhance awareness on the part of the consumer, and this is of major importance, as consumer cooperation is crucial if we are to achieve the environmental objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under his direction Parliament has been able to have a central role in bringing together the views of consumer associations, environmental organisations and producers also. The prevailing and uncommon mood of consensus is a resource that all parties should cherish, also bearing in mind future plans for acts.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will be an important application with regard to the producer’s responsibility. I am satisfied that in many respects I have been able to strengthen and clarify it through my amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Producer responsibility will have a huge impact on the volume and quality of waste electric and electronic equipment, greater than any other possible decision that Parliament might take regarding waste. It will create incentives for more environmentally friendly design and for innovations before products have yet come on the market and so reduce the ecological burden of products throughout their lifetime.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly we are now creating alternative methods for treating waste to act as an incentive, resulting in an ecological burden that is as light as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendment I tabled with this in mind was adopted by Parliament at first reading and the Council adopted it in its common position in a formulation that was further improved.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is now making legislation that will clearly show to the rest of the world that the conflict between consideration for the environment and the economy is not unavoidable but one that can be settled through carefully considered legislation. That is why it seems foolish that the Council wanted to allow collective financing – in practice a waste tax – not just with regard to historical but also future waste.</p>
<p class="contents">For one thing it would not be an incentive for ecodesign, which in practice would mean the whole directive would be watered down. Secondly, it would allow an opportunity for ‘free-rider’, which would penalise honest and respectable producers. Thirdly, it would increase the public tax burden since no proportional reduction in existing taxes can be anticipated. The Council’s common position therefore means fiscal greed to be endured by consumers, producers and the environment alike, although, fortunately, it would seem that Parliament is on their side.</p>
<p class="contents">I think Parliament’s work in connection with this directive has succeeded so well as a process that it would be worth exploring and clarifying what courses of action we could adopt more frequently for the future. If we were in the habit of erecting statues to legislative projects we might now build one gladly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me briefly recall why we are tackling the specific problem of electrical and electronic waste. It is the fastest-growing part of the waste stream, indeed it is growing three times faster than the average. Each of us produces on average about 14 kgs per year of this waste and by the year 2010, when this directive is fully operational, electrical and electronic waste will account for over 8% of the entire municipal waste stream. Once adopted and implemented the directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment will allow us to divert this type of waste from landfills and incinerators to environmentally sound re-use and recycling.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive on restricting hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment will prevent the presence of unnecessary hazardous substances, posing risks for human health and the environment in various stages of the life-cycle of such equipment, including its waste management.</p>
<p class="contents">The work undertaken by the European Parliament substantially reinforces the original proposal, and I welcome the majority of the amendments tabled. In particular I support the strengthening of individual financing, as proposed by the Committee on the Environment, and limiting collective systems to those cases where these are necessary for practical reasons. This can help to internalise waste management costs into the product price and give incentives for a better design for re-use and recycling. It is a first step towards fuller integration of environmental considerations into product design and consumption patterns.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to find appropriate solutions for the financing of historical waste put on the market before the entry into force of this directive. One of the options to achieve this may also be the use of a visible fee. This should, however, be done in line with Articles 88 and 89 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the principle of increasing the collection target to 6 kgs per capita and per year, though the timetable foreseen needs to be more realistic and take into account the time needed to collect and process data.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the proposal to advance the phase-out date for the substance bans in the RoHS directive to 2006, though this should be done in accordance with the principles set out in Article 95 of the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also answer some of the points raised during the debate. I can assure you that we have carefully evaluated all aspects of this proposal, including its costs. For the overall target of 4 kg per capita collected waste, we estimate that the costs will be in the region of EUR 500 to 900 million. We also base our estimates and evaluation on the existing systems, of which there are not many: the Netherlands is the one example from which we can draw conclusions and learn lessons. These figures have been confirmed by practical experience, for example in the Netherlands. If Parliament wants to increase the collection target, this is obviously a political decision, and we agree with that.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to subsidiarity, we have tried to strike an appropriate balance between harmonising certain elements of the proposal and leaving others to subsidiarity. This is why the way the collection systems operate is left to the Member States. We also think it is not necessary to define at Community level who is to finance the collection point up to the moment the equipment is brought to it. This is why we reject both Amendments Nos 69 and 83.</p>
<p class="contents">What about small and medium-sized enterprises? The Committee on the Environment has voted in favour of deleting a temporary exemption for SMEs from the financing obligations of the directive. We can accept this point as we think that practice has shown that there are no excessive costs for these companies and that such an exemption is not needed, and it might even lead to market distortions.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland, I hope that any day now we will be able to present the batteries proposal and I am working hard on that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a total of 82 amendments have been tabled on the WEEE directive and 18 on the RoHS directive. On the waste electrical and electronic equipment proposal, the Commission can accept 32 amendments in full, two in part and 20 in principle. The Commission can accept Amendments Nos 9, 11-19, 24, 27-37, 39, 40, 43, 44, 45, 50, 57, 65, 76 and 77. In Amendment No 23, the Commission supports a new paragraph 1 and paragraph 1(b), last subparagraph in full and paragraph 1(b), third and fourth subparagraphs as well as paragraph 2 in principle. In Amendment No 73, the Commission can accept the first part. In Amendments Nos 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, the first, third and fourth sentences can be accepted in full. In Amendments Nos 20, 21 and 41, the first sentence can be accepted in full. Amendments Nos 42, 48, 49, 51-55, 66, 78 and 92 can be accepted in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">On the RoHS proposal, the Commission can accept four amendments in full, one in part and seven in principle. The amendments acceptable in full are Nos 3, 4, 10 and 17. Amendment No 5 can be accepted in part – first paragraph – and in Amendments Nos 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the first paragraph can be accepted in full and Amendments Nos 13 and 15 in principle.</p>
