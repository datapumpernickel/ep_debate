Perhaps the Secretary‐General could remain with us – we need a lawyer. Mr Secretary‐General, I would be grateful if you just stay here for a minute, because this is important.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I believe that a vote tomorrow on my report would be erroneous in law, illegal and impossible. I would like to give my reasons for this statement and to call on Parliament and the Bureau to use their authority to postpone tomorrow's vote on my report. My justification for this is as follows. We considered these issues in the Committee on Transport and Tourism last week, but the situation has changed now that the Treaty of Amsterdam has come into force. This morning we quite rightly resumed the procedure during first reading and we repeated Parliament"s position from the previous first reading. The committee services have now published a report numbered A−0000, which is a corrected version of my report A−0245, which is on the agenda. So this is a new report which I have not even been able to read properly yet, because the procedural page includes explanations in French, and I assume that you should be able to read your own report in your own language. And what does the procedural page say, as far as I can make out? It says that the Council has confirmed its common position. First of all, I consider that to be illegal, because according to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Council should have consulted the Committee of the Regions. I do not know how it did that in just a few seconds, because we only had the first reading at 12.00 noon and I think this is a result of earlier this morning, before we had the first reading. That is the first legal error! Secondly, in the procedural page of a report that I have never signed, it says that today, during the sitting on 4 May, the President of the European Parliament has confirmed the common position and has referred the common position to the Committee on Transport and Tourism as the committee responsible. However, the Committee on Transport has not met since 12.00 noon today, nor is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow morning. So I do not know how it is possible to complete the second reading of a report in the Committee on Transport in a procedurally correct manner, if this report is to be voted on tomorrow at 12.00 noon.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the report on the agenda is not therefore valid, as it is has been drawn up in accordance with Maastricht. The report that I have now been given has a zero number instead of an agenda number, it is not even in my own language, and it refers the report, the common position that is, to the Committee on Transport, which is not meeting. The explanation given by some administrative services to the effect that we knew this last week and anticipated it, and that we considered last week what we wished to do, may be all very interesting from a legal theory point of view, but it is not acceptable for us to have a first reading today, for a report to be referred to the Committee on Transport when it is not meeting, and for the administration to amend my report from last week and to say that it is a second reading report. Well, you clever lawyers, I informed the Sittings Service about this yesterday, so that they could consider it in good time. In my opinion, the report cannot be voted on tomorrow and it must be officially deleted from the agenda. I attach particularly great importance to this because we are looking at a report on road user charges, and the European Court of Justice declared the first directive to be void because of a legal error, namely inadequate consultation of Parliament, and declared that it would only remain in effect until the renewed decision‐making process had been completed. I would regard it as being highly inappropriate if Parliament were tomorrow to adopt a proposal for a directive that was once again defective because of a legal error. I call upon the administration to check this very carefully, and I must insist that, as is quite right, it should be Parliament, its Members and committees that decide, and not some officials who take it upon themselves to do this by altering the procedural page.</p>
<p class="contents">I do take this very seriously, Madam President, and I hope that your staff, when they examine this objectively, will come to the conclusion tomorrow that the report – whatever report that is, whatever number it has, I mean report A−0245, which is on the agenda and has a definite subject matter – well, I would consider it as highly questionable for a report to be rewritten by officials and suddenly put on the agenda. That cannot be right! In my view the Council common position, as the President has said, and no matter how defective it may be because of failure to consult the committee, is now with the Committee on Transport, and that committee is not meeting this week.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me turn to the actual content of the report, as we must after all say something about that. I regard the decision taken by the majority last week to approve the common position as being a crass error. I would like to illustrate this with one or two arguments. In my second reading report, we simply reiterated the reservations we had at the first reading. These were swept aside by the Socialists, because Austrian Members and their Swiss friends want to sew up the EU/Switzerland convention come what may, and have therefore brushed aside any reservations. That is simply not acceptable, and I shall give you two reasons why. I think it is highly questionable for the Commission to declare, in a political agreement, if the common position gets through, that we should withdraw our complaint against Austria regarding excessive toll charges as a matter of political agreement. I still believe that the current Commission and Neil Kinnock are subject to the law, and that if the Commission has justifiably made a complaint, this complaint cannot be withdrawn as a result of political chicanery and by way of a political deal. I say that because I believe that the Commission should be bound by the law and not by political trickery. Secondly, I believe that the level of toll charges agreed by the Council is quite simply intolerably low. I have never understood the Socialists, who are calling for a great hike in road user charges in principle, but whose demands fall short of the level Parliament judged to be correct by a large majority in 1997, which was higher than the Council has proposed now. I regard this as grovelling before the Council, which has effectively said ‘you can like it or lump it!". According to Maastricht we have the right of codecision and of approving the common position in this case. As Christian Democrats, we cannot consent to withdrawing from the codecision procedure at the expense of our road haulage companies and at the expense of the environment. So I hope that we can still achieve a reasonable form of consultation at second reading.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Swoboda </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I am sorry that our last transport policy debate before the elections is taking place in such unsatisfactory circumstances. But, Mr Jarzembowski, this is pure cynicism on your part. You have consistently tried everything to prevent a system being adopted and have done everything to prevent external costs, for example, being included in toll charges or road user charges. And now you, of all people, are suddenly pretending that this agreement would be far too low and would not help the environmental situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are the legal arguments. Although I am a trained lawyer, I am not a European Parliament lawyer. I would not be so presumptuous. Nevertheless, Mr Jarzembowski, it was your proposal – your specific proposal at the last meeting of the committee – that we should vote on the second reading, and that we should confirm the first reading again for formal reasons so that we could take a decision on this subject today. You yourself, Mr Jarzembowski, said that we should take a decision and proposed this procedure. You have said today that parliamentarians should take this decision, and not officials. It was the parliamentarians who made it! Even if the officials have perhaps made incorrect allocations here and there, it is the parliamentarians who have made the decision here, on the basis of your proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me get to the heart of the matter, because that is what I am really interested in. The central issue is that in recent years transport policy proposals have been blocked, for two reasons. First, because we have been unable to reach a solution on the Eurovignette, because of opposition from members of your party, not because they argued that the result would be too low, but because they were fundamentally opposed to it, as they were against making progress on European Union transport policy. The second reason was that Switzerland opted for a solution which although it might be understandable from its own point of view, was not a solution that sat well alongside European integration.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why it was right that there have been negotiations on this, and with negotiations you always find that you cannot achieve the ideal solution, as otherwise there would be no compromise and no consensus, but at least you reach a consensus, even if not all interests are reconciled. However, in this case we have managed to achieve a consensus with Switzerland which opens up that country and which fits in well with European integration, including transport policy issues, and which at the same time makes it clear that the principles of an environmentally friendly transport policy can be realised with the introduction of the Eurovignette and by diverting transport from road to rail.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would particularly like to think Commissioner Kinnock very sincerely for all his understanding and patience when taking part in negotiations here and in always keeping to the law. But he has also got a good political head on his shoulders, thank goodness, because we need Commissioners who can think in political terms, whilst respecting the law, and who want to make progress.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Kinnock has achieved progress, and on behalf of my group I would particularly like to thank him on the occasion of this last transport policy debate. We do not know if he will continue to be the Commissioner for transport policy. He has some splendid achievements to his credit in recent years, in this field as well as in others, and that should not go unrecorded. We have complained enough about Commissioners here, but we can also give praise where praise is due.</p>

It is a Danish proverb which I hope can be translated. It says: ‘people who ride oxen get there too'. By this, I mean that what we are in the process of doing will still turn out well in the end. You are very concerned about certain principles in this matter. I can understand that. On the other hand, there is always room for improvements. You should not feel victimised by the Socialists in this case. On the contrary, there is cooperation here, but the important point is to get something on the table and to make it stick, so that it has real meaning. From that point, we can take things further. Even this proposal can be improved. In fact, I do not understand the squabbling we have had which Mr Swoboda touched on. It is irritating that we should be talking about it on the last evening, during the debate on the last transport item. We have been through many good items together, such as the ‘port state' and ‘short‐sea' issues, so I would urge you to support this decision. We are working towards environmentally friendly transport, and it can still be improved. That is why I have asked for speaking time this evening. It is in order to appeal to you personally, because I believe we have misunderstood each other on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, may I also be permitted to thank Mr Kinnock, and I am sure we shall see him for many years to come in this House.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking Members of this honourable House for the kind things they have said, and also to say to Mr Jarzembowski that he will know that I completely respect the thoroughness and effectiveness of his work even when, on odd occasions, I am not in total agreement with his conclusions. Tonight we have in the House three very fastidious, excellent Members of Parliament and even though Members will know my political pedigree, and it diverges from that of Mr Jarzembowski, nothing could take away the affection and respect I have for him and his work.</p>
<p class="contents">On the procedural points, which he makes with force and sincerity, I know he will forgive me if I do not get engaged in these arguments because the expertise and, indeed, the responsibility for dealing with the issues lies elsewhere. I should like, therefore, to concentrate on the substance of this issue, which, as both Mr Sindal and Mr Swoboda have said, is a matter of critical importance, so far as I am concerned, and so far as the development of the common transport policy is concerned. As Mr Jarzembowski reminded us, it is nearly four years since the European Court annulled the first and only directive on road charging. It is nearly three years since the Commission submitted its proposal to replace that annulled directive, and nearly two years since Mr Jarzembowski's first report was debated here at first reading. We have grown old together with this measure. In the time since then, a great deal of work has been put into trying to achieve the present state of progress in all the Community institutions. I am very grateful for the commitment that has been shown in dealing with the second reading of the Eurovignette proposal, particularly in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">This new piece of legislation is both necessary and significant. It will fulfil the Community's legal obligation to adopt a new directive to replace the annulled directive and, most important as far as I am concerned, it is a vital step towards a common framework for differentiated charging systems in the whole of the European Union. Naturally the legislation, as Mr Swoboda says, is the product of a compromise that reconciles a variety of concerns and interests. Honourable Members may take some satisfaction from the fact that, whilst it differs in a number of points from the Commission's original proposal, the directive, as it turns out, is closer to the opinion of Parliament in several respects. For example, the compromise does not contain an explicit provision to include external costs in existing charges, although it allows, and in some cases requires, differentiation of existing charges in order to reflect environmental and other effects. I know there is not unanimous enthusiasm for that principle but it is certainly one that I would seek to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission feels that this directive as it now exists represents a useful first move towards fair and efficient pricing in road truck haulage, and we welcome the willingness of Parliament and the Council to make that advance while, at the same time, we continue to emphasise the need for further work on quantifying external costs for all modes. As honourable Members will recall, that was also specified in Mrs Schmidbauer's very good report on the Commission's White Paper on fair payment for infrastructure use, and we are currently embarked on that task of quantifying the externalities with the help, obviously, of an expert group. When the results of that work are available, they will provide another component for use in the ongoing consideration of the internalisation of external costs, which will, I know, be an increasingly important subject of attention in the next Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, as the House will know, the main features of the common position reached on the current directive are the setting of minimum vehicle tax rates at the levels of the existing directive and without differentiation according to Euroclass, the maintenance of certain transitional measures on vehicle taxes, the establishment of maximum rates of user charges with a differentiated structure as proposed by the Council, the provision for an enabling power so that toll rates can be differentiated according to the emission class of the vehicle and the time of day when the road is used, provision for Austria to apply an infrastructure cost‐related toll on the motorway section between Kufstein and Brenner, and provision for a 50 % reduction in user charges for vehicles registered in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">As the House will know, the Commission proposed Article 75 as the legal base for this measure since we maintain that it is appropriate for developing the common transport policy even when legislation contains some elements relating to fiscal provisions. The Council disagreed and it added Article 99 of the Treaty as a legal base as a result of ministers' view that the provisions on annual vehicle taxes in Chapter 2 make it a substantial fiscal measure. I am sure this will bring the citizens of Europe cheering out on to the streets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council's common position is an acceptable balance between what is needed and what is feasible. It maintains progress in the common transport policy and it is consistent with the purposes pursued by at least the substantial majority in this House over several years.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us have some cause to be encouraged by the fact that a long and sometimes arduous legislative process has been concluded successfully. I want to express particular thanks to Members from all parts of the House, especially in the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for the valuable contributions that they and Parliament in general have made to achieving that success.</p>

We may have different political views, but we have always had trust in each other. I believe that it is important for there to be trust between the institutions and for each to recognise the competence of the others. We have always done that. I would therefore like to thank you once again, and to say farewell, whatever office you may hold next time.</p>
