<p class="contents">This is an important directive as it would introduce a ban on substances that have been identified and classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction, the so-called CMR-substances. It is a far-reaching proposal, as it bans their sale and all their possible mixtures to the general public. The proposed directive will therefore encourage the marketing and use of safer alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the proposed directive provides not only for the protection of consumers’ health but would also preserve the Internal Market. It would introduce harmonised rules throughout the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The reasons for favouring an extension of the ban to products placed on the market for consumer use are understandable. Nevertheless, this requires an examination of the scientific evidence, the release factors and the exposure situations. The Commission will address Parliament's concerns by seriously looking at potentially problematic products which could pose unacceptable risks to health and the environment. I am pleased that this procedure of risk assessment is clarified precisely in the new recital 3.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission accepts the new recital 3, and I hope that this directive can now be finalised. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my fellow Members’ information, I will therefore very briefly describe the measure which we will be voting on tomorrow and, as Commissioner Liikanen already said, represents common ground which the Parliamentary delegation to the Conciliation Committee has supported, endorsed and which it commends to the House for a positive vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Liikanen has already said, this is an amendment to the twenty-third amendment of Directive 76/769 relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction). The proposal, based on Article 95 of the Treaty, has two main objectives: to safeguard the internal market by introducing harmonised provisions on the marketing and use of the above-mentioned substances and to achieve a high level of protection for human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is appropriate to point out that we are talking about 25 substances in particular, 14 of which are classified as category 2 carcinogens, such as some cobalt salts, cadmium, benzopyrene, azoic colouring agents and so on; three of these are classified as mutagens and eight as toxic to reproduction. For example, it has been established that cobalt causes carcinogenic effects in laboratory animals and in human beings, particularly lung cancer and myocardial tissue tumours; cadmium powders, for their part, can cause testicular cancer in addition to lung cancer. As can therefore be inferred from these brief examples, we are dealing with highly dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">During the last year and a half to two years of work, Parliament adopted at first reading, in February 2002, two amendments which the Council, in June 2003, partly accepted by adopting its common position. At its second reading in 2002, Parliament adopted an amendment to the recitals. We have therefore reached the final part of this conciliation, of these three stages and, as has already been pointed out, the problem that still needed to be settled did not concern the substances, but the products which may contain these substances. Well, the agreement on the sole point at issue during conciliation stipulates that the Commission must submit as soon as possible a legislative proposal aimed at banning the use of products – products this time – containing substances classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction where, however – and emphasising this is very important to the rapporteur – there is scientific evidence that these substances are released by such products, thereby exposing the general public to the risks described above. This is why the delegation considers the obtained results to be satisfactory for Parliament and commends it to the House for adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferreira (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, we now have to decide on the report by Mr Nisticò, an important report because, as has just been mentioned, it aims to prohibit the marketing of substances newly classified as carcinogens, mutagens or substances toxic to reproduction. It also constitutes – and I would emphasise this – the twenty-third amendment to the directive. We must of course welcome the European Union’s decision on this question, and also welcome the fact that it regularly comes up for discussion, as our knowledge of the subject grows. The examples quoted by Mr Lisi are a good illustration of the need to prohibit these hazardous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">During the conciliation procedure, however, the Council was unwilling to approve the proposal to extend the subject matter of the text to include products, so as to avoid legislation which in its view would be too complex and which would run the risk of being impossible to apply. Admittedly the argument that these substances are present in 30 000 products and it would be difficult to carry out assessments of such a large number of products makes good sense. However, surely we could ask, here and now, that such assessments should be carried out on new products placed on the market which contain the substances in question?</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has undertaken, following agreement between Parliament and the Council, to submit a legislative proposal aimed at prohibiting the use of products containing CMR substances when it is scientifically proven that exposing the public at large to such substances involves risks. It is desirable that this proposal, which is in line with what we want to happen, is put into practical terms as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the method of working, I would remind the House that, whereas this report concerns the twenty-third amendment to the directive seeking to prohibit the marketing of CMR substances, the Committee on the Environment is already looking at the twenty-fifth amendment to that directive. Of course the twenty-fifth amendment is concerned with other substances and preparations, but would it not be better to coordinate the adoption of the various texts, particularly when they are concerned with products that are hazardous to human beings and to the environment? CMR substances, chemical products and pesticides should be examined from the same angle, namely that of safety and the risks that they represent to human beings and to the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also another question which we shall have to take increasingly into account from now on, and that is the question of risk and the burden of proof. A company which places a product on the market has to assure consumers that the product is not harmful. It is not the task of the consumers to demonstrate that the product is hazardous. A product should not have to be banned after it has been placed on the market because the product has actually shown itself to be harmful: it should be banned before it is even placed on the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Naturally, my group and I are in favour of adding a further 25 dangerous substances to the banned list. I, personally, am also the rapporteur for the twenty-fifth amendment to this directive, through which a further batch of substances is being added. That is not at all what is controversial about this recommendation. Instead, my criticism applies more to what is not included and to the defects in the current legislation. The designation ‘substances and preparations’ by no means covers the use of CMR substances in consumer products, that is to say in those products with which we, as consumers, in the first place come into contact and through which we are exposed to these dangerous substances, for example when we buy toys, textiles, new flooring etc. The directive does not, then, cover the main source of what we are exposed to, that is to say carcinogens and other dangerous substances.</p>
<p class="contents">At first reading, the European Parliament asked the Commission to extend the directive to include the sale of consumer products, and we requested a proposal by 2002. In the common position, the Council states that a full risk assessment is required if it is to be possible to introduce restrictions on products. What is more, the Council comes up with the amazing argument that this really will be difficult because there are so many products. That is, of course, precisely why, in fact, a directive is required, namely so that people do not continue to be exposed to carcinogens through consumer products.</p>
<p class="contents">The conciliation on which we are now to adopt a position, together with Mr Nisticò’s recommendation, constitute a compromise I believe to be quite contrary to the new chemicals policy we have adopted, proposing that CMR substances not be permitted to be used in products if, through what is termed a reverse burden of proof, they have not proved to be safe. A reverse burden of proof is not what we now have in the outcome achieved but, instead, restrictions that apply only if, by means of a risk assessment, it can be demonstrated that a risk exists. In other words, we have precisely the policy that all the institutions have recognised as being ineffective in protecting people’s health. Unfortunately, it will be a good many years before the chemicals policy comes into force. In order to protect people’s health, we really needed measures covering CMR substances in consumer products immediately. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance will not therefore be voting in favour of the recommendation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">What is becoming clear to us all is quite simply that present analysis of chemicals and the present chemicals on the market are not satisfactory.

We welcome the new system that is coming and, if you like, in the very dying moments of the old system, I have to say I can remember more of these amendments to the original directive than I care to remember, although I have not been here quite long enough to remember the original directive, and I have always found that we have not been sufficiently consistent in what we have done. I would agree with some of the remarks made by Mrs Schörling. We need a new chemicals policy. We are waiting for the new chemicals policy, Commission – where is it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
