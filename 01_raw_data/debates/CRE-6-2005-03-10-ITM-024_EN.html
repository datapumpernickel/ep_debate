The lights are going out in Belarus, and the prospects for development are ever more receding.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that one point could have been emphasised still more in this resolution, namely the oppression of the free trade union movement in Belarus. This is an important part of the country’s democratic opposition. Parts of this movement are now on the way to being crushed by the Lukashenko regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Belarus is now a country that is becoming ever more isolated in Europe. That obviously applies also to its contacts with the EU - a course that has obviously been chosen by the President of Belarus and that thus also affects the Belarussian people. That is why it is all the more important to show that this policy of isolating Belarus is aimed at those in power in the country and not at the Belarussian people. What we need now is more contact with the civil organisations in Belarus, the democratic opposition, independent media and the free trade unions that are still fighting against the authoritarian government headed by President Lukashenko. At the same time, we should perhaps conduct a still tougher policy of sanctions against those who now govern Belarussian society. There is no alternative.</p>
<p class="contents">In countries all around the region, for example in Ukraine and other countries, a process of democratisation is taking place. Clearly, the day will come when Belarus too is democratised and can be included in further European cooperation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today we have a responsibility to European society and the people of Belarus to demonstrate whether we can sustain the high standards set by Dr Sakharov and the European Parliament, since the human rights prize awarded in the name of Academician Andrei Sakharov, is a symbol for the victory of the dignity of mankind, intellectual freedom and reason.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we must continue what we have begun. We are responding to the struggle by the Belarussian democrat Mihail Marynich for human rights, by adopting a resolution demanding his immediate and unconditional release as well as that of other political prisoners — that is our responsibility. Responding to the struggle of the journalists of Belarus for the truth, in our statement we strongly condemn attacks by the Lukashenko regime on the media, journalists and any person who freely expresses their opinion — that is our responsibility. We are responding to the Belarusian people’s fight for the right to belong to the new democratic world by condemning the dictatorial Lukashenko regime — that is our responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">Europe must promote the process of shaping civil society in Belarus, where society is not as inert as is at times thought in Europe. People want to express their opinions and are ready to do so, and I am convinced that the struggle of the Belarussian people and the leaders of democracy there has earned the most comprehensive EU support — both moral and financial, since the criminal Lukashenko regime is combating them ruthlessly. Our duty is to call things by their real names. Today in Belarus there is a form of implementing political, economic and ideological power, a regime known as a dictatorship. In Minsk the true supreme power, legislative power, executive power and even judicial power belongs to one person — a dictator, who has usurped unlimited, absolute and uncontrollable power and dominion over society and individuals. </p>
<p class="contents">I call on the European Parliament and the Council to acknowledge that the current Belarusian regime is a dictatorship and that President Lukashenko is a dictator, and to condemn them. In the name of Belarussian democracy, I call for a unification of vision and economic power, Europe’s parliamentary experience and the administrative capacity of the Commission. In order to protect Belarussian democracy, we need a decent shield, not an umbrella. I call for our common endeavour to begin today!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Belarus is a blot on the map of Europe, and unfortunately this blot is becoming blacker and blacker. Elsewhere, democracy is making headway, even in Arab countries, though the rate of progress is slow and we are not satisfied with it. In Belarus, however, the situation is worsening.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lukaschenko, Belarus’ <span class="italic">Duce</span>, is doing all he can to isolate the country still further. He recently stated that Belarus ought not to send young people to be educated and study in the West, because anything they learnt there would be of no use back in their home country, especially in view of the political situation in Belarus. It is hardly surprising that Western knowledge is deemed useless in Belarus, given that the country must be the only country in Europe and perhaps even further afield, where an official state ideology exists. There are officials everywhere, monitoring compliance with this state ideology and its development. They can be found in every workplace. It is therefore crucially important for us to send out a strong signal on this matter. Allow me to state quite clearly that what is happening in Belarus is not just a matter for Belarus, it is an important matter for the whole of Europe. Thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course, none of us can remain indifferent in the face of events in the Middle East, including the major changes in Lebanon, where people are also demanding the right to freedom and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">We very recently had an opportunity here in Parliament to hear the new President of Ukraine drawing attention to the new reality and the major transformation that has taken place in his country. Against that background it is totally unacceptable for our continent to continue to be blemished by what has already been described, and very appositely, as a dark stain that is becoming darker still with each passing day. The news from Belarus is really very disturbing. There is not the least sign of the regime being willing to open up to civil society: quite the opposite, it is stepping up increasingly repressive measures. I therefore believe that, politically speaking, Belarus has become one of the greatest problems we face within Europe, and in view of the gravity of this situation I believe that we should strengthen our support for civil society in that country in every possible way, and that we should also step up existing sanctions as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue between the European Union and Russia has assumed particular importance in this context. As we know, one of the most important problems to be discussed as part of this dialogue is conditions in the neighbouring countries which lie between the European Union and Russia, and, as our resolution states very clearly, it is a matter of regret that this point – covered in paragraph 21 of our resolution – has not been taken up by the Commission. Commissioner, I hope that you will be able to enlighten us on that subject; I regard that as essential. We will accordingly be supporting this motion for a resolution in the hope that there will be good news from Belarus before the year is out. I sincerely hope so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tibet was the subject of debate in the House today. Luckily, Tibet and the Dalai Lama do not allow themselves to be forgotten. They send out constant reminders of their existence. I have to say that my country’s history was equally bitter. In the nineteenth century Europe often tried to forget that the Polish people existed and had a right to independence. Only the many Polish uprisings kept the so-called Polish issue alive and ensured Poland was not forgotten.</p>
<p class="contents">In more recent history, the world largely forgot about the whole area of Europe that found itself under a Communist yoke after the 1945 Yalta Conference. Then came 1989, the fall of the Communist regime in Poland, followed by the fall of the Berlin Wall. I should remind the House that the fall of Communism in Poland preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall. There followed happy times for Poland. We now need to realise that what lies beyond the eastern border of the present European Union is not another planet but our own back yard. When the people of Ukraine claimed their independence, the European Union managed to demonstrate its support. The same should happen now. The responsibility for defending the Belarussian nation and its right to genuine independence, rather than a semblance of independence controlled by Mr Lukaschenko and his cronies, rests on our shoulders.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to realise that whilst combating his people, Mr Lukaschenko is also combating their culture and religion, notably the Catholic religion. There are many Catholics in Belarus, and Catholicism tends to be identified with independentist and pro-Western tendencies. The expulsion of Catholic priests has become standard practice in Belarus. That is why we must offer every support to the people of Belarus as they seek their freedom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many in this chamber who know what it was like when these conditions applied in our own states. This is a situation in which we should not shrink back from using the word ‘dictatorship’, for that is precisely what is currently gaining ground in Belarus. That is precisely the situation in which it is possible for political detainees such as Mikhail Marinitch, Valeri Levonevski and Alexander Vassiliev, as well as Yauhien Afnagel and Professor Yuri Bandashevsky, to cite two topical examples, to have their personal freedoms curtailed. This is something we have to bring to people’s attention, and, here and now, I call on the Council – in its absence – and the Commission to summon the Belarussian ambassadors and give them a political message demanding the immediate release of these political detainees and making it plain that we will not tolerate further detentions on the grounds of the free expression of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">In the same breath, let me reiterate my call to the Commission and the Council to also do something about the disappeared persons and press on with the work that the Council of Europe has begun. They must set in motion an international inquiry that will at last give the people of Belarus hope when the international community no longer keeps silent in the face of the massive violations of human rights in Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, human rights abuses are an everyday occurrence in the EU's new neighbour.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, however, not to talk directly about human rights abuses in Belarus, but to raise the issue of the European Union's assistance to civil society in that country. Through the TACIS programme, the EU has allocated EUR 10 million to projects in Belarus in support of civil society and the independent media for the period 2005-2006. Since that assistance flows through the Belarus Government, it is not efficient and flexible enough to support civil society organisations, the majority of which have already been de-registered for political reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the Council of Ministers' resolution of November 2004 and the detailed EU action plan for promoting democracy in Belarus, the European Commission insists on using the existing mechanism for support to civil society in Belarus. Some Member States and the expelled Belarussian community, on the other hand, want to see the creation of a special fund, with more flexible structures, to support non-registered NGOs, which are the most active and important in Belarus but receive no support under the current EU mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">We must acknowledge the progress made by the European Commission regarding Belarus. However, the Commission must finally recognise the need for increased support for genuine civil society organisations such as the Belarussian Association of Journalists, laureate of the Sakharov Prize. I therefore call on the European Parliament to raise its voice in this matter, exert its influence and put adequate pressure not only on the Commission but also on Belarus. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I truly believe it could happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Rarely do black-and-white situations arise in the international arena or indeed in internal politics. The situation in Belarus is like a black-and-white film. Truth and freedom are on one side, and the regime on the other. I thank the rapporteurs for their motion for a resolution. I am not sure that it is too severe. It is appropriate to the current situation in Belarus, which is after all a European country.</p>
<p class="contents">This motion for a resolution is a rallying call to the defence of a free, democratic and European Belarus. The country deserves a better future. The European Parliament has remembered the political prisoners and the disappeared in Belarus, the closed-down newspapers and educational establishments, whilst emphasising that freedom is indivisible and that freedom does not require a visa from Mr Lukaschenko. I believe thanks are due to the rapporteurs for this.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to say that as the House defends the cause of Belarus today, it is also defending European solidarity and honour. I thank you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, the Poles and Lithuanians are with us, and people talk as if Belarus were on the moon.</p>
<p class="contents">I recently received an e-mail from a member of the public who strongly protested at what he saw as our neglect of that country. Such is not the case; here in the European Parliament, we are giving human rights in Belarus massive backing, awarding the Sakharov Prize to its citizens, holding debates on a regular basis, and really getting stuck in. That, though, is the impression that the public get as a result of the Council’s absolute passivity, and, in particular, of the policies adopted by our nation states, whose interest in this issue is – with a few laudable exceptions – quite inadequate. For these reasons, it is important that we should make it clear that items 3 and 4 in this resolution must be addressed with all speed; I refer to the investigation of the cases where people have disappeared, and the release of political detainees. I would ask the other groups to lend their support to our amendment, whereby we may be able to do something for young people from Belarus, where, we agree, democracy and the rule of law must be advanced, and the nation states must at last awake from their torpor. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The EU’s goal is to have close relations with all of our neighbours, including Belarus. We want to see Belarus as a democratic, stable and prosperous country, fully benefiting from our Neighbourhood Policy. Unfortunately, its government's policies prevent it from taking its rightful place in the family of European nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The seriously flawed conduct of the parliamentary elections and the referendum in October 2004, show how far Belarus is lagging behind in terms of democratic development. It is deeply worrying for us all that democratisation, respect for fundamental freedoms and respect for the rule of law are deteriorating rather than improving, as the regime continues to tighten its grip on democratic forces, the independent media and opposition forces.</p>
<p class="contents">In November 2004, following the elections in Belarus, EU foreign ministers adopted conclusions setting out a clear EU policy. We confirmed the restrictions on ministerial-level contacts with Belarussian authorities, but at the same time sent a clear message to the population that they are not forgotten and that we are trying to support civil society and democratic forces in Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">We are closely monitoring the human rights situation in the country and, as a result, the EU imposed a visa ban last year on certain high-ranking Belarussian officials, on the basis of the findings of the Council of Europe’s Pourgourides report on politically motivated disappearances. We then extended this visa ban to the officials considered responsible for the rigged election and the referendum, as well as those responsible for the repression of the peaceful demonstrations that followed.</p>
<p class="contents">The cases of Mr Marinich and other imprisoned political opponents are of great concern to us. We believe that his trial was politically motivated and have issued a statement calling for his disproportionate sentence to be reconsidered. We have serious concerns in general about the independence of the judiciary in Belarus and continue to follow these cases closely. The EU issued the statement on Mr Marinich's case in January.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards your call on the Commission to step up our assistance efforts to Belarus, I am pleased to report that we have already done so in response to the EU Foreign Ministers' conclusions last November. The Commission is playing the lead role in coordinating and delivering EU assistance in support of civil society and democratisation in Belarus. A conference will be held in Vilnius next week on that very important subject. In difficult situations such as that of Belarus, where a country is isolating itself from the world, this is particularly difficult and we are working on the appropriate division of labour between the Community Member States and other donors.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome the role that the European Parliament can play in encouraging democratic changes and supporting democratic forces in Belarus. We are currently carefully examining the action plan which your Delegation for Relations with Belarus has prepared, to see how this can mesh with our own efforts in that regard. There is much to be done and we look forward to working with Parliament and with the democratic forces inside Belarus.</p>
<p class="contents">You raised some questions in your contributions that I should like to answer. The first was whether Belarus was discussed at high-level meetings between the EU and Russia. The answer is yes; the issue is always raised during those meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of how to channel the funds and how to assist civil society in Belarus financially was also raised. The main question is the ability of the relevant organisations to absorb the funds. The Commission is ready to examine all possible ways of supporting Belarussian civil society financially so that the funds can be used efficiently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
