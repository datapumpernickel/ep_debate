These programmes stated as their aim the protection of people and nature from the adverse effects of air pollution, meaning that critical ceilings in respect of nature and people would not be exceeded. The Commission’s proposal for a directive on national emission ceilings is an important step in achieving the aims the Union set itself: to protect its citizens from the adverse effects of air pollutants. The legacy of past decades is going to take some time to put right, however. We are still not even aware of all the technical potential for ridding ourselves of sources of emissions entirely. For this reason, it is reasonable to proceed in stages, as the Commission has proposed.</p>
<p class="contents">The first stage is the Interim Environmental Objectives to be achieved by 2010, which means cutting health-threatening ozone loads by two-thirds by that year. We cannot be satisfied with just this, however, as, after this target has been met, there will still be too many areas where pollution counts exceed levels that are dangerous to people and nature. Owing to this, I have recommended in my report a long-term goal, in addition to the interim one, and a final target for 2020. In that way, we would finally be able to reach a point where critical levels and loads are not exceeded and everyone will be protected effectively from all known health effects of air pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would like to draw your attention to my amendment, in which, owing to a translation error, there is a wrong word in your copy of the document. In place of ‘reached’ it should say ‘exceeded’. I hope that this will be sorted out before tomorrow’s vote.</p>
<p class="contents">How, then, do we achieve a situation in which air pollution does not exceed tolerance levels for humans and for nature? The Commission’s proposal sets limit values for each Member State with regard to certain kinds of interrelated emissions, which cause acidification, increased ozone in the inner atmosphere and soil eutrophication. Dealing with these problems and the emissions that cause them together has proved to be the most cost-effective way of tackling the causes of air pollution and bringing it under control. The biggest disagreements in the implementation of the directive relate to the limit values, i.e., the emission ceiling set for each country.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN Economic Commission for Europe has also examined the objectives for reductions in the same sources of emissions as in the proposal for a directive now under discussion, and, as a result of these talks, the so-called Gothenburg Protocol was signed. There is a clear difference between this proposal and the Commission’s. If we were to accept the ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol, we would never reach the targets that the Union has set itself regarding air pollution. Comparing the differences between the Gothenburg Protocol and the Commission’s proposal with regard to the effects on health, the annual reduction levels proposed by the Commission would save the lives of as many as four thousand people a year in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is beyond dispute that the ambitious targets set for the environment have been found to be an essential ingredient in people’s health and safety, there have been pleas for lower ceilings, on the basis that cleaner air costs too much for industry and communities. It has to be said, however, that there is very considerable exaggeration with regard to the costs involved. If, on the other hand, we calculate the benefits that better air quality will bring to people and the natural environment, as well as to buildings, we see that the economic benefits are four times greater than the costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We still have to work on the proposal for the directive so that, for example, the situation with regard to the applicant countries and those questions too that relate to the EU’s neighbouring regions can be better taken into account.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The UN ECE ceilings were agreed by all our Member States, by the applicant countries and globally, in a protocol signed at Gothenburg as recently as November 1999. Why did the Commission come up with these even stricter and substantially more expensive ceilings only one month later? I understand that the groups, the whole Parliament, are split on this issue, between supporters of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and supporters of the industry committee's line. Members of Parliament should be aware of the serious implications for our industries and agriculture, for our competitiveness, for jobs and – yes – for people and our constituents if the Commission proposal wins through. The industry committee urges this House to vote in favour of the amendments which are tabled in my name and in the name of Mr Bowe. These are the amendments passed by the industry committee. The UN ceilings are quite ambitious enough for us to reach our internationally agreed targets in reasonable time. The industry committee wishes to see these limits fully and properly implemented across the European Union and globally. The Commission can then concentrate on ensuring this occurs, on perfecting the models that are used and perhaps come up with new proposals in two or three years' time on the basis of much more convincing arguments regarding the relevant costs and benefits.</p>

The present draft directive on national emission ceilings tackles the key culprits where atmospheric pollution is concerned. It contains maximum emission levels for substances which are responsible for acidification, ozone forming in the troposphere and the eutrophication of soil.</p>
<p class="contents">As the topic is reasonably technical, I will only single out the salient points on behalf of myself and my group. The directive’s key goal is to reduce the emission levels of said substances to below the critical levels and, hence, pollution. These goals must be met by 2010, with an interim assessment of the national programmes in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important – and you have heard so yourself just now – and most talked about component of the proposal is, of course, the table which specifies the permitted annual emission levels for each country. The fact that, at UN level, 36 countries, including 15 EU Member States, recently agreed on less strict standards for the same substances played an important role in the discussion. There are now Members who urge that this table, i.e. the European Commission’s table, be replaced by the UN’s so-called Gothenburg table, which permits a higher ceiling. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I have to admit that this line of argument is rather weak. Indeed, UN agreements are always less ambitious due to the fact that it is difficult for the situation in rich, prosperous and hence often more polluting countries to be lumped together with the situation in the developing world. Moreover, it is incorrect that the European ceilings were established after completion of the UN negotiations. Examining the proposal and the argumentation – as I assume other Members have done – I notice that, at the time when the European ceilings were being stipulated, the UN protocol was still being negotiated. Add this to the fact that the environmental effects of SO2, NOx and the volatile organic substances, in particular, directly affect our own continent, I – and the majority in our group, I think – can go along with the Commission proposal regarding these substances. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I do have another problem, namely that concerning ammonia. The Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats would like to see the present ceiling adjusted. Looking at the nitrate directive, I notice that hardly any Member State meets the standard specified. It seems to me completely unfeasible to go beyond the Gothenburg standard. In addition, the effects of ammonia emissions are partly local and, as such, a lower threshold seems acceptable. On behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats, I have tabled an amendment which, where ammonia is concerned, is based on the lower Gothenburg standard and defers definitively setting the ceiling until the year 2006. The reason for this is that I hope that, by then, the effects of the implementation and the pending European legislation on nitrate will be able to give us better indications. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by making the following comment: legislation on ceilings is, in actual fact, the counterpart of legislation on large furnaces, for which I also happen to be rapporteur. We completed the first reading even before last year’s elections. The Council of Ministers, however, is still putting a spanner in the works. Could we be informed on the progress made? </p>
<p class="contents">As a final remark, I would like to thank Mrs Myller, the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy appears rather as if it had been caught napping and has only just woken up, the fact may, at all events, be conveyed that the problem of acidification is scarcely a new issue. Instead, it has been with us for as long as industrialisation – for 100 years. Research into the question has been going on for 30 years. None of us ought to be in any doubt about what the sources of acidification are, nor about what we should be doing regarding this issue. </p>
<p class="contents">Some accuse the Commission’s proposal, and also the report, as being excessive and far too costly to implement and say that the calculations that have been made are utopian. This is, however, wrong because we know that the Member States themselves have contributed to the report which serves as a basis for the whole directive. There is more justification for criticising the fact that we have not included the energy scenario we have emphasised elsewhere, for example in the Kyoto protocol, and which involves burning fewer fossil fuels in order also to solve the climate problems we are facing. </p>
<p class="contents">With all due respect to the Gothenburg protocol – and despite the fact that it has taken its name from my home town – I have to say that it is, in fact, just not on to compare this with the directive which we have to take a decision on tomorrow. One might well wonder why the Commission’s directive appears only a month later, rather like a punishment directed against this UN directive, but that has to do, of course, with nothing other than our own sluggishness in dealing with the issue. If we had been a little quicker off the mark, the present directive would have been on the table – signed, sealed and delivered – long before the so-called Gothenburg Protocol. </p>
<p class="contents">The word “impossible” has been used about the directive. I should like to say, however, that what is impossible is the situation which we have at present. The impossibility lies, therefore, not in the directive but in the current situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that the debate comes down to this: do we believe that the Gothenburg Protocol was the best Member States can realistically achieve? I recognise that the Commission and environmental groups believe that in practice much more can be delivered but nonetheless some Member States have committed themselves to significant reductions in air pollution – though that is certainly not true of all of them. Some Member States seem to have gone into the negotiations with a few calculations on the back of an envelope and refused to compromise in any way to set themselves any realistic targets. Others have not even used the same methodology, the same basis of calculation as others. So the protocol in many ways is a nonsense. It can give us no confidence whatsoever. It is a messy political compromise and nothing more.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know how much more the Commissioner can achieve but we should be seeking reductions in air pollution and we should be giving her our support in her efforts to negotiate them. We should support this report and give her our backing.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all probability, drafting this directive was like a national auction, and the end result is very modest when we think what the real challenges are. But, in any case, it is important that the European Parliament should now defend at least that policy which the Commission has chosen.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance proposes that even stricter goals should be set for 2010 than the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has recommended. We want to emphasise that an integrated strategy must be adopted to reduce emissions. We have to remember that, in any case, we have the implementation of the Kyoto commitments ahead of us, which will mean insisting on more efficient use of energy and simply using less of it. So, in our opinion, this directive must take into consideration that added benefit is to be had from an integrated strategy as regards implementing its objectives. We are very satisfied that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy included issues of shipping and air traffic within the scope of this directive, and we are convinced that the benefits to be gained from adhering to an integrated strategy are enormous.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we want to combat acidification, manure pollution and smog formation, we need to reduce the emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, ammonia and volatile organic substances. The Council’s conclusions concerning the EU acidification strategy have raised expectations which now have to be given substance. This could even be done in a cost-effective way, as is evident from the explanatory note to the Commission proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">We all know by now that six months ago, higher emission levels were agreed at Gothenburg within a UN context. These values, however, are the result of a political compromise between states, and the results of the model used by the Commission have been overlooked. This model is sound and the results are well founded. Also in view of the fact that, with these emission ceilings, the objectives of the EU’s Fifth Environmental Action Programme still cannot be met, a relaxation of the values is unjustified. </p>
<p class="contents">The first step towards achieving the emission ceilings is undoubtedly a dynamic implementation and enforcement of existing directives, such as the Auto-oil programme. In addition, we need to lay down new legislation in this field as soon as possible. In this connection, I would once more urge the Council to produce a common position on large furnaces as a matter of urgency. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, additional policy, for example in the field of volatile solvents used in paints and varnishes, as well as in car spraying, will continue to be necessary. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Now to the issues: it is obvious that there are differing opinions in this House on whether the proposal of the European Commission is too ambitious. Many are saying that it cannot be implemented using current technology or only at an exorbitant cost. The Commission itself says that the proposal can be implemented cost effectively. I find it interesting that the European Commission is assuming in this that energy consumption in the European Union will increase by 8% in the coming years and that there will be no change in the proportions of energy forms used and therefore no reduction in the proportion of fossil fuels. In my opinion this is not ambitious; if anything, the opposite. We in this House have always agreed that we must reduce the proportion of fossil fuels and that we must save energy. If we do not achieve this, then this is a declaration of environmental bankruptcy. If the perceptions of the European Commission as regards this basic assumption become reality, then there is no need for us to talk any further in this House about climate protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We must increase energy efficiency, improve energy saving and promote regenerative energies whilst, at the same time, recognising that nuclear energy produces neither CO2 nor SO2 nor NH3, volatile organic compounds or NOx.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are honest about it, I think that the two ideas are not mutually incompatible and for this reason I would also like to expressly oppose certain Member States demanding exemptions under the directive if they renounce nuclear energy. This cannot happen within the context of collective environmental responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">All the same, I would like once again to stress the fact that the Commission proposal is not too ambitious, but if anything a little too unambitious. I will support it tomorrow in the vote and I hope that the majority of the House will do the same.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I creates a proper framework in which we can work in the long term to reduce emissions. The vast majority of the amendments I can support. There are one or two that went through that I have some doubts about, particularly Amendment No 7, which I cannot see as being environmental at all, or as contributing to the overall attempt to reduce the amount of ozone-depleting substances at ground level anywhere in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to come to the issue which Mr Davies has addressed, namely, where we should start from. With what targets are we to start?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a series of quite practical and well-argued and debated figures were arrived at just before Christmas at Gothenburg under the UN/ECE protocol, and it seems to me that is the logical place to start. It would not to my mind be the right place to finish, but it certainly would be the right place to start and it is the reason why I was convinced when I was there in the debate in the Industry Committee, as none of my colleagues from the Environment Committee were, that it was the right place to start. It seems to me that the Commission figures are aspirational. Yes, we could go there – we should be trying to go there, but I do not think we should be starting there. We should be starting with the UN/ECE figures, with the Gothenburg protocol and revising them as is proposed by Mrs Myller in her report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an important instrument for future environmental policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States are given a clearer brief. They know what they should be aiming for. Upon examination of the table with the different ceilings for each Member State, however, I get the impression that there are double standards. I note that, for example, my country, Belgium, has to meet the maximum possible level, rather than the economically viable level, but that, at the same time, areas in its vicinity which are just as polluted as my country can pursue a much laxer policy. That is because a large country can use its better regions to offset its bad practices. A small country is not in a position to do this. I shall give you an example. From your statistics and maps, it appears that in northern France, which is just as polluting and polluted as Belgium, matters can be processed at a lower level. According to your calculations, the implementation of this directive costs each Belgian EUR 103 per annum, compared to EUR 15 for each person in France, including northern France. That is eight times less. This is partly due to the fact that we are a small country and we are surrounded by polluters. One per cent of the GDP per annum is too much of a strain for my country. I would therefore ask you to give me your backing for Amendments Nos 16 and 17, in which I request that the Belgian Government be given the chance to re-evaluate the situation based on the annual reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Acidification leads to the death, or reduced growth, of forests and causes fish to die and fewer plants to grow. Acidified water also releases heavy metals which constitute a health problem. The countryside in the Nordic countries is particularly vulnerable to acidification because these countries are largely lacking in means to protect themselves against it. Acidification occurs due to acid rain, caused by air polluting emissions produced by the burning of fossil fuels. </p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden and Finland, we have taken extensive measures in order to reduce national levels of air pollution. We are making major efforts to add lime to lakes and wetlands. We are, for the most part, complying with the emission targets proposed in the now current directive. However, more than 80 per cent of the acid rain over our country comes from air pollution not in our own countries but in other West European countries. We are therefore appealing for your help. Many North Europeans believe that it is only through environmental cooperation with other EU countries that our problems with acidification can be solved. </p>
<p class="contents">To the members of the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy I want to say that the UN resolution in accordance with the Gothenburg Protocol is far from being adequate. I am convinced that the EU can be better than the UN at solving the environmental problems in Europe. The proposed EU directive against air pollution can, in fact, constitute an important step towards combating the acidification of the countryside, mainly in the northern area of the EU. In addition, significant reductions in the percentages of unhealthy ground-level ozone, mainly in big cities in the southern part of the EU, can at the same time be attained. We ought therefore to have a common interest in applauding the present EU draft directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, by virtue of an unusually fortunate coincidence, directives on waste incineration, on limit values for national emissions of certain atmospheric pollutants, and ozone in ambient air all feature on today’s agenda. Previously, atmospheric pollution used to be associated with roads and traffic. Today, however, on a large scale, it refers to the whole world, and on a small scale, it even means the house we live in. In short, it means our whole ecosystem, and action must be taken. Setting emission limits for the four main pollutants is a sure way to help to reduce pollution, combat acidification and limit the harmful effects of these pollutants on human health and on plant life. </p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal for a directive, the European Commission proposes quantified national emission ceilings, which must be met by 2010 for the four pollutants I have just mentioned. Furthermore, it estimates the costs for each Member State of complying with these limits. I think that this is a good strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Myller’s excellent report makes a lucid evaluation of the European Commission’s proposal and considers it to be balanced; the report also seeks to strengthen the proposal in some areas. In particular, the committee approved a compulsory review of the directive by 2004, which will enable there to be a review of the limit values stipulated and measures adopted to ensure that these limit values are respected. All of this seems quite reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I must ask a question here. Why should we not allow a Member State to prove that it is being treated particularly unfairly because of the way the directive is implemented, as a result, for example, of its geographical situation and its climate and the fact that these leave it at a major disadvantage? Would this not be wise?</p>
<p class="contents">The EU system for combating atmospheric pollution is thus being extended, strengthened and refined. EU environmental policy is becoming more and more the environmental policy of each Member State, with obvious advantages for all Europe’s citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For my own part, I am ready to endorse the compromise prepared by the PPE-DE Group in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, according to which we shall comply with the Commission’s proposal except with regard to the area of ammonia emissions, as the proposal will not cause great problems for my own country, Finland, or our neighbour, Sweden, as has become evident on many occasions in this discussion. However, I also understand those views that advocate electing the ceilings proposed under the Gothenburg Protocol. However the voting goes tomorrow, I believe the Commission should continuously monitor developments in all Member States, and promote action to help industry to make the necessary changes. It is important that the environmental objectives are achieved as cost-effectively as possible throughout the whole Community.</p>
<p class="contents">Air quality in Europe has improved considerably in recent years. Emission levels have decreased significantly, at least in the energy sector, in transport and in industry. In recent years, there have been more and more EU acts in the area of the environment and new targets have been set for industry. I think it is something of a problem that the targets are repeatedly changed before any proper assessment has been made of the effects, in practice, on the environment and the costs to industry of the legislative measures that have been adopted. Before further obligations are imposed it is important to ensure that the action that has already been agreed is implemented in the Member States in every respect. These two goals are not, in my opinion, mutually exclusive.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I believe there should be international agreements on ceilings for emissions for shipping and aircraft, and, at this stage, they should not fall within the scope of the directive. Regarding long-term goals, I am of the opinion that there should be no strict deadline, but that Member States should endeavour, in accordance with their own goals, to meet the norms by the time stipulated or earlier.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope that this proposal will be another important step in this direction and that is why I especially want to thank the rapporteur Mrs Myller for her valuable work.</p>
<p class="contents">The Gothenburg Protocol is a step forward. However, it is nowhere near enough. The protocol goes only halfway towards the goal for acidification already agreed by Parliament and the Council. A substantial number of people will die early if we do not adopt the measures proposed by the Commission. The protocol is the result of a process in which there is too little pressure on the reluctant to do what they should. We cannot let this deflect the Community from agreed goals. The costs of the Commission's proposal must be kept in perspective, even on the Commission's highly pessimistic estimate which would not take full account of Kyoto or non-technical solutions. They amount to only 0.08% of Community GDP in the year 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Member States will have to do some of the things that will let them meet proposed emissions ceilings more cheaply if they are to live up to their Kyoto commitments. Saying that the ceilings are too difficult is dangerously close to ignoring Kyoto.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn to the amendments. The Commission can accept fully Amendments Nos 3, 8, 9, 13, 19 and 21. The Commission can accept in part the principle underlying Amendments Nos 1 and 2. We will draft a recital which does not appear to restrict the Commission's right of initiative, for inclusion in our amended proposal. We will also include a reference in Article 9 of the directive in order to make the new recital operational. It follows that the Commission does not accept Amendment No 27.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of the Commission's proposal is to leave as much flexibility as possible to Member States, but we cannot rule out further Community action if this would help Member States to meet emission ceilings more cost-effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can also accept in part Amendment No 11 which would make further changes to Article 9. We agree that review of the legislation should take account of aircraft emissions, further emission reductions in regions bordering on the Community, measures taken in applicant countries and transport factors. The Commission cannot however agree to bring forward the dates for reports to Parliament and Council. In 2003 the Commission will have almost no data from Member States on which to report and base any decisions. The Commission will not know in 2011 whether or not ceilings were met in 2010 because of the time that must be allowed for Member States to compile inventories.</p>
<p class="contents">We accept in part the principles underlying Amendment No 12. We will therefore redraft Article 9(3) to incorporate much of the material in the proposed amendment. The Commission accepts the principles of Amendment No 23. The reference to countries outside the UN/ECE process must be restricted to those who have supplied data and whose emissions are relevant to pollution in the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission accepts Amendments Nos 24, 25 and 26 in principle, and will also take them into account when it redrafts Article 9 as part of its amended proposal. The Commission has a great deal of sympathy with the concerns underlying Amendments Nos 16 and 17. Allowance should be made for the fact that smaller Member States have less room to spread the load. However we are dealing here with transboundary pollution, so the Commission considers that adjustments to ceilings for individual Member States can only be made as part of a general review of ceilings. We will therefore propose a new recital and changes to Article 9, which will ensure that effects on smaller Member States are properly taken into account on review.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can accept that part of Amendment No 20 that would insert “an appropriate” into Recital 9. We do not accept the remainder of Amendment No 20. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 15, 28, 29 and 32. They seek to replace emission ceilings that are designed to meet the agreed Community target for acidification, and to protect our citizens' health, with the emission ceilings in the Gothenburg Protocol. Gothenburg ceilings fall far short of what is needed as has already been said.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that, if Member States take seriously the Kyoto commitments, the emission ceilings that it has proposed will not be difficult to implement. We may well be able to go further by 2010, but this is something that can only be decided when we know how Member States will meet their Kyoto targets. We cannot therefore accept Amendment No 31. The Commission cannot accept Amendments No 4 and 14: under the principle of subsidiarity it is for Member States, not the Commission, to determine penalties for breaches of national legislation. Furthermore, Amendment No 14 seeks to restrict the Commission's discretion under the Treaty to decide when to bring infringement proceedings.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 18 and 30 are also unacceptable. The Commission is committed to pursuing long-term objectives for protection of the environment and human health, but we simply do not have enough information today to predict when long-term objectives might be reached. The Commission must reject Amendment No 6. Emissions from international maritime traffic and cruising aircraft cannot be wholly controlled by individual Member States, nor even by Community action, and cannot therefore be included in national emission ceilings. Action where appropriate must be taken in the International Maritime Organisation or the International Civil Aviation Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the IMO agreed to a proposal from the Community to declare the North Sea a sulphur dioxide control area. The Commission will examine whether further such proposals should be made to the IMO, and whether international action is also needed on aircraft emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 7. It is based on a misleading comparison with the solvents directive, where processes may involve high temperatures. Non-volatile organic compounds are automatically excluded from the definition of “volatile organic compound” in these proposals since they are not found in the air in ambient conditions and do not contribute to ozone formation. The proposed definition is identical in the Gothenburg Protocol. We must maintain technical consistency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendment No 10. It would remove an essential obligation for Member States regularly to update emission inventories.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, we do not accept Amendment No 22. The Commission's proposed wording on the key issue of public information is in line with agreements on the first two air quality daughter directives.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to answer Mrs Oomen-Ruijten because she asked about the proposals on large combustion plants. The answer is that the Council failed to reach a common position in December and the Commission is supporting the Portuguese presidency in its effort to make progress in parallel with the progress on this proposal.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
