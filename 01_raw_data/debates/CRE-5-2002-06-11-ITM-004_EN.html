<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roth-Behrendt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, I hope we will manage today to conclude a legislative process that was first discussed in Parliament a number of years ago. This legislation is, of course, concerned with the protection of health, and we all naturally want cosmetic products – soaps, shampoos, perfumes – to be healthy, which means not presenting any hazard to the people who use them.</p>
<p class="contents">All Members of this House have a natural interest in making the European cosmetics industry competitive and keeping it that way. We have, of course, always borne in mind that jobs are tied in with the manufacture of cosmetics and that these jobs deserve to be safeguarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Presenting as rapporteur the committee's second reading to Parliament today, I can tell you that the committee adopted it by 44 votes in favour, with two abstentions, that is to say, with a very, very large majority right across all the political groups. That is the way we want it.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we want to achieve here today? We want this second reading to alter the Council's Common Position, which is poor, feeble, and far from forward-looking. The Ministers of the Member States, assembled in Council, have missed their chance to set a course and also to hear what their peoples want.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, do the people of Europe want? If you were to conduct a survey, it is likely that you would, in many countries, hear very diverse opinions. Most, though, would agree that there is a sufficient choice of soaps, deodorants, perfumes, and lipsticks. We do not need hundreds and thousands of them if animals have to undergo lengthy torture to produce them. So let there be a stop to animal experiments in the field of cosmetics. You would certainly find an overwhelming majority of the public in favour of that, and in Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Right, we said in the committee second reading, let there be no more animal experiments in the field of cosmetics. We also go even further and say that, from a certain point, sales of cosmetics tested on animals must cease. We are convinced that this is the only way that we will step up pressure in favour of alternative methods of testing and on the search for tests in which animals are not tortured, in which animals do not have to suffer.</p>
<p class="contents">What do we want in addition to that? We want perfumed ingredients that bring out allergic reactions in people and are recognised by experts as allergenic, to be indicated on labels. Not in the least do we want to ban them. We want them to be labelled so that people with allergies can make their choice. We also want consumers to be better able to ascertain how long cosmetics will last, so that they know, when they open a cosmetic or a sun cream, whether they will be able to use the product next year or whether it will have become harmful to health or have lost its effectiveness. All groups in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy were very much of one mind on these various proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, when we vote at noon today, we too will be united in an overwhelming majority that will show the Council how very poor we consider its Common Position to be. I would have liked the Commission and Commissioner Liikanen to have been a bit more courageous and not waited for an absolute majority at second reading in Parliament to force them to change their mind. I would have liked the Commission to have demonstrated a bit more flexibility and courage on some points, as, in my experience, Mr Liikanen otherwise usually does. I hope that we here are at least in agreement that this partnership works.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now also like to say something about this partnership. There is indeed a great deal of disagreement in this House, and some of us still maintain that disagreements are a good thing, in that they make clear to the public the differences between us and the reasons why they should vote for one party or for another. I must admit that I am, at the moment, more concerned about the matter in hand. I am very grateful to members of the other groups for their cooperation, which has been extremely fair and thoroughly accommodating. Looking up at the representatives of the cosmetics industry, who are sitting up in the gallery and waiting with understandable interest to see what is to be decided today, I can only say that I value the largely fair cooperation afforded by the cosmetics industry, who have an important stake in these matters, and I know that constructive cooperation also builds trust.</p>
<p class="contents">All the bodies which have played their part so far – Parliament, industry, consumers' organisations, and also the organisations representing people with allergies – are convinced that Parliament, today at noon, will have a unique chance to at last enact a law that will, in a couple of years, activate legislation that people want and need. I hope that, at noon today, we will be courageous enough to show this to the Council and the Commission by an overwhelming majority. My dear colleagues in other groups, you will have my support in doing so. I hope that I will also have yours. We will confirm this today and, if necessary, in a conciliation procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last revision was the sixth, in 1993. The issues I am referring to are the prohibition of animal experimentation and the prohibition of the marketing within the European Union of products which have been tested on animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur, Mrs Roth-Behrendt, has worked hard and seriously, maintaining the coherence of the Commission’s text and improving it, particularly in view of the illogical proposal of lifting the prohibition on marketing.</p>
<p class="contents">My group has always supported this amendment and has agreed with the rapporteur that, after so many years of work and unfulfilled expectations in relation to ending animal experimentation, we must deal with this issue once and for all, setting precise timescales, urging and motivating the cosmetics industry to mobilise all its available resources so that, without in any way jeopardising the safety of its products, experiments on animals will be stopped for good as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Peoples’ Party, however, has always believed that full compliance with this directive made it necessary for the rapporteur’s initial proposal to show a degree of flexibility, while allowing for certain exceptions since, although it is true that the majority of cosmetic products offer the consumer complete safety without their ingredients having to be tested on animals, there are certain cases in which scientists have still not been able to find reliable alternative methods for particular products which are not totally superfluous, such as sun products or creams, which provide a degree of protection from sunlight.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the work not just of my group but of all the parliamentary groups has focused on the identification of these cases and their incorporation into the text of the directive, and the rapporteur has been highly receptive to this. Without allowing the cosmetics industry to delay eliminating its animal experimentation practices, the proposal for a directive allows exceptions for very specific tests and for a maximum period of ten years.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, I believe that this amendment has the support of the whole of the European Peoples’ Party and that, when it comes to it, it will have the support of the whole House. I am convinced that a vote in favour by the European Parliament, not just in relation to this amendment, but the whole of the proposal, will finally bring into being regulations which combine animal protection and consumer protection in a balanced and fair manner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No other issue has taken Parliament so long to deal with as that of animal testing in the matter of cosmetic products.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think the message that should go back to the Member States is that this Parliament believes that, until we get serious, the industry will not get truly serious. I accept that there are a large number of areas where there is cause for concern in terms of medical research and extremely difficult and serious tests for which no valid alternatives have yet been produced. But I remain convinced that, unless we are able to send a clear signal by reasserting the position we took at first reading, there will not be that incentive that comes from the clear knowledge that these sanctions are there and will be implemented. The test ban and the marketing ban have not been complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot afford further delays. I would say to everyone, including the Member States who tried very hard to bring us a common position that we could accept, we still have to try harder. The answer is to send a signal at second reading, so that the rapporteur and our colleagues of all parties have the strongest possible negotiating position when we come to one of the most serious processes of conciliation we have ever had in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Davies (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, animal testing is carried out on a huge scale across the European Union and the world to ensure that products like chemicals and new medicines and pharmaceuticals are safe for humans to use. The public has long made clear that it wants an end to animal testing for no better purpose than to ensure the development of yet more vanity products to fill our bathroom shelves, such as all the deodorants, soaps, and hair shampoos to be found on supermarket shelves.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet this debate has dragged on year after year with it becoming increasingly difficult for the public's wish to be turned into practice. Now we have a classic conflict between the Parliament, which has made it clear that it wants an end to animal testing, and the Council, which has done its best to ensure that no marketing ban is introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made it quite clear that an animal testing ban within the European Union alone is insufficient. It simply means that animals will be tested upon in countries outside the European Union where no proper supervision can be undertaken. A marketing ban has to be introduced, pressure has to be put on industry to ensure that new alternatives are developed. The proposals being put forward by the EPP have been particularly helpful.</p>
<p class="contents">My group will be supporting Mrs Roth-Behrendt's call for a marketing ban to be introduced at the earliest moment. However it is likely that it will be the EPP amendment which goes through today. That leaves open the option for us all of an ambitious and yet realistic settlement, an agreement between the Parliament and the Council which can end this matter once and for all, putting pressure on the industry but not creating insoluble problems. I hope that today in the vote later in this plenary we can once and for all put an end to this issue and put an end to unnecessary animal suffering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is completely unacceptable to torture animals in order to, supposedly, improve ourselves. Contrary to what the cosmetics industry states, it is possible to produce and sell safe products whose ingredients have not been tested on animals. Many companies moved away from these archaic practices years ago and the overwhelming majority of consumers want an immediate ban. It is unfortunate, therefore, that both the Commission and the Council are still taking the side of the cosmetics industry and those responsible for profit-driven torture of animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed ban would apply only to products tested in the EU and would allow companies to export testing to other parts of the world. This is unacceptable. We want the practice to stop, not to be relocated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's failure to implement a marketing and test ban – which was meant to come into effect in 1998 – is completely unacceptable, and to argue that a marketing ban would face problems in the WTO is nonsense. There is a legal precedent. The adoption of the Dog and Cat Fur Act in the US showed that animal welfare can be a legitimate reason for restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as labelling goes, I am very disappointed that the Council did not adopt Parliament's recommendation in the first reading that "tested on animals" should be clearly stated on the product label. The consumer has a right to know this.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to CMR substances, which are allowed in cosmetics, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy reaffirmed its first reading request to ban CMRs in cosmetics unless evaluated and accepted as safe by the Scientific Committee. In fact, the committee's position on CMR substances has been strengthened in line with the latest position of the Scientific Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the fact that the Commission recently banned CMRs in its review of chemical directives but has included it as an exemption, it is ridiculous that a substance can be banned from paint and polish but not from something that is put on your body. It is completely hypocritical to argue for the continued torture of animals in the interests of safety, whilst at the same time allowing dangerous products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that animal experiments should be restricted to those areas in which they are of vital importance to human health, for example that of medical products. Obviously, animal experiments must not take place in connection with cosmetic products.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore in favour both of a total ban on such animal experiments and of a marketing ban. It must also be realised that an effective ban of this kind in the EU would have a very beneficial effect on the whole of the world market. It would provide arguments in the global market for completely doing away with animal experiments in this area. It would show that there are alternatives.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue has been discussed for a long time, indeed for too long. I am amazed at the Commission’s attitude, which must be characterised as antiquated, and at the failure to realise that it is time to take this decision. A genuine decision in favour of a marketing ban would expedite technical developments leading to alternatives. That is in itself something positive.</p>
<p class="contents">The possibility has been mentioned of a conflict with the WTO. I think the risk was exaggerated earlier on but, if a decision of this kind is challenged in the WTO, it is obviously a battle in which the European Union must engage, and engage in fully, for it would be an important conflict of principle concerning the right to enable animal and human health to take precedence over the free market. That is a right one should of course be prepared to fight for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With regard to the majority of them, we believe that we cannot make any exception to the fundamental ideals relating to growth and civilisation in which we firmly believe and which Parliament has never failed to uphold.</p>
<p class="contents">This applies to animal experimentation, amongst other practices, where continuing to fail to apply a limit, thereby delaying research into alternative methods of experimentation, means failing to encourage research itself and continuing to use practices which are in conflict with those goals of prosperity and civilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The only point in Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s report which I do not understand is the point relating to Amendment No 28, previously Amendment No 26, to the Commission text, which contains the list of allergenic substances. Clearly, the respect to be shown towards animals must also be shown in equal measure to human beings, and it is therefore our responsibility to place a limit on the use of substances with proven allergenic capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of the 23 substances listed in the amendment, there are certainly 13, as the rapporteur rightly points out, with proven allergenic capacity, and it is therefore justified to place a limit on their content in products. Then there are another 13 whose excessive toxicity has yet to be proved, as the rapporteur implies, moreover, specifying that the Scientific Committee has recommended limits to be placed on their use, purely as a precautionary measure and pending more thorough analysis. This is an indirect precaution in the sense that there can be absolutely no risk of toxicity – always assuming that their might have been – in the use of these ingredients according to the limits laid down. The fact is that these last 13 substances include 11 defined as natural essential oils which may as well not be used at all as be used in the quantities laid down, and the concern is therefore not that the quality of the product will suffer but that local farming economies, particularly in the south of Europe and particularly in France and Italy, which produce the basic ingredients – jasmine, citrus fruit in general and bergamot, in particular – will be wiped out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that all animals are God’s creatures. Accordingly, each animal should be treated by us with respect and not – as is unfortunately often the case these days – used as a disposable item. I am convinced that we received animals to use as food and – insofar as strictly necessary – to develop and test medicines. Any other use of animals, or should I say, abuse of animals, is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore in favour of a European ban on the use of animal testing for cosmetic products. However, unlike the Council, we are of the opinion that a European testing ban alone is not sufficient, because this means that animal tests outside of Europe will simply continue. Only a testing ban in combination with a European trading ban on cosmetics tested on animals will force the cosmetics industry to look seriously into developing alternative methods. However, I would like to note in this connection that we must ensure that producers in developing countries are not treated any worse than European producers, particularly as this contravenes the WTO regulations. It is therefore of major importance for countries outside of Europe to be brought up-to-date in good time in order to be able to comply with the bans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore ask you to vote in favour of Mrs Roth-Behrendt’s proposal. In this way, we send a clear message to the Council that we believe that only in this way can unnecessary and unacceptable animal suffering which accompanies the development and sales of cosmetics be brought to an end. Let us hope that with this, after years of unnecessary delays, the abuses in this sector will come to an end. I thank you for your attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This House decided that as long ago as 1993, but at that time we had a weak partner alongside us. It appears that we still do. The weak partner in question is the Commission, which has, over recent years, not got a grip on consistently putting these European resolutions across at the WTO and getting our partners there to grasp soon enough that we are ready to go ahead. We want to force them to take positive action.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, Mr Liikanen – despite the high personal regard I have for you – I find your presentation very disappointing and hope that our next debate will see us at last getting a ban on animal experiments, which as far as I am concerned could be in five or six years' time. What is crucial, though, is that, after those five or six years have elapsed, the cut-off point must be reached. Everyone must be aware that, after five or six years, experiments on animals will be over, apart from those scientifically-justified exceptions that we intend to lay down here and now. We know that there is an exception to every rule, but exceptions must remain just that and nothing more. That is why we cannot, in five years' time, have a new document presented to us and the debate starting all over again from the beginning. We cannot explain it to our children and nor can we explain it to the animal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has enough clout to sort this out at a sufficiently early stage with our WTO partners around the world. Our experience with leghold traps, and traps with animal skins, is an outstanding demonstration of this. If we involve our WTO partners in the debate at an early enough stage rather than take them by surprise, a way can very well be found. Commissioner, I really would like to encourage you to go down this road. You are in character enough of a man to play the part of an outrider throughout the world. I very much want to motivate you to do that.</p>

<p class="contents">It is unfortunate that compromises are required in this respect. Labelling on all products tested on animals must now become compulsory with immediate effect. It is of major importance for industry, science and the government to invest more in alternative methods, as far too little use is still being made of current knowledge due to this approach. The validation procedures must be accelerated. Forty thousand animals annually are forty thousand animals too many. The replacement, reduction and refinement of animal tests are a question of civilisation. Animals are far too beautiful to be treated so dreadfully. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr van den Bos said a moment ago, forty thousand animal tests annually are forty thousand too many. Twenty-five years ago, the Body Shop launched cosmetics that were not tested on animals. It has proved for 25 years that it is possible. This Body Shop policy should now become standard European policy. At the earliest opportunity. It is beyond me why the Christian-Democrats want to wait for another ten years. If we really want this, we simply have to say: as soon as possible.

What they are is never spoken aloud. It is nevertheless well known that Bush’s values do not incorporate a high level of commercial ethics. There are no moral values in the United States that can be used to justify hormone-free food, plant varieties that are not genetically modified or cosmetics that have not been tested on animals.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Council common position on effecting a marketing ban on animal-tested cosmetics, subject to permission by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, is untenable. At the OECD, decisions are taken on the basis of unanimity and they do not have to be explained. That makes it possible for the USA to dictate to the EU on the question of values. It would be more honest to clarify whether a marketing ban on animal-tested cosmetics is incompatible with WTO rules. If necessary the matter could be referred to the WTO’s dispute settlement procedure where a ban could be upheld without the opposing party being able to dictate the final outcome alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The WTO must look into whether world trade is also possible with reference to ethical criteria.

<p class="contents">What we need and what this report brings us towards is a ban on the marketing of products tested on animals. Of course, what we need is to ensure that safety is our key criterion.

<p class="contents">Our amendments would ban with immediate effect those tests for which alternatives have been validated. It would set a deadline for each of the others, according to the stage reached in the process of validating an alternative, up to a maximum of five years.

It is just as likely that a marketing ban will prove to be "WTO-secure" as it will "WTO-insecure". The point is this: the arguments about WTO rules are purely hypothetical. It is not entirely appropriate in my view to move from the arguments of substance for and against a marketing ban to a much more convoluted and esoteric debate about WTO law. A more honest approach – the approach advocated by this Parliament – is to adopt a marketing ban as soon as possible, and then deal with the WTO aspects separately in the unlikely event that our laws are successfully challenged in the WTO.

<p class="contents">First we are told that, yes, the end will be in 1998, then it is 2000, next 2002, and now you come along with a presentation and have absolutely nothing to say. How on earth do you think industrialists work? Such a thing could only occur to a functionary who has never had to put even a brass farthing into his own industry. The potential has been there for ages for European industry to have a whole new boom in cosmetics. It is you who have prevented it! In 1996, four million people signed up; they were artists and beautiful women who like using cosmetics. Now you come along and tell us that, in the European Union, we do not want to torture animals any more; instead, we will do it just over the border. This Parliament, the artists, the beautiful women – how stupid do you think we are? What do you take us for? Do you really think we are the sort of racists and xenophobes who will not have dumb beasts tormented here in the European Union, but will let it happen to dogs in Hungary or Poland? That strikes me as monstrous, and as an insult to the four million people who signed their names to protest against such things.</p>
<p class="contents">You know, there is a fine saying to the effect that ‘the day will come when men will look upon the murder of animals as they now look upon the murder of men.’ That was not said by some crazy animal rights activist, but by Leonardo da Vinci, perhaps the greatest artist who ever lived. Never again, Commissioner, will you be referred to in the same sentence as Leonardo da Vinci.

This report formalised proposals on issues on which the Commission proposal was not sufficiently wide-ranging or ambitious and the common position has once again failed to take up some of these proposals. I therefore feel that there are three matters to which Parliament must draw the attention of both the Commission and the Council. Firstly, the need to ban all potentially carcinogenic or toxic substances in cosmetic products; secondly, a ban on the use of fragrances in products specifically designed for children, given the risks of allergic reaction potentially associated with these fragrances; and, thirdly, the hottest topic of this debate; testing products on animals.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, both the Council and the Commission’s positions are unacceptable. On the one hand, the Commission is taking a step backwards with regard to previous legislation; in other words, when faced with non-compliance with previous legislation, the Commission prefers to stop talking about a marketing ban. Where the Council is concerned, a step forwards has been taken, because it has referred to the OECD the regulation of a matter that falls to the European Union to define. I do not know whether this recourse to the OECD is just another symptom of the intergovernmental shift that has been affecting the Council of late and I therefore believe that the rapporteur’s position is the most appropriate one: we must ban testing on animals in Europe, we must move towards a ban on the marketing of these products and towards alternative methods. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In brief, we need to make sure we vote in favour of the amendments which allow alternative methods to be used, especially for toxicity and reproduction, for which there are currently no satisfactory alternative tests. For the rest, I too am in complete agreement with the rapporteur that, where there are alternative methods which allow animal testing to be avoided, we should use these alternative <span class="italic">in vitro</span> methods. Consequently, what I and my fellow Members who tabled this amendment are trying to do is to allow alternative methods to be used, but not in cases in which there is no alternative to animal testing. I must point out that the first priority is human health and then, of course, respect and protection for animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that Parliament will vote in favour of these amendments which give us this facility until such time as these tests can be replaced by alternative <span class="italic">in vitro</span> methods. I must reiterate and stress that, as there are no satisfactory <span class="italic">in vitro</span> methods available, it would be irresponsible and absurd to do away with every facility for which there is, as yet, no alternative method. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unacceptable that when we are making such enormous scientific advances we still accept the infliction of pain on small animals in order to find out whether a new face cream is safe.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to express my strong support for the report. The rapporteur has struck the right compromise: the ban would not be immediate but could come into force in five years, and that means that, in effect, we have given the companies concerned at least 15 years' notice since we first started discussing this about ten years ago. I also support the idea that we should demonstrate our own responsibility – a concept which is foreign to the Greens – by introducing a marketing ban as tests are developed where at present there are no alternatives available, even though we then have to set a deadline for these tests, perhaps ten years ahead. Parliament's report will give the search for alternatives a new urgency.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions to the Commission and I hope that when Mr Liikanen answers he will address himself specifically to my points on Amendments Nos 21 and 28. Mr Nisticò and Mr Nobilia raised this earlier on.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very concerned that, on the labelling of fragrances, aromas and essential oils, Amendments Nos 21 and 28 involve the introduction of unnecessary requirements which may have a very unfortunate effect on the composition of products, their continued availability and indeed the viability of some of the smaller firms that make them. The rapporteur proposes a very comprehensive system of labelling when perfumes and aromas are present in products, even in tiny amounts. In fact, although this is designed to protect the few consumers who have allergies to certain fragrances, the proposal is unlikely to provide a significant public health benefit. There may be no safe fragrance for some allergic individuals. The best they can do, as they well know, is to steer clear of products with fragrances in them altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur is reacting to representations by the European Consumer Bureau, which says it is putting the case for allergy sufferers and clearly sees the issue as part of its war on chemicals. I have to say that I have received no representations from allergy sufferers on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Flavour and Fragrance Association points out that the amendments will saddle consumers with products carrying references to up to 50 ingredients in 11 languages. This is stupid and unnecessary. Furthermore, there is a danger that some essential oils would be removed from formulations, thus damaging the economic interests of some countries, including some very poor countries. These amendments are a bad and unnecessary deal for consumers and the industry. I hope that the rapporteur will consider withdrawing them and that the Commission and the Council will reject them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been a very lively debate, characterised by emotion and level-headedness, and touching on various points. For that I am very grateful to the Members of this House who have spoken. I am grateful to Mrs Flemming for making me aware of what Leonardo da Vinci said, and I have been constantly trying to think up points of similarity between him and Mr Liikanen, who, when he responds, will perhaps astonish us by telling us that the two of them have much in common and that he, in the depths of his heart, actually has great sympathy with Parliament's proposal. I am very grateful to all the Members who have supported me and a similar number of whom will, I hope, support the proposals when we vote at noon today. Should cosmetic amendments – and ‘cosmetic’ is the appropriate word – be necessary, I am convinced that we will have to make them in the course of the conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly address the points made by Mr Nobilia and, at the end, Mrs Jackson. I have to tell Mrs Jackson that I could not withdraw the amendments even if I wanted to, because the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy had adopted them with 44 votes in their favour. It has therefore now become the Committee's position and not just my own, and I have to make a true and faithful report of that to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say in addition that I am a lawyer rather than a natural scientist, and so I have done something very simple. I have borrowed the position of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetology, composed of European Union scientists, who have established that 26 substances result in allergic reactions, 13 of them to a severe degree. That labels should indicate the presence of these substances I find the most utterly obvious thing in the world. We have labels for nuts in chocolate and everything else for people who suffer from allergies, and we have to have labels for this as well. The aromatic oils industry having belatedly woken up to this, I can well understand why, three days before the vote, it was trying to influence us. I do not want to ban its products, but I do want the substances listed, in one language rather than in eleven, and with their chemical names, in the list of ingredients, which is, incidentally, what the Scientific Committee on Cosmetics proposed. It is my conviction that we owe that to the European Union's consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The wish expressed by Parliament in its opinion for the first reading to improve consumer protection has, to a large extent, been taken into account in the common position. That said, I am aware that Parliament's assessment might be different and I fully respect it, as has been confirmed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and Council welcome in particular the proposals relating to some categories of products, such as products for children or intimate hygiene or the extension of the minimum durability date requirement. They would be of clear benefit to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission shares Parliament's concerns on the use of substances classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction (CMR). The cosmetics directive already regulates the use of CMR substances in a sectoral manner.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to find a consistent and sustainable solution for the substances specific provisions have been introduced to strengthen the legal framework, while complying with the key principle of risk assessment. Furthermore, the Commission has proposed new measures on these new substances in its White Paper on the new chemicals policy and we are now working on concrete proposals with my colleague, Mrs Wallström.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the fragrance allergies issue, the Commission and Council welcome the introduction of a labelling system for allergenic fragrance ingredients. This will improve the current labelling requirements to allow consumers who are sensitive to certain ingredients to avoid products containing them.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the issue of animal testing, we all know how difficult and sensitive it is, especially because it creates a great deal of concern among the public. We all share the objective to reduce animal pain inflicted during experimentation.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue is linked to many other policy areas and we are therefore working in constant and close cooperation with my colleagues, Mr Byrne and Mr Lamy, who are responsible for health and consumer protection and trade issues respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council common position compromise has taken these aspects into account in a new global approach. It leads to a balanced solution offering a genuine benefit to animal welfare, whilst safeguarding consumer health and taking into account the impact of our internal decisions at international level. We thought that this approach would be a positive step and give a political signal that your concerns have been considered, as it reintroduced a marketing ban.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed solution to ban animal testing within the EU whenever possible and to make mandatory use of all alternative methods at the earliest opportunity seemed an improvement. It will lead to the management of animal testing within the European Union, thereby answering the criticism of exporting the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Acceptable validated alternative methods are still lacking for a number of key toxicological parameters. They are necessary for a full health risk assessment of cosmetic ingredients to ensure a high level of consumer protection. It is impossible to predict when all the necessary alternative methods might be available.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the European Union is bound to ensure compliance with its international obligations, but an essential objective is to provide the highest possible level of safety. A total ban on all animal testing would endanger the safety of cosmetics and therefore human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The marketing ban, linked to the acceptance at OECD level and excluding any cut-off date, reduces the risk of a challenge under the disputes settlement system of WTO. The European Union, with the strong support of the European Parliament, is seeking to promote considerations relating to the welfare of animals with the WTO. However, this proposal has so far found very little support among the WTO members.</p>
<p class="contents">Some colleagues have argued that the EU should implement such a ban and see whether it is challenged by other WTO members and then if necessary consider the measure in the light of WTO opposition. I put the question to my colleagues who are responsible for WTO relations and their reply is as follows: Such a course of action has a political cost. We would reinforce the suspicion already widespread among developing countries that, regardless of their commitments in the WTO agreements, developed countries intend to use their trade power to impose their own ethical priorities and values on others. To provoke a WTO case under those circumstances might, therefore, be counterproductive, increasing the polarisation between developing and developed countries and reducing the chances of success of the EU's effort to bring such matters as animal welfare and environmental and social considerations into the WTO discussions. That is the opinion of my colleagues who are responsible for this field in WTO relations.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that further work, in close cooperation between Parliament and the Council and Commission, will finally lead to a balanced solution that genuinely benefits animal welfare while safeguarding consumer health and our international commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Jackson put two detailed questions on Amendments Nos 21 and 28. On the second part of Amendment No 28, we could accept in principle the listing of these recognised fragrance allergens in Annex 3, according to the suggested modalities, but it should be in the form of a Commission directive. The Commission would reject the first part.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposed amendment to Annex 3 has to be implemented via a Commission directive adapting technical progress adopted under the comitology procedure. As far as Amendment No 21 on fragrance listing is concerned, this amendment requires a full ingredient listing, including perfume composition.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the large number of ingredients in fragrance compositions, indicating all the fragrance ingredients on the labelling would neither be feasible nor helpful to consumers or dermatologists and would be disproportionate to the anticipated risks. Furthermore this deletion would remove the legal basis for requesting that fragrances with potential allergenic effects be indicated as requested in Amendment No 26, which has been introduced in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept in principle Amendment No 1, first part, Amendment No 5, first part, Amendment No 27, second part and Amendment No 28, second part. However, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, second part, Amendments Nos 2 to 5, second part, Amendments Nos 6 to 27, first part, Amendment No 28, first part, and Amendments Nos 29 to 33. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
