<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hatzidakis (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, all the political groups have now agreed to debate this issue and have tabled a joint resolution. I think this is extremely important, as is the fact that the Socialists have changed their initial position, because the sinking of the Express Samina has not only shocked Greece, it has shocked the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not debating here merely in order to express our sorrow; the main subject of our debate is what happened, why it happened and how we can rectify the situation, how the Commission and the European Parliament can help from now on to ensure that the same does not happen again in the future. There can be no doubt that the human factor played a decisive part. However, there are aspects of the accident which, in my view, prove that Community law has been infringed. The directive on the registration of passengers was infringed. The Minister has admitted as much, the Prime Minister admitted as much yesterday in Parliament and I hope that the Socialist Group in the European Parliament will admit as much. The directive on life-saving equipment, life-jackets and life-rafts was infringed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, on Sunday, three hours before the deadline for applying Directive 98/18 expired, some 50 Greek ships were taken out of service by the Ministry of Merchant Marine. What amazes me is that the Government and the company both insist that the Express Samina complied with all the safety requirements. In other words, had it not sunk, it would still be sailing. The government itself says so.</p>
<p class="contents">So what are we calling for? We are calling mainly for three things. Firstly, full application of Directive 98/41 on the registration of passengers. Secondly, a shorter timetable for Directive 98/18 so that there are no longer any derogations for Member States, as has been the case to date with Greece. Parliament consented at second reading under pressure from the Greek government at the time. Mr Stenmark remembers and can testify to this. And, of course, we are calling for an end to the derogation for Greece on cabotage, the monopoly and oligopoly arrangements governing transport by sea. Greek cabotage operators are running their new ships on the routes to Italy, where there is competition, and their old ships on the Greek routes, where there is no competition, and that is how safety standards drop.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to point out that all the Greek MEPs have now reacted against this situation. We do not consider that everything is a mess in Greece; there are some very good ships and the overwhelming majority of Greek seamen are very good at their job. We have tabled the motion as an expression of our awareness of the issue and our intention to fight for Greece to adopt even higher safety standards than the European Union in order to correct this negative impression of our country.</p>
<p class="contents">Three amendments have been proposed by the GUE/NGL Group, one on shipping registers, one on working conditions and one on an <span class="italic">in situ</span> investigation by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We disagree mainly on technical grounds, which I do not have time to go into now, but would be happy to explain privately to my fellow Members. The problems are technical rather than political: for example, as far as shipping registers are concerned, the resolution already contains a reference to them and there is no need to repeat it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We feel that the word of the European Parliament needs weight if it is to be more than passing comment. Besides, our Parliament does the same every time a sad incident such as this happens. Must it continue to do so? Someone said in the House the other day that we do not want to debate shipping safety. But has there ever been or will there ever be an in-depth debate in 2 or 3 minutes under the urgent procedure? In deference to the House’s decision the other day, we sat round the table and thrashed out a joint text which, I admit, was only made possible by the cooperation and good faith of all the groups. This final text expresses our sorrow, which was expressed at the start by our President, Mrs Fontaine, and takes account of the statements by the Commission and the call on the Greek Government for full information and a full investigation, which has already begun. It also stresses the importance of applying safety regulations and our scepticism about all forms of derogation. But, surely, this is precisely what our proactive Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is doing and – as we all know – it needs serious and often time-consuming dialogue and procedures in order to decide what needs to be done on each occasion. Is it that easy to decide what needs to be done about shipping under an urgent procedure?</p>
<p class="contents">Nor was the need for urgent procedure justified after the event, given that the compromise text contains no references which might have been misunderstood as urgent party politics against the Greek Government, precisely as the result of the good faith which, as I have said, was demonstrated on all sides. So the question remains. What have we gained from the text which would have been lost had the resolution not been urgent?</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, Mr President, we have agreed to this joint proposal for a resolution, which we support as it stands, urgently, and we of course disagree with the amendments tabled, again urgently, for the reasons which I have stated. And as far as shipping is concerned, in deference to the memory of the innocent victims of the Express Samina, we shall support and take the lead in any action which targets personal safety and environmental protection and tries to do more than just make an impression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But what really irritates and angers me are shortcomings, imperfections, derogations and the problems which this sinking has brought to light and that is why we need to debate them; I do not know if it will be under the urgent procedure but, in essence, it must be as quickly as possible. And they do not only concern Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to debate and to call, as we do in the resolution, for the absolute application – with no derogations – of Community legislation, which is inadequate and needs to be enriched; we need to call for and encourage modernisation and improvements in port infrastructures, crew training in modern equipment, crews which, I should like to add, Mr President, are among the most experienced in the world. Of course, we also need to reorganise and refine administrative monitoring, control and sanctioning procedures. Mr Papoutsis has already “dismantled” a very important directorate in his ministry, the Directorate of Merchant Ship Surveys. It is only a very small first step, I know, and other steps are needed.</p>
<p class="contents">And because all this concerns Greece, which has the biggest shipping sector in the European Union, it basically concerns the safety of all types of shipping throughout the Union. Which is why we are impatient to receive the recent decisions finally taken by the Council and we are impatient to receive them in legislative form in Parliament also, which is why we feel that it would be useful if a parliamentary committee were to go to Greece and work with the authorities, agencies and professionals to see where the difficulties lie – it is the most experienced country when it comes to shipping – so that it can assist the European Parliament in helping to improve, enhance and introduce stricter legislation for the safety of shipping throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Of course, accidents at sea happen, human errors are made; but what is most important, Mr President, is for us to see, when a human error is made, if the right action was taken before and after the error. In other words, in the present case, if the right inspections were carried out and the right certificates issued for the ship, if the life-jackets were in the right places, if the crew was doing its job. There is a whole series of things which need looking at right away, especially if Community legislation was also infringed. In my view, the Greek competition committee has never acted in cases in which it should have acted. Of course, I know it is not a matter for the Commission, because the Commission acts in cases of competition at European Union level, but my question is this: how is it possible for a competition committee appointed by the Minister, a committee already in place, to have done nothing and to gradually have allowed a shipping monopoly to emerge? And, as we know, monopolies, be they private or state monopolies, are a bad thing. In the present case they are bad for both freight and passenger shipping.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that the factor which needs to be quantified here as the result of this tragic incident, is what needs to be done at European Union level, because the bigger picture is the safety of shipping in the European Union. I should like to say, as far as the resolution is concerned, because there are a number of amendments, that my amendment on shipping registers is covered in the text, it is already there. As far as my amendment on working conditions is concerned, there is a directive on this and the wording of the amendment is less satisfactory than the text. And finally, the visit by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism is not, I think, the answer to our prayers; it is up to the European Commission to investigate and ascertain if a Community directive has been infringed, to hurry up with the case law which we want to see in order to make shipping safer and, finally, to do whatever needs to be done and, as I said, to investigate the matter of this famous competition committee. That is what we are waiting to hear from the European Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Socialist transport team, I regret the fact that this debate is taking place as an urgency. It could be more properly debated in committee next week, but that was the decision of the House which, of course, I respect.</p>
<p class="contents">What we certainly do not need today, or indeed next week, or in the future, is a point-scoring exercise between our Greek colleagues in the run-up to the general election in Greece. That serves no one's interest. This is not a concern solely for Greece. It is a matter for Europe as a whole. This was an accident waiting to happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of us have worked on the issue of ferry safety for many years, not least because other ferries in other parts of Europe have also sunk with a tragic loss of life, be it the<span class="italic"> Herald of Free Enterprise</span>, the<span class="italic"> Scandinavian Star</span> or, of course, most notoriously of all, the<span class="italic"> Estonia</span> in the 1990s. All these demonstrate that ferries are not safe enough. In our view, this tragedy could well happen again. Not because we have too few laws in Europe, but because the laws are not properly enforced. It is not just Greece. There are other Member States that do not comply with maritime safety laws and if I may, I will name some: Italy, Belgium, Denmark, Ireland and the Presidency, France, are all failing to implement the port-state control directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope today, and in the coming days and weeks, we will hear from the Commission on what action they propose to take against these Member States that do not take maritime safety seriously. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is human nature to be the more affected by a tragedy the closer it comes to one. If I speak with special feeling in this debate, it is because over the years Greece has become another home to me. I have had many opportunities during this time to observe just how skilful Greek seamanship can be. But the issue cannot be localised in this way. In recent years many other lives have been lost at sea in our waters, not only by way of major ferry disasters but, on all too frequent a basis, from amongst our fishing communities. That is why we have to address issues of maritime safety more generally and in the constructive way suggested in this motion. I, too, would put particular stress on the need to implement properly the legislation we already have. I would ask that we become even more cautious than we ever have been before about allowing derogations from future legislation where matters of safety are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor are such issues important only for those of us who come from areas where the sea is our highway or our place of work. They are important for us all, even when we are not immediately affected. This is so, if only because, in the words of the early English poet, John Donne, any man's death diminishes me because I am part of mankind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our thoughts are very much with them at this particular time.</p>
<p class="contents">As a Member who represents Scotland, I feel a particular sadness and concern too about these events. Although Scotland and Greece sit at the furthest edges of the European Union, we nevertheless share a common topography. Both our countries have many island communities around our shores and as such the people of Scotland's islands felt a particular sense of shock following the recent events in Greece.</p>
<p class="contents">Our island communities depend on ferry services as an absolute lifeline. These ships provide transport for passengers and goods and ensure the sustainability of some of Europe's most remote and fragile communities. It is the duty of Member States to make sure that the owners and operators of ferries are aware of their responsibilities for the safe passage of people and goods.</p>
<p class="contents">We are fortunate in Scotland not to have directly suffered the type of tragedy to hit Greece but we are only too well aware that our waters are some of the most hazardous in Europe. We have many concerns about the forthcoming tendering process which is under way. I should like to ask the Commission for some assurance that in tendering for lifeline ferry services, or indeed any ferry services, safety is given its highest priority. In the cut-throat world of tendering, all too often companies can be pushed into cost-cutting measures and I would not like to see safety measures being sacrificed. It is simply not acceptable to the northern and western isles of Scotland, nor for the potential North Sea to European mainland crossing which I hope will be established in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p class="contents">Our citizens deserve the best of safeguards in sea transport. The trade unions who represent the men and women who work on ferries, as well as representatives of our seaboard communities, ought to be involved in discussions at the pre-tender stage, so that they can play a role in ensuring that safe practice is not sacrificed for the sake of profit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It has been argued, including here in the House that the human factor was to blame. This argument is the least unacceptable. The fact that the ill-fated ship was 34 years old and was not included on the list of ships which – and this too is wrong – were exempted from the additional inspections required under Directive 98/18/ΕC, is positive proof of the unaccountability of the shipping industry which always finds a way, for which governments and regulatory authorities are to blame, of getting round even these generally inadequate regulations, at the expense of passenger and shipping safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The legal framework for shipping in Greece and in the European Union in general has proven to be inadequate and dangerous and we need new, stricter rules, especially for very old ships, rules without derogations. Equally dangerous is the modus operandi of the regulatory authorities and the shipping register which, by operating as a private, profit-making company, is basically controlled by the very shipowners it is supposed to be controlling.</p>
<p class="contents">Even the tragic shipwreck has not thrown up any useful conclusions. On the contrary, innocent victims are being exploited in order to promote shipowners’ wider objectives. Hurrying to suspend cabotage in Greek seas, as earnestly called for, including in this joint resolution, will intensify profit-seeking competition between the shipping companies, with even more tragic consequences for passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the European Parliament not to approve the suspension of cabotage by rejecting the reference to it in Paragraph 5 of the joint resolution, on which our group has requested a separate vote, and for the European Parliament to approve the involvement of crew representatives in regulatory authorities and shipping registers and the manning of ships in line with the real needs of cabotage by approving the amendments which we have tabled. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Such a disaster is always a sad event, especially if it could have been prevented. Let us therefore hope that the inquiry into the cause can give us a clear picture of the situation, at which stage it will be possible to take adequate measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Judging from the survivors and those involved, we can already draw two conclusions. Disasters at sea are often caused by a lack of maintenance and a lack of staff who are both able and aware of their responsibilities. It is particularly tragic since this tragedy can also be put down to the lifting of EU legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Greek government has now nullified this exemption. The European Union should be very wary when granting exemptions to EU legislation, particularly when public safety is at stake. I would, in this light, refer to two other southern countries that would like to join the European Union in due course. The quality of both ships and staff under their flags is rather more notorious than renowned. We cannot afford to make the same mistake again.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I would just like to say that great human suffering forces us to draw lessons from this tragedy. It is unfortunate that we still have to learn the hard way. This resolution points us in the right direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This had its effect in the 19th century, during the wars of liberation. The first Greek king was a Bavarian, and it also has its effect in the present day, in that a particularly large number of people from Bavaria go on holiday to this beautiful country. There are particularly large numbers of Bavarian tourists in Greece. Therefore it came as a double shock to us to have to see these terrible pictures and hear this dreadful news. It was a shock because families suffered so badly as a result, and because we mourn the loss of human life, but it was also a shock because it revealed a flagrant disregard for safety.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware that when something like this happens, the credibility of the European Union also comes into play. Time and again, we rightly complain that there is too much of a centralising drive in various areas. We criticise any attempts to formulate a common European tourism policy, which some people here want. That is something we can confidently leave to the Member States and regions. According to the principle of subsidiarity, tourism policy is something that should be devolved to Member State level. But what people in all countries must be able to depend on in equal measure, are safety standards. That is precisely why it is one of the European Union’s most important tasks to ensure that exceptions are no longer made where safety standards are concerned, as has obviously been the case here. We must be in no doubt that, particularly in an era of cross-border mass tourism, whether it be tunnels – where there was a spate of disasters last summer – or ships, which have been involved in a great many disasters in recent years, people expect to be able to depend on safety standards within the European Union. Human error happens all over the world. Greek sailors are excellent and famous for being of a high standard. But what we must realise is that when it comes to technical standards, there is, I am sorry to say, a degree of chaos in this region. This is the point at which the European Union and the European Parliament must take direct responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has expressed its sympathy to the families of the victims and the Greek government.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this is not the first accident of its kind in European waters and, as I am sure you know, the European Union took decisive measures after the last serious ferry accident, the Estonia disaster in 1994. A series of far-reaching provisions was introduced in order to improve the safety of ferry passengers.</p>
<p class="contents">As you will recall, the purpose of the provisions introduced at that time was to ensure: first, that passengers are registered. Secondly, that harmonised safety standards are applied, including in relation to stability and rescue equipment for inland traffic in the European Union. Thirdly, that compulsory surveys and investigations are carried out after accidents. Fourthly, that social standards are maintained on board and, fifthly, that the shipping safety code is applied to ferry operator companies.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, domestic and foreign voyages by passenger ferries to or from Union ports are covered by a complete legal framework. It is the Commission’s job to monitor the practical application of this legal framework within its remit as set out in the Treaty. The Commission therefore contacted the Greek authorities as soon as the Express Samina went down, requesting clarification of the application of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission asked the Greek authorities to check if the ships required to adopt the Community’s safety standards by 30 September had in fact done so. As a result of the check requested by the Commission, 60 ships were taken out of service pending proof of compliance with standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission fully endorses the European Parliament’s view that safety regulations applicable to passenger ferries now need to be tightened. The Member of the Commission responsible, Vice-President De Palacio, therefore intends to include the question of revising the current directive on safety standards for passenger ferries in its work programme for 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also intends to conduct a detailed examination of passenger transport liability regulations, in order to ascertain if they need to be changed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to stress that the Commission is convinced of the need to make European legislation on the safety of passenger ferries a top priority and to ensure that this legislation is applied strictly and uniformly throughout the Community. Only thus will we contain the risk of a repeat of such accidents. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
