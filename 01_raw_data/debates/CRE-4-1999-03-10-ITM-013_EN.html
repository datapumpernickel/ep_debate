<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Randzio‐Plath </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, monetary union has been with us for over ten weeks, but consumers in the EU are still finding it difficult to see the day‐to‐day advantages of monetary union for them. People travelling on business or as tourists who need to change their own national currency into another national currency – both of which after all simply represent the euro, which does not yet exist in the form of coins and banknotes – have discovered that the commissions charged on such transactions are still high, too high in fact. Their opinion is shared by the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs, following its hearing involving banks, buildings societies and consumer associations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put the following question to the Commission: was it not a fundamental mistake to ignore the European Parliament's proposals during initial consultations about what should be covered by the euro regulation? I have in mind not only the legal status of the euro and provisions on standards and international recognition of the euro, but also the issues of converting bank accounts, conversion costs and dual pricing. But above all, I have in mind the commission charged on exchange transactions. It should be possible to apply yardsticks in all these areas so that savings on exchange rate hedge costs and other costs which previously applied to transactions in the European Union, and which no longer exist today, are passed on to our consumers, customers and travellers, as a kind of bonus.</p>
<p class="contents">What strikes me is that the fee structure in the various Member States is remarkably similar. Yet in some Member States we now have commission rates of 6 %, and many people have reported different commission rates when exchanging from one national currency to another. This applies to the French franc, for example. I have also heard, for instance, that it is more expensive to change German marks into Italian lire than into French francs.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to say that both colleagues and members of the public have reported that there are banks and building societies which have ceased to offer exchange facilities, especially for certain currencies. I have heard that there are even central banks which have stopped making no‐fee exchange transactions. The Commission needs to carry out a thorough investigation of all these issues to put a stop to these practices. And I mean an investigation by the Commission itself, not one under the aegis of the European banking associations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is simply unacceptable that the introduction of the euro has not created greater confidence in monetary union on the part of our consumers, but just the opposite, it is breeding a climate of mistrust. It is high time that we had transparency. We need to know how high costs and charges were before the introduction of the euro and how high they are now after its introduction. We need an initiative from the Commission. What is more, what effect is competition having in reducing costs and charges for exchange transactions? It is scandalous that Italian banks have been given advance warning of an investigation! And can anyone claim that the Commission's investigation of only eight banks in connection with a possible cartel agreement is adequate?</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I think it is really important for the Commission to launch an initiative or take some other measures, perhaps even in the form of legislation, on maximum charges. The Commission's actions on cross‐border transfers also really leave a great deal to be desired, given that there was a political undertaking to do more than just reduce the cost of cross‐border transfers as from 15 August and to make such transfers more secure.</p>
<p class="contents">As Members of the European Parliament were are deeply concerned about all these issues, and the public expects the Commission to take some action instead of dilly‐dallying.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kestelijn‐Sierens </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the banks claim that changing coins and notes from the euro zone costs them more for transport, insurance, staff and so on. I find this hard to believe. Why? Because changing money within one and the same currency does not cost anything. For example, I do not have to pay to change a BEF 10 000 note into ten BEF 1 000 notes.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, the exchange rates for the euro zone currencies have been fixed against each other and against the euro since the beginning of the year, which means that they form part of the euro and are thus part of one and the same currency. So what is the difference? The House has been calling for there to be no charge for changing national currencies into euros because it is a compulsory exchange. We have not insisted on the same thing for exchanges between the euro zone currencies because these are voluntary.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need, in any event, is complete transparency, which should in itself lead to lower costs both for exchanges and for cross‐border payments. This must happen by 31 March this year, otherwise our group believes that we must consider introducing binding legislation so that the credibility of the euro is not undermined and consumers can enjoy the full benefits of monetary union.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (IT)</span> Madam President, even though not all the questioners are present for the discussion, the large number of oral questions on the subject of bank charges proves the importance and, if I may say so, the seriousness of this matter. Allow me to begin by summarising the situation before dealing with some specific issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Commission is being asked to take an initiative, I should like to explain the various initiatives already undertaken by it, all of them complementary with one another. First of all, the Commission fully agrees that one of the main arguments used to convince the EU"s citizens of the benefits of the single currency was the fact that the introduction of the euro would bring down costs for tourists and for businesses trading across borders. We remain absolutely convinced by the soundness of this argument.</p>
<p class="contents">Prior to the introduction of the euro, as the honourable Members know, the Commission adopted Recommendation 98/286 on banking charges for conversion to the euro. It provides that banks should not charge fees either for the conversion of accounts from the national currency of a Member State participating in the euro zone, for example from the French franc to the euro in France, or for the conversion of payments from the national currency into the European currency and vice versa. By the same token, banks may not levy different charges for services denominated in euros: in particular, they may not levy charges higher than those applying to identical services denominated in the national currency unit.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for services such as the conversion of banknotes, the recommendation establishes rules on the transparency of the fees charged. On 8 December 1998 the Commission published an initial assessment, revealing that banks throughout the euro zone were intending to abide by the recommendation. It is true that the recommendation does not specify what constitutes an acceptable level of charges, but the volume of charges currently being levied on the services in question is undeniably a cause for serious concern. As you know, we must distinguish between two types of operation: the conversion of euro zone banknotes and cross‐border payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us begin with conversion transactions. Prior to the introduction of the euro, as Mr Hendrick and Mrs Randzio‐Plath stressed in their question, conversion charges – covering the exchange‐rate risk and the costs of handling foreign banknotes – were partly concealed in the spread; clients therefore had the impression that they were paying less than was really the case. Now that the conversion rates have been set officially, banks must indicate – separately from the conversion rate – every charge that is made. The elimination of the exchange‐rate risk, deemed to represent around 15 to 20 % of the charges levied, and greater competition resulting from transparency should lead to a reduction in conversion charges, which has already happened to some extent. But this process must be accelerated.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been monitoring recent developments in this field very carefully, and has taken a number of measures to ensure that the cost of converting banknotes in the euro zone really is competitive. On 12 January 1999, I wrote to the European banking associations requesting the necessary information to compare the level of fees before and after the introduction of the euro. On 5 February, the Commission – that is, Mr de Silguy, Mrs Bonino and myself – issued a statement to the press inviting all the banks to publicise the changes they had made, before and after the introduction of the euro, to the total level of charges for banknote conversion in the euro zone and for cross‐border payments in the form of cheques, credit transfers and paper. We asked the euro‐zone banks to forward this information to the Commission by 31 March, via their European associations. Similarly, the press release of 5 February invited users of financial services to inform the Commission – by e‐mail or fax – of cases where the banks have failed to respect the legal framework of the euro or the Commission's recommendation on the transparency of bank charges.</p>
<p class="contents">My department has so far received some 200 messages. These relate to the level of fees, or to the continued existence of fees, rather than a failure to respect the legal framework or the recommendation. Mr Van Miert has since begun to investigate possible violations of the rules on competition, so as to ensure that there is competition between financial service providers in respect of exchange‐rate fees and other bank charges. This matter was specifically raised by Mr de Lassus Saint Geniès. However I would also make it plain – to Mr Gallagher and Mrs González Álvarez in particular – that there is currently no intention of taking legislative measures in this area; after all, direct intervention in the establishment of banknote conversion costs in the euro zone would be incompatible with market principles and with contractual freedom. That is the situation for the time being.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may, Madam President, I should now like to answer some of the specific questions raised by the honourable Members, implying that the present levels of charges for cross‐border services indicates that the recommendation is being ignored. As I have explained, the recommendation states that such charges must be transparent, without specifying an acceptable level. Concern over the level of charges would rather seem to indicate the opposite, namely that the banks are abiding by the recommendation on transparency, which has raised awareness about the level of charges that were previously completely or partly hidden.</p>
<p class="contents">The honourable Members wonder, furthermore, whether or not the disappearance of the exchange‐rate risk has affected the level of the charges made for such services. We have received some partial data in response to our enquiry of 12 January; we publicised these on 29 January, but by 31 March we expect to have a complete picture of the situation on the basis of the requested information. We shall report back to Parliament accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards cross‐border payments – a topic raised by Mr Gasòliba I Böhm – this is a matter of great importance, which will not disappear automatically with the introduction of euro banknotes in 2002. In a single‐currency area, it will be increasingly difficult for the public to understand why cross‐border payments in euros should be more expensive than national payments. Therefore this problem must be addressed as a matter of urgency. It is not only politically important, but also commercially important to the banks that this matter should be explored rapidly, not least through investment in cross‐border links between national retail payment systems, as pointed out by Mr Herman. The Commission is determined to act as a catalyst for all these developments; and to Mr Wolf, who asked what other initiatives are planned, I can reply that this is one. We are currently preparing a communication, to be published by May 1999, concerning the policy on payment systems in the economic and monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">Last of all, as far as cross‐border credit transfers are concerned, I would recall that the directive which Parliament helped to adopt dates from January 1997, and that in the Conciliation Committee a very late date had to be set for its entry into force: mid‐August 1999. The main reason was that this was demanded by one Member State, whereas the majority of Member States formally undertook to transpose the directive no later than the start date of the euro. However, this has not happened in most Member States, and at the ECOFIN Council on 8 February, I pointed out to the Finance Ministers that this directive needs to be implemented as soon as possible; I am following this up in writing. Therefore the Member States too bear considerable responsibility here. I would add that, according to press reports over the past few days, the French Minister of Economics and Finance intends to embark on a dialogue with all the parties affected by euro‐related bank charges. This is an encouraging sign. Given the overall context which I have described and in which – as you see – the Commission is actively pursuing a cohesive set of measures, I can assure the honourable Members that we are especially grateful for Parliament's support, not least in the form of initiatives such as the hearing which Mrs Randzio‐Plath recently organised on this issue.</p>

They are unsatisfactory for several reasons. The first of these is the fact that this is not an unexpected situation we are facing. This is not the first time the House has debated the matter. We have already looked at this issue, and we have had plenty of advance warning. More than one year before the final stage began, we had already discussed this issue – levying bank charges during the transitional stage of monetary union – many times in the House. On two occasions, Parliament reached a conclusion which it made clear to the Commission: in order to avoid unfair practices in this field, the Commission would have to use its power of initiative to prepare a regulatory instrument, a definitive regulation that would set specific limits and establish some discipline. The Commission felt that this was not necessary, that a weaker instrument would suffice – a mere recommendation – and that we should trust in the effects of competition to control the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the truth is that the situation is even more negative than the most pessimistic forecasts. The general rule in terms of charges for exchanging euro area currencies is that the charge is at least 3 % and, in many cases, it is more than 3 %. Frankly, it is difficult to see how this figure can be taken as a real cost.</p>
<p class="contents">It is difficult to believe the claim made by some banks that the exchange rate risk component in former charges only accounted for 10 % of the charge. Today, the Commissioner is telling us that it is between 15 % and 20 %. This is unbelievable. The majority of reasons banks use to continue charging handling costs, such as the cost of personnel, insurance, storage and so on, are reasons that would also be valid excuses for levying a charge for changing a 100 000 lira note into ten 10 000 lira notes. Costs are also involved in these cases, they are also non‐interest bearing assets and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">In the end, the result of such behaviour from banks will be that many people, many normal people, will come to the conclusion that the euro is not a single currency that has replaced the currencies of the 11 Member States participating in monetary union but that it is just one extra currency. It is another currency on top of their own currencies that still exist in practically the same conditions as before the euro was introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The single currency is a reality for the stock exchange and for the financial markets but not for normal people, not for tourists who need to change their money to spend it in another country. Nor is it a reality for the emigrant who is sending money to his home country and who sees that the cost of transferring money has remained the same or, in some cases, has even risen. It is as if the euro, the single currency, does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">What is at stake here, Commissioner, is something extremely important: the credibility of the single currency, the credibility of the most important operation the Union has undertaken in a very long time. This is what we are gambling with and, for this reason, we feel we should once again draw your attention to the possibility of revising the Commission"s initial approach.</p>

Obviously I appreciate the Commissioner's commitment, but I would point out that I asked the Council an urgent question on this topic in January, which has still not been answered. For over four years the Commission, Parliament and the Member States' finance ministers have been telling the public and businesses that there would be a change of scene in the Community as from the landmark date of 1 January 1999, in that the cost of moving currency – the number‐one tool of unification – would disappear. But none of this has happened! It is more expensive to change a euro‐zone currency now than it was in 1998. I could go on about this at length, but now is not the time. I have in my pocket a small example of what I am saying: like every conscientious MEP – and I am, moreover, vice‐chairman of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – I have one euro account in my own country, Italy, and another here at my workplace. I paid a cheque drawn in euros into another euro bank account, and was asked to pay not only the normal cost of the banking transaction but also the cost of converting a foreign cheque. So I called for the branch manager and asked him whether he knew, in that specific case, what the lira was. To his answer that the lira is our national currency, I replied that, on 1 January, the lira – or franc, deutschmark or peseta – in fact became the national unit of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless the banks start working towards a common currency rather than a national one, it will be hard for us to convince the public, business leaders and small traders to work in a market which – as you rightly say, Commissioner – must become not just a single market but an internal market.</p>

I also wrote a letter to the Commission on this matter prior to the issue of electronic payments coming up for discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been said on the subject of exchange‐rate charges and transfer costs. It was interesting to note the Commission's repeated assurances that it would issue a communication in May, possibly devoted exclusively to payment systems. Moreover, I think people are very surprised that we do not have an interoperable bank card or customer payment system. I hope that on the one hand the Commission, by being vigilant with regard to competition, ensures that no one is excluded from the different payment or interoperable systems to be launched in the near future and, on the other, that it makes use of all the opportunities which are available.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to suggest that while we are deciding what needs to be done, we also look into the transaction costs incurred as a result of using a credit card in another country. This is, of course, the only interoperable system which people can use when they are in another country. It is very hard to understand why the cost of using a credit card outside one's own country, but in another euro country, should be so high. I hope the Commission will give some thought to the matter. In this context, charges of 4 % and above have been mentioned.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Madam President, first of all I should like to say that one of the major arguments used to convince our EU citizens of the benefits of the single currency was the fact that the euro would reduce costs for travellers and for enterprises involved in cross‐border trade. It was widely anticipated that the elimination of exchange rate risks between the currencies of Member States within the euro zone would lead to a reduction in the costs involved in conversion transactions between these currencies. Notwithstanding these arguments, charges for exchanging euro area currencies have remained relatively high, as have bank charges for cross‐border transfers, despite the fact that all the currencies are now inextricably linked.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has consistently insisted that compulsory conversions between national currencies and the euro must be eliminated in every shape and form. It is important that the EU institutions remain vigilant on this matter. The Commission must continuously monitor, assess and publish the bank fees charged by the financial and banking sectors to ensure that no overcharging arises. This data must take account of the structure of bank charges and must allow for direct comparisons between conversion costs before and after the introduction of the euro so that transparency can be maximised on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The banking and financial sector in Europe should take it upon itself to draw up a code of conduct to ensure that the EU financial legislation governing these currencies is strictly enforced.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I welcome the fact that the European competition directorate is now investigating banks suspected of overcharging customers for transaction costs post‐ January 1999.</p>

I have started off very dangerously, as with only one minute's speaking time, you can only afford such a long introduction if you can refer to what someone else has already said. In this case I am pleased to say that I fully agree with all Mrs Randzio‐Plath's requests and would simply like to support them, in particular her call for the Commission to launch a real initiative and, as far as possible, to ensure transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the vital point is not that the public are now paying excessively high charges, but the fact that this came as a surprise. They had no idea what they were in for, and that is what is really wrong. The same members of the public who had to put up with major packages of cuts in order to meet the convergence criteria were persuaded to accept those criteria on the grounds that in future they would be able to travel within Euroland just as they had travelled within their own country in the past. The fact is, that has not happened. Charges still exist and in some cases they have even risen. The public do not perhaps feel that they have been cheated – I do not want to exaggerate – but at the very least they feel let down. This has done nothing to enhance the European Union's reputation in the eyes of the public in the various Member States.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Fayot </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, in <span class="italic">Le Monde</span> on Wednesday 10 March there was an article with the following headline: ‘Euro still a virtual currency for consumers", with the sub‐heading: ‘Two months after its introduction, the European currency is still a marginal method of payment".</p>
<p class="contents">I could not have put it better myself. So two months after all the fanfares surrounding its introduction amidst hype unprecedented before 1 January 1999 – and we as Members of Parliament were party to that – not only has the euro not caught on with consumers, it has also stirred up various doubts and fears amongst them.</p>
<p class="contents">To my mind, this is a serious blow for the credibility of the new currency and for its acceptance by ordinary mortals. Of course it was predictable that national currencies would not be replaced by the euro very quickly in day‐to‐day transactions within the Member States. However, in view of the stability of the euro and a reduction in the cost of transfers, we might at least have expected an increase in cross‐border transfers. Not a bit of it! If anything, charges have increased. The banks have been quite frank in explaining that as they have lost their profit on the exchange‐rate spread, they need to recoup their expenses in other ways, and the Commissioner seems to have gone along with this to some extent.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me give you two examples from my own country. Since 1 January 1999, the Luxembourg post office has imposed a charge on every cross‐border transfer – let there be no mistake, on every single cross‐border transfer – amounting to a levy of LUF 80, whereas previously it had been free. By way of a second example, a member of the public wrote to me reporting that he had paid LUF 200 in bank charges on a transfer of LUF 268 to Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this will do anything to develop the single market in financial services for the consumer. In its communication on financial services, the Commission explained that there were enormous differences between one country and another in all areas affecting the ordinary consumer. I think that in the case of bank charges for converting the euro, the least we could have done would be to go for transparency. This would have involved explaining what these charges – which are now to be increased – consist of, why there is any need to increase them and what the sector's overall strategy is.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, Commissioner, the question is whether we are to leave things to market forces or whether regulation is envisaged. You have made it very plain that in your view there is no need for intervention, and that market forces should push down charges. Nevertheless, let me leave you with the following thought: at a time when everything works through the banking system and the average citizen is increasingly dependent on that system, we need to guarantee universal service in banking as well – the right to banking at an acceptable price.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, consumers feel taken in and politicians foolish now that the introduction of the euro has failed to produce much lower exchange rates and has even, in the case of exchanges of smaller amounts, resulted in higher charges. The same applies for cross‐border transfers. We were a little less naive than the Commission about what the banks would do, so we called for legislation to regulate exchange costs, but this did not materialise. Now the Commission is trying – too late, I fear – to restore its reputation by making dramatic attacks on the banks.</p>
<p class="contents">The banks are right when they claim in their defence that they still have costs to pay, but they should have explained all this earlier when they were still passing on those costs in the form of different buying and selling rates. Now they are going to have to be a little more transparent about the costs involved, and if necessary we must introduce legislation to force them to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, it is unacceptable that the banks should not yet have developed a cheap and efficient system for cross‐border consumer payments. I find this completely baffling in a sector which claims that the customer comes first. The development of such a system should be the top priority in my opinion, and it would also enable the banks to get at least some of their own back.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Monti, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Madam President, I wish to thank all the speakers. They provide me with the opportunity to identify one point on which I believe there is full agreement among us, namely, that the present situation is deeply unsatisfactory; and one point where there are partial divergences, namely, how to remedy that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The present situation is indeed quite unsatisfactory. The figures deriving from the first partial returns from the banking associations indicate that charges for exchanging banknotes have decreased in many cases by anything from 15 % to over 40 % depending on the amount and the currency being exchanged. They also indicate, however – and this is the most unsatisfactory part of it – that the decreases have been less when small amounts – for example, less than the equivalent of EUR100 – are exchanged, and in some cases the charges for exchanging small amounts may have increased. This is totally unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The divergence arises where apparently some of you seem to believe that simply setting the level of the charges by a directive or a regulation would be both necessary and sufficient. Here the Commission happens to have a different view. Certainly we are not so naive as to believe that the unregulated play of the market will do the trick. Obviously not. What are we doing, since our purpose is not simply to complain loudly but to try to change the situation on the ground? What we are trying to do is, one the one hand, to impose competition. Hence the actions of the competition Commissioner to see whether agreements or cartels have been put in place. The Commission has the power to eliminate them if that is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also trying to impose transparency. As we all know, transparency is a prerequisite for competition and we are using all possible weapons to impose transparency, such as asking banks and bank federations to convey their data; and also in the most immediate way by opening up e‐mail sites and faxes available to consumers and citizens. We should also avoid creating confusion. For example, when the issue of the remittances of migrant workers is brought into the picture, then obviously this has to do, not with conversion charges, but with the good or bad functioning of cross‐border credit transfers. There the relevant instrument is the one on which legislation has already been enacted – the directive for cross‐border credit transfers of early 1997. As I indicated in my earlier intervention, there the problem is with a delay in transposition on the part of Member States – hence the actions vis‐à‐vis finance ministers. It would be a great help, I would add, if Members of the European Parliament could also put pressure on their respective national authorities to speed up the implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, to indicate the complexity of the matter and the panoply of instruments through which the Commission – which is particularly active in this area – is addressing the problem, I should mention that we have proposed two draft directives on the issuance of electronic money. It so happens that electronic money may be the first way in which citizens will be able to make cash payments in euros before 2002. There were strong interests asking us to limit the ability to issue electronic money to banks. We said No, because we want to create competition there too, for the benefit of the consumer. So in our draft directive we made provision for other institutions to create electronic money – provided, of course, that they are submitted to an appropriate prudential framework. Therefore, we all share the point of view that this is an extremely serious matter, of great relevance, as you all stress, to the credibility of the euro and, incidentally, of the financial system. I am afraid it is not a problem concerning which somewhat simplistic solutions such as merely legislating would have the desired results.</p>
