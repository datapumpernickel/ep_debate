It is something which is not tangible in our day-to-day life, and there is still no so-called ‘euroreflex’ on the part of the population. The present currencies are not yet being converted into the euro. That is why I cannot stress enough the importance of this information and awareness campaign for the euro. It is not yet too late, but we must all realise that 2001 will be crucial in our efforts to involve the entire European population in this giant operation. By means of the amendments which I have tabled and which have also been included in the report, I wanted to underline a number of aspects of this campaign. </p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance – and I will not labour the point as it was sufficiently highlighted this morning – the campaign must devote special attention to making young people aware and involve education in the information campaign. Secondly, an information campaign must obviously be tailored to specific target groups, such as the weaker members of society. I would also ask for special attention to be paid to people on extremely low incomes. As you know, there are two groups of people who spend a great deal of their time thinking about money: those who are extremely rich and have a great deal of money and those who have very little money or who need to budget every day to make sure they can make ends meet for the rest of the month. Well, the euro will have a great impact on them and it is they who deserve our special attention. For this reason, and for other reasons, but especially for this reason, it is important that consumers should not be cheated when they convert their money into euros. The switch to the euro should not lead to improper price increases. I have therefore called for the setting up of local hotlines within every local community to ensure that citizens can report improper price increases in a way which is simple and easy. I have also asked the Commission to submit proposals in this respect and to present best practices to the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Solbes, I must express my approval of this report for I feel that the introduction of the euro is one of the most important, key results of the formation of the European Union out of our 15 States. Therefore, preparing the population for practical use of the euro is certainly a positive move.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Karas for incorporating a request I made to remove a point from the original measure which stated that adolescents and children must receive good teaching so that they can in turn teach their grandparents. I would hope that, also on this occasion, it will be the grandparents, the elderly, the pensioners – who elected me here to the European Parliament to represent the Pensioner’s Party, no less – who will teach the adolescents. This is quite possible, for I am sure that pensioners – who fill all the markets of the European Union every morning – will be among the first to understand the relationship between the euro and their national currency.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe I can make a small contribution to this effort: I will have posters put up in the areas in Italy in which I was a candidate for the elections, calling upon the Italian Government to raise the minimum pension to EUR 500. The poster will not specify exactly what this amount corresponds to in Italian lire, and this will force all the citizens to find out the value of EUR 500 in lire. It is a shame that the Government will not accept this proposal, but, at least it will serve to teach the Italian pensioner citizens the value of the euro.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is economically naive and will do huge macroeconomic damage. Politically it is clearly intended to undermine the nation state, and thus it threatens democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal before us talks of information on the euro, but we already have all the information we need. Every newspaper I open has stories about the euro. Banks and accountancy firms are running seminars and briefing clients. This is not about information, this is about propaganda. I do not trust the Commission to provide unbiased information. The very idea is absurd. I was particularly horrified by the idea of Mrs Randzio-Plath that we should actually enrol schoolchildren as the stormtroopers of this euro propaganda blitz.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, if the 12 euro countries wish to undertake a propaganda campaign, that is no business of mine. But in three countries, Denmark, Sweden and Great Britain, the euro decision is not yet made. It would be a gross abuse of the democratic process for the Commission to undertake a euro propaganda campaign in those countries before referenda on the currency take place. It would be outrageous to take money from the taxpayer and to use it to influence the voters' decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In Britain, 70% of people are opposed to joining the euro. We do not want our money spent on promoting it either in the UK or elsewhere. I therefore have two demands to make of the Commission. Firstly, please tell us today that no such campaign will be undertaken in Great Britain, Denmark or Sweden. Secondly, please assure us that the share of funding which might have been spent on those countries is returned to their national exchequers so that people can see clearly and transparently that their money has not been squandered on objectives they do not support. Better still, cancel the whole project and put all the funds into a special account to help defray the enormous costs that will be incurred when the euro is eventually dismantled.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr Karas’s report contains many interesting elements, including 38 proposals, which in many cases coincide with the proposal in the Commission’s communication in February and, in other cases – as he has explained very well in his initial statement –, are proposals which fine-tune, improve and even extend some of the initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Having made this initial comment, I would like to clarify certain points which I consider to be essential. Firstly, the communication is part of a very complex operation, that is, the introduction of the euro, in the form of coins and notes, on 1 January 2002. Secondly, in the application of this process of introducing the coins and notes, the principle of subsidiarity plays a fundamental role. This means that the Member States, through their governments and central banks, are fundamental to the whole process and also to the operation of providing information.</p>
<p class="contents">Our role as Commission consists, in some cases, of persuading, in others, of acting and, in the majority of cases, of communicating to the Member States ideas which they can or cannot apply, and, in some other cases, of proposing specific actions.</p>
<p class="contents">The main concern at the moment is to determine the level of preparation of Member States, companies and citizens. With regard to the Member States, I can tell you that next week I will present the Commission with a report on the practical application of the euro. This will contain a summary of the situation of the national plans for the introduction of the euro in each of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies are the special objective of the information campaign at the moment. According to the latest information available, regarding September, approximately 88% of small and medium-sized businesses assure us that they are prepared for the euro or, at least, are aware of the need to prepare themselves now.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this figure would be deceptive if I were not to give two additional figures, or make two additional comments. Firstly, of this 88%, only 22% have already implemented the plans necessary for the introduction of the euro. As for the rest, there is a certain contradiction between this position, which in theory is so favourable to the companies, and the lack of use of the euro in normal operations at the moment. To put it another way, we have the impression that companies view the operation with relative optimism, in the belief that it will be easier than it may turn out to be. This is the reason why we believe that we must pay special attention to companies during this period, as well as to citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission intends to implement certain specific actions, apart from the July communication, regular reports to ECOFIN, a proposal on counterfeiting, which will be presented before the end of the year, and also a series of measures necessary for coordination.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make some comments relating to the various points mentioned in the debate. On the whole, the proposals in the communication coincide with the proposals which have been made here. Nevertheless, there are certain points which deserve additional comment. Firstly, what action must we take in the ‘pre-in’ countries or in third countries? The countries which are not currently members of the Monetary Union have the right, like other Member States, to information campaigns. This will clearly happen, as long as those countries want it to happen. Two of them, for the moment, Denmark and the United Kingdom, have not shown any interest in implementing these information campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">Your recommendations include many of the actions which, in our opinion, must be asked of the Member States and, to this end, we will send a communication to the different countries so that they may take account of them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight certain very interesting aspects which have been mentioned such as paying special attention to training, schools, women, specific sectors, such as tourism, or the tremendously interesting initiative of the distribution of price tables, or the initial or additional obligations of public administrations.</p>
<p class="contents">We will communicate to the banking sector your proposals on the possibility of using some of the ‘savings days’ for information purposes, and we will move forward on all aspects relating to charges on the exchange rate. The Commission is favourable to the idea that there should not be a differential between the charges made for cross-border operations and for national operations.</p>
<p class="contents">Two additional comments. The Commission is absolutely prepared to work with Parliament, with the European Central Bank and with the Member States in order to implement a programme which is more efficient, bearing in mind however that, in accordance with the current model, approximately two thirds of the total expenditure of the programme will be met by the Member States, according to their specific programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the possibility of providing more resources or extending the information process, as proposed in the Karas report, the Commission is in favour of both options. Of course, we will have to debate them in the future, when we discuss the budgets for the coming years. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
