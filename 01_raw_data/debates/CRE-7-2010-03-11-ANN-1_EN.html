<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council has constantly highlighted the importance of high standards of nuclear safety and of a high level of environmental protection. The Council regularly underlines its support for a high level of nuclear safety and environmental protection throughout the European Union and in third countries.</p>
<p>National responsibility for nuclear safety is confirmed by the international IAEA conventions, such as the Convention on Nuclear Safety (CNS), to which Belarus, Russia as well as Euratom and most of the EU Member States are parties. However, the review conference under the CNS provides an opportunity to exert peer pressure on other parties regarding the safety of their installations and the way they implement the relevant provisions of the Convention.</p>
<p>The Council would like to point out in particular that, under the CNS, Contracting Parties in the vicinity of a proposed nuclear installation have to be consulted, insofar as they are likely to be affected by that installation.</p>
<p>Furthermore the Euratom-Russia Agreement on the peaceful uses of nuclear energy currently under negotiation is intended to contain provisions on verifiable requirements for nuclear safety and the protection of the health and safety of workers.</p>
<p>The Council further recalls that this issue is regularly taken up in the framework of the EU-Russia Energy Dialogue and at Permanent Partnership Councils on Energy. It should be noted in this respect that the last (tenth) progress report on the Dialogue states that:</p>
<p>‘The parties [Russia, the EU] point out that diversification of both energy resources and transport infrastructure is an imperative of our time. In this framework, they support the development of electrical power trade between the EU and Russia bearing in mind the necessity of guaranteeing the highest level of nuclear safety.’</p>
<p>Regarding impact assessment in an international context the Council notes that Belarus is a Party to the Espoo Convention on Environmental Impact Assessment in a Transboundary Context, which contains binding obligations designed to assess and minimise the environmental impact and the potential danger to the environment. The Council underlines that responsibility for the environmental assessment lies largely with the promoters of these projects.</p>
<p>The Russian Federation is not a full ‘Contracting Party’ to the Espoo Convention. Nevertheless, the EU encourages Russia to apply the Espoo Convention voluntarily. The point has been made for quite a long time to Russia, including in relation to existing Nuclear Power Plants.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0062"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has correctly pointed out, under Article 14 of the Treaty on European Union (TEU), as introduced by the Lisbon Treaty, the number of Members of the European Parliament must not exceed 750, plus the President. As the elections to the European Parliament of June 2009 took place on the basis of the former Treaty (i.e. 736 elected MEPs), on 18-19 June 2009, the European Council agreed to add 18 additional seats to the 736 seats filled in the June elections, in the event that the Treaty of Lisbon entered into force<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The implementation of this agreement of the European Council requires the adoption and the ratification by the 27 Member States of a Protocol amending Article 2 of the Protocol (36) on transitional measures annexed to the Lisbon Treaty, following the procedure laid down in Article 48(3) of the TEU. On 4 December 2009, the Spanish Government submitted a proposal for the amendment of the Treaties to that effect.</p>
<p>The European Council decided on 10-11 December 2009<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> to consult the European Parliament and the Commission with a view to examining this proposal. Pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 48(3) TEU, the European Council specified that it did not intend to convene a Convention (composed of representatives of national parliaments, of the Heads of State or Government of Member States, of the European Parliament and of the Commission) before the conference of representatives of governments of the Member States, since in the view of the European Council, this was not justified by the scope of the proposed amendments. The representatives of the European Council therefore requested the consent of the European Parliament to that effect, as required by Article 48(3) TEU.</p>
<p>The estimated timetable for the opening of the conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States depends on the receipt of European Parliament’s position on these two issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The strategy for the Baltic Sea region is of historic significance and vital importance to the Baltic States and their neighbourhood. If pursued successfully it will strengthen the unity of the EU as a whole, as millions of people living geographically close together who, however, for reasons to do with their history and traditions, have rarely joined forces will be bringing their efforts to bear on shared projects. As a representative of the Baltic region, I find it worrying that the 18-month work programme drawn up by the EU’s presidency trio countries should focus on the EU strategy for the Danube region while failing to mention the strategy for the Baltic Sea region.</p>
<p>Given that the strategy for the Baltic Sea region has only just begun to be implemented, does the Council not think it too early to consider the mission accomplished and hence less deserving of attention from the institutions?

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 14 December 2007, the European Council invited the Commission to prepare a European Union strategy for the Baltic Sea region, which the Commission presented in June 2009 to Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions.</p>
<p>The Baltic Sea Strategy is aimed at co-ordinating action by Member States, regions, the EU, pan-Baltic organisations, financing institutions and non-governmental bodies to promote a more balanced development of the Baltic Sea and is accompanied by an action plan organised around four pillars: marine environment, prosperity, transport and energy, safety and security.</p>
<p>The October 2009 European Council stated that the Baltic Sea Strategy was an important contribution to the economic success of the region and to its social and territorial cohesion, as well as to the competitiveness of the EU and called upon all relevant actors to act speedily and ensure full implementation of the Baltic Sea Strategy.</p>
<p>The strategy itself builds on the existing EU instruments, funds, policies and programmes.</p>
<p>In this sense, as set out in its conclusions of 26 October 2009, the role of the Council is that of a policy developer as it receives periodic reports and proposals for recommendations from the Commission, while the Commission is responsible for actual co-ordination, monitoring, reporting, facilitation of the implementation and follow-up.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Council called on the Commission to present a progress report by no later than June 2011, and therefore beyond the time period of the 18-month presidency programme.</p>
<p>Until then, the Council may only be involved when and if the Commission may decide to amend the strategy, given that, in that case, endorsement from the Council should be sought on the proposed amendment.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0066"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As from December 2008, to tackle the crisis, the EU and its Member States have implemented a wide range of extraordinary measures, including the European Economic Recovery Plan, based on solidarity and social justice. As a part of that Plan, the Regulation establishing European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) was revised in 2009 in order to allow the Fund to cover redundancies caused by the impact of the global financial and economic crisis.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a new Microfinance Facility should be operational over the period 2010-2013. This facility aims at increasing access to loans, and thus at reducing unemployment and poverty resulting from the crisis. The Council considers that the agreement reached with the European Parliament, in the first-reading, on a new Microfinance Facility is a positive contribution in this respect.</p>
<p>In the area of Structural Funds, additional measures are needed to alleviate the impacts of the economic crisis in those Member States that are most seriously hit. Therefore, the Council foresees measures to simplify payment of advances to the beneficiaries of state aid. Moreover, the Council foresees an additional pre-financing instalment for 2010, in order to allow for a regular cash flow and to facilitate payments to beneficiaries during programme implementation.</p>
<p>As far as financial assistance is concerned, relations between Member States should be based on responsibility, as well as solidarity.</p>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>After the first favourable signs of the crisis abating last autumn, economic growth turned to positive in the EU in the third quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in order to overcome the economic crisis the Member States and the EU have made huge fiscal interventions to support the financial sector and the real economy, in particular in the framework of the European economic recovery plan agreed in December 2008 in response to the global financial crisis and economic slowdown.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, currently 20 Member States have excessive deficits, which should be brought below the reference value within the next few years. Lack of sound budgetary policies and a weak financial sector could severely jeopardize the recovery and undermine the credibility of European Union macroeconomic policies.</p>
<p>However, while on the one hand it is necessary to phase out extraordinary financial measures that are unsustainable for Member States, on the other hand timing of the phasing out should be compatible with an economic recovery which is self sustained.</p>
<p>In this perspective, Union policies should be refocused towards long-term reforms in an ambitious and revamped new strategy, in order to further improve competitiveness and increase the EU's sustainable growth potential.</p>
<p>On the basis of the communication of the Commission Europe 2020 strategy of 3 March 2010, the Commission has proposed that Spring European Council agree on the focus of this strategy, set the quantitative targets and finalize the governance structure; and that in June the European Council should endorse the integrated guidelines to implement the strategy and the country specific quantitative targets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0073"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As the honourable Member has observed, gender equality has cross-cutting and fundamental importance within the EU. Equality between women and men is strongly affirmed in the provisions of the EU Treaties. Article 3 of the Treaty on European Union provides that the Union shall promote equality between women and men, and Article 8 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union specifies that this aim is to be pursued in all the Union's activities. The European Council of 23/24 March 2006, when adopting the European Pact for Gender Equality<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, also explicitly acknowledged that gender equality policies were vital to economic growth, prosperity and competitiveness.</p>
<p>On 30 November 2009, the Council adopted Conclusions on precisely this subject<a href="#defann_6_2" name="refann_6_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, calling for gender key messages to be forwarded to the European Council.</p>
<p>In these Conclusions, the Council specifically affirmed several of the points that the honourable Member has also made. In particular, the Council considered that ‘gender equality is crucial for fulfilling the EU objectives of economic and social cohesion and a high level of employment, as well as for ensuring sustainable growth and competitiveness, and for tackling the demographic challenge’<a href="#defann_6_3" name="refann_6_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The gender issue is also addressed in the EU 2020 strategy, adopted by the Commission on 3 March. The Council had an exchange of views on this general topic at its meeting on 8 March, and the Presidency has undertaken to convey the outcome of these talks to the European Council. This procedure will give the Member States and the Presidency a vital opportunity to affirm the concerns and the positive perspective that the Council expressed in its Conclusions in November.</p>
<p>It is also worth noticing that the present Spanish Presidency of the European Union is very active in the field of gender equality and has already celebrated the European Women’s Forum Beijing+15 on the 4th and 5th of February, after the European Women in Power Summit on 3rd February, bringing together representatives from European Union Governments, the European Economic Area, candidate countries, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the main European women’s associations that work towards gender equality.</p>
<p>The next 25th-26th March the Spanish Presidency is organising the Informal Meeting of Equality Ministers that shall be focused on ‘Equality as the basis for growth and employment’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>What is the Council's position on unfair commercial practices operating in the food supply chain?

<p>As the Spanish Presidency stressed during her appearance before the Agriculture Committee on 27 January, the improvement of the functioning of the food supply chain is of primary importance, as part of an efficient and competitive agriculture and agro-food industry, which is one of its priorities.</p>
<p>In particular, the Council is currently examining the Commission communication entitled ‘A better functioning food supply in Europe’ (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2009&amp;nu_doc=0591">COM(2009) 591</a> final). In this respect, the Council held in January an exchange of views on this topic on the basis of a questionnaire elaborated by the Presidency and is now working on draft Council conclusions on this communication.</p>
<p>Five key ideas are developed in the draft conclusions as they now stand, without prejudice to the final text. Most of these ideas are referred to in your question:</p>
<p>Improving the structure and consolidation of the agro-food industry in order to help to achieve the scale necessary for greater bargaining power when dealing with large retailers.</p>
<p>Increasing transparency along the food chain. Greater transparency allows for tracking price levels and developments and for increasing pressure on stakeholders to speed up price transmission. This is key to fair distribution of added value along the food supply chain.</p>
<p>Combating unfair trading practices. The Commission proposes to assess these practices in the internal market and propose any necessary Community measures to address such practices.</p>
<p>Encouraging self-regulation initiatives. The Commission proposes to work together with the food supply chain stakeholders to prepare sets of standard contracts. Adoption of Codes of Good Commercial Practices is also envisaged.</p>
<p>Exploring competition in the food supply chain. The Commission proposes to work with the European Competition Network to develop a common approach to competition issues of relevance for the functioning of the food supply chain. The Council is reflecting on the interplay between the existing competition and CAP rules.</p>
<p>The Presidency hopes that these conclusions will be adopted by the Council at its March session.</p>
<p>Last but not least, together with the European Parliament, the Council is currently working on a Commission proposal for recasting Directive 2000/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on combating late payment in commercial transactions.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0078"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>While the economic and monetary union by its very existence provides an element of stability and protection against market turbulence, the members of the euro area share a common responsibility for the stability in this area and their economic policies are a matter of common concern. They are required to conduct sound national policies in line with the Stability and Growth Pact and the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines.</p>
<p>The recent economic crisis and current developments on financial markets have shown the importance of close coordination of economic policies. At their informal meeting on 11 February, the Heads of State or Government of the EU declared that the euro area Member States will take determined and coordinated action, if needed, to safeguard financial stability in the euro area as a whole. Until now, no euro area Member State has asked for assistance.</p>
<p>On 16 February, the Council, following the invitation of the Heads of State or Government, focused on the situation regarding government deficit and debt in Greece, adopting:</p>
<p>an opinion on an update by Greece of its stability programme, which sets out plans for reducing its government deficit below 3% of gross domestic product by 2012;</p>
<p>a decision giving notice to Greece to correct its excessive deficit by 2012, setting out budgetary consolidation measures according to a specific timetable, including deadlines for reporting on measures taken;</p>
<p>a recommendation to Greece with a view to bringing its economic policies into line with the EU's broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p>In relation to economic co-ordination and surveillance in the euro area more generally, the Commission intends to submit this spring a proposal under Article 136 of the Treaty to the Council on the basis of provisions of the Lisbon Treaty. The Council will examine the Commission's proposal upon its receipt. Until now, the Council has not received any such proposal, and in particular has not received or discussed any proposal relating to a European Monetary Fund.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0083"></a>

<p>The recent economic crisis and current developments on financial markets have shown the importance of close coordination of economic policies, as confirmed by Heads of State or Government of the EU as well as by the President of the European Council on the occasion of their informal meeting on 11 February.</p>
<p>Primary responsibility for their economic policies lies with the Member States themselves. The EU monitors and coordinates them, in particular in the context of the Stability and Growth Pact and Broad Economic Policy Guidelines. While the Stability and Growth Pact focuses chiefly on enforcing and maintaining fiscal discipline, the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines aim at ensuring multilateral surveillance of economic trends in the Member States. Structural policies, especially with a view to increasing competitiveness, leading to higher growth and employment are coordinated in the framework of the Lisbon strategy, which will be re-launched this spring as the EU 2020 strategy.</p>
<p>All these instruments are based on partnership and cooperation among the Member States. The Lisbon Treaty provides the euro area with additional legal framework in order to ensure the proper functioning of the economic and monetary union. The existence of the Euro Group is formally recognised in Article 137 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU) and Protocol 1(No. 14) on the Euro Group. Furthermore Article 136 TFEU allows the adoption of additional measures applicable only to the euro area, aimed at strengthening the coordination and surveillance of the budgetary discipline of the euro area Member States or setting out economic policy guidelines for these Member states. Such measures are adopted in accordance with the relevant procedure from among those referred to in articles 121 and 126 TFEU with the exception of the procedure set out in article 126(14) TFEU.</p>
<p>The Commission intends to submit this spring a proposal to the Council to reinforce economic policy co-ordination and surveillance on the basis of this provisions of the Lisbon Treaty.

<p>Today we have sufficient evidence about the harmful consequences of illicit financial flows for developing countries.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Tax evasion, capital flight and illicit financial flows are undoubtedly a serious challenge for development, particularly in developing countries, and were identified by the 2008 Doha Declaration on Financing for Development as major obstacles to the mobilization of domestic revenue for development.</p>
<p>In May 2008, the Council adopted Conclusions<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> underlining that good governance in the tax area, which comprises the principles of transparency, exchange of information and fair tax competition, is an essential means for combating cross-border tax fraud and evasion and for strengthening the fight against money laundering, corruption and the financing of terrorism.</p>
<p>The EU is actively promoting these principles in a number of contexts:</p>
<p>The European Neighbourhood Policy includes, in a number of its Action Plans for particular third countries, a general reference to cooperation in tax matters and to the principles of transparency, exchange of information and to the Code of Conduct for Business Taxation. These action plans are tools for economic and political cooperation between the EU and partner countries.</p>
<p>EU Development Cooperation Policy provides for additional support to developing countries that are willing to commit to the principles of good governance, including in the tax area, through the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Governance Facility and the Governance Initiative of the 10th European Development Fund.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recent wider international acceptance of the OECD tax standards, including by many developing countries, has substantially changed the international environment towards more transparency in tax matters and has moved the debate forward within the EU. On 28 April 2009, the Commission issued a Communication on Good Governance in Tax Matters<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, in which it floated a number of ideas on how to promote good governance in tax matters towards third countries.</p>
<p>In its Conclusions of 18 May 2009 the Council invited the Commission to make proposals for concrete EU action on dialogue with, and assistance to, developing countries on promoting good governance in tax matters and more effective national tax systems in order to achieve development goals.</p>
<p>The subject was discussed by the Council again within the framework of its 17 November 2009 conclusions on Policy Coherence for Development. The issue was included in the initial selection of five priority issues that shall be addressed in the PCD work programme to be submitted to the Council this year. The Conclusions stated the need to improve transparency and counter illicit cross-border flows and tax evasion ‘recognising that these have a severe impact on domestic resource mobilisation in developing countries’.</p>
<p>Building on these prior achievements, the Spanish Presidency of the Council has included this issue as one of its priorities in the development agenda for this semester.</p>
<p>Thus, at their informal meeting in La Granja (Spain) on 17-18 February 2010, with the participation of the President of the EP Development Committee, EU Development Ministers had an in-depth exchange of views on the issue of Taxation and Good Governance for Development and Innovative Mechanisms for Financing.</p>
<p>The Council will take this debate further in the next months and is looking forward to the forthcoming Commission Communication on Promoting Good Governance in Tax Matters in the Context of Development Cooperation, which is expected to be presented to the Council as part of the so-called ‘April package’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<tr><td align="center" valign="top"> </td><td align="left" valign="top" class="contents">
<p>The European Council meeting on 11 February 2010 and the Eurogroup of 16 February 2010 took historic decisions. For the first time, a Member State – Greece – has been placed under tripartite supervision; for the first time, the Council has expressly prohibited measures affecting pay, health systems, pensions, the civil service, markets, etc. It is remarkable that the Council has, as yet, made no mention of the wretched state of the economies of the other Member States of the EU. Spain, for example, has a deficit of 11.2% and a rate of debt growth of 20%, France an 8,3% deficit and a 10% rate of debt growth, Italy a 5.3% deficit and a debt amounting to 114% of GDP, Portugal an 8.7% deficit and a 10% rate of debt growth, and the UK, with a 12% deficit, is at the same level as Greece, and has a rate of debt growth of 20%. The overall level of debt in the Netherlands is approaching 234% of GDP, in Ireland 222%, Belgium 219%, Spain 207% and Greece 179%.</p>
<p>In the light of these figures, the Stability Pact has, in effect, been scrapped. Does the Council admit that this is so? Can it say whether the huge deficits in the EU are attributable to the various ‘illegal’ support packages for banks and industries? Are the measures taken against Greek workers harbingers of similar 'recommendations' for workers throughout the eurozone? Is Greece a 'guinea pig', as the Greek Prime Minister claims?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Stability and Growth Pact remains the main instrument for maintaining financial stability in the EU as a whole as well as in the euro area. It is applied consistently and fairly to all Member States, and it is currently being applied with the flexibility introduced in its revision in 2005. The Stability and Growth Pact is therefore very far from being scrapped.</p>
<p>In order to overcome the most severe global economic crisis since 1929, Member States and the EU have made huge fiscal interventions to support the financial sector and real economy in the past two years, which naturally led to an increase of public deficits. These interventions were necessary and appropriate, and have played an extremely important role in averting an even more grave crisis, in stabilising the economy and in preventing a more dramatic recession. In this difficult period, the Stability and Growth Pact has shown the worth of its flexibility.</p>
<p>When economic recovery is confirmed, the extraordinary measures must be withdrawn. The Council has already agreed on the main principles of exit strategies. On the fiscal side, these are being implemented in the framework of the Stability and Growth Pact. In 2009 and 2010 the Council adopted recommendations with a view to bringing their budget deficit below the reference value of 3% of GDP to 20 Member States, including Belgium, Spain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal and the UK. The deadlines for correcting the deficit vary from 2011 to the fiscal year 2014 / 2015 depending on specific situation in individual Member States.</p>
<p>Among the Member States currently subject to excessive deficit procedure, Greece is the only Member State that failed to take effective action as per the Council Recommendation adopted in April 2009. Furthermore, as shown by the October 2009 update of budgetary data, the figures presented by the Greek authorities have not been reliable. The Council will continue to closely monitor the situation in all Member States with a public deficit exceeding the reference value and, if any of them fails to comply with the recommendations, the Council will take the necessary measures.</p>
<p>The recommendations to Greece or any other Member State are aimed at helping the authorities to maintain sound fiscal policy, they are not taken ‘against’ any group of citizens. Some Member States have allowed an evolution of their public finances which is not sustainable and must thus take corrective measures – this is the only correct and sustainable way towards strong economic recovery. In the long run, lack of fiscal discipline would lead to unsustainable budget deficits and public debts, which would have a detrimental effect on the economy of the EU as a whole as well as of the Member States concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0093"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The deterioration of the public finances in Greece, combined with broader macroeconomic imbalances and the loss of competitiveness of the Greek economy in recent years has led to the difficult economic situation this Member state is facing today. The Greek authorities are committed to taking the actions necessary to address this situation, and the Council is committed to supporting Greece's efforts.</p>
<p>The Council has repeatedly pointed to the long term structural problems of the Greek economy in various multilateral surveillance exercises. In conjunction with the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs, the Council, in its Recommendation on the 2009 update of the broad guidelines for the economic policies of the Member States, noted that it is ‘imperative to intensify efforts to address the macro-economic imbalances and structural weaknesses of the Greek economy’. It recommended Greece to increase competition in professional services and investments in R&amp;D, use structural funds more efficiently, reform public administration and take a broad range of labour market measures within an integrated flexicurity approach.</p>
<p>On 16 February, the Council, following the invitation of the Heads of State or Government, focused on the situation regarding government deficit and debt in Greece, adopting:</p>
<p>an opinion on an update by Greece of its stability programme, which sets out plans for reducing its government deficit below 3% of gross domestic product by 2012;</p>
<p>a decision giving notice to Greece to correct its excessive deficit by 2012, setting out budgetary consolidation measures according to a specific timetable, including deadlines for reporting on measures taken;</p>
<p>a recommendation to Greece with a view to bringing its economic policies into line with the EU's broad economic policy guidelines.</p>
<p>In the context of the above mentioned measures, the Council recommended Greece to implement a comprehensive package of measures in order to improve the functioning of the product market and business environment, support productivity and employment growth, and improve efficiency and pace of absorption of EU structural funds, as well as to correct its excessive budget deficit and address the long-term sustainability of its public finances. With a view to supporting productivity and employment growth, Greece was invited to:</p>
<p>take immediate measures to fight undeclared work;</p>
<p>review labour market regulations, including employment protection legislation, with a view to increasing labour supply;</p>
<p>support labour demand by reinforcing targeted reductions in the cost of labour;</p>
<p>enact reforms in the educational system aimed at improving the level of skills of the labour force and enhancing responsiveness to labour market needs.</p>
<p>Against the background of the challenge to improve productivity, including through prioritised public investment strategies, Greece should take all necessary measures to improve the efficiency and pace of absorption of EU structural funds. In doing so, particular attention should be paid to the swift and efficient implementation of the operational programmes on 'Administrative Reform' and 'Digital Convergence', as these support essential reforms in public administration, which is central to the reform strategy outlined in the January 2010 update of the stability programme.</p>
<p>Greece is expected to present the first report of the implementation of these measures by 16 March, the second in May, followed by quarterly reports. The Council will closely monitor the situation and continue to take measures, as appropriate, in order to support the Greek authorities in promoting economic growth as well as maintaining sound fiscal policy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0096"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the March 2010 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU is concerned over the recent deterioration of the situation in Belarus and increased human rights violations. The EU sees the situation around the Union of Poles as part of a deteriorating trend, of which the lack of freedom of expression and assembly, increased control over the media and pressure on journalists, the new law restricting the use of the Internet and the harassment of opposition activists are further worrying signs.</p>
<p>In her statement of 16 February, HR Ashton expressed concerns about the situation of the Polish minority in Belarus, and notably police action expelling representatives from community-owned property, police detentions of community members, and attempts by Minsk to impose a community leadership. These concerns have also been conveyed through diplomatic channels to the Belarusian authorities.</p>
<p>The Council briefly exchanged views on the matter on 22 February, and will return for a more in-depth discussion in the coming months.</p>
<p>When meeting with FM Martynov briefly in the margins of the inauguration of the Ukrainian President Yanukovich in Kiev on 25 February, HR Ashton conveyed her serious concerns over human rights violations, and noted that the situation around the Union of Poles was not a Belarusian 'internal affair'.</p>
<p>The Council intends to continue with the EU's policy of conditional engagement, and this is also supported by prominent Belarusian pro-democratic and pro-European leaders, such as Aliaksandr Milinkevich.</p>
<p>At the same time, it is of utmost importance that Belarus abides by its OSCE and international commitments, including in terms of the protection and promotion of the rights of minorities.</p>
<p>It is in the interest of the EU to pursue relations with Belarus to advance shared values and principles.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to monitor human rights situation in Belarus and keep it high on the political dialogue agenda with the country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0097"></a>

<p>The Council considered that it was an action which cannot be conducive to peace and stability in the Middle East.

<p>The EU welcomed the investigation by the Dubai authorities and calls on all countries to cooperate with it. The countries concerned in the EU are themselves carrying out full investigations into the fraudulent use of their passports.</p>
<p>The European Union is committed to ensuring that both EU citizens and countries around the world continue to have confidence in the integrity of EU Member States' passports. In that regard, the EU adopted in 2004 standards for security features and biometrics in passports and travel documents issued by the Member States.

<p>The policy of the Government of Botswana and its programme of relocation of San from the Central Kalahari Game Reserve (CKGR) have attracted particular attention and raised concerns within the international human rights’ community, including the UN Committee on Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues.</p>
<p>The EU has, for its part, through local Heads of Mission, regularly discussed the matter of the San/Bushmen in Botswana with the Government of Botswana. These discussions take place in the context of the article 8 dialogue under the Cotonou Agreement, which provides for a systematic and formal dialogue in relation to the three essential elements of the Cotonou agreement, namely respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. In these meetings the Government has informed the EU on the follow up to the ruling of the High Court. According to our information, in December the San/Bushmen nominated their representatives who have been tasked to discuss with the Government the CKGR issue. In order to find a solution to the CKGR relocation issue, contacts between them and the Government are now underway.</p>

<p>NATO, with the active support of the EU and the CFSP, has launched Operation Moshtarak, the largest offensive in Afghanistan since the beginning the military intervention by the US and its allies, as part of the US's 'new strategy' determined by US President and Nobel peace prize winner, Barack Obama. Although it only began a few days ago, it has already resulted in the killing of at least fifteen civilians in the region of Marjah. NATO troops maintain that this was an error, while the Afghan authorities have admitted that it was a selected target, but blame the Taliban. These fifteen casualties come in addition to the 2 412 civilians already killed by NATO occupying forces in Afghanistan in 2009 alone, according to the United Nations.</p>

<p>The framework for the EU’s engagement in Afghanistan is set out in the EU Action Plan for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adopted by the Council on 27 October 2009. According to this framework, EU efforts in Afghanistan are civilian. The EU is not involved in operation Moshtarak or any other military operation.</p>
<p>EU efforts are concentrated on strengthening the capacity of the Afghan state and its institutions to promote good governance, human rights, and efficient public administration, especially at sub-national level. Supporting economic growth, especially through rural development and social progress is also a top priority.</p>
<p>In addition, the EU is focusing its efforts on strengthening the rule of law, i.e. by assisting in the building of a civilian police force through EUPOL Afghanistan, the EU Police Mission in Afghanistan launched by the European Union in June 2007 and supporting the implementation of the National Justice Programme.</p>
<p>These efforts are also in line with the strategic priorities presented by the Government of Afghanistan.</p>
<p>The Council has emphasised that international assistance must be a transition strategy, focusing on enabling the Afghan Government to assume full responsibility, while the international community gradually takes a more supportive role.</p>

<p>Persecution of a civilian population by a state power, whether directed against a state's own citizens or otherwise, is contrary to the rule of law and democratic principles in general. By extension, such acts are irreconcilable with the basic values of the European Union, notably the right to live in security. It is imperative that allegations of such acts be subjected to thorough investigation.</p>
<p>As far as the various incidents between Israeli security services and Palestinians as well as Israeli policies under the occupation regime are concerned, the Council has always insisted that both sides should respect international law and international humanitarian law. These are principles that the Council has referred to in its conclusions on the Middle East Peace Process, most recently in December 2009.</p>
<p>I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Council continues to attach particular importance to the human rights of individuals, in line with the legal principles I have mentioned, and is prepared to condemn their violation, where appropriate and on the basis of sound evidence.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0108"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Commission welcomes the continued interest of the European Parliament in the issue of volunteering.</p>
<p>The European Year of Volunteering 2011 will focus on the following four aims: firstly, to create an enabling environment for volunteering; secondly, to empower volunteer organisations; thirdly, to raise awareness about the value and importance of volunteering; and fourthly, to improve the recognition of volunteering activities. The European Year will therefore engage all the relevant stakeholders, especially civil society organisations, at EU, national, regional and local levels. The Commission also hopes for the continued involvement of Parliament during the preparation of the Year.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to assure the honourable Member that its priority is to ensure that action on the issue of volunteering continues well beyond the end of the European Year. Its influence should be reflected in policy initiatives and continued dialogue with civil society stakeholders, businesses and European and international institutions, all of which will ensure tangible, beneficial results for the volunteering sector, and European society at large, in the subsequent years. However, the Commission considers that at the present stage of preparing the European Year on Volunteering 2011, it is too early to assess whether a Green Paper on Volunteering would be the appropriate tool to facilitate, recognise and add value to volunteering.</p>
<p>A Commission study on volunteering in the European Union that was finalised in the beginning of 2010<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> provides for the first time research and insights into the current situation of volunteering in the European Union. While this study has collated and made use of a wide-range of sources to gather the most information possible on the level of volunteering in the EU, it has not been possible yet to provide a statistically accurate comparison across Europe and there is still a lack of comparable data between Member States. The Commission therefore welcomes initiatives that aim at improving its understanding of the voluntary sector and fully intends to explore potential synergies with Eurostat and other international institutions, such as the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations, as suggested by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Combating violence against women constitutes a political priority for the Commission. The Commission welcomes the adoption by the European Parliament of the resolution on the equality between men and women in the European Union (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-7-2010-0021_EN.html">P7_TA(2010)0021</a>) as well as the adoption of the proposal for the creation of a European Year to combat violence against children, young people and women.</p>
<p>The Commission is determined to use its political, legislative and financial powers and resources to help eradicate violence against women in Europe and elsewhere. The problem is addressed at the Commission's level through legislative and policy initiatives and actions in the areas of the protection of fundamental rights, gender equality and other employment and social policies, the policies of trafficking in human beings and sexual exploitation, cooperation in law enforcement and criminal justice, asylum and immigration policies, public health, developments, research and education.</p>
<p>A number of initiatives have recently been taken by the Commission in the area of combating violence.</p>
<p>A mid-term strategy for equality between women and men is currently being prepared, to be adopted mid-2010, to follow-up the existing framework. It is foreseen that violence against women will remain a specific priority area on which the Commission will focus.</p>
<p>On the field of criminal justice, the Commission will shortly submit a proposal on trafficking of human beings. It also supports the Spanish Presidency project to create a European Protection Order which also aims at better protection of women victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p>The Daphne III Programme, which represents the most targeted and comprehensive action in the area of combating violence, has recently launched a study on harmful traditional practices which will be completed in early April 2010. Moreover, a Eurobarometer survey of EU citizen's perception of violence against women has been launched by the Programme, which will allow comparing the changes in perception of violence in EU within the past ten years. The results of this Eurobarometer survey should become available in mid 2010.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Daphne III Programme has launched a preparatory action following an initiative by the European Parliament, on the standardisation of national legislation on gender violence and violence against children. The aim is that this study will help the Commission determine the scope of its future actions, including the possibility to propose legislation in this area. The study will look into the possibility for a European-level harmonisation of legislation on gender violence that could help reducing gender violence within the European Union. The study is currently under way and the final report is expected end of September 2010. The results of this study will be presented at a conference at the end of 2010. This will give the Commission an opportunity to present its actions towards a strengthened policy to response to combat violence.</p>
<p>In light of the abovementioned initiatives, the Commission takes note of the request of Parliament to the Commission to establish an EU-wide strategy on combating violence against women, to prepare binding legal instruments aiming at elimination of violence against women and a European awareness-raising campaign on violence against women. The Commission is currently investigating these possibilities and is reflecting on how best to respond to these requests.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0100"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Union has yet to finalise its position on the different proposals related to elephants which will be discussed at the Conference of Parties to CITES starting on 13 March 2010. This position will be established once all relevant information is available, in particular the report by the Panel of experts appointed by the CITES Standing Committee to assess the proposals by Tanzania and Zambia.</p>
<p>It is very unlikely, however, that the EU will support any decision allowing a resumption of ivory trade. The assessment of any possible link between previous one-off ivory sales and illegal activities is subject to an ongoing study. Pending this, it is very difficult to see how the European Union could agree on a resumption of ivory trade, especially in the current context of high levels of poaching and illegal trade in ivory.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0059"></a>

<p>(EN) On 17 November 2009 the Chinese authorities issued a Circular in which they announced measures for creating a system in 'innovative' sectors where access to public procurement takes place on the basis of a pre-qualification system (accreditation). Since then, the Commission has been in close contact with European businesses in China and in Europe as well as with international partners to assess the impact of this circular.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly raised the issue in numerous bilateral contacts at various levels with the Chinese Government to express its concerns on these measures and to invite the Chinese Government to explain them. In parallel, a number of international partners as well as a significant number of national and international business organisations have done the same.</p>
<p>It is the view of the Commission – and of many of its international partners – that the Chinese authorities have not provided a satisfactory explanation for these new measures. Important questions remain unanswered. The Commission intends to pursue the issue with the Chinese authorities at all relevant levels to clarify the situation and to ensure that the interests of European businesses in the Chinese procurement market are defended.</p>
<p>China is not party to the WTO agreement on government procurement (GPA), although negotiations are ongoing. Once China will join the GPA, it will have to abide by internationally agreed disciplines which will be instrumental to address such issues. However, in the meantime, the Commission is pursuing discussions in the WTO how to address trade distortions arising from subsidies affecting trade in services, as mandated by Article XV of the General Agreement on Trade in Services which is binding on China.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0061"></a>

<p>(EN) In its Communications ‘A European Economic Recovery Plan’<a href="#defann_26_1" name="refann_26_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and ‘A Shared Commitment for Employment’<a href="#defann_26_2" name="refann_26_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> the Commission gave a firm commitment to take effective measures to help the Member States fight the effects of the crisis by speeding up implementation of operational programmes (OPs) cofinanced by the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>A first set of measures, involving the simplification of the rules on eligibility and an additional advance on OPs, was adopted under the European Economic Recovery Plan in April and May 2009. An additional EUR 4.5 billion from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and EUR 1.8 billion from the European Social Fund (ESF) was paid to the Member States in order to support urgent operations required to cope with the crisis (total advances paid to the Member States in 2009 amounted to EUR 11.3 billion).</p>
<p>The Commission also encouraged the Member States to use the OPs’ built-in flexibility to channel Structural Fund financing into operations to respond to the crisis and, where necessary, to modify the OPs. It also pointed out that some operations could be funded by the Structural Funds alone, compliance with the principle of cofinancing being assessed in terms of the average for the priority over the programming period. This meant that such operations could be entirely financed by the Funds, provided they were offset by others that were financed entirely from national funds before the end of 2015.</p>
<p>The communication ‘A Shared Commitment for Employment’ and the related measures were needed to boost job creation and counter the effect of the crisis on jobs at a time when the real economy and the labour market were beginning to feel its impact. It was accompanied by proposals for amendments to the General Regulation on the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund.</p>
<p>A key amendment provided for a two-year derogation (for 2009 and 2010) from the rules on calculating reimbursements of interim payments made in respect of ESF OPs and would have meant that, where a Member State wished to apply that option, 100% of the public contribution to a priority covered by interim payment claims up to the end of 2010 would have been reimbursed. As a result, while OPs would have had to respect the cofinancing rate for the period as a whole, they would have mirrored what is possible at operation level. Given the nature of the ESF, which is the EU’s main tool for investing in people (it supports 9 million people each year), this provision clearly sought to speed up operations in favour of people, and in particular those who need it most, the unemployed or those at risk of becoming unemployed, with a cash flow estimated at EUR 6.6 billion.</p>
<p>The Council came to a compromise agreement, which involved the payment of an additional advance of EUR 775 million from the ESF and the Cohesion Fund to the five Member States most affected by the crisis (Romania, Hungary, Lituania, Latvia and Estonia). In addition a more flexibility was proposed as regards the automatic decommitment of the 2007 commitment. </p>
<p>The Commission opposed that compromise, which it felt did not provide enough support for people affected by the crisis. The proposal is currently before Parliament.</p>
<p>The Commission proposal for a new EUROPE 2020 strategy entails several proposals asn part of flagship initiatives to make or reinforce EU instruments available for directly or indirectly combatting rising unemployment. The Flagship Initiative ‘An agenda for new skills and jobs’ proposes to facilitate and promote intra-EU labour mobility and better match labour supply with demand with appropriate financial support from the structural funds, notably the ESF. The Flagship Initiative ‘Innovation Union’ proposes to strengthen the role of structural funds, rural development funds, R&amp;D framework programme in supporting innovation. The Flagship Initiative ‘A digital Agenda for Europe’ proposes to facilitate the use of EU's structural funds in pursuit of this agenda.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concerns that many natural resources are exploited in an unsustainable manner. The Commission is working in several ways to address this problem and ensure a better conservation of biodiversity both within and beyond the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission, together with Germany and other countries, is supporting a vast independent study on The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity Loss (TEEB)<a href="#defann_27_1" name="refann_27_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. TEEB was launched by G8 Environment Ministers in 2007 and has so far delivered three reports highlighting the importance of estimating the economic value of biodiversity and the economic consequences of its continuing loss. This work is important, because as long as the value of nature remains unaccounted for, the economic interest in exploiting it will continue to prevail over efforts to conserve it. The idea is to ensure that TEEB findings and recommendations are reflected in all relevant decisions and policies and put on a par with other economic considerations (for instance by integrating this valuation into conventional accounting procedures), not only in the EU but across the globe. The TEEB final report will be presented at the 10<span class="sup">th</span> Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (COP10 CBD) in Nagoya, Japan, in October 2010.</p>
<p>This year, the UN International Year of Biodiversity, will see the negotiation of a new global biodiversity policy framework within the scope of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). The 10<span class="sup">th</span> Conference of the Parties to the CBD, in Nagoya in October 2010, will adopt a revised and updated Strategic Plan for the Convention, setting out a long-term global vision for biodiversity, a mid-term mission/headline target, and a set of goals and sub-targets to reach that mission/target. The Commission will seek to ensure that safeguarding vulnerable species is reflected in the global post-2010 framework, and to improve the conservation status of threatened species.</p>
<p>The EU will also be playing a key role at the Conference of Parties to the CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species) in March 2010. It will notably propose the adoption of measures for the protection of marine biodiversity, via the regulation of international trade in marine species subject to overexploitation. The EU will also oppose the adoption of any measure which could lead to a resumption of ivory trade in the current circumstances and will contribute to help out African States to develop a plan of action for the better conservation of elephants.</p>
<p>The Commission will also continue its efforts to ensure that its consumption of timber and timber products does not contribute to illegal logging, which often has severe negative impacts on biodiversity. This is being addressed through the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan and the proposed 'due diligence' regulation laying down obligations of operators who place timber and timber products on the market, which is currently in the co-decision process.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

UniCredit and the developer Pirelli, acting jointly and in collaboration, signed the ‘Chopin Agreement’ with Pekao SA in June 2005 but failed to inform the market and the financial supervisory authority of this, in spite of the requirement to do so. As a result, UniCredit, as the dominant shareholder, forced Pekao to conclude an unfavourable partnership agreement with Pirelli in April 2006. Pirelli and UniCredit are connected through their capital shares in the Olimpia company, in which Alessandro Profumo, CEO of UniCredit, holds an executive post. In parallel with this, an asymmetrical transaction has taken place at Olimpia, involving the purchase by Pirelli of worthless Telecom Italia shares from UniCredit.</p>

<p>(FR) Firstly, it should be pointed out that the Community dimension of a case is not necessarily or uniquely demonstrated by the simple fact that the companies concerned are located in two Member States. In this regard the Court of Justice, in accordance with established case law, has indicated that the Community dimension and interest of a case are determined on the basis of its effects on intra-Community trade and of whether the practices in question exert an influence on the trade flows between Member States in a way that could harm the achievement of the objectives of a single market (see in particular ECJ, AEPI v Commission, Case C-425/07P, specifically §42). It follows from the information provided by the honourable Member that the case in question concerns a one­off commercial agreement between two companies and that this agreement does not appear to have to be in the Community interest.</p>
<p>Furthermore, established case law also states that competition law, in particular the rules on abuse of a dominant position, do not apply in the case of relations between a subsidiary and its parent company (see in particular ECJ, Viho Europe BV v Commission, Case C-73/95). Therefore, competition law cannot be applied in the present case.</p>
<p>In view of the above-mentioned points, the Commission does not intend to intervene in the case brought to its attention by the honourable Member.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0079"></a>

<p>(EN) The EMU policy framework as laid down in the Treaty on the functioning of the European Union and the Stability and Growth Pact aims at guaranteeing sound economic and budgetary conditions. In some cases, euro area Member States have unfortunately failed to enact sound policies in good times, and developed imbalances and vulnerabilities which are extracting a high price during the crisis in terms of growth and employment and in terms of high sovereign risk premia. These countries face serious economic and fiscal challenges, which require prompt and decisive corrective action. The Commission is supporting them in this endeavour with its surveillance and policy advice activity.</p>
<p>With respect to Greece in particular, the Commission adopted a comprehensive and ambitious package of detailed recommendations on 3 February, covering fiscal policy and collection of statistics (recommendation to the Council to give notice to take action under Article 126(9) – excessive deficit procedure), a proposal for a Council Opinion on the Stability Programme, and structural reforms (Council recommendation under Art. 121(4) – inconsistency with broad economic policy guidelines and risk of jeopardising the proper functioning of economic and monetary union). The Ecofin Council adopted the respective documents on 16 February and requested a first reporting on the supporting measure to safeguard the 2010 deficit target by 16 March at the latest.</p>
<p>Both the Heads of State or Government and the Commission have called on the Greek Government to do whatever is necessary, including adopting additional measures, to ensure that the ambitious targets set in the updated stability programme, in particular the 4% of GDP reduction of the budget deficit in 2010, are reached. On 3 March, the Greek Prime Minister announced additional fiscal consolidation measures amounting to some 2% of GDP. The Commission welcomed the measures, which confirms the Greek Government's commitment to take all necessary measures to deliver the Stability Programme's objectives and in particular to ensure that the 4% of GDP deficit reduction target for 2010 is met. At the same time, the Commission stressed that full and timely implementation of fiscal measures along with decisive structural reforms in compliance with the Council decision is paramount. The Commission monitors the situation closely and remains in close contact with the Greek authorities. The Commission will prepare a mode detailed assessment of the measures in time for the mid-March Ecofin Council, based also on the foreseen reporting by the Greek authorities.</p>
<p>As stressed by the Heads of State or Government, members of the euro area share a common responsibility for the stability of the euro. Our economic policies are a matter of common concern. The critical lesson from this crisis is that we urgently need deeper and broader surveillance of economic policies, including earlier detection and tackling of imbalances, in order to better safeguard macro-financial stability in the euro area. The Commission intends to soon come forward with proposals to further strengthen the coordination and the surveillance of national economic policies within the euro area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0081"></a>

<p>Since the beginning of the financial crisis at the end of 2008, Russia has imposed a number of protectionist ‘temporary’ anti-crisis tariffs on a number of imports, such as meat and milk products, furniture, some steel products, trucks, television sets and others. What is more, on 1 January 2010 a customs union between Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan came into existence. The external tariffs that were agreed by the three countries are mostly based on Russia’s tariffs. As a result, a total of 30% of the product lines exported from the EU to Russia have seen increases in tariffs.</p>
<p>It is widely recognised that the main problem the EU faces is that Russia is not a member of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) and is therefore not bound by the WTO rules restricting unilateral increases in import tariffs and other trade-restrictive measures.</p>

<p>(EN) Since the end of 2008, Russia has followed a policy of increasing import tariffs on a broad range of products as an alleged response to the current economic crisis. In fact, Russia is the G-20 country that has adopted the largest number of protectionist measures over the past year. These measures directly hit the EU's economic interests as the EU is Russia's largest trading partner.</p>
<p>These protectionist measures were originally introduced on a temporary basis. However, they have been made permanent under the recently created Customs Union with Belarus and Kazakhstan. The new Common External Tariff of the Customs Union, in force since 1 January 2010, has consolidated most of the ‘temporary’ Russian import tariff increases and has also extended them to the other two Customs Union members.</p>
<p>During the past few months, the Commission has focussed efforts on assessing and trying to mitigate the impact of this new trade regime. The Commission has urged Russia to roll back the tariffs to the previous lower levels, on a large number of products of particular export concern for the EU. It has also repeatedly requested Russia to hold formal consultations as foreseen under the Partnership and Co-operation Agreement.</p>
<p>Up until now, Russia is still proceeding with tariff increases. It should be stated that under the current EU-Russia bilateral arrangements, Russia does not have any specific legal obligations to respect a ‘standstill’ on the level of import duties. However such standstill, while not legally enforceable, can be commonly expected from any country wishing to join the World Trade Organisation (WTO).</p>
<p>The Commission continues to be engaged in Russia's WTO accession process. Intense consultations at senior officials' level are ongoing to clarify the new situation. The Commission remains fully engaged to move the accession process forward and urges Russia to improve and stabilise its trade regime with a view to respecting the negotiated accession commitments.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0082"></a>

<p>A variety of different risk management tools are currently available in Member States. With regard to insurances, mostly classic insurance schemes are available in the EU (mainly single-risk and combined insurance, but also yield insurance), and these are generally private. In many Member States, only a limited number of insurance companies are operating. The level of development of the agricultural insurances in each country is mainly linked to two decisive factors:</p>
<p>– The needs faced by each country (risk level);</p>
<p>– The economical support to the insurance systems given by each Member State.</p>
<p>Some governments subsidize insurances while others provide aid ex-post on an ad-hoc basis through compensation schemes or calamity funds, which can be partially financed by the agricultural stakeholders on a voluntary or compulsory basis.</p>

<p>The ECOFIN Council meeting in February called on Greece to implement special budgetary adjustment measures. Mr Juncker stressed that the Commission would propose a package of possible measures to Greece aimed at reducing expenditure and increasing revenue and, by way of example, referred to cutting wage costs and increasing VAT and taxes on cars and energy.</p>
<p>Given that most of the measures taken, or about to be taken, by the Greek Government already aim to reduce wage costs and increase revenue through higher taxation, does the Commission not consider that such measures – which are tantamount to an austerity policy on revenue and income – may themselves further reduce demand for investment and consumption in the Greek economy, thereby undermining efforts towards recovery and the consolidation of public finances in Greece? Will it propose that the Greek Government take measures which are geared to actual conditions in Greece to promote growth and the recovery of productivity in the economy?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) High deficit and debt levels have a substantial negative impact on a country's ability to grow given implications on financial markets, interest rates and credit conditions. Therefore, fiscal consolidation is also necessary for growth. Though growth conditions in 2010 will be unfavourable in Greece, postponing fiscal consolidation would certainly lead to worse results in terms of growth. In compliance with the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact, Greece submitted in January 2010 an updated stability programme according to which a substantial effort towards fiscal consolidation, with the deficit declining from 12.7% of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2009 to below 3% of GDP as from 2012. A first part of the adjustment, equal to 4% of GDP, is to be achieved this year. The Commission and the Council have endorsed the Greek stability programme and consider that both the targets and the underlying measures are appropriate.</p>
<p>To the extent that risks associated with the deficit and debt ceilings materialise, additional effort is necessary to keep the budgetary targets on track. The Commission welcomes the announcement by the Greek Government on 3 March 2010 to introduce a set of additional consolidation measures equal to 2% of GDP. This announcement confirms the Greek Government's commitment to take all necessary measures to deliver the programme's objectives and in particular to ensure that the 4% of GDP deficit reduction target for 2010 will be met. The additional measures appropriately include expenditure cuts, and in particular savings in the public wage bill, which are essential for achieving permanent fiscal consolidation effects and restore competitiveness. The announced revenue-increasing measures also contribute to fiscal consolidation. Full and timely implementation of fiscal measures, along with decisive structural reforms, in compliance with the Council decision is paramount. This is in the interest of the Greek people, who will benefit from sounder public finances, better growth prospects and job opportunities. It is as well important for the overall financial stability of the euro area.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0098"></a>

<p>(EN) In reply to the honourable Member's question, the Commission considers that improving child safety on the Internet and in particular on social networking sites is an important and shared responsibility of public authorities, parents, schools and industry.</p>
<p>In the framework of the Safer Internet Programme<a href="#defann_35_1" name="refann_35_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> the Commission facilitated the signature of a self-regulatory agreement, the ‘Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU’<a href="#defann_35_2" name="refann_35_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in 2009 by 20 companies Arto, Bebo, Dailymotion, Facebook, Giovani.it, Google, Hyves, Microsoft Europe, MySpace, Nasza-klaza.pl, Netlog, One.lt, Piczo, Rate.ee, Skyrock, Tuenti, Sulake, VZnet Netzwerk Ltd., Yahoo!Europe and Zap.lu. These companies recognised their responsibility and identify potential risks on their sites for under 18s, including cyberbullying, grooming, and risky behaviour like revealing personal information. They aim to limit these risks by a number of specific measures.</p>
<p>The Commission is monitoring the implementation of this agreement very closely. On 9th February 2010, the Commission published an evaluation report of implementation of the Safer Social Networking Principles based on an analysis of the companies' safety policies and testing of the respective sites by independent experts. The report shows that most of these companies have taken action and empowered minors by making it easier to change privacy settings, block users or delete unwanted comments and content. Yet more needs to be done since only 40% of the companies only make profiles of under-18 users visible only to their friends by default, and only one third replied to user reports asking for help.</p>
<p>The Commission will analyse in detail the individual results of each signatory and will follow-up on individual basis with each company where more efforts are needed to fully implement specific parts of the social networking principles. As foreseen in the ‘Safer Social Networking Principles for the EU’ signed by the companies, the European Social Networking Task Force<a href="#defann_35_3" name="refann_35_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>will meet again this year, to discuss further possibilities of improving the online safety of under 18s who use social networking sites.</p>
<p>Besides, the Commission is reviewing the current European rules on data protection and privacy. To this end, the Commission has run a public consultation on the revision of the Data Protection Directive<a href="#defann_35_4" name="refann_35_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, which ended in December 2009. Its results show that many citizens want more rigorous consent requirements in relation to minors in the online world.</p>
<p>In addition, the Safer Internet Day's theme on 9 February this year was ‘Think before you post’ to encourage youngsters in particular to pay attention to the personal information they put on the Internet.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the Commission indicated in its reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-7-2009-5058_EN.html">E-5058/09</a>, differences in treatment applied by service providers according to the nationality or the place of residence of their costumers (such as restrictions to the use of credit cards that prevent customers from a Member State to have access to services provided from an online store in another Member State) are dealt with specifically by the non-discrimination clause in Article 20, paragraph 2 of Directive 123/2006/EC on Services in the Internal Market (the ‘Services Directive’). While prohibiting discrimination, this provision also specifies that not all differences in treatment are forbidden since differences in the conditions of access will be allowed ‘when those differences are directly justified by objective criteria’.</p>
<p>The enforcement of national legislation implementing this provision lies primarily within the responsibility of national authorities and courts. The Commission is not empowered to start infringement proceedings against a private party on the basis of Article 20(2) of the Services Directive. However, it is providing assistance to Member States in order to make sure that national provisions transposing Article 20(2) of the Services Directive are implemented and enforced correctly at national level by national authorities and courts. In particular, in this context, the Commission has recently published a study on business practices susceptible to fall within Article 20(2) and on the possible reasons behind them. Consumers having suffered from cases of possible discrimination may also seek redress by contacting assistance bodies in their countries such as bodies members of the ECC (European Consumer Centres) Network.</p>
<p>When applying these provisions, national authorities and courts will have to take account of objective criteria which may justify the different treatment.</p>
<p>In addition, as the honourable Member may know, it also needs to be pointed out that authors' copyright and rights related to copyright such as rights of record producers and performers in sound recordings of music held in online stores are usually licensed on a national basis. However, the Commission is not in the possession of information suggesting that the need to obtain copyright clearances to offer services in Poland explains why the iTunes' on-line store is not available in that Member State</p>
<p>In addition to the application of the above-mentioned non-discrimination clause in Article 20(2) of the Services Directive, autonomous decisions by dominant companies need to be assessed under Article 102 TFEU which prohibits, as incompatible with the common market, any abuse of a dominant position by one or more undertakings, insofar as it may affect trade between Member States.</p>
<p>The Commission continues to pursue efforts to achieve the removal of the obstacles still impeding the development of legitimate pan-European music services and to enable consumers to buy from any online store in the EU, irrespective of their place of residence. The removal of the identified obstacles, together with the effective enforcement in Member States of Article 20(2) of the Services Directive will be of fundamental importance to achieve these objectives.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0107"></a>

<p>(EN) The creation of an area without internal border control is flanked by accompanying measures, amongst which effective police and judicial cooperation. With this in mind, EU Law enforcement agencies such as EUROPOL and EUROJUST have been created and a number of legal instruments have been adopted to allow Member States to effectively fight cross border crime such as for example a Decision from 2008 on the stepping up of cross-border cooperation, particularly in combating terrorism and cross-border crime. The provisions concern in particular the automated exchange of information with regard to major events and for the purpose of fighting terrorism, as well as regarding other forms of cross-border police cooperation.</p>
<p>As far as the efficiency of entry bans is concerned, the attention of the honourable Member is drawn to Directive 2008/115/EC on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (to be transposed by Member States by December 2010) which provides for a harmonised EU-wide entry ban. This entry ban has preventative effects and fosters the credibility of a European return policy by sending a clear message that those who have no right to stay and disregarded migration rules in EU Member States will not be allowed to re-enter any EU Member State for a specific period.</p>
<p>As far as Bulgaria and Romania are concerned, in accordance with the Act of Accession, the lifting of internal border controls is preceded by a specific evaluation process to verify whether all preconditions for the application of the Schengen acquis are met.</p>
<p>This evaluation covers the areas of external borders, visa, police cooperation, the Schengen Information System and data protection. Bulgaria and Romania set their target date for lifting internal border control for March 2011. Evaluations have started in 2009 and will continue throughout 2010.</p>
<p>The conclusion on whether (or not) all preconditions are fulfilled and the decision on the lifting of internal border control falls under the full responsibility of the Member States.</p>
<p>The success of the Schengen area depends on mutual trust between Member States and their capacity to implement fully those accompanying measures which enable the lifting of internal border controls. The effective fight against corruption and the strengthening of police and judicial cooperation are important factors which are crucial for building this trust. The Commission encourages efforts and closely follows the developments in this area in Bulgaria and Romania. In the framework of the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, the Commission assesses the reform of judiciary, fight against corruption and organised crime. Handling cross-border crimes are an important factor of the evaluation. The Commission bases its assessment on various sources, including information coming from the Member States, and gives recommendations in its summer reports how to improve the situation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2010-0110"></a>

<p>The privatisation of Skaramanga shipyards forced through by successive Greek governments has had painful consequences for workers, since hundreds of jobs have been lost. 'ThyssenKrupp', the owner of the shipyards, is now selling them after earning 3 billion euros for the construction of submarines, although it denounced the contracts with the Greek State and failed to deliver the product. The shipyards have been broken up, and a separate rolling stock company has been established. The 160 workers employed there have not been paid for approximately 10 months. The press has reported about hundreds of new job losses and bargaining between multinationals for ownership of the shipyards and with the government so that it gives the new owners a 'dowry' of billions of euros from the 2010-2011 arms programmes.</p>
<p>Does the Commission consider that the liberalisation of the markets and the application of the laws of competition to the shipbuilding industry, decided on by the EU and national governments, has led to the marginalisation of this sector in Greece, a seafaring country par excellence, job losses and the violation of workers' rights in order to allow monopolistic groups to make a profit?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The application of the laws of competition aim at ensuring fair and effective competition for the benefit of Europe and its citizens, as competition cuts prices, raises quality, expands customer choice, promotes technological innovation and, consequently, boosts the European economy. The Competition rules of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union include a general prohibition of state aid, save under exceptional justified circumstances, in order to ensure that government interventions do not distort competition and trade inside the EU. The Commission can in certain circumstances authorise aid for the restructuring of a firm in difficulty, including in the shipbuilding sector. However, it is the responsibility of the public authorities to ensure that the aid is properly implemented.</p>
<p>In 1997, the Commission gave Greece the chance to finance the restructuring of the civil commercial activities of Hellenic Shipyards by authorising EUR 160 million of aid<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Unfortunately, some crucial conditions attached to the approval have not been complied with. In addition, Greece repeatedly provided unlawful and incompatible financing to the loss-making civil activities of the yard until 2002.</p>
<p>The Commission has a supervisory role to ensure that state aid rules are correctly applied by Member States. Because of the breaches of the conditions and the unlawful aid provided subsequently to the shipyard, the Commission, in July 2008, following an in-depth investigation under EC Treaty state aid rules, requested Greece to recover more than EUR 230 million of illegal aid<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to note that as regards the selling of the shipyards or any other decision regarding its reorganisation, only the owner of the shipyards is responsible for such decisions. The Commission's powers are limited to the control of interventions of the State in the economy; they cannot interfere with a company's industrial choices.</p>
<p>Aiming at the protection of employees, the EU legal framework provides for several directives that might be of particular interest in the context of restructuring the shipbuilding industry in the EU, notably Council Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 concerning collective redundancies<a href="#defann_38_3" name="refann_38_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, Directive 94/45/EC concerning the European Works Councils<a href="#defann_38_4" name="refann_38_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, Directive 2002/14/EC establishing a general framework relating to information and consultation of workers in the EC<a href="#defann_38_5" name="refann_38_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, Council Directive 2001/23/EC concerning the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses<a href="#defann_38_6" name="refann_38_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a> and Directive 2008/94/EC on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer<a href="#defann_38_7" name="refann_38_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The directives having been transposed in Greece, it is up to the competent national authorities, in particular the courts, to ensure the proper and effective application of national transposing provisions in the light of the specific circumstances of each case with a view to the fulfilment of any employer’s duties in this regard.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
