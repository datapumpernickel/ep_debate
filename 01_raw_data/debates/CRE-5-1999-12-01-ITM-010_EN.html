This House should therefore be able tomorrow to adopt these two proposals for European Parliament and Council regulations on the implementation of measures, on one hand, to promote economic and social development in Turkey and, on the other, to intensify the EC-Turkey Customs Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal involves financing, over the next three years, up to a total of EUR 135 million based on Article 130 of the EC Treaty. This requires the codecision procedure to be used. The second proposal which, over the same period, provides for a commitment of EUR 15 million, may come under a simple consultation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is therefore prepared to resume the financial aid decided on in March 1995 under the Customs Union agreements. This aid has been blocked since then due to a lack of unanimity in Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not expand on the reasons for this blockage other than to say that the crisis in the Aegean played a major part. European concerns in the essential areas of respect for human rights and the protection of ethnic minorities were also very much taken into consideration. In this respect, the forum which was requested by this House should have an important role to play. It could use the existing structures, particularly within the Economic and Social Committee of the European Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals for regulations submitted for our approval will, under these conditions, help to encourage the continuation of the current political development. They contain a clause authorising the Council to take the appropriate steps if it were proven that the most basic rights were being violated in Turkey. This clause stipulates that either this House or the Commission could propose suspension to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I must stress that if we care about the coherence of the strategy adopted and approved by this House in recent months, we should avoid introducing, through our amendments, any measures which would block the process that has been started. We must not lose sight of the importance of encouraging a fruitful dialogue with Turkey, if only, for example, for obvious geostrategic reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as a reminder, although the provisions establishing all this aid involve financing over three years of EUR 150 million, the European Union’s trade surplus with Turkey has doubled since the entry into force on 1 January 1996 of the Customs Union agreement, thereby increasing in four years from EUR 4 billion to EUR 8 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">I truly believe that the Community must now honour its previous commitments so as not to discourage all those in Turkey who are resolutely committed to the Customs Union route and who have therefore decided to attach their country to the European Economic Area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on Budgets’ amendments have been integrated into the reports, and one could wish for nothing better. In the Commission’s proposals concerning resources for promoting economic and social development in Turkey and for extending the Customs Union between the European Community and Turkey, it is proposed that the period 2000-2002 should be covered, because the year is now so far advanced that it is too late to establish new budget headings for this purpose in 1999. The Committee on Budgets also wishes reference to be made to the interinstitutional agreement of 6 May of this year and for it to be stated that the recommended amounts for the period 2000-2002 should constitute a portion of the multiannual financial framework for the MEDA programme so that it is apparent that we are not concerned here with a new expenditure item. </p>
<p class="contents">Ever since the European Council confirmed in December 1997 that Turkey could apply for membership of the EU, efforts have been made to create the opportunity to provide financial aid with a view to promoting economic cooperation and bringing Turkey closer to the EU. This, then, is the background to these proposals, on the one hand, for a three-year subsidy of EUR 15 million when a start is made on implementing the Community’s regulations and developing the Customs Union between the EC and Turkey and, on the other hand, for the subsidy of EUR 135 million for developing the economically backward regions of Turkey. These resources therefore have nothing to do with the special subsidy, proposed in the budget for the year 2000, for reconstruction and aid in connection with the earthquakes in Turkey. </p>
<p class="contents">In 1998 and 1999, Turkey was allocated grants under the MEDA programme, the European Parliament’s having approved the Commission’s programmes following participation in an interinstitutional working party. The Committee on Budgets also decided that this working party should be maintained during the reading of the Budget for the year 2000. </p>
<p class="contents">I have just one technical remark on Amendment No 15 in the report concerning economic cooperation where it is stated that the Council (with a qualified majority) or the European Parliament can decide to suspend the partnership. We are talking here about joint decision making, so the Council cannot decide without Parliament’s being heard. This is just by way of clarifying the interpretation of this proposal. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should say that, this year, the policy-making process has been delayed by the parliamentary election and by the special circumstances in connection with the Commission’s departure. It is good that a resolution can now be adopted to press ahead with the financial aid in accordance with the political conditions linked to the grants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all in his debt and his reward has been the favourable vote in the Committee on Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">These reports clearly respond to commitments made by the European Union. The Customs Union with Turkey has to be accompanied by special budget aid and a series of special loans from the European Investment Bank, in addition to the programmes provided for under the MEDA programme and procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">This aid consists of two types of measure. The first is aimed at strengthening economic and social cohesion and overcoming the regional development inequalities within the country. The other is intended to help Turkey gradually gain access to the Community market, take on the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> and intensify the Customs Union. For this last objective, a three-year multiannual framework of EUR 15 million is provided. As no budget cover exists for these amounts in 1999, the multiannual financial framework of the programme will have to be extended by one year to 2002, as mentioned today by the rapporteur. The appropriations for 1999 will also have to be included in the draft supplementary and amending budget.</p>
<p class="contents">It is impossible to separate the Morillon report from the general context of relations with Turkey. We have today debated with the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission the problems which have occurred, the proposals made by the European Commission in its report on the Helsinki Summit and also the position which the Council of Ministers will presumably adopt.</p>
<p class="contents">This House adopted a resolution in October which clearly marks the line which should be followed by the European Parliament. However, as stated today by Mr Poettering, on behalf of my group, there are some disagreements within our group as to the importance, nature and scope to be attributed to Turkey’s application.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly believe, and I said this in the debate in October, that for the first time all the pieces of the Turkish jigsaw are on the table, namely the problems of the Aegean islands, Cyprus, human rights and ethnic minorities. A major debate is currently in progress on the ratification of the death penalty imposed on Mr Öçalan.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the rapporteur that the vote on these reports should not now be taken off the agenda. This House has made an inescapable commitment to a moratorium on the death penalty, as we did in the debate in the last plenary part-session, on which I understand the President has written to the Turkish authorities. I therefore feel that the European Union must honour its commitments and, at the same time, recognise that nobody has been executed in Turkey for fifteen years.</p>
<p class="contents">This must not lead us to forget the commitment we have made to the defence of human rights, fundamental freedoms and the ethnic minorities in Turkey. In my opinion, we must be very clear and send an unambiguous message to the Turkish authorities about what they can expect from us and what their corresponding rights are. We must be extremely clear in this respect, by stressing that they are entitled to apply but that it is not in our interest to start these accession negotiations until the Copenhagen criteria, and the political commitments in particular, have been met.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s commitment must be to therefore very firmly support the excellent reports presented by Mr Morillon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree, however, with Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra that these reports are part of a larger pattern in our relationship with Turkey. I think that the most important message which is coming out of the European Union at the present time is that Turkey is entitled to apply for membership of the Union. It might well be said that this is an opportunity which Turkey has had for almost thirty-five years, ever since the Association Agreement. It is, however, important that we point this out at the present time. </p>
<p class="contents">We need a democratically stable, socially and economically developed Turkey in the European partnership. That is important for our security and our future in Europe. For us, the views of the democrats in Turkey and of those struggling for human rights within organisations dedicated to that purpose are obviously very significant. Almost all of these people are in favour of Turkey being regarded as an candidate country. The Kurdish question, the issue of Cyprus, torture and breaches of human rights are also, at a serious level, European matters which will be discussed, examined and dealt with at different monitoring stations within the European Union. In this way, resolutions and the war of words will be translated into the genuine work of reform involving clear and agreed goals. At a big international seminar two weeks ago, arranged by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation, all the Turkish parties, including the old Welfare Party, declared themselves in favour of applicant states such as Turkey becoming members of the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">For Turkey, this now means that matters have become serious. The move must now be made from ambitions and intentions to the purposeful work of reform in accordance with the Copenhagen criteria. For our part, we now want to challenge the Turkish government to translate their words into action and show that they are serious in their endeavour to enter the European partnership. We should then demonstrate that we too are serious about their efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union has made major efforts over a number of years to ensure this Customs Union is successful, and Turkey herself must now ensure that she fulfils the role that she is called upon to play.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support what is perhaps the more contentious report. It is a welcome report on economic and social development in Turkey and was supported in the Committee for Foreign Affairs this week. Here the joint forum has to be of major importance, and again both sides must fulfil their role. We are, of course, confident that we will do so. We remain confident that Turkey will also.</p>
<p class="contents">In this period of time before Helsinki, it is vital that we look too at the rule of law, human rights, respect for minorities, protection and recognition of their cultural identity and support for measures seeking to abolish capital punishment, one of the amendments that came before our committee to the Morillon report this week.</p>
<p class="contents">We have, of course, the unhappy fact of one death penalty upheld in Turkey at this very moment. But I believe there is good news that we can focus on even in that tragic situation where the possibility of a citizen losing his life at the hands of the State is upheld by the Court of Appeal. May I remind my colleagues here today that Turkey has not used the death penalty in practice since 1984. There has been an effective moratorium in place since then with the result that 53 people who were defined as subject to what we would call cruel and inhuman punishment, have had their cases put on one side.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment the Minister for the European Council and Human Rights, is reported in today's issue of <span class="italic">Milliyet</span>, the daily paper, as being firmly against capital punishment. There is a new law coming to the Turkish Parliament in the year 2000, put forward by academics, in which for the first time ever the proposed criminal justice bill does not contain the death penalty. Let us hope and believe that in this year 2000, Turkey's commitment to our millennium year globally will be the abolition of the death penalty once and for all through the democratic parliamentary process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has proposed that Turkey should be accorded candidate status. If the Council in Helsinki accepts this proposal, it would lay the foundations in Turkey for a new form of dialogue with the European Union, in that Ankara would then have the prospect of future membership. It would also mean that the Union would have to keep its promises. The rapporteur’s proposals allow the mistakes of 1995 to be corrected, when the European Union intensified relations with Turkey, without guaranteeing the necessary financial aid. Financial aid for Turkey cannot be divorced from obligations in the fields of social development and democracy, rule of law and respect for human and minority rights.</p>
<p class="contents">This is referred to equally in both reports because it is important that participation in the European economic system should go hand in glove with democratic development. Another important point is the involvement of the European Parliament. Its debates can provide further transparency and raise the political and democratic profile of relations between the European Union and Turkey. The case of Öçalan – I am referring to the death penalty – raises the question of how we will have to deal with such issues in the future. There can be only one response from all the political groups in this House and that is the demand that capital punishment be abolished. It is not a question of making an angel of peace of Öçalan. On the contrary, we need to demonstrate that respect for human rights means much more than empty rhetoric, of course it does, and not just in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">This House should call on Turkey to comply with the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights, which is incompatible with the execution of Öçalan. I can read Turkish and I am pleased that, so far, I have seen no reports of negative reactions from the government in Ankara in the Turkish press or in other Turkish media. That gives me reason to hope.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite everything said about Turkey today, it is important for us to pursue the new Turkish policy of the European Union. In this sense we support the two reports as a contribution to the democratisation of Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They succeed in presenting the political requirements of cooperation with Turkey clearly and consistently, especially the need for compliance with, and development of, human rights, including the rights of the Kurdish people, the demand for the abolition of capital punishment, the strengthening of the civil society, greater involvement by non-governmental organisations and the abolition of social deprivation and regional under-development.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that these changes were necessary reflects badly on the Commission. The fact that they were possible reflects well on the parliamentary committee and the work of Mr Morillon. Nonetheless, my decision has been made extraordinarily difficult. The Commission maintains in its proposal that a process of democratisation and promotion of human rights has been introduced in Turkey and we heard similar words from Mr Prodi this afternoon. The committee, on the other hand, only talks clearly of the need for such a process, but not of an allegedly positive development already under way. Not only does that appear to be decidedly more realistic to me; it also tallies with the evaluation which the Commission itself made in a communication to the Cologne Summit on 3 and 4 June this year. Twice it says that it sees no noticeable improvement, at least on the Kurdish question, and it rates any chance of further improvement as doubtful given the rise of, in the Commission’s words, the ultra-nationalist MHP party. I am most baffled as to what our optimism is actually based on and why the Commission has circulated two contradictory assessments.</p>
<p class="contents">From where I stand, it appears perfectly clear that there has been no real, positive development in the issues raised. The Turkish Vice-Premier Bahcelý of the MHP stated in connection with the upholding of the death sentence on Öçalan – perhaps it only appeared in the German newspapers – that Europe should not be encouraged to interfere even more boldly in Turkish affairs and President Ecevit expressed the view that a judgement by the Court of Justice in Strasbourg need not be accepted. That clearly contradicts the commitments entered into by Turkey as a member of the Council of Europe. Their own international legal commitments continue to be openly disregarded by Turkish officials when it comes to human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I consider the honest offer of membership of the European Union to Turkey to be strategically correct and necessary. The European Union must have room for and an interest in including Turkey and must clarify that unequivocally once and for all. However, there can be no cutting back on demands for democratisation of the constitution and political realities, fundamental improvements in respect for human rights, a political solution to the Kurdish question and an end to the occupation of northern Cyprus. All this is still outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow we must adopt either the Commission version or the committee version of Article 3(2). Both versions contain terms for suspending cooperation in the event of fundamental violations of human rights. I see these violations and therefore consider that it is wrong to pass this text at this point in time. That would push our own paper and our own credibility <span class="italic">ad absurdum</span>. My group therefore is in favour under these circumstances of deferring both reports. We sent a proper signal to the Russian Government in a similar situation two weeks ago. We should handle this matter in the same way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would even go so far as to say that the European Union should encourage cooperation between its Member States and Turkey. The reports that we are debating here today nevertheless give us the opportunity to reflect once again on Turkey’s progress in terms of human rights and the protection of minorities. In this context, we were extremely concerned to hear of the confirmation by the Supreme Court in Turkey of the death sentence on Öçalan.</p>
<p class="contents">I am a Member of the European Parliament for Portugal, a country that abolished the death penalty as long ago as the 19th Century. We were, moreover, the first European Union country to do so. Personally, I reject this form of punishment, both out of conviction and because I do not think that it achieves any of the aims that punishment seeks to achieve. Consequently, we feel that it would now be timely to give yet another very clear signal that the preservation of human rights and the protection of minorities in Turkey are still an essential condition for the European Parliament to show its solidarity in terms of cooperation and support for that country. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would like to point out that just yesterday, here in Strasbourg, the European Court of Human Rights accepted a request for a stay of execution for Öçalan whilst it examines the case. I was also pleased to read that President Nicole Fontaine reacted speedily to the confirmation of this sentence and I also read that she would intervene with the President of the Turkish National Assembly in order that it should not confirm the carrying out of the death sentence. I do not know if she was able to obtain any guarantees from him or not. My feeling is that the European Parliament should look with the utmost caution at developments, not just in this case but also in Turkey’s human rights situation, and in the protection of its minorities, and this caution should be matched with an equal degree of firmness. </p>
<p class="contents">To this effect, tomorrow I shall propose – contrary to what others here appear to think should be done – that we postpone voting on the two reports until a later sitting, and I would therefore ask the President of the European Parliament on behalf of the institution over which she presides, to formulate a clear request to the Helsinki European Council that if the decision by the Turkish authorities stands, the Council should adopt a firm position with regard to Turkey’s application to join the European Union. I think that only in this way will the European Parliament be effectively and unambiguously defending principles and values rather than just stating them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I visited Turkey as a member of the Committee on Human Rights of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, and I therefore think I am speaking after due consideration. It is not only the Öçalan case which leads me say that Turkey is not yet ready to apply: Mr Öçalan, among other things, was practically handed over by the D’Alema Government – a black mark against Italy’s name – but on the other hand, it was precisely from the Italian Penal Code that Turkey borrowed article 155 of its own Penal Code, which permitted Mr Öçalan to be condemned – article 155 of the Turkish Penal Code was copied from article 241 of the Italian Penal Code – and therefore I was not in the least surprised by the position of the Italian Government on this case either. Be that as it may, Turkey still has the death penalty: well, while it is hard to change the mentality of the police and change the situation in the prisons, a law is, nevertheless, sufficient and a parliamentary vote is sufficient to abolish the death penalty, which is what many countries in the European Union have done. How one can have capital punishment and at the same time ask to join the European Union is something that still astounds me, but I am even more astonished that there is talk of granting candidate status to a country that has not yet abolished capital punishment. For this reason too, therefore, I am in favour of postponing the vote. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Indeed, it is the exactly the latter circumstance which threatens to thwart the Ecevit Government’s opportune intention of starting to eliminate the grinding socio-economic disadvantage of the Turkish south-eastern provinces. The rapporteur is right in stipulating that EU-financed projects and programmes, in particular, should benefit those sections of the Turkish population who are lagging behind. </p>
<p class="contents">However, we do not wish to conceal the fact that we certainly would not want to interpret this helping hand from Brussels to Ankara as a political gesture pointing towards candidate status vis-à-vis the EU. In our opinion, the agreed Customs Union offers plenty of scope for Turkey to be given opportunities for development. As far as we are concerned, the highest level of European cooperation with Turkey has been reached with this effort. </p>
<p class="contents">Quite significantly, the appeals made to Turkey by the rapporteur and other submitters of amendments, to finally walk the difficult path to becoming a democratic constitutional State, are in line with our fundamental objections to confirming Ankara’s candidate status. Why does the European Union not speak in plain terms? False hope on both sides would, in any case make us fear for a speedy relapse into the old situation of “cold friendship”. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Let me just take a slightly different tack to that pursued by a number of the previous speakers. I really believe that we should be talking in more encouraging tones to Turkey at the moment. Many of us wish to see positive progress in the development of the Union's relations with Turkey, and it is most important therefore that obstacles to the provision of EU financial aid for Turkey are removed as soon as possible. Not only that, but in recognition of Turkey's candidate status, which we trust will be endorsed and taken forward shortly by the European Council in Helsinki, we should be thinking in terms of a more ambitious programme of assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, the measures proposed are aimed at enabling Turkey to put in place the necessary structural adjustments resulting from the Customs Union which operates very much at the moment in the European Union's favour. Mr Prodi, when he was speaking to this House on 13 October, suggested that an accession partnership similar to the partnerships established with the official candidate countries would also help Turkey move steadily towards meeting the membership criteria. It is recognised that accession negotiations cannot commence until the political criteria are met but we must give Turkey every assistance to get to this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">In Parliament's resolution of 6 October, we resolved to work speedily on the technical and financial assistance necessary to complete the Customs Union; and we called on the Council to support the necessary measures. We have now reached that stage and trust that Council will be wholly supportive of our proposals. We should also be prepared to begin consideration of measures that will help bring Turkey closer to our values and our economic approach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Morillon report provides us with a good opportunity to discuss a European strategy for Turkey without beating about the bush. </p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we all agree that, in the European Union, no issue has been as controversial and given rise to as much tension and opposition as that of relations between the European Union and Turkey, and this is understandable, because Turkey has nothing in common with any other country involved in the enlargement process. The other twelve countries together create fewer problems than Turkey does alone: economic and social problems, problems relating to human rights, democracy and respect for minorities. In short, it has created problems of security and stability in south-east Europe by basing its foreign policy either on open violence, as in Cyprus where it continues to occupy the northern part of the island, or on the threat of violence, as when the Turkish parliament officially stated that if Greece exercised its sovereign rights in territorial waters in the Aegean this would be a casus belli. </p>
<p class="contents">The question of a European strategy for Turkey is basically quite simple. The European Union is not going to change for Turkey’s sake, but Turkey is going to battle to become a European country. Europe is not going to become Turkish; Turkey is going to become European. The European strategy for Turkey must make clear to the Turkish political classes and to Turkish society that there is not going to be a separate set of rules for Turkey and that Turkey must meet all the criteria set in Copenhagen and Luxembourg if its European prospects are to prosper. </p>
<p class="contents">The Union must make it clear in the run up to Helsinki that it should respect international law on Cyprus. The Union must make it clear that the integration process for Cyprus will continue, regardless of any form of blackmail by Turkey. The Union must ensure that all applicant countries, Turkey included, respect international treaties and international law and cooperate with neighbouring countries to promote peace, and that any disputes are resolved through international law and international judicial bodies, such as the International Court of Justice in The Hague. Yes, Turkey should become a member of the Union but it should leave violence, unlawfulness and autocracy outside Europe’s door and enter in peace and democracy. That is what the Turkish people want and it is what its neighbour Greece and its fellow citizens want. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The majority in this Parliament did approve following tortuous debates since approval would encourage the Turkish Government to arrive at an acceptable human rights policy, true democracy and a political solution to end the Kurdish issue. </p>
<p class="contents">We find that the outcome is not altogether convincing. With the sentencing to death of the Kurdish leader Öçalan and confirmation thereof, we are once again faced with the tragic consequences of an unresolved request for respect and right of self-determination on behalf of a people, the Kurdish people, in Turkey. </p>
<p class="contents">In Turkey, a great deal of pressure is being exerted by various parties and groups on Turkish society to demand the execution of Öçalan. Turkey is not yet ready to abolish the death sentence by a long shot, even if the death sentence is not actually carried out. Turkey has to provide us with a guarantee that the life of Öçalan will be spared. If this is not the case, the hope that a political solution will be reached for the Kurdish issue in Turkey will once again be dashed. The despair of the Kurds will not do much for stability in our countries either. We know that thousands of Kurds live here.</p>
<p class="contents">I would nevertheless like to join in the congratulations extended to the rapporteur, as the text of his report is, in many ways, an improvement on the Commission’s proposal. One could say that the financial support follows on from earlier decisions reached by us. But think it through: if we vote on the text, the report stipulates that financial cooperation can be suspended in the event that the democratic principles of the constitutional State, human rights or fundamental liberties are violated. Does this not imply that, if we grant financial benefits today, the goalposts for human rights, etc. have already been set and that, consequently, only a deterioration of the current situation could lead to suspension? As far as we are concerned, the goalposts of these measures do not go far enough. We would like to see the situation in Turkey drastically improve in terms of democratisation and human rights and in terms of a solution to the Kurdish issue, but we hope that this is possible without having to exert financial pressure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, we are being urged to vote in favour of the two regulations and the release of the relevant appropriations to Turkey, both because it has made significant progress towards democratisation and in order to encourage it to go still further in that direction. Contrary to claims by the Council and the Commission to the effect that democracy is progressing in Turkey, claims which demonstrate that the first to benefit from progress are the multinationals, it is blindingly obvious that the situation has, in fact, deteriorated. </p>
<p class="contents">So what is happening today? Turkey is still illegally occupying 38% of Cyprus in full contravention of international law, it is continuing with its provocations against Greece; it is still engaged in barbarous ethnic cleansing and genocide against the Kurdish people; it still insists on resolving the Kurdish issue through military intervention and it is continuing its military operations against the Kurds in Northern Iraq. Over 12 000 political prisoners are being held in its prisons where torture and murder are an everyday occurrence. Leila Zana, winner of the Sakharov prize, is still in prison, as are three Kurdish parliamentarians and famous writers and journalists. Recently, twelve political prisoners protesting against inhumane prison conditions were murdered.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the case of Mr Öçalan who, aside from the inhumane way in which he was abducted and imprisoned, was sentenced to death in a mockery of a trial, and whose sentence was unanimously upheld two days ago by the Turkish Supreme Court of Appeal. That shows just how sensitive the Ankara authorities really are to appeals for democratisation. Secondly, we are told that if we accept these regulations and release these appropriations, it will help the democratisation process. We were told the same thing when the Customs Union was signed five years ago. However, neither the constitution nor the criminal code has been democratised. The death penalty has still not been abolished, nor has the Kurdish issue been resolved politically and, according to statements by Turkish ministers, the Cyprus question “is no longer an issue”. So, believe me, if we vote in favour of the two regulations under discussion, despite their positive aspects, then this will certainly encourage the Turkish regime, which claims that Turkey is the most advanced democracy in all of Europe, to tighten its existing policies. We do not want to hit the forces fighting for true democracy, we want to send a message of solidarity to prisoners and push for real democratisation of the regime, which is why we urge you to vote against these two reports or, at least, to refer them back to the committee until such time as Turkey shows tangible evidence of democratisation and respect for international law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This time, instead of culture, the nature of the European intervention is intended to support the social and economic development of the Mediterranean country and, for the umpteenth time, the question that we are all silently asking ourselves remains: can, and indeed should, the European Union in any way support a State that is geographically close, if not contiguous, surrounded by the same sea that washes upon the coasts of Southern Europe, even if that State appears extremely distant as regards respect for human rights? We are disappointed to note that since 1996, the year when the Aegean Sea crisis led the European Community to block the agreement on the Customs Union with Turkey, no headway has been made towards obtaining total respect for civil rights and the protection of minorities. While the Turkish Government has made some half-hearted attempts in recent years, the recent death sentence placed on the Kurdish leader, Mr Öçalan, has made any possible political <span class="italic">rapprochement</span> between Turkey and the European Union more remote. And yet, as we have maintained several times in this Chamber, the process of a community’s democratic growth also occurs through its economic and social development. To deny the financial aid proposed by the Commission for the next three years for the development of the Customs Union would, especially at this tragic time when this Mediterranean country is on its knees following a terrible catastrophe, contribute to exacerbating a downward spiral with unimaginable consequences to Turkey. </p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, the Italian delegation from <span class="italic">Alleanza Nazionale</span> thinks it more sensible to have a carefully considered acceptance of cooperation with Turkey, subordinating it to specific, tangible actions to bring its government into line with western European democracies. Democracy has a price, Mr President: asking Turkey to pay it is an act not of weakness, but of great responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, because we have heard some criticism of the Commission, I would like to congratulate you and your officials, who are with us today, for the committed approach which they take to this issue, and for always communicating and discussing matters with Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, assessments sometimes turn out differently in various Commission documents and papers. But perhaps that has more to do with erratic Turkish policy, which sometimes makes more and sometimes makes less progress. But anyone who sees things as they really are will note that some progress has been made over recent months and it deserves acknowledgement. We must not fail to take the matter seriously, as some previous speakers have said and done, for to do otherwise would only give succour to the Turkish government! What I wonder is: how come Akim Birdal is in favour of introducing a new strategy, how come other Kurdish representatives are in favour of our introducing a new strategy, how come the entire opposition to the government and civil society are in favour of our introducing a new strategy if all it does is support the government?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to extend my special thanks to the Greek government and to foreign secretary Papandreou; that was a courageous step, especially in light of domestic political relations. It was also a highly risky step which was clearly also motivated by the situation in Cyprus and the attempt to bring Cyprus closer to the European Union and find a political solution to the Cyprus question.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are not uncritical of Turkey; on the contrary. I repeat, Turkey would be a lot further down the road to Europe if it had applied fundamentally different measures in the field of human rights and minority rights in good time, at the right time, especially with regard to the Kurdish question, democracy in relation to Greece and a contribution towards solving the problem in Cyprus. But if the Council decides in the next few days – I say <span class="italic">if</span> – to officially recognise Turkey as a candidate, then Turkey must realise that the ball is in its court. Then it will be up to Turkey to make the next move, because we will have made a move, partly in response to the minor changes which we have seen, partly in anticipation of what might, should and must follow. But then the ball will be in Turkey’s court and it is up to Turkey to make the next move if further progress is to be made in bringing Turkey and Europe closer together. We want to have Turkey in the European Union, but Turkey knows full well that only a Turkey which recognises the Copenhagen criteria can become a member of the European Union. Every candidate country knows that and Turkey should know it too. I trust that it will soon take steps to meet these criteria. It will, without doubt, take a number of years, but the more quickly Turkey acts, the more quickly it will become a member of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This distinguished colleague endeavoured to improve the Commission’s proposals. However, we should refer both these texts back, because we are not a schizophrenic parliament which says one thing for Chechnya and another for Turkey. We cannot afford to be a parliament which is politically dead. </p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki Summit takes place in a few days’ time. And what will our message be? Everything’s fine? We have adopted the regulations? Never mind about Öçalan? Never mind, look at it from a tourist’s perspective! In Greece, Turkey and the Eastern Mediterranean, we slaughter a cock and daub its blood over the foundations of a new house. Never mind if Öçalan is sacrificed or is in danger of being sacrificed over the foundations of Turkey’s accession to the European Union? </p>
<p class="contents">Is that what we are going to say to the Summit? And for what? For two regulations, one of which is illegal and pure sleight of hand. It has made Turkey, an applicant country, out to be a <span class="bold">developing </span>country so as to get round the unanimity rule in the Council of Ministers of the European Union. In my view, the European Parliament should stand its ground and should allow not only Turkey but also the Turkish people into the European Union and, in the process, it should intervene to give the Turkish people the rights they have so far been denied.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have discussed it a lot lately; today we are debating two proposals for regulations on strengthening the Customs Union and on interventions that aim to improve Turkey’s economic and social development. We are doing this on the eve of the Helsinki European Council, where Turkey’s possible application to join the European Union will be decided, and we are doing this in a context in which we have seen Mr Abdullah Öçalan’s death sentence confirmed by the Turkish Supreme Court, followed by a request for a stay of execution from the European Court of Human Rights and a declaration by the Turkish authorities, delivered by Prime Minister Ecevit, that they would prefer the legal process to be completed, including the appeal by the defence lawyers, before making the government’s position known and before putting the issue before parliament. Therefore, the matter is not closed and, once again, it falls to us to choose a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that Parliament has decided to invest in the democratic growth of this country. But our alternative is not a choice between, on the one hand, a position where there is a complete refusal to cooperate, as is currently the case, and on the other hand, an uncritical acceptance of events. I would remind all Members of parliamentary Amendment No 11, which lets us keep control of the way this cooperation will develop. The fact remains that, together with the wider picture, mentioned by many Members, and Mr Swoboda was the last person to do so, the fate of Mr Abdullah Öçalan is still a pressing matter that must be resolved once and for all.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a major step forwards, but it is a shame that Turkey has not taken any such positive steps. We are all indignant at the confirmation of the death sentence on President Öçalan, we are all united in asking for a gesture from the Turkish Government, and then there is the moratorium on capital punishment: it is likely that the sentence will be suspended, despite the government’s grave decision not to respond to the request from the Court in Strasbourg. Of course, this is not without importance, but is it enough to convince us that Turkey has its house in order so it can join the Union? No. Every day in Turkey human rights are violated: there are thousands of political prisoners, and union and religious freedoms, freedom of opinion and minorities’ freedoms are repressed. In the light of the extraordinary event and unilateral actions for peace, whereby the PKK chose to abandon the armed struggle and implement a ceasefire, and in the light of numerous leaders of the PKK choosing to turn themselves in to the Turkish authorities in order to reaffirm their choice of wishing to negotiate for peace, the Turkish Government gave only negative and scornful responses. Some young Kurdish refugees visiting the European Parliament asked us: will you help us return to our villages? They have been destroyed – will you help us rebuild them? As much as I welcome and am grateful for the content of the Morillon report, I think that we must send out a strong signal by postponing this decision until the Turkish Government confirms the stay of execution and begins talks to find a solution to the Kurdish question. There can be no double standards when it comes to the right to live. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Verheugen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, although the two regulations being debated here today have in fact nothing to do with the debates which will be held in the General Council next Monday and in the European Council in Helsinki a few days later, I am of course aware of the fact that the political context and timing cannot be ignored here and that we must naturally discuss the overall problem of relations between the European Union and Turkey in conjunction with these two regulations and that is what most speakers have done here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">I am most grateful for the debate which has been held here because it was a highly factual debate which made very valuable and important points, especially for the attention of Turkey, because Turkey will have to gauge the political mood which prevails in Europe towards its application to join the European Union. Firstly, however, I would like to extend my most sincere thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Morillon, for the two reports which he has submitted and to express my appreciation to him and to Mr McMillan-Scott and Mr Schwaiger for their contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the report is so important because the European Parliament subscribes in it to the view that the European strategy represents a suitable way of extending relations between the European Union and Turkey and that financial support is needed in order to implement the strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to take this opportunity to explain once again the change in strategy towards Turkey, and I certainly do not take what Mr Brie said as a reproach. If a new Commission is not to be allowed to change the position of previous Commissions which it considers wrong, then we have no further need of a Commission. We could use robots which just keep on applying whatever was said once at some time in the past. I think that Mr Brie of all people will understand that you are not always willing to be arrested for something which your predecessors did. Otherwise we could have an interesting debate on your own predecessors, couldn’t we?</p>
<p class="contents">I just wanted to make that clear. What the change involves is something quite different. The fact is that we must recognise that our previous strategies towards Turkey have not had any visible success. We can hold endless discussions as to the reason, but the fact remains that the findings made here, that progress in Turkey is unsatisfactory, are correct. So the question which arises is: can we do anything to change this? The proposal made by the Commission, and which I hope Helsinki will support, is to set a parallel process in motion so that the two processes dovetail. On the one hand, we want to bring Turkey into the European Union using precisely the instruments used to bring other candidates in and, on the other, we want to see, in parallel, a fundamental change in Turkey itself. I repeat, a fundamental change. I can report from my discussions with the Turkish Prime Minister and from several meetings with the Turkish Foreign Secretary over the last few days that the Turkish Government is fully aware of the need for this fundamental change in the political, economic, social and cultural areas. More than that, I am convinced that the present Turkish Government and the parliamentary majority behind it also want this fundamental change.</p>
<p class="contents">At some point now we must break the vicious circle. There is no sense in saying: once Turkey has already done certain things, then maybe we will say yes, because then Turkey will give the standard response: as Europe does not keep its promises, we have no clear European prospects and we cannot therefore negotiate the risk-strewn path to reform.</p>
<p class="contents">We could carry on like this for years and nothing would change, which is why the attempt being made now is reasonable, bodes well and is under our control at all times. That is important because we do not of course want to bring a country into the European Union which, we must one day admit, will not meet the political criteria. For the rest, it is wrong to say that there have been no interesting developments in Turkey recently. I would like to quote just three. As far as foreign policy is concerned, there is no question that we are witnessing a rapprochement between Greece and Turkey which we would have considered impossible six months ago. That is not only thanks to the contribution of the Greek Government, which I have a very high opinion of and hold in great esteem; it is also thanks to the Turkish Government. I would like to mention just one of the minor consequences of this rapprochement: when Greek and Turkish journalists work together to stop the propaganda which we have followed for years in the main media in their countries and to stop people from being wrongly informed about what is happening in their neighbouring country, then I call that very real progress indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is that we shall probably witness the passing of a very important law on human rights in Turkey before Helsinki. For the first time in the history of Turkey, there will be a law which allows members of the civil service, i.e. officials, to be brought to trial for violating human rights. For example, people allegedly responsible for torture will be brought to trial. We take that for granted in our countries, but for Turkey it is unprecedented.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point I would like to make is that the Turkish Minister responsible for European integration and human rights – an interesting remit, but one which goes well together – has officially stated, following the upholding of the death sentence by the Court of Appeal, that it is not in Turkey’s interest to carry out this death sentence. Without wishing to betray confidentiality, I can go so far as to say here that my impression is that, while the proceedings in Strasbourg are under way, the Turkish Government does not want, under any circumstances, to take a decision on the execution; their strategy is rather to use the time gained by the proceedings in Strasbourg to abolish capital punishment in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like at this point to appeal again most urgently to Turkey to do so as quickly as possible. It is not just a symbolic gesture. The death penalty is something so final, something so final and so barbaric that we in Europe cannot sanction it. Turkey knows full well that the abolition of capital punishment must be one of the first hurdles on the road which I referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would be most grateful if you would vote in favour of the rapporteur’s report and uphold an old commitment which Europe entered into towards Turkey. We too are not always in the most credible position, including vis-à-vis Turkey. I always find it very difficult to demand something of a country, to make demands on a country to which we have made promises which we have not honoured. A vote in favour of the two regulations would considerably improve our moral position in relation to Turkey and I consider that most important at this stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The ideas developed by the European Parliament in the form of the amendments tabled during the discussions tally fully, for the most part, with the Commission and I shall support most of them. There are only a few minor points on which I cannot accept the proposed amendments as they stand and that is where the institutional balance is affected. You must and you will understand that the Commission must take care to ensure that the distribution of roles is not changed, that the tasks are allocated as stated in the Treaties and that responsibilities cannot be mixed. But I think that there is overall agreement on the matter itself. I again expressly offer to provide the European Parliament with comprehensive information in advance on specific action taken and on the projects which are developed and implemented jointly with Turkey on the basis of the funding regulations, thereby guaranteeing the involvement of the European Parliament in the development of relations with Turkey at all times.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not know this evening what the decision will be in Helsinki next week, but I am firmly convinced that the decision which the European Parliament has to take on these two regulations will impact on the outcome of future discussions and on the decision taken by the European Council in a week’s time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
