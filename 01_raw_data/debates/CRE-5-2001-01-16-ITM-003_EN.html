<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pomés Ruiz (PPE-DE)</span></span>  ,<span class="italic"> deputising for the rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by praising the fine work done by my colleague, Salvador Garriga Polledo, in the report he is presenting on own resources, a subject he has been following very closely for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">The Community budget comes, in part, from the traditional own resources raised by the Member States’ customs services and therefore the principal role of Community legislation on guarantees and securities is to protect the financial interests of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">The defects in the procedures applicable to the security and guarantee system mean precisely that the corresponding Community revenue is not collected and has to be covered by additional GNP contributions from the Member States. Therefore, I understand that interest should be levied on traders who effectively use unauthorised credit in their deferment accounts as part of release for free circulation operations. The Garriga Polledo report deals with cases under Member State responsibility in which a failure to enforce Community legislation on securities and guarantees harms the Community’s interests.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Court of Auditors, in cases of mandatory securities the basic principle is that the customs authorities should fix the security at a level equal to the precise amount of the customs debt where this can be established with certainty, or if not, the maximum amount, as estimated by the customs authorities, of the customs debts which have been, or may be, incurred. In practice, it is the security or guarantee body that assesses the risks of the operation. In order for these risks to be assessed, the guarantee should be fixed at the closest possible level to the customs debt for which the security or guarantee is provided. If these rules were observed, the pertinent financial interests would be fully protected.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of difficulties arise in this and I shall highlight half a dozen:</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there are no reliable statistics on the volume of guarantees currently granted. The data on these securities and guarantees, which are clearly identified in accounting and legal terms, certainly exists in the customs accounting departments of Member States, but there are no procedures to enable it to be collated and known at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, some customs authorities cannot – I prefer to think this rather than that they do not collaborate – effectively monitor observance of the requirements set out in Community legislation on guarantees because of failures in their accountancy operating or computer systems and procedures. I must stress the need for the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS) to come into operation soon in all the Member States and the countries associated with the common transit system. It is clear that the fulfilment of Community securities will depend, to a large extent, on the development of all the operations of the NCTS.</p>
<p class="contents">To solve the problem of the high level of undischarged transit operations, we should emphasise the importance of operational measures and, again, the need for swift development of this new system. With the multiple guarantee certificate system and the NCTS we shall achieve centralisation and greater administrative clarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, incomplete declarations must be mentioned. At the end of the periods allowed under Community rules the Member States should transfer the duties covered by a guarantee which are not contested into ‘A’ accounts.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the need for a change to Community customs legislation in order to ensure that the securities which guarantee the right to credit should also guarantee the automatic payments made by the customs offices after release of goods.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the large number of cases reported by the Court of Auditors in which the amounts owed to the Community budget have not been paid or received with the relevant late payment interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I should like to mention the difficulties giving rise to the failure to collect the considerable amounts of customs duties and other taxes arising from TIR operations, which are attributable to ineffective implementation of existing mechanisms and a lack of monitoring of transit operations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I want to stress that the Commission must study the various problems raised and, in particular, review the computer system in order to take into account the interest owed in this respect to the Community budget by the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McCartin (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – Mr President, I want to acknowledge the important role of the Court of Auditors in preparing these reports. I am dealing with four reports relating to the dairy sector, the cereals sector and swine fever involving total spending of approximately EUR 16 billion, which is a considerable proportion of the budget. The study by the Court of Auditors involves a great deal of detail and we must acknowledge the important role it plays in assisting Parliament in its work, because, obviously, without this interaction between the Court of Auditors and Parliament, Parliament would be in no position to evaluate or judge the effectiveness of Commission spending. We can also acknowledge that the Court of Auditors plays a role in assisting the Commission to identify weaknesses in its administration and difficulties which it may not have observed in the way Member States implement our various schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors, in this particular report, has drawn attention to the weaknesses in the basic regulations, weaknesses which make it difficult for the Commission and indeed even the Member States to effectively control spending. In the special report on the reform of the cereals sector, the Court of Auditors has drawn attention to the question of whether or not the policy itself attains its economic and social objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">To go back to the dairy sector – there are two reports here, one relating to skimmed-milk powder, the other to butter – we should remember that even though we have a quota system which is designed to bring production close to the level of consumption, we still have to spend approximately EUR 3 000 million a year disposing of surpluses, and of the skimmed-milk powder which we produce something like only 37% of it is sold at market value. In other words, the rest of it must be subsidised for use in animal feed and other things. Similarly, in the case of butter, only 75% of the butter we produce is sold at market prices. This identifies the weaknesses in the policies where we have a quota system and at the same time require vast Community resources to subsidise surpluses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors' report – and Parliament supports this – draws attention to the fact that we should perhaps utilise our resources better in a way that might encourage greater consumption of dairy products on our European markets, rather than subsidising unused quantities.</p>
<p class="contents">In the cereals sector, the main concern of the Court of Auditors was the fact of overcompensation which has been well documented and which we acknowledge, and it also draws attention to the fact that it is necessary in designing policy at all levels – Commission, Council and Parliament – to take account of market changes. When we designed this policy we did not foresee the rise in world prices which led to gross overcompensation in the sector. The report also draws attention to the fact, and Parliament notes this, that something like 40% of all the EUR 14 billion spent in the cereals sector goes to 3% of farmers, and 54% of farmers only get approximately 5% of the aid.</p>
<p class="contents">This again draws attention to the whole thrust of the policy and whether or not we should review it with the idea of making it more compatible with regional policy and with social policy. These were the main concerns expressed. We should also say in relation to the cereals sector or to the dairy sector that we have noted that the Commission has undertaken a root and branch review of the policy and has already set that study in motion. So we look forward to its completion.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to thank the Commission for its cooperation and the fact that it has already taken action on some of the weaknesses identified in the various reports. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Staes (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, since the end of December 1995, when the Dayton peace accords were concluded, the European Union has contributed to peace in a major way. A great deal of funding has been freed up for reconstruction, the organisation of elections, contributions to human rights, etc. We also financed 53% of the High Representative Office. The Court of Auditors’ Special Report which is before us, is the third in a series. There have already been reports on the situation in Mostar, and a second report dealt with the reconstruction in former Yugoslavia. I believe that these special reports, together with the report which is now before us, have consistently made us as a European Parliament sit up and face the facts, and also try to act upon these reports in an effective manner. I also believe that progress has been made in this area thanks to the Court of Auditors’ way of working, together with the follow-up by Parliament, via the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the task of budgetary control cannot be carried out from a little office in Brussels or an office in Strasbourg. I believe that sometimes, it is necessary to visit the relevant location. Expertise in the field is necessary; you need to meet the people; you need to know what people have to put up with there, what the conditions are. For previous reports, other MEPs have been given the opportunity of going to Bosnia and Herzegovina. They learnt a lot from their visit, and I visited the place myself between 16 and 19 October of last year. That is very important. I would like to reiterate as well as underline this. In actual fact, I learnt more in those four days in Sarajevo than I could have learnt from wading through reams and reams of written material. I would therefore like to urge the Conference of Presidents to take this into consideration when, at a later date, they decide for or against giving rapporteurs the opportunity to have this experience.</p>
<p class="contents">What was the criticism about, ladies and gentlemen? First of all, criticism was levelled at the Commission for not deploying sufficient resources and staff and for a Brussels-based management which is too centralised. I gather that this criticism by the Court of Auditors has been acted upon by the European Commission. All credit to the Commission for this. Improvements have been made and staffing levels have increased. I would like to stress here that the people in the delegation in Sarajevo are better organised, highly qualified and highly motivated. That is thanks to the Court of Auditors’ criticism and the fact that Parliament has acted upon this criticism. Furthermore, the Commission has, under pressure from the Court of Auditors, adopted a deconcentration policy, which has given the people in the Sarajevo delegation, but also in other delegations, more clout. It has also meant that the head of the delegation can meet the needs on the ground in a more powerful manner, and has also ensured that all overdue payments have now been cleared. So, as far as this is concerned, well done to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Other criticism concerned the High Representative’s Office and how the European Union works with that office. The European Commission has been blamed for not keeping a close enough eye on it. Thanks to the Court of Auditors’ report and the action taken by Parliament, there is now a new mentality in the Office of the High Representative. It is indeed the case that, since March 1999, there has been a new financial director who has written a veritable tome on the rules to be followed. Apparently, when the High Representative first took up office, rather a lot was being wasted. His commitment, and that of the Commission and the office as a whole, has slimmed down the budget of the High Representative’s Office by nearly EUR 5 million over a period of three years. I believe that this is an extremely positive result.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, one of the key criticisms directed at the High Representative was also in the shape of Paragraph 17 on the conflict of interests generated by the former financial director. Parliament, at least in the resolution now before us, is asking for a full explanation in this regard. I have to let you know that I have now received a document from the High Representative, and from the Commission, and that the key criticisms have been addressed in this document. That is why I propose the adoption of my amendment, which takes this into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Other criticism was expressed with regard to human rights. I have to say that the Commission is doing a truly creditable job on this in Sarajevo and Bosnia and Herzegovina in general. I believe we should make more funds available to those people, but in terms of human rights, we are still waiting for responses from the Commission with regard to Paragraphs 29 and 35.</p>
<p class="contents">A final – important – point I would like to make is the recurring theme of the media policy. The Commission has come under very strong criticism with regard to its media policy. It is reported that with regard to this policy, EUR 2 million’s worth of equipment was subsidised which was not eligible for subsidy. I am still waiting for a detailed report from the Commission. It is included in the resolution, and so I hope that a response will be forthcoming in the very near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From this point of view I should like to thank Commissioner Schreyer for attending. I hope that, through her, the managers responsible more specifically for the administration of the Structural Funds, both in the Commission and in the Member States, will be made aware of the content of our report and of our conclusions, since this matter concerns the Structural Funds, which, as we know, are generally managed by the Member States directly.</p>
<p class="contents">So, to the four distinct reports: one report on the principle of additionality, one report on the development of industrial sites, a third report from the Court of Auditors on the European Social Fund and the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (Guidance Section) – Measures to assist the employment of young persons, and a fourth report on the International Fund for Ireland and the Special Support Programme for Peace and Reconciliation. Regarding this last report, I should particularly like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for its contribution. Our Committee took on board all the amendments they presented.</p>
<p class="contents">Although these four subjects are quite distinct, the same sort of comments can be made about them all, and these are of three types. Firstly, the major criticisms which may be levelled at the Commission with regard to the administrative procedures which the Court of Auditors, like us, considers too time-consuming and too complex and which occasionally hinder the smooth running of projects. It must be said that the same criticisms are also made of Member States. There is never sufficient monitoring once projects are underway, either at grass roots or from Brussels. The same lack of resources and staffing is continually remarked upon – other speakers have raised it on other points – even despite the frequent comments by the Court of Auditors on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently engaged in a radical reform of its organisation and is asking for additional resources. I hope that Parliament, which has always believed in the myth of the zero growth of officials despite the multiplication in their duties, will accept the Commission’s proposals and objectives and will also step up its monitoring tasks and its role. Obviously, this will cause some overlapping of funding, since funding is not sufficiently well monitored, and hence the poor use of European appropriations. The final criticism that may be made concerns the delays in payments, a recurrent problem which the Commission does not appear to be capable of resolving or putting a stop to.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a major criticism that I would like us to emphasise in our dealing with the Member States is the poor use of appropriations, often due to a lack of cooperation between the Member States and the Commission, and the reluctance of the Member States to make better use of the funds. Too often they are treated as donations, funds to be substituted for national funds. In some instances, the Member States attach little importance to the principle of additionality which stipulates that this is cofinancing which must be complemented by national financing. They seem to think the funds cover 100% of the financing, which is clearly not in line with the reasoning behind the Structural Funds and their use. The Member States should not forget that these are public funds and, as such, the concern of all the citizens of Europe. They should hence be used with even more care than national funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to remedy such inefficiencies, a new regulation was adopted in June 1999, which I hope will enable us to make progress. When it uncovers inefficiencies we would urge the Commission to use all the means available to it, such as the suspension of payments, and if there is sufficient justification we shall be right behind the Commission in this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think the Commission itself should pay more attention to the eligibility criteria before authorising funds to be released. This would prevent the funding of projects that were not viable and the ‘rag-bag’ projects that are often seen in the Member States. That concludes my comments. Thank you, Mr President, for the extra few seconds you allowed me. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I say this because it was only at the beginning of 2000 that the Court was able to complete and approve its report on Community aid granted between 1996 and 1998, in other words, between four and two years previously. The obvious consequence of this regrettable delay is that many of the observations in the report are out of date, since, in the meantime, major changes have taken place in the legal framework and the political situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. But this does not mean that the report’s observations should not be taken into account in future, particularly in Kosovo, in order to avoid similar problems arising with identical actions promoted by the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">This type of monitoring is crucial for identifying and solving existing problems, which exist on two levels: one involving direct funding and the other cofinancing with other donors. In the first case, one problem that stands out is the inadequacy of support for actions designed to protect human rights, support for civil society and support for the media. There have been many situations which, fortunately, have been rectified. These range from identification of centralised procedures inappropriate given the urgency with which actions have to be carried out, to the fact that the Commission found itself confronted with various <span class="italic">faits accomplis</span> which subsequently had to be financed. With regard to cofinancing, we welcome the transfer of financing from the Office of the High Representative to the first pillar, which meant that it had to be implemented in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Regulation. Furthermore, we believe the same will have to apply to financing for monitoring electoral procedures and, consequently, to cooperation with the OSCE.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, these were the observations that we in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy felt should be considered in the report by Mr Staes – whom I congratulate – given the volume of the total funding for this type of aid, the shortage of resources and the obvious need for them to be used in a rigorous and transparent way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The difficult environment in which the Funds have had to operate, their role as a pump primer, the approach in giving priority to disadvantaged areas and the unique role in pioneering the joint management and delivery of cross-border programmes have all been given the recognition they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that the International Fund for Ireland has produced a comprehensive response to the issues raised in the Court of Auditors' report, which can be made available to Members. That response includes a number of specific actions that the Fund is taking to address matters raised in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to stress one crucial point in relation to the International Fund for Ireland: this is not a European Union programme. The Fund is, in fact, an international organisation with its own governing body, rules, audit procedures and so on. Furthermore, the European Union is just one of five donors involved in its financing. The European Union's annual contribution constitutes 35% of the total.</p>
<p class="contents">The International Fund for Ireland was established by the British and Irish Governments in 1986 with the objective of promoting economic and social advance and encouraging contact, dialogue and reconciliation between the Unionists and Nationalists throughout Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Contributors to the Fund are the United States, the European Union, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. Since the Fund was set up it has provided assistance of EUR 597 million to 4 600 projects, which have helped to create 38 000 jobs, leading to an additional investment of approximately EUR 1.193 billion, bringing the overall investment in these projects to almost EUR 1.79 billion; directed almost 90% of its commitments to the most deprived areas; encouraged over 9 000 participants in cross-community groups and encouraged 5 000 participants in cross-border structures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

May I also point out to everyone that the Balkans are a separate area of Europe, both geographically and from the point of view of their customs and their way of thinking. So we need to study every incident from every possible angle if we are to be efficient both in our criticism and in the measures which we take. What it comes down to, as Mr Staes has said and done, is going and seeing for yourself. From where we stand, we cannot see what is happening in these particular regions, which are pretty much a law unto themselves. We cannot monitor what is going on from behind a desk. We cannot understand the Balkan way of thinking from letters, faxes and e-mails. What we need to do is to get close to them, and we need to get close to them not just by expressing an interest which, it goes without saying, is manifest on all sides; we need to get close to them in practice, both physically and geographically, but mainly by learning about their history and what makes them tick.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything that has happened, the comments made by the auditors and the Commission, demonstrate that something that is good can always be replaced by something that is better and that something that is better can always be made better still. That is the direction we are all pulling in. I am certain that the interest evinced by us and the critical spirit which exists cannot but lead in the right direction and, if you like, we can take the results of the practices applied to this sort of cofinancing and adapt them in other directions. The European Agency for Reconstruction is now up and running in Thessaloniki and Pristina. It has attracted a great deal of criticism, but we cannot presume that Sarajevo is the same thing as Pristina and we need to make that clear, which is precisely why I referred to different ways of thinking, customs and situations which need to be borne in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Many honourable Members – and to some extent they are right – said that the agency in Thessaloniki should be decentralised and should move to Pristina. Many of us categorically opposed this as out of the question. We have been proven right in keeping the agency in Thessaloniki because if we had moved the Thessaloniki agency to Pristina, Yugoslavia would now be unable to obtain funding from the European Agency for Reconstruction because it would have been impossible for a Serb to go to Pristina and claim so much as a single euro. Which is why I repeat that criticism is a good thing, but everything we do must be adapted to the circumstances, the needs and the peculiarities of each region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Morgan (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would like to start by giving my thanks to the Court of Auditors for its very useful report this time on a range of issues. We were very critical of it at the time of the annual report but I think these special reports are very valuable.</p>
<p class="contents">There are clearly a range of areas where the Commission has yet to act to improve matters. Today, I am going to concentrate on a response to the report written by Mr Dell'Alba on various aspects of the Structural Funds. Certainly, in my country, this is one of the areas where the European Union can visibly claim to be making a difference, and there is a recognition that Structural Funds and the attempt to increase wealth, and improve social conditions and employment rates in an area give a positive image of the EU. But we cannot stand by and uncritically applaud. The reports by the Court of Auditors clearly show that there is room for radical improvement, and the Commission has already introduced a new Structural Fund regulation to improve the situation and will obviously be checking very carefully to see whether these reforms have gone far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of additionality, we must remember that European Funds are intended not to finance but to cofinance operations and must not take the place of public expenditure by national authorities. That is all very well, but even the new regulations only allow for assessment of additionality at a national level and not at a regional level. Rules are rules, but if there is no effective punishment after breaking them, they become weaker and unenforceable, so we need to see a solid legal basis to develop the possible imposition of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of the development of industrial sites, the Commission should not wring its hands but say that this should only be seen as part of a wider policy to assist SMEs. Substantial sums go into these developments. In Wales, for example, we know that this is a clear target; we need clear targets and objectives and we will be looking forward to seeing those within the Structural Fund programmes in future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, there is the Garriga report. I believe the Committee on Budgets has already made plans to this effect, but I think it is vital that we evaluate the results of the committee of inquiry on transit fraud. What has the Commission done so far with the recommendations in that report?</p>
<p class="contents">Next, there is the McCartin report on agriculture. It is always an interesting topic, and nobody will deny that the agricultural policy is not static, but that it should move along with the times, especially in connection with the negotiations within the World Trade Organisation and enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to raise two points without making a judgment either for or against. The following considerations are currently of importance to my group: first, what would the effect of cofinancing agricultural expenditure be, and income allowance, in particular? Another point, which is very topical at the moment, is animal disease control. This is taking a huge chunk out of the European budget. Would it not be possible, in imitation of customs in the Member States, to obtain insurance cover against the outbreak of certain animal diseases? Could the Commission look into this matter at the earliest opportunity?</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the Staes report, it is encouraging to see that the European Union can make a difference in the Balkans, which is much like a hornet’s nest. We are delighted about this, and we believe the Staes report is excellent. We particularly support the fact that it is not the Office of the High Representative which is calling the shots; it is the European Union which coughs up the funds and which will have to check whether these are well spent.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a general comment on the climate of corruption which is supposed to prevail in the Balkans. In our opinion, it is necessary for the Commission to decide on the way in which this should be allowed to affect Europe. Is this having an impact on European aid?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to make an observation with regard to the Dell'Alba report. In my country, there are indications that the price of industrial sites is rising considerably thanks to European aid. This is not desirable in our eyes. Could something be done about this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European agricultural policy must be given a thorough going over. BSE is only the tip of the iceberg. Subsidisation of quantity increases, overproduction and then more subsidies for reducing surpluses, not only is all this very difficult for the ordinary citizen to comprehend, it is also extremely susceptible to fraud, and the quota regime cannot begin to cushion the effect. This is very clearly borne out by the McCartin report.</p>
<p class="contents">It is to the rapporteur’s credit that he constantly draws attention to this, and not just in times such as these. Unfortunately, Parliament does not have full co-determination powers in agricultural matters and is therefore only able to make very limited use of the political room for manoeuvre. The decisions are taken in the Council of Ministers; they are reached behind closed doors by the national Agricultural Ministers, with their diverse client interests. Yet whilst they reserve the right to make the decisions, they are not prepared to actually take on responsibility. When it comes to errors, misdemeanours, irregularities or fraud, they are not the ones who immediately take responsibility; no, they always point the finger at Brussels, i.e. the EU instead.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be a fundamental change on this score. Not only is control called for, but also political co-determination for Parliament in all areas of the agricultural policy. We need more transparency and openness. This is not about working against the farmers; it is about fighting for a different kind of consumer policy, in the interests of the farmers. Mr McCartin has already mentioned the right key words in his report. What we are talking about here is the issue of direct aid and cofinancing. Something needs to change here, also in the light of eastwards enlargement, if we want to pursue the agricultural policy in such a way that it will lend itself to eastwards enlargement. Even after the Nice Summit, it is clear that the Council is incapable of actually solving these problems, and so to conclude, I would like to stress once again, and this will be a matter of concern to the whole of Parliament, that Parliament needs full co-determination and codecision rights in agricultural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These three countries have rendered account in the budget of their customs duties, i.e. own resources, to a much greater extent proportionally than other countries. There are large ports in these countries and a lot of traffic in transit passes through them.</p>
<p class="contents">Both the documents of the Court of Auditors and Mr Garriga Polledo’s report feature an embarrassing element. In many countries abuses have been revealed, although there is no mention of countries’ names. This consequently gives rise to the suspicion that crimes are mostly committed in those countries that have large transit ports. If there is no mention of countries’ names, suspicion must fall on Great Britain, Belgium and Holland. If they are not guilty of covering up crimes and protecting criminals, they are, nevertheless, the object of suspicion, as the countries’ names are not mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Huge volumes of goods pass through the European Union, which are then shipped outside the Union from its ports. Studies by both the Court of Auditors and OLAF have shown that there is major abuse associated with tobacco imports and transit traffic in particular. It is difficult to assess the extent of this, but the size of the damage caused to the Union is estimated to be between one and five billion euros. Tobacco comes mainly into the Dutch and Belgian ports and is transported on through EU countries, often to the area of the former Yugoslavia, to Montenegro, for example. Last year the EU decided to grant financial aid to Montenegro to the tune of EUR 15 million for political reasons, free of any conditions connected with the prevention of smuggling. Every night contraband tobacco is taken by 50 or 70 speedboats from Montenegro to Italy from where it is distributed to EU markets free of customs duty or tax.

I shall therefore confine my comments to the subjects raised by Mr McCartin and Mr Staes.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the first of these reports, the French Members of our group cannot endorse its comments on butterfat, which challenge the Council decision to maintain guaranteed prices until 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a decision we think is particularly justifiable, and one that is essential for farmers. Similarly, we do not think that the fact that 92%<span class="bold"> </span>of appropriations available in 1998 under the disposal measure “butter for non-profit organisations” was spent in just three Member States, none of which is among the poorest in the European Union, as the resolution points out, is worth including as a serious argument. It is rather jumping the gun to forget that the phenomenon of the development of a fourth world and the impoverishment of certain social strata in our countries is a horrendous reality, and the return to still vulnerable growth is not about to make it possible to quickly reintegrate that sector of the population which has often been marginalised for a long period.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not find the report’s critical attitude to the aid given to the major cereal-producing regions to be satisfactory either, even though the report does, admittedly, pay special attention to the smaller cereal-producers within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We do not share the report’s opinion, on the subject of swine fever, that pig farmers should bear the greater part of the financial burden involved in combating epidemics. One might well ask just why they should be expected to bear these additional costs when they are weighed down by considerable costs already.</p>
<p class="contents">They are clearly not the parties responsible for epizootic disease; they are its victims. So, unless we are seeking, once again, to renationalise the common agricultural policy on the quiet, there could be no question of accepting this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Staes’ report on European Union aid to Bosnia and Herzegovina rightly condemns the serious financial mismanagement in the Office of the High Representative (OHR) during a dramatic period, what is more, and once again, at the expense of monies belonging to the citizens of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group also notes the request for the OHR and the Commission to provide information detailing the reasons leading to this confusion of interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is it acceptable for EUR 2 million to be allocated to ineligible material in the sector of ….</p>

Firstly, I would, however, like to direct my comments at you, as a member of the Bureau of Parliament. It was a disgrace to this House that we had to tolerate such a bureaucratic administrative hold-up over the question as to whether or not we can send the rapporteur of Parliament‘s Committee on Budgetary Control to Bosnia and Herzegovina. I hope that for the sake of those whom we are supposed to represent here, there will be no repeat performance. I make no bones about the fact, because this is something we – myself included – normally criticise the Commission for. This time, I am sorry to say, we are forced to acknowledge that the problem lies with us, which is insupportable.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this report by Mr Staes raises our hopes in two respects. Firstly, the Commission is receptive to new ideas. A most welcome development has taken place between the first visits under the leadership of the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Budgetary Control, and the <span class="italic">status quo</span> as ascertained by our rapporteur, and I can only congratulate the Commission on this.</p>
<p class="contents">At the start of this programme for the Balkans, aid was granted in the typical EU manner, i.e. the decision was taken around the green table in Brussels and private firms were then commissioned to determine the aid requirement at local level, and to divide and distribute the funds. This method has been abolished and the system almost revolutionised – partly under pressure from this House. It shows that our initiatives are valuable and that the Commission is receptive to new ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, perhaps you could even use this receptiveness to new ideas, which you displayed in the delegation in Sarajevo, as an example for other delegations in other countries to follow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe we should think about the real causes behind this incomprehensible fact. Perhaps there is a lack of initiatives and the least-favoured areas do not know how to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">If that is the case, we should not just cross our arms and justify our inaction with the excuse that we give them money but they do not use it properly. We should push forward with an additional policy of analysis, information, training, motivation, consultancy and monitoring to give a boost to new structures and opportunities for development and progress.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is also possible that what is happening is that from our more developed and more technocratic positions we are being too perfectionist and demanding, imposing too many regulations and conditions, and thus preventing and stifling the appearance of valid ideas in keeping with the level of development of the regions addressed by Community policies. Perhaps we should adapt the Community policies to these regions instead of expecting the regions to adapt to an elitist European policy. What is …</p>

His conditions of work were not the best. It is unfair that we in Parliament should have to deal with a report from the Court of Auditors concerning events going back many years, but the fact is that Mr Staes has done his homework and gone out into the field. Now, it is not that I do not trust Mr Staes, on the contrary, but I too happened to be in Bosnia last week, and he is right in his assessment. The history of the Commission’s delegations in Bosnia has become a success story.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors’ report concludes that the Commission’s control over funds for the High Representative’s Office and the UN, for example, has not, by any means, been good enough. Many of the problems are due to the projects having previously been administered centrally from Brussels. Now, the EU delegations on the spot have been given more powers and more staff. This shows that the idea of giving the delegations more duties and more responsibility does, in actual fact, work in practice. The Court of Auditors proposes that, in future, the EU should give organisations such as the UN, the OSCE and the High Representative’s Office a sum of money which they can administer themselves. At the same time, the Court of Auditors would like to see tighter control. I really do not think that this adds up. If we simply give money as a direct form of budget aid to the organisation, then the Commission will completely lose track of things and no longer have any control. The issue of cooperation between the EU and the organisations will become part of the 1999 discharge. The Commission is calling for clear guidelines from the Council and Parliament. That is something I can well understand. We cannot demand both better control and more of a free hand. We merely need to retain a certain degree of control over taxpayers’ money. The UN system is unfortunately becoming more and more bureaucratic, inefficient and corrupt so, in spite of everything, I have much more confidence in our own EU system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Casaca (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, this debate covers ten special reports by the Court of Auditors on subjects of such varied kinds and importance that they range from a study of the principal of additionality in structural actions to a specific and thorough analysis of the Community cereals policy. I would therefore like to limit myself to the latter issue and to begin by congratulating Mr McCartin and the Court of Auditors on their excellent work and by highlighting the final points of the Court’s analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1993 and 1997, overcompensation in the cereals sector amounted to over EUR 13 billion. Every European citizen contributed more than EUR 37 to the cereals budget in 1997. Arable crops represented 43% of agricultural expenditure but only 10.7% of final production. Almost 40% of subsidies went to 3% of farmers, and 57% of the beneficiaries received 4.5% of subsidies. The Court of Auditors concluded from this analysis that the current system of support for farmers’ incomes, which is based on factors such as price, yield or area farmed, needs to be replaced by a system based on a standard net income per farm household or working unit, with farm support only being triggered to make good any fall in that income.</p>
<p class="contents">The COM in arable crops provides the greatest argument for the need to reform the CAP. The thorough political remodelling that has been applied to the structure of Germany’s federal government is a clear sign that, even at the heart of Europe, where this CAP was conceived and where it has always found its greatest support, it is becoming increasingly difficult to sustain an agricultural policy model that was designed to protect an industrial approach, based on large-scale farming. We must come up with a rural policy geared towards regional needs and fairness between farmers if we are to preserve Europe's cultural heritage and the environment. This will require reform of the current CAP. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The measures to assist young farmers setting up in business are inadequate, since in far too many cases the target group exceeds the age limit on the date of receiving aid even though it was eligible at the moment of presenting an application. Given the difficult situations experienced by a large number of these young people and the hardship faced by people working in that sector, a situation where some of them cannot receive European and national aid due to inaccuracies and delays is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the measures to assist the employment of young persons, we would need a precise assessment before being able to consider the impact of this policy. This assessment should take account of the variety of routes to employment to be implemented. As regards the measures for the redevelopment of industrial sites, on the contrary, the funding has been too generous, since the ERDF aid has been used to fund projects of types other than the development of industrial sites. This is compounded by the fact that different forms of aid, if not coordinated at regional level, can engender competition between promoters and a subsequent scattering of aid and reduced effectiveness. This does not make it possible to conduct a redevelopment policy which takes account of the diagnosis of needs and the assessment of achievements, ultimately enabling the active administration of regional development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I cannot go without mentioning the restructuring planned by the Danone Group, a procedure we find in various Member States. We cannot tolerate firms which have been able to receive European subsidies being allowed, even though they are in good financial shape, to decide, for reasons of structural adjustments, to lay off thousands of people and causing as many family crises which, once again, will be a drain on national and European public monies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, one of the major objectives of the European Union is to combat unemployment, which is a priority of the Member States but also of the Commission. We know how difficult it is to reach the whole of a target group with any measure. However, in view of the inaccuracies and shortcomings that have been observed, demands have been presented to have the necessary arrangements made immediately, in particular in order to better define the measures and to actually pass the benefit on to the recipients by curtailing delays in the handling of cases and the payment of beneficiaries, in order to ensure that the results achieved are...</p>

<p class="contents">I would advise other regions with serious problems of unemployment to study the work of the International Fund in Northern Ireland and the border counties. It has done such outstanding work. For example, it has funded some 4 600 projects, creating 38 000 jobs, and almost 90% of these jobs are in areas of high unemployment and in deprived areas. Some 9 000 people from cross-community groups have been involved in these projects for creating jobs in Northern Ireland and some 5 000 people have been involved in the cross-border projects. It has done an outstanding job and I welcome the positive response in the report to it.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the Special Peace Programme from the European Union itself. At grass-roots level in Northern Ireland it too is bringing together people from both sections of our community, in particular with projects for young people – young men and women. There are shared-city initiatives to promote community; there is development and training for unemployed women – I am just singling out some of the very successful operations that are going on – the development of the food industry and, of course, the new housing development.</p>
<p class="contents">We very much welcome and deeply thank the Commission for this, and the Council of Ministers for the Special Peace Programme for Northern Ireland.

The IFI and the Peace Fund are unique funds so it is understandable that certain misunderstandings should have arisen owing to a lack of familiarity with the special nature and operation of these funds.</p>
<p class="contents">As was pointed out previously, the EU makes a major contribution together with the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The Fund has committed in excess of £400 million which has triggered an investment of £1.2 billion creating 38 000 jobs for 150 projects right across the border countries and Northern Ireland. I deem it wholly inappropriate that the Committee on Budgetary Control should question the effectiveness of the IFI funding system. I believe that these funds have made a major contribution towards the peace process and that Mr Dell'Alba should familiarise himself a little more in detail with these funds.

<p class="contents">I feel this debate has shown how valuable the Special Reports by the Court of Auditors are, because they investigate particular problematic areas in great detail. As Commissioner, I can only welcome these Special Reports with open arms because they enable us to deal with criticisms as they arise, and the Court of Auditors constructs its Special Reports so well that they can have a direct bearing on new Commission proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I must be brief and I am only able to go into some aspects of Parliament’s very detailed and valuable reports. Firstly I will deal with the report by Mr Garriga, and then I will consider your comments on the own resources, Mr Pomés Ruiz. EUR 14 billion is raised annually in customs duties, for the purpose of financing the EU budget, and a substantial proportion of this amount is accounted for by securities and guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last few years, the Commission has endeavoured to substantially improve the legal provisions in this area. I might mention that in 1999 and 2000, new legal provisions on the transit procedure in the customs field entered into force. They allow for better monitoring of transit processes and the handling of securities undertaken for the purpose of safeguarding these processes. The Community Custom’s Code has just recently been amended and the amendment has entered into force.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year, seven Member States were connected up to the new computer-supported transit procedure. Parliament initiated a great deal in this area through its committee of inquiry, which produced some very practical results that are now being worked on by the Commission. Above all, it is highly significant that the candidate countries are now to be directly involved in this computer system, i.e. in this new procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two ongoing sets of infringement proceedings against Germany relating to the consequences of impropriety in respect of customs procedures, and the question as to whether this should attract interest payments, and consideration is being given to invoking similar proceedings against Austria, Belgium and Denmark. In addition, I might point out that at some point in the next few days, the Commission will present its report on the own resources system for the period 1997-1999. All in all, it is the Commission’s intention to transfer more responsibility to the Member States in the customs field. I take the view that in the event of administrative error which leads to losses in customs revenue, a different regime should apply in future to the one currently in force, i.e. it is the Member States themselves that should be liable for the loss of revenue in the event of error. It is quite simply a bad system, in that the last pillar of financing within the EU budget has to come into play in such circumstances, i.e. all Member States then have to pay according to their share of GNP. In other words, the present system is such that those who practise sloppy management are rewarded, whilst those who make a special effort are, in fact, the mugs. It ought to be the Finance Ministers’ first priority to want to change a system of this kind. There is no sign of this happening yet, but the Commission will continue to press the point.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn now to the extremely important report on agriculture by Mr McCartin. I would like to express my gratitude for these reports. They cover the following subjects: milk powder, butterfat, cereals and swine fever. I have several brief comments to make on these, and, Mrs Rühle, all I can say is how right you are that this report too illustrates, once again, the number of areas in which urgent reforms are needed. We have one surplus in the entire area of milk production, and this causes a whole host of other problems, particularly in terms of financial control, because this surplus has led to specific sales promotion measures for skimmed-milk powder and butterfat, which raise enormous problems for financial control time and again, or, to put it another way, they create opportunities for fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The criticism raised in the Special Report prompted the Commission to improve on and simplify four aspects relating to skimmed milk. The definition of skimmed-milk powder eligible for financial aid was stated more precisely, the control procedures, particularly in relation to the detection of the presence of whey in skimmed-milk powder, were reviewed, and the aid for liquid skimmed milk destined for use in animal feed was abolished following a cost-benefit analysis, which is something that attracted a great deal of criticism. This was a necessary measure though, because the vehemence of the Court of Auditor’s criticism on this point meant that steps had to be taken.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of butterfat – there is also an issue here arising from the overproduction that occurs in this sector – I can confirm that the fact that payment of aid is concentrated on only a few Member States is to be reviewed at the forthcoming assessment of the milk sector. This concentration is not unusual but we will take up your comments on this again nonetheless. The Court of Auditor’s observations with regard to shortcomings in the exercise of control are currently being given consideration under the clearance of accounts procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors assessed the reform measures introduced in 1992 in the third Special Report on the effects on the cereals sector. The Commission used these measures as the basis for its own assessment. In the motion for a resolution, Parliament, and yourself, Mr McCartin, call for direct payments to be differentiated, in a bid to redress the currently uneven distribution of incomes between prosperous and less prosperous regions, but also between large and small farms. This would be possible subject to certain constraints, although not all Member States would accept it, and there is room for improvement here too.</p>
<p class="contents">You also address the important issue of cofinancing of direct aid in the report. We know what became of this matter in Agenda 2000. However, the Commission feels that this is another topic that must be brought up for discussion again in the course of the midterm review.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly on the subject of swine fever: the Commission is of the same mind as those who feel that after the last epidemic, there is an urgent need to revise the relevant legal provisions. It has therefore submitted proposals accordingly, and, has also restructured the Commission’s veterinary service as a result. The Commission would agree with you, Mr McCartin, that pig producers should carry a greater share of the financial burden of measures to combat animal diseases. In this connection, the Commission will carry out an investigation into risk management instruments in agriculture, the findings of which will be available in the next few months, and they are bound to be the subject of intense discussion in this House thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to your report Mr Staes, for which the Commission is in your debt. In the period from 1996 to 1998, which is the period the Court of Auditor’s Special Report relates to, the Commission – and you acknowledged this – operated under extremely difficult political conditions on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">You mention the extraordinary circumstances, particularly with regard to the financing of the open broadcasting network. Firstly, it was necessary for equipment of a very high quality to be made available for this network, and secondly, it was important to ensure that the transmission of information was of a very high quality too, with a view to preparing for the 1996 elections, and allowing for independent reporting. However, the Commission is forced to concede that, in many areas, there was much cause for criticism and so it has taken the appropriate steps.</p>
<p class="contents">I will go on to discuss the relationship between the EU as donor, and the Office of High Representative and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe as recipients of the financial aid. This relationship is indeed complex. The Commission has been reprimanded for quite a few administrative shortcomings, when the fault actually lies with the international organisations. It is not a case of denying responsibility. It just goes to show that there are even difficulties on the cooperation front sometimes, which are partly structural in nature. The Court of Auditors is now proposing, as it did back in its 1999 Annual Report, that international organisations should not be granted project financing but should be allowed budgetary grants instead. But how is the Commission supposed to support international organisations with an exclusively political mandate when these organisations find it difficult to properly implement the administrative and financial standards of Community aid programmes? Further talks and regulations are called for here.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the repatriation of refugees and the construction of housing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which also features in the report: the Commission was able, with the aid of projects financed by the PHARE and OBNOVA programmes, to achieve similar successes where rehousing is concerned to those of other donors. A criticism was raised in the 1999 Annual Report to the effect that there were shortcomings with regard to the repatriation of refugees, but this situation has now improved. I would also remind you once again that the Commission has learnt from all the errors committed in Bosnia and Herzegovina when it came to granting EU aid, and has taken the necessary steps, and it has also placed the administration of EU aid, for example in Kosovo, on an entirely different footing.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the comprehensive report by Mr Dell'Alba, which concerns the principle of additionality as applied to the Structural Funds, industrial areas, youth employment initiatives, the International Fund for Ireland and the PEACE programme. Here, too, I must confine myself to a few remarks. The structural funds regulation of June 1999 now includes new provisions regarding the principle of the additionality of measures, which will hopefully help to ensure that, in future, there will be no more cause for the kind of criticism raised by the Court of Auditors about the previous support period, and the criteria will be clearer.</p>
<p class="contents">I have this to say about the Court of Auditor’s report on industrial areas: one of the key aspects of the 1999 reform of the structural funds has been the strengthening of the monitoring and assessment instruments, which will enable us to establish more effectively where the money goes to. The regulations now provide for a clearer distribution of responsibility between the Commission and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, permit me just to say a few words about the report on the PEACE programme. Parliament has expressed its profound concern at the often slow-moving materialisation of the PEACE programme in Northern Ireland and has called for a transparent budget. The furtherance of the consolidation of the peace process in Northern Ireland and the support, particularly of the cross-border cooperation afforded by local initiatives, which Mr Hume made reference to once again, was not just an innovative goal, but was also the right programme to my way of thinking, and I am delighted to be able, once again, to acknowledge the fact that it has Parliament’s support. This programme too was launched under very difficult conditions initially. As the Court of Auditors report shows, it was still able, in the end, to play a part in supporting the peace and reconciliation process in Northern Ireland. I believe that was the object of the exercise and to that extent, I am delighted that it could be judged a success at the end of the day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
