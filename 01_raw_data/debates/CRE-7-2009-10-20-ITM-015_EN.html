<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Mariann Fischer Boel, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission. </span>– Mr President, let me start by thanking you for allowing the urgent procedure to be applied to the two proposals that I hope will help the situation in the dairy market – one proposing that milk be included in the scope of Article 186, and one regarding the management of the buy-out scheme for quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">These proposals are the latest in a long series of dairy-oriented measures that we have adopted. I have taken note of your resolution of 17 September, and I hope you have noted that many of your recommendations are already covered in practice, covered by ongoing studies or will be covered by today’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the long-term measures mentioned in your resolution, we have set up a high level group. The first meeting has taken place and we expect that the final paper will be delivered before the end of June next year.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very happy to be able to say that the reality today in the dairy market is that prices are increasing and we are no longer seeing any buy-up into intervention because the market prices are better than the intervention prices.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding my proposal, Article 186 is an existing provision for a large number of products, but milk is not included. The recent price volatility that we saw, starting in 2007, has shown that it is, or it will be, necessary to include milk under this article, because this would then allow the Commission to take faster action.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, in the Council of Agricultural Ministers and in COMAGRI, I also announced this EUR 280 million for dairy farmers. In order to be able to pay out this money quickly, I simply need the legal basis in Article 186. The idea will be to allocate the money in national envelopes, according to production in the year 2008-9 and, of course, within the ceiling of the national quotas, distributed in a non-discriminatory manner to those dairy farmers most affected by the crisis. Again, to use this possibility, we need to include milk in Article 186.</p>
<p class="contents">When I say I announced the possibility of proposing EUR 280 million, you have to be aware that the budget authority, which is the European Parliament and the Council of Finance Ministers, will have to decide on this amount at the ECOFIN meeting on 19 November. I also said yesterday that this is the last money that I have in my pockets, with the exception of the EUR 300 million which is necessary as a buffer to avoid financial discipline. It is important for me to say clearly to you that Article 186 is not a <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> to propose whatever ideas the Commission might get. At this stage, I can only say that private storage for different products – and this could include cheese – is a candidate, provided that the market situation is such that we can justify it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second part of the proposal is the management of the quota system. The possibility already exists today for Member States to buy up quotas. What we are introducing here is the possibility that the Member States simply reduce the overall national ceiling of the quota with the amount of quotas they have been buying out of the market. This is a voluntary scheme because it has been obvious in our discussions that compulsory schemes simply would not work politically.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to hearing your comments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this way, we have sent a signal to our dairy farmers and have not shied away from the responsibility. In contrast to a minority of my fellow Members from other groups, we see, in this request to use the urgent procedure, an additional tool to get help to dairy farmers at a difficult time.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly true that this request from the Commission did come very late in the day and that it is less than what is possible. That said, it is always better than doing nothing at all.</p>
<p class="contents">The views within my own group about the proposed buy-back programme also diverge widely. The programme would have to be obligatory for it to have any impact at all. Yet I see no majority for that in this Parliament or in the Council. Furthermore, such a programme would not be acceptable to some of the Member States as it would be tantamount to a cutting back of the balancing out arrangement and also of the quotas. The indication that quotas are to be raised for priority groups is a decision that is already the law in force.</p>
<p class="contents">The inclusion of milk and milk products in Article 186 for immediate measures in the event of market disturbances is to be welcomed. Nonetheless, I will be tabling an amendment to the effect that this measure should be restricted to two years. If it proves its worth, we will then agree to an extension.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say thank you for the EUR 280 million. Commissioner, you have indeed largely accommodated Parliament. I know that you do not have any more money available to you. I ask that the – possibly amended – motion for a resolution be approved on Thursday. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The rapid extension to this sector of the rules governing intervention in the event of market crisis enables us to provide a significant response at an extremely difficult time for farming as a whole and the dairy sector in particular. At this point, we expect the European Commission to take onboard, as Mrs Fischer Boel just said, Parliament’s requests, which have pointed out several times that the measures taken until now have proved to be inadequate given the seriousness of the current crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s openness towards the Commission today should not be interpreted as full delegation with unrestricted powers, but as a gesture of responsibility in a dramatic and wholly exceptional situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am keen to stress that in this regard, Parliament considers it essential to be involved at every stage of the decision-making process in order to guarantee democratic scrutiny, and this is why we believe that the Commission should notify Parliament in advance of how it will actually use these new powers conferred under Article 186 for the milk sector as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner, could I first of all thank you for responding positively to the resolution agreed with this House on 27 September. I welcome the moves you have taken to try and stabilise what is a very serious situation for dairy farmers. I also welcome the EUR 280 million that you have announced for restructuring.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the first part of your proposal, the question we all have to ask today is: why are we being asked to approve urgency measures at this late stage, and will they assist market recovery? Because clearly, as you said in your speech, the green shoots of recovery are already starting to show. I am not convinced that the proposed quota changes will make a great deal of difference but, as they are voluntary on Member States, this group will certainly not oppose them being granted.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the proposal on widening the scope of Article 186 to include milk and milk products, in my experience, ministers – or in this case commissioners – usually come to parliaments asking for powers so they can take action to solve a problem. Tonight, we seem to be being asked to grant the powers to the Commission without first being told exactly what action they will be used to address.</p>
<p class="contents">As I understand from your contribution early on, you did mention that you needed this extra power as a legal basis to pay out the EUR 280 million. I would be grateful if you could clarify whether that is the case. Is that why you require the powers? Because the great concern we all have is that we may well be handing over a blank cheque to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you said you had been financially plucked of your last feather, so, if you have other ideas for action you might take, clearly there is not much financial scope to do anything at all significant. Our group will only grant these powers if they are time limited and they are constrained to extreme circumstances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission must now bear the overall responsibility again. This morning, we saw something different, although we would have liked Parliament to have been more involved. Let me say quite clearly that we are not against financial support. We must be clear, however, that such support is just a drop in the ocean, in the truest sense of the expression.</p>
<p class="contents">The decisions made in Luxembourg unfortunately also did not help us bring about a rebalancing of supply and demand – which is, of course, the crucial element here. The voluntary buying up of quotas is all well and good, but it will not have a major impact as it does not contribute significantly to a reduction in volume.</p>
<p class="contents">I already mentioned yesterday that we must give proper consideration to the Court of Auditors’ report and set about implementing a policy aimed at the long term and that we need to look at what the Court of Auditors has said. The Court said that we need supplies to be managed in future or else the whole system will be incapable of being financed, and we need a dairy policy based on quality products in the European market.</p>
<p class="contents">We must move away from export refunds as quickly as possible – this is an old demand on our part and we have often pointed out the disastrous consequences of these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">We really need a policy that goes beyond this current crisis and we also expect longer-term answers from the Commission. Regrettably, the Commission has not given us such answers so far, specifically as regards how we need to strengthen the producer organisations in order to give them more market power and restrain the supermarket chains. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reality, and I think the cause of the frustration that many dairy farmers feel, is that while they have seen to some extent what Mr Lyon referred to as the green shoots emerging, this money has not passed through into their bank accounts yet. So this does create a degree of frustration for the dairy farmers. Many have been under financial pressure for a long time. It is a good and useful thing that we can talk, because I do now accept the need for Article 186 to be brought into place so that we can get this money direct to the producers as fast as we possibly can. I think that is the challenge.</p>
<p class="contents">I like Mr Deß’s idea of an amendment, and if he puts it forward I think I would like to support that amendment for a limit of two or even three years to get this job done.

<p class="contents">You are going to release EUR 280 million, when only a few weeks ago it was going to be EUR 600 million. You are therefore going to give a one-off payment of EUR 1 000 to farmers who are now losing EUR 100 to 200 per day. We are therefore calling for a real emergency financial plan, not a plaster to treat a life-threatening illness.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, you want to use public money for a huge plan to slaughter dairy cattle and to shut farms. In so doing, you are going to destroy the future of our farmers, as it is the young farmers who will be the hardest hit, the smallest farmers, those who develop the land, who produce milk products and quality cheese, and who preserve the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">How dare you propose that, when so many families, in Europe and elsewhere, do not have access to food, starting with milk! I would add that, with your plan, we will have a milk shortage in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is, at a time when the Treaty of Lisbon is being pitched so strongly to us, we can only be surprised that you should want to enforce this Article 186 of the regulation, which will give you full powers. You had these full powers, though, and it was these that led you to opt for the liberalisation of quotas that is plunging us into the crisis that we are in today, for the sole benefit of manufacturers and distributors, because, even today, the European Court of Auditors points out that, between 2000 and 2007, the consumer prices of milk products increased by 17% while the producer prices fell by 6%.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I say to you once again that there is an urgent, a very urgent, need to provide a huge amount of help to the agricultural sector by means of a major European emergency fund, to return to a policy of minimum agricultural prices, and not to let the capitalist market destroy our farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I have three questions to ask. The first one is as follows. What do you see as the lesson from this crisis? Have we learnt any lesson from it? Commissioner, this crisis has not been caused by any kind of natural disaster, tsunami or other similar event, but by a series of bad decisions and a basically failed agricultural policy. Looking at the future, what can you promise farmers? How will they avoid a similar crisis in the future? I would like to hear a clear-cut, detailed answer from you.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for my next question. You said yesterday at the Committee hearing that Member States can freely use this sum of money. What does this mean exactly? Will Member States be able to distribute this money fairly so that it is not given to farming’s big business and large farms, but to smallholders, family farmers who are most in need and whose livelihood depends on it? These farmers have ended up in the direst situation. The other large group that should be considered are farmers in the new Member States, especially smallholders. How do you want to get rid of this intolerable discrimination which derives from the fact that we Hungarians, for instance, had to hand over our markets lock, stock and barrel to the European Union, but we have received only a fraction of the subsidies? How and when will this injustice and inequity be eliminated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With reference to the content of the proposed measures, despite a lack of adequate operational details for them, I think that things are moving in the right direction towards solving the problems which our farmers are currently experiencing. I do not believe, however, that the proposed measures alone can solve the problems we are facing. Nevertheless, I think it is vital to vote in favour of the proposal to amend Articles 78 and 79 of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Article 186 of the same CMO Regulation, I would point out first of all that paragraphs a) and b) of this article lay down different levels of protection for different goods, intervening for some when prices rise and fall significantly, whereas for others – pigmeat, olive oil and other products – only when prices rise significantly. I think this is an unacceptable discrepancy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to put forward, also on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats), an amendment with the aim of ensuring that the Commission informs Parliament prior to undertaking the measures set out in Article 186, and I think that this amendment is compatible with what the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats in the European Parliament just proposed.</p>

I have more questions for the Commissioner. Does she really, seriously believe that paying out this money will end the protests? As I said earlier, I believe that Parliament’s decision this morning equated to granting the Commission a blank cheque because we do not know what it will do with it. I will say it again: the Commission is not part of the solution to the problem, but is actually part of the problem. I stand by that view.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet I also simply accept the decision – as you have to see the facts as they are and this is what has been decided – and I would say to the other Members that we must limit these measures. We should limit them to a manageable period, so that we in Parliament can also get our hand back on the tiller.</p>
<p class="contents">I have another question for you, Commissioner, as it is repeatedly said for all the programmes that we need to continue to promote restructuring. So what do you mean by restructuring? Do you really think it is right that we continue to give out money in order basically to encourage smaller-scale farmers to give up so that we can give money to the bigger farms? This policy is no longer an effective means to an end. We must ensure that we employ the money in a targeted way, specifically in the disadvantaged regions, in order to maintain the structures in those regions that are in greatest jeopardy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The millions mentioned here are far below the amount needed to compensate producers for the falling prices that they have been suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Contrary to what is claimed, it is necessary to reverse the route that the CAP has been heading down, where successive reforms have dismantled the instruments to regulate the market, quotas and production rights, leading many thousands of producers to gradually abandon the sector. Thousands of jobs are in the balance: whole families who depend on farming, and the dairy sector in particular. Vast regions are at stake, where the land will be increasingly abandoned, with drastic social and environmental consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">All this cries out for immediate intervention to restore fair prices for producers, but this will require more resources than those now being made available. Above all, and we repeat, the situation demands measures with a greater scope that are not merely palliative, such as the cancellation of the annual increase in milk quotas, returning them to the levels in place prior to the decision to increase them, and the repeal of the decision to abolish the quota system in 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is dangerous to tamper, simply because of a desire to do something, so close to the final phasing out of the milk quota system, a system that has really been to the disadvantage of dairy farmers hitherto. It has also been left behind by developments on the ground, as the market is currently finally beginning to recover. I therefore reject this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to see how the Commission is seeking to exploit Parliament’s call for urgent measures for its own ends. It is doing this by attempting, shortly before the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, to ensure for itself permanent scope to act without Parliament’s consent through this amendment of Article 186. I therefore reject this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I could live with Parliament granting the Commission scope to act for a limited period in cases of crisis. This ability would also be available to Parliament in future times of crisis, with very rapid effect, through Rule 142 of its Rules of Procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This hope is strengthened by the decision to support milk producers with a sum of EUR 280 million next year. A fundamental question, however, remains: what should be done about milk production and milk producers in the long term? The most important question in this matter is the future of milk production quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there are two approaches. The first, which is the effect of the review of the common agricultural policy, increases production quotas gradually, and aims to lift them in 2015. The second approach, which is contained in the present proposal of the European Commission, aims to limit milk supply by a new method of calculating the charge for exceeding the national quota. These two approaches contradict each other.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am in favour of maintaining the quotas, but only when the breakdown of quotas among EU countries and producers is based on objective and fair criteria. The development and adoption of such fair and objective criteria would be very difficult, but perhaps it is worth making the attempt. If we are talking about extension – I fully support the extension of Article 186, but I think this should be accompanied by a definition of the role of the Commission and the instruments it will be able to use. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have argued that a situation as serious as the one faced by the dairy sector requires urgent measures to defend the sector, for both economic and social reasons. I actually come from a country, Portugal, and a region, the Azores, where the dairy sector is very important and embedded in regions that are socially rather fragile and where, in fact, it would be vital to maintain the quota system beyond 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">The measures proposed here are somewhat flimsy, but they are nonetheless necessary and imperative. I am also worried about how the Commission will use the new powers it is to be given, especially since it has acted in quite an insensitive way in this crisis, putting forward weak measures, too late, and only under intense pressure. In view of this, I would like the Commission to submit an annex to Article 186, setting out measures which can be used for a radical intervention in the dairy sector so as to ensure its sustainability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is one point that I feel the need to criticise, however, which is the voluntary buy-up programme for milk quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">A programme of this kind, if it is to succeed, must be obligatory, not voluntary. I find this voluntary arrangement to buy back milk quotas counterproductive. I believe this not only because this arrangement will initially mean that we retain a quota increase which it will then be very difficult to rein back in. By buying back the milk quotas, we will be giving them a financial value again, and the main effect of that will be that it hampers the ability to do the balancing out. I feel I must reject any measure that restricts balancing out. Particularly in the phasing out period for the milk quotas, balancing out is a necessary tool in order for individual farms to be able to orient themselves better in the market.</p>
<p class="contents">For the reasons I have mentioned, I will be forced to reject this part of the motion, although I will vote in favour of the motion as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should acknowledge that in this House and push to ensure that they are passed on to farmers. We are saying there is EUR 280 million available to them, but every additional cent they receive is worth much more than the doling out of payments to them. That is most important.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is important that some have criticised the Commission hugely. Let us acknowledge that intervention and export refunds have been used to maintain prices, even with that horribly low price for producers, so I think some of the criticism is unnecessary and harsh. I support the extension of Article 186 if you needed to pay out this EUR 280 million, which I regard as symbolic rather than significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us look at the lessons. We need to look at what is going to happen to CAP reform post-2013; the high-level group is focusing on it. I would say to those political groups who tonight support funding for dairying: make sure that you also support a properly funded common agricultural policy after 2013; otherwise your words are empty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was explaining to French listeners what took place yesterday in Luxembourg.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Council’s decision is a bad one, since the only word to appear in the text is ‘restructuring’. In France, we have gone from having 480 000 milk producers in 1984 to having fewer than 88 000 today.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are told that yet more producers must be forced out and that the money that will be recouped – this appears in the text – will be used for producers who have exceeded their quota. Production will therefore have to be concentrated still further and milk producers in the most difficult areas forced out. This is the wrong approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The money that has been given, the EUR 280 million – the figure has already been quoted – equates to EUR 50 per month and per farm, for one year. That is peanuts; it is almost a show of contempt for the crisis that the producers are going through.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the subject of Article 186, I should like to say that, at a time when we are moving towards codecision in agricultural matters, it is unacceptable for power, for a blank cheque, to be handed back to the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sends out a clear signal to all those who are suffering the adverse consequences of the crisis every day. I urge that this adequate response will not be a one-off economic solution, but part of a targeted, long-term strategy for restoring, stabilising and developing this sector in Europe. This is why it is important to take into consideration the measures which each Member State is going to adopt. I would like to draw attention to the fact that Bulgaria can only partially accept the proposals to amend Regulation 1234. We insist that it is explicitly recorded in the draft that the opportunities to manage national milk quotas will be exercised at Member States’ discretion. It is important that the option is retained to choose the existing scheme for buying up and redistributing milk quotas through the national reserve. We can ill afford either to hold back or collect payment from producers as the Bulgarian sector is in the process of being modernised. Otherwise, Bulgarian producers will not be competitive even after 2015. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it should also be remembered that when we are talking about money – and it is money which we are talking about – the way in which the money is actually distributed is important. It should reach those who are feeling the effects of the crisis the most, because I will not agree to a policy under which we give everyone an equal amount, which means a small amount, so that, in fact, quite literally, we do not help anyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I would like, if I may, to refer to history before turning to the future in a moment. I am sure we remember the wonderful years, over a year ago now, when the farmers were getting a very good price for milk. At the same time, they were benefiting from large EU subsidies for modernisation of the dairy sector. Therefore, it is important that we plan the future based on this experience, and that we draw conclusions from our mistakes, because mistakes were certainly made. It is equally important for us to think about how to plan the development of this sector, since money is available both as direct subsidies and also for the development of rural areas. In addition, we have the instrument of milk quotas at our disposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On further restructuring, or better, perhaps, as 21 Member States wanted, on an injection for the market, on market mechanisms? In fact, the farmers want the money to be used for support mechanisms. Currently, they are not able to take out further loans or to improve productivity. They are not able, at the moment, to continue with modernisation, because they have lost liquidity. They do not want to buy refrigerators or milking machines now, this is not the time for further investment. The EUR 280 million works out at not quite EUR 2 per tonne of milk produced in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Commission proposes what it calls a ‘mechanism for management of the quota system’, it really wants to limit production. We should consider whether we will not see a repeat of the situation which followed reform of the sugar market, and which has meant that we now have problems with the supply of that resource.

We have been taking lots of different measures over the summer so I think we should devise a special study to tell the new Members of this Parliament exactly what has been going on since last January.</p>
<p class="contents">On the specific points on the two proposals here today, I have to repeat again that the buy-up scheme is not a new scheme. It is already there for Member States to use if they want to help specific dairy farmers out of business. It is an offer, and that is why I do not want to make it compulsory; it is a possibility for helping farmers out of business. The quota they buy out can be kept in the national reserve and distributed at a later stage if Member States so wish. This was one part of the discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The other part, which has aroused by far the most interest today, is Article 186. The reason for introducing dairy farming into Article 186 is the fact that we need to be able to react fast. By the way, I do not see any reason why dairy farming should not be part of Article 186, as areas specifically within the meat sector are already there. And, in general, those who fear that the Commission will get a blank cheque and do whatever they want should keep in mind that Article 186 is normally by nature a very positive scheme where it is possible to try to help people who are in difficulties by reacting very fast. So it is not a blank cheque. It will be discussed, as you probably know, in the Management Committee.</p>
<p class="contents">I have listened to your ideas concerning a more limited period of three or four years. I think it would disqualify dairy farmers – but of course I have listened to what you say.</p>
<p class="contents">Then I think there are lots of mistaken ideas going round. This EUR 280 million is not for restructuring. It simply offers a possibility of paying out very quickly as soon as we have the formalities in place, with the acceptance from the Ecofin meeting in November and the signing of the budget for 2010. This means we can act immediately, which would not be the case if we do not have Article 186 in place. So it is not restructuring. As I said before, it gives Member States the possibility of paying the most needy from this national budget.</p>
<p class="contents">How should it be distributed? I have clearly said it has to be on the basis of production. I can hear that there may be other ideas but if we start discussing internally how to distribute, then I think it would take at least to the end of next year because there would be so many great ideas we would never be able to find a common line on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I will reply to some of the specific questions. I would like to say that producer organisations are an excellent option. It is actually necessary. I have said that clearly in plenary before, specifically when discussing the fruit and vegetable scheme. If farmers spend their time and efforts competing against each other instead of competing with the strong retail sector, I know who the winners and the losers will be. Therefore I say: do work together to be a much stronger body in the whole food chain.</p>
<p class="contents">I completely agree with you that we have a global problem, that we have one billion people starving, not being able to get what they need to eat every day. That is why I was hurt to see European farmers spreading milk all over the fields in a situation where we are facing starvation problems globally. That is not the best image for European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I am very impressed at the way in which two Members, Mr Bové and Mr Häusling, managed to gear their speaking time. I noticed very carefully how it was done. I do not know if it is a new procedure of the House that one speaker can substitute for another who then goes in to speak under catch-the-eye. It was quite smart, I would say.</p>

Unfortunately, the Commission has taken a long time to act. It has only done so when faced with intense pressure from dairy producers, the European Parliament and 21 Member States. I would make the following points on the measures that you have presented here:</p>
<p class="contents">1: The fund of EUR 280 million is too little compared with the amount of EUR 600 million unanimously deemed necessary by the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, which is the committee with both technical and political expertise in this matter. This policy statement was approved by the European Parliament itself. We cannot, therefore, consider less than half the sum that Parliament deemed essential only a month ago to be sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">2: The inclusion of milk in Article 186 gives the Commission an operational tool that can be deployed instantly, but that does not mean that Parliament will no longer monitor the issue. We still need instruments to regulate the market. We should maintain the quota system and introduce transparency into the milk marketing chain. Without these two instruments, it will be impossible to restore and guarantee stability in Europe’s rural areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, these measures can only alleviate the crisis, but cannot end it altogether. In order to do this, the decisions regarding the milk quota increases should be dropped. However, neither the European Commission, nor Mariann Fischer Boel personally, is inclined to acknowledge that wrong decisions have been made. I agree with the European farmers’ demand to drop the quota increase.</p>
<p class="contents">I also oppose the permanent abolition of the quota system scheduled for 2015. I concur with the point of view of the largest European farmers organisation COPA-COGECA, which is that the dairy market requires regulation after 2015 as well. The important lesson to be learned from the current crisis is that the dairy market needs to be regulated. Without this, prices will become unpredictable. European dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large-scale price volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">On the subject of the current emergency measures, I would like to draw attention to the fact that the increase in the minimum subsidies from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 may cause problems for Member States in a more difficult budgetary situation. What I am afraid of is that in these countries, such as Hungary, the governments will not provide the maximum support. As a result, farmers in these countries may end up at an even bigger competitive disadvantage.</p>
<p class="contents">I am confident that during the vote on the 2010 budget taking place on Thursday, the European Parliament will support the proposed amendment, submitted by a number of Members including myself, which would increase support for the school milk programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs Fischer Boel has therefore succumbed to the pressure after turning a deaf ear, for weeks on end, to the distress of farmers on the brink of bankruptcy. However, this financial measure is derisory and is intended merely to calm the producers down for a while. It will do nothing to solve the problem of a sector that is on its way out with the planned end of milk quotas. Milk producers do not want charity or handouts, they want the market to be regulated so that they can sell their milk at prices that will allow them to live a dignified life from their efforts and to guarantee their children’s future. Through its stubborn desire to impose the dogma of free and fair competition, the European Union is going to leave thousands of farmers at the mercy of the law of the market, and that alone. This is the same ultraliberalism that each month makes thousands of industrial workers unemployed. The carnage must be stopped now as a matter of urgency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At EU level, this amounts to an additional one cent in aid per litre of milk, which is absolutely negligible. After putting up bold resistance for several months, the European Commission gave in slightly to the pressure exerted by farmers, 21 Member States, including Hungary, and the European Parliament, which already demanded additional resources for the sector during their informal meeting held in Brussels last Monday. In spite of the tardy measures from the EU, the Hungarian Government has acted quickly to support dairy farmers and has done everything to help them, taking into account the budget resources available. Hungary has helped the dairy sector by using all the sums that can be reallocated as part of rural development resources and the European Economic Development Programme. Apart from us, only Latvia and Malta have such outstanding indicators. Hungarian dairy farmers will receive directly around EUR 3.3 million from the EUR 280 million envelope, roughly equivalent to HUF 890 million. The Hungarian government can freely decide how to use this money. The Commission only made the suggestion that the most needy producers should receive this special aid, which coincides with Hungarian objectives. Following approval of the 2010 budget, this sum will be paid out at the start of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
