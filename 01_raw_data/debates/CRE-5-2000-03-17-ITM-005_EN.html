<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Evans, Jillian (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Commissioner, the purpose of the Structural Funds is to target the poorest and most run-down areas of the European Union, those in greatest need of development, with extra money to help them begin to rebuild the economy, create jobs and regenerate poorer communities. Additionality is meant to ensure that happens and to prevent governments from using EU funding to replace their own aid as this would defeat the object. But in many regions and nations that is what happens at the moment and I can illustrate the problem using the example of Wales. The granting of EU Objective 1 status to West Wales and the Valleys last year was an acknowledgement of the poverty in two-thirds of the country. EUR 1.2 billion of European funding used effectively could provide exactly the additional help that is intended. But if we look at the government budget to Wales, in practice there will be no more government spending next year with Objective 1 than there is this year before Objective 1.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Assembly budget which comes from the Treasury remains the same so that in the first fifteen months, at least, of the new programme period there are no additional resources at all. The money will be taken from other budgets in the National Assembly, such as health and education. Therefore central government expenditure is reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Structural Funds, areas of greatest need are identified and selected on regional criteria. Yet when the Commission looks at additionality it is dealt with on a Member State level. This is a clear contradiction. The rules as they stand allow this to happen. Member States are not legally required to demonstrate additionality at the regional or programme level. I agree with the statement made by Commissioner Barnier in a written reply to me when he said that the spirit of additionality rather than the letter of the law on the matter is an important consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">We need the revision of the system and a central part of that is looking at additionality internally in the Member States at the programme level as well as at the Member State level. Mechanisms need to be in place to ensure that Member States respect the principle and the spirit of additionality so that funds are targeted and spent effectively. So we are asking in this question, Commissioner, for confirmation that this will be done and I look forward to the vote on this debate in April.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, the principle of additionality exists in order to ensure that transfers to the Member States under the Structural Funds add to, rather than replace, national expenditures on structural development measures. In this way, European Union structural policies will have a greater impact on reducing regional and social disparities.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">ex-ante</span> verification of additionality is at present being undertaken in application of Article 11 of Regulation 1260/99. This is an integral part of the negotiation of the Structural Funds programmes with the Member States. This exercise is a demonstration of the Member States' intention to implement the principle of additionality over the programming period that lies ahead. Where necessary, the Commission may request clarification from the Member States on the details of their forecasts for eligible expenditure for the period 2000-2006. As a further measure, the Commission has prepared detailed implementing provisions for inclusion in the programming documents covering both the situation <span class="italic">ex ante</span> and also the mid-term and final verification of additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue covered by the questions is the possibility of the verification of additionality at regional level. I would like to develop a number of elements of previous answers. Firstly, although additionality is implemented at the level of the overall eligible spending by the Member States rather than at regional level, it must be borne in mind that the overall additionality required to be demonstrated is, by definition, the sum of the eligible expenditures at the lower level. In practice, reduced national eligible expenditure in some regions would have to be balanced with an increase in other regions in order for additionality to be respected overall. On this point the Commission can give a clear assurance that, where evidence exists of reduced national expenditure in a given region or regions, it will be particularly attentive with regard to the credibility of the overall figures.</p>
<p class="contents">A second point of clarification concerns the scope of additionality and the suggestion that, when implemented at national level, it may be incompatible with the regional vocation of the Structural Funds. It must be borne in mind that the development-related expenditure of a Member State which is taken into account for the assessment of additionality is generally a mixture of resources allocated and managed at national level and those managed at regional level.</p>
<p class="contents">While there might be some categories of expenditure for which stability could be expected at regional level between the programming periods, it could hardly be suggested that the level of spending on, for example, major infrastructure should be maintained at the same level in each region regardless of current needs. This is why the Commission takes the view that the strict application of additionality at regional level would lead to excessive rigidity in the management by the Member States of their own development expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding budgetary provisions within the Member States between the central government and the regions, the Commission can only repeat that these are matters exclusively for national consideration and are not related to additionality as defined in the regulations.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not think that there is a more important issue in Wales at the moment than the application of Objective 1 funds and it is important to look at the background to the issues that we are currently considering.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two major news stories breaking in the United Kingdom today. One is the shock news of BMW's decision to break up the Rover-Land Rover Group with the threat of massive redundancies right the way across the UK and the other breaking news this morning is the Conservative Party's stunning victory in the Ayr by-election driving the defending Labour Party into a miserable third place with a swing of almost 10%.</p>
<p class="contents">Now these stories are not just topical background to this debate. In my view, they underpin the very issues which we are considering in the context of Structural Fund spending under Objectives 1 and 2 in those parts of the European Union which are facing major economic problems. As we have already heard from Jillian Evans, a major part of Wales, in constituencies which I also represent, has been granted Objective 1 status, but sadly ever since that announcement was made by the Commission, our problems in Wales have actually got even worse. As a direct result of what I would describe as UK government policy, our agricultural economy has all but collapsed. Farm incomes are at their lowest level for a generation and this decline is also hitting the manufacturing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not apologise for saying that the massive overvaluation of sterling which gives the UK Labour Chancellor an electoral war-chest of unprecedented proportions has handicapped every Welsh and UK manufacturer trying to export into the European market. It is little wonder that BMW blames the Rover decision directly on UK government economic policy, but that I fear is little comfort to the thousands of workers in Rover who have strained to improve the efficiency of the company only to find that their efforts have been undermined in Downing Street.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn then to the central hand of Labour government at work in terms of the European Structural Funds package. The unacceptable behaviour of the UK Government over this has already brought about the timely end of the political career of the first Secretary of the Welsh Assembly. Sadly, the Structural Funds spending issues have been marked by delay by disputes in relation to matched funding and also in relation to the issue of additionality. Lest it be raised later in this debate let me make it clear: this is not a new issue and I share the view that it is an issue that needs to be examined very carefully by the Commission itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the honour to be appointed as the rapporteur on the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee for the Structural Funds guidelines 2000-2006 and the committee agreed on that occasion, based on our recommendations to the Regional Policy Committee, that the Commission should pay attention to this issue of additionality. We reiterated the importance of ensuring that Structural Funds do not just merely, as it were, replace public spending otherwise earmarked for those areas that are lagging behind. I am rather sorry that the Regional Policy Committee did not incorporate that in the report themselves, but there it is.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a number of questions that I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to take back to Commissioner Barnier. I appreciate that he is the Commissioner in office today but he may not be in a position to respond to these points himself. However, these are points that I seek to put in the context of certainly the area that I represent and I daresay they are points that would be supported by Jillian Evans on behalf of her party. What progress is being made in relation to the approval of the programming documents within the Commission? Will the Commissioner take the step in terms of transparency of publishing at an appropriate time the correspondence that has taken place between the Commission and the National Assembly? We were assured, I am bound to say by a rather complacent Economic Secretary, who has now become the First Secretary, that all matters were proceeding in an orderly fashion. Yet we hear from remarks that are made from time to time by the Commission that there are real problems and we find it difficult to do our job within this Parliament without that degree of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">So, will the Commission undertake to make that information available to all Members of the European Parliament? Will they undertake to keep us informed in relation to these matters? Will they undertake to challenge Member State Governments in relation to the maps that have been drawn up in relation to Objective 2 where also there has been quite clear evidence of jerrymandering also. The additionality issue is an important one, but I must say it is not the only one which gives much concern to many Members of this European Parliament.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I acknowledge that there is difficulty in the Midlands with the Rover Group. I would not like to make political capital out of it. There are too many jobs at stake. Secondly, he also mentioned their by-election. I congratulate his party in securing a victory in this by-election. But, unlike him, I have been in Ayr for the last three weeks, on the doorstep. I can tell you that additionality was never raised once.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn to the question at hand. I thank the Nationalists for having raised this. It is right that we have a proper discussion on the whole question of the Structural Funds. But I suspect there is a deeper plot here. What are they actually trying to achieve? I listened to Ms Evans. Basically, what I took from her contribution is that she wants to redefine the Structural Funds regulations. I would remind people in this Parliament that it was not so long ago that this Parliament passed, by the assent procedure, the rules and regulations governing the Structural Funds, including Article 11, which defines additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it therefore Parliament's role now to change that? We should not change that. The role of this Parliament is to ensure that the rules are complied with. That is what we should concentrate on.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Ms Evans, along with one of her colleagues, Dafydd Wigley and a member of the Scottish Nationalist Party, Mr Wilson, went to meet Commissioner Barnier. I should like to read out the statement made by Commissioner Barnier after that meeting:</p>
<p class="contents">“I know that there has been a great deal of debate in Scotland and Wales recently about European regional funding. But I have the impression that this has sometimes confused two separate issues – additionality and cofinancing. I am not surprised that there is a certain amount of confusion among the Nationalists on this. Additionality, whether or not EU funds are providing additional impact, compared to what would otherwise have happened, can be used as <span class="italic">one</span> of the selection criteria by the local programme planners before they decide to approve aid to individual projects. The Commission, on the other hand, is obliged by the rules to make a global assessment of additionality for the UK as a whole, with the specific aim of ensuring that the European financial aid is additional to, and not a substitute for, national finance.

<p class="contents">As the Commission will be aware, however, a number of Member States within the European Union have devolved systems of regional government. Such regional systems of government are normally financed in whole or in part from central government funds. It appears to me that, under the present rules, central government can build the EU contribution to structural funding into its calculations for determining regional government budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">There appears to be no mechanism, despite what the Commissioner said, for ensuring either of two things: first, that the additionality rule is applied to this calculation, and second, that the amount of EU funding which ultimately reaches individual regions corresponds directly to the amount earmarked for those regions at the planning stage. At the very least, this engenders a lack of transparency. It may also mean that the additionality principle is not being properly implemented on a region-by-region basis.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept, like Mrs Evans, that this does not, strictly speaking, contradict the letter of European Union law on this matter. But, unlike her, it seems to me to be quite clearly contrary to the spirit of additionality rules and undermines the very purposes for which structural funding was established in the first place. Although I come from Scotland, I know these issues are of concern not just to my Liberal Democrat colleagues from other parts of the United Kingdom but also to ELDR members representing regions across the whole of the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Some of us newcomers to this Parliament are already beginning to tire of good intentions, fantastic programmes and of hearing about the spirit of the Community regulations. Instead of spirit, we are going to end up with ghosts and sleepless nights because, in reality, commitments are not being fulfilled. It is therefore appropriate for the European institutions themselves to start by making good their commitments with regard to additionality.

The first rules that need to be complied with are those in the Treaty, in this case, Article 158, which takes the objective of economic and social cohesion to its highest level. Our task is to ensure that following on from this, the Commission’s regulations and behaviour attain and serve to attain these objectives. Our task is also to be alert enough here to criticise and to raise the issue whenever we see that this is not being done. We support the good timing and the reasoning of the issues raised by the authors of the oral question and we agree with the comments that have already been made here. We call on the Commission to exert more pressure to ensure that these instruments are used effectively in favour of the regions with the greatest needs, instead of, as it seems to us, letting the objective of economic and social cohesion go cold.</p>
<p class="contents">This subject is obviously a delicate one, and its development has been discussed at great length over the years, with many rules being regularly revised, but what we cannot accept is that the revision of these rules and the development of the bureaucracy always hit the most needy. We cannot, for example, accept the fact that problems have been raised about allocating funds to regions which are eligible under various programmes, because if these regions are eligible for various funds it is precisely because their needs are the greatest, and anything that hinders the operation of these funds holds back their development and threatens the objective of economic and social cohesion. Similarly, we do not accept that the Commission should in any way associate itself with the degree of inertia shown by some national governments who are not prepared to support the regions with the greatest needs.

The first is that the money in absolute terms in most regions of the Community is relatively small, and its impact is political rather economic – though that is important too. I have often said it is important that we as a European Union should not just make regulations telling people what they may or may not do, but that we should extend what appears to the European public and to the regions of the Union to be tangible benefits. Even in rich regions they will appreciate the fact that the European Union tries to help close the gap between rich and poor.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing in the macro-economic sense that we can say is that, if a certain amount of Structural Funds is allocated to Portugal or Greece or Ireland, as it has been in the past, then that money goes into these states in any case and that is the first impact that it has. The money is actually transferred and, regardless of whether the letter of the law is observed or not, the countries become the better off.</p>
<p class="contents">Another point that I would like to make is that we can learn from the past. First of all, we have now tidied up the regulations to some extent, but originally they were written in an effort to please every sector and every political interest, so that it became impossible, with the staff that the European Commission had at its disposal, to police the spending of the money, and that is still the case to a large degree.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now into to the third or fourth programme. What we must do is learn from the mistakes of the past and try and apply the lessons to the future. If you want to be absolutely effective with the way this money is spent, what you need to do is to look at what a country has been spending previously, and to ask them to submit their plans to the European Commission. The European Commission identifies the weaknesses in this plan and says: This is the way we would like our money to be spent in addition to what you have already allocated for all this work you intend to do.</p>
<p class="contents">In my personal experience in Ireland, I never heard the European Commission take Ireland to task for failure in the area of additionality. But one should remember that, between 1982 and 1992, the Structural Funds to Ireland peaked; they are getting less now, and there was a generous amount of money. But, from 1982 to 1992, the public capital programme actually reduced, including Structural Funds. It reduced in real terms by 30%. So where did the Structural Funds go? The Structural Funds actually went into public sector pay and social welfare, and it is very questionable as to whether they did a good or a bad turn to the Irish economy in those years, because they contributed to inflation and increased wage demands. So there are lessons to be learned: set against the staff the Commission had at its disposal to deal with the Irish problem – three or four people – Ireland had 30 000 civil servants, and the Irish Civil Service won every time!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Medina Ortega (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I am going to refer to a subject that none of the previous speakers has discussed. I am referring to the report by the Court of Auditors on the principle of additionality. This is a report that was published in the Official Journal of the European Communities on 9 March.</p>
<p class="contents">This report contains a very interesting section – section 62 – that discusses privatisation. Over the past few years, various European Union governments have enthusiastically embarked on a policy of privatisation placing the heritage which previously belonged to the community in very few hands. In Spain, for example, over the last four years, public companies have been privatised to the tune of 4 billion, with a B for Barcelona or Brussels. These public companies have passed into the hands of private individuals.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Liikanen is an expert in accounting, and knows that privatisation is a form of public disinvestment and, specifically, that it can be a form of regional disinvestment. If, for example, an airline providing regional services was privatised, regional disinvestment could occur, and we would thus be infringing the principle of additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The Court of Auditors has referred to this, saying that Member States are aware that spending decreases as a result of privatisation and it is in their interests to reduce it. Taking into account the importance of the categories of spending affected, telecommunications, energy, etc., this simple operation can substantially modify the final result.</p>
<p class="contents">And we also have the response by the Commission, which must be very recent, and which Commissioner Liikanen, as a member of the College, must remember perfectly. The Commission replies here with a system that we call the Olendorf method, a method of language-learning that consists of the teacher asking the student “Have you got my uncle's underpants?” and the student replying “No, but I have my grandmother's glasses”. And the response given to us by the Commission in section 62 is very short. It says: "Although the private sector sometimes invests in sectors that are traditionally considered public, it would be incredibly difficult to increase the verification of additionality in private investments, as this would imply the collection and examination of the accounts of a number of private companies which would not be obliged to provide the corresponding information to the national authorities or to the Commission”. That is, the Commission is replying using the Olendorf method. We have here Commissioner Liikanen who knows the subject very well, and perhaps he could give us a more specific response, as I believe that this considerably affects the core of additionality.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is that the Berlin financial forecasts anticipated a substantial reduction in the Structural Funds. This year we have EUR 29 430 million. In the year 2006 we will have a nominal figure of EUR 26 600 million, that is to say, a reduction of 14% over seven years. Taking into account inflation, I can calculate that there is a reduction of 20%. That is, from now until 2006, the Structural Funds will lose over 20% compared with the current figure, which means that it will be very difficult to meet the needs we are meeting today and, as we have heard, there are still many problems in many Community regions.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a further problem, which should also not be hidden from the Commission or the members of this House: we are talking about the impending enlargement of the European Union with thirteen new Member States, most of which have a far lower average income than that of the poorest regions of the Community and there are no plans to fulfil cohesion policies with regard to these candidate Member States. I know that the Commission will not be able to give me a reply on this question, but I am drawing the attention of the House and the Commissioner to the problem that this will cause with regard to Community cohesion policies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This principle of additionality is important to reduce regional disparities, which is the aim of the Union’s regional and structural policies. The Commission must oblige the Member States to work in such a way that the principle of additionality is implemented both nationally and regionally.</p>
<p class="contents">I suspect that this principle is being seriously violated in the Member States. The effect of the Union’s regional policy is dramatically weakened by governments drastically reducing national, public and structural aid and subsidies, even in excess of what is coming into a region via Union funds. In some cases this violation is covered up by including as national regional funds development funds, which are mainly, however, targeted at the fastest growing areas. The regional failure to observe the principle of additionality aggravates the situation with regard to internal regional disparities within Member States, which runs counter to the aims of the Union’s regional policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a matter of real concern because it is made to appear as though a scheme which is supposed to provide specific help really ends up just been a conjuring trick between the Commission and the national governments in which extra money is supposed to be coming in, but we are told afterwards it makes no difference whether extra money went into the particular region as long as it went into the country as a whole. That is simply unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We are further told, however, that all is well, because the additionality rules in the regulation are being carried through properly. Yet the Court of Auditors, in the very report that we have been talking about, says the following things: the difficulties encountered are caused by the limited development of the principle in terms of concepts and methodology and the joint failure to find appropriate and effective procedures for verifying it. And then two paragraphs later, the identification of the structural assistance interventions in the eligible regions is unreliable, and this leads to the inclusion of a large number of estimates and hypotheses which are difficult to verify.</p>

Great Britain, as a whole, receives some £10 billion in support from the Structural Funds programme. Indeed parts of my own constituency, the West Midlands, have been awarded £550 million under the Objective II strand.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the Structural Funds programme the European Union, by having this programme, is indeed providing an opportunity – an opportunity for regions to develop and for communities to strengthen; an opportunity for businesses to prosper and for people's lives to be improved. The Structural Funds programme provides, in many cases, the single most important and positive opportunity for our own worst-hit and most deprived areas to get up off their knees and back on their feet. This is a laudable objective and something that every Member of this Parliament would, I hope, support.</p>
<p class="contents">But Structural Funds also provide an opportunity for national governments. If unregulated and unmonitored, they are an opportunity for national governments to ease their cash burden and to iron out their accounting difficulties – or indeed more cynically, one could say, to siphon away a war chest or pay for vote-winning tax reductions. Granting of Structural Funds is often trumpeted by governments as a sign of its success, whereas in truth it is merely a recognition of difficult problems that a region faces. The aim of the Structural Funds programme is not to help governments win elections, but to help the lives of Europe's citizens. It is a great shame, therefore, that just by having this debate today, we are signalling our awareness that money from the Structural Funds programme is not allocated in many Member States as it should be.</p>
<p class="contents">We are accepting the fact, for example, that matching funding is often not provided by national governments and that, by clever accounting, figures are all too often shrouded and fudged. So what can we do? What can be done to ensure that our aims and objectives are met? To begin with, additionality must mean exactly that – additional funds being spent where they are most needed and on the most important projects. We must work harder to ensure that the true figures for spending are rigorously checked and that spending is identified more clearly. Only recently the Commission published a devastating critique of the UK Government's handling of the Structural Funds, due in large part to the inequality of public sector matching funding. This is clearly not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">In one area alone – Liverpool and Merseyside – the lack of support by the UK Treasury is putting at risk the creation of </p>
<p class="contents">10 000 jobs, and up to 5 000 existing ones will be lost, according to a report by the Liverpool Chamber of Commerce. The end result of all this is that private-sector partners will have little confidence in projects, often resulting in the failure of worthwhile schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, as I have said previously in this House in previous debates on the subject, we must endeavour to ensure that these funds are seen not as a hand-out but as a hand-up.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Additionality is <span class="italic">your</span> concept, and it is up to you to ensure that it works effectively in Member States.

It is all very well for my colleague Jonathan Evans to imply that his party is not guilty. For eighteen long years the concept of additionality was not complied with by his government either.</p>
<p class="contents">I think some momentum is being lost, Mr President. I was talking to councils in Wales yesterday. They need this scheme to go ahead. It is in line with the excellent principle of cohesion, and we ask the Commission to adhere to that and to assist the poorest regions in the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We pay the taxes that make up the grants that other areas receive. We have no Objective 1 funding. What Objective 2 funding we had has been reduced by the present government and the Conver Fund that used to be very helpful is now being phased out. So, why do I speak? Because even in the south-east of England there are pockets of deprivation.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular I want to speak of the Isle of Wight, a beautiful island with 130 000 good people but 68% GDP per head of the European average – a very poor region. It gets no support from Europe. Why not? It does not get the grant from Europe because at NUTS II it is classified with Hampshire. Hampshire is a prosperous county – 100% of European average so, no money for the Isle of Wight. Yet, it has a population of 130 000, a bigger population than the Åland Islands which are NUTS II and do get grants from the European Union. The island has taken its case against the British Government that it feels is treating it unfairly, to the High Court in London. I think they might win that case.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as Europe is concerned, on my advice, they took their case to the Ombudsman because we believed that EUROSTAT, by refusing to define the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region, was treating the island unfairly. This week, in what I would say is a landmark ruling by the European Ombudsman, he has said that constitutes maladministration by EUROSTAT and by the European Commission. Let me read out his ruling: “In the present case the Commission has not provided the Ombudsman with elements which show that EUROSTAT, when deciding not to classify the Isle of Wight as a separate NUTS II region, has taken into account all relevant factors including Article 158 of the Treaty and the Viola report of the European Parliament”. He has recommended that the Commission and EUROSTAT should look again at this particular problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the Commission to consider fairly this recommendation that has come from the Ombudsman so that I can go back to the people of the Isle of Wight and say that this issue will be looked at again, that they can expect the Commission to treat fairly the particular problems and concerns of the island. Then we can get in on this act of additionality and take up our fight with the British Government to make sure that we get support from Europe and from the British Government to treat fairly an island which to date has not been fairly treated either by the British Government or by the European Union.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their worst nightmares have turned out to be reality. The Labour Party heartlands of Scotland have sent them an unmistakable message. The Scottish Labour voter – for so long taken for granted – has spoken. The Scottish Conservative Party candidate in Ayr, John Scott, has humiliated Labour into third place – 5 000 or more votes behind.</p>
<p class="contents">This will only get worse for Labour when the truth about their incompetent and cynical administration of the European Union's Structural Funds becomes better known and better understood. Because of the Labour Government's tardiness in submitting its proposed maps nine months late in December instead of March last year, it is still struggling to come up with acceptable specific projects. Scottish local authorities are left not knowing whether or not the projects which they are having to underwrite will indeed obtain Structural Fund support.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner: three questions:</p>
<p class="contents">When do you expect to be able to provide certainty for the Scottish regions and the badly needed projects which are looking for EU support? Are you satisfied with the preparedness of the Scottish Executive to provide the necessary matching funding and to assure you that it is truly additional? Or is it all just the usual Labour/Liberal coalition hot air, all mouth, while feet drag along the cobbled streets of Edinburgh and European money is hijacked by the Treasury in London?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
