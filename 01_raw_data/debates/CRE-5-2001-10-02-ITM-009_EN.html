<p class="contents">The Durban Conference can be described as a success on several counts, despite the difficult political context in which the negotiations took place, and despite the fact that this conference had been described as a failure before it even began.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, in terms of practical results, this is the first United Nations conference devoted to the task of combating racism which has ended with the adoption, by consensus, of a policy declaration and a programme of action. The Durban Conference was, above all, an opportunity to reinforce this essential task of combating racist tendencies, tendencies towards the discrimination and intolerance that constitute a feature of everyday life for millions of human beings, who are all too often the silent victims of outrages against their dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> Even if in the adopted texts, which form the very essence of what we are talking about, little progress was made, the theoretical contemplation of the fight against racism clearly shows a strong, political will to banish racism. A call is also made for taking an impressive number of specific measures which aim to fight this scourge globally. As such, the lion’s share of the 220 articles of the action programme consist of preventive, educational and protective measures which aim to eradicate racism at all levels, as well as strategies which endeavour to attain out-and-out equality of all people worldwide.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of example, I will list a few measures which should strengthen the national and regional institutions in their fight against racism, and which must encourage them to step up their mutual cooperation. Other measures aim to educate people to respect human rights, change their mentality and to grant non-discriminating access to education. Still other measures place the role of the political parties in the foreground, allowing them to develop internal codes of conduct which will prohibit their members from making public speeches which incite racism.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are also measures which must help in the fight against racism in the workplace. The action programme also contains a number of statutory, judicial, regulatory and administrative measures which must prevent racism and must offer protection against this plague. The time was too short to bring all negotiations to a good end. That is why it was impossible to complete the discussions on certain important points, such as the caste system or race discrimination in combination with the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the European Union did manage to have important themes included in all definitive texts. These themes include the gender issue, better child protection and the fight against the trafficking in human beings, especially women and children. Here too, I would like to emphasise the difficulties arising from the use of the concept of ‘race’. Today, it is a fact that each theory which supports the existence of different human races is scientifically flawed. The European Union would like the use of language to follow this trend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not our intention here to deny the diversity of the human race, but we do want to emphasise its unity, and, as such, fight the present forms of racism which are often based on these kinds of claims. But due to strong opposition from certain States, we have been unable to make much progress in this field. The European Union insisted on explaining its fundamental viewpoint on this matter in a last speech, which will also be included in the Conference’s report.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the strategies are concerned, the States are urged to draft a policy and action plan to fight racism, and to implement the Durban action programme. They are also urged to continue to cooperate in a statutory international framework, especially with the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights which is responsible for the follow-up of the implementation of the texts that were adopted in Durban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> I think I can also safely say that the political scope of the compromise achieved on the causes and origins of racism is another important successful result of the Durban Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Like you, I have read some of the comments. I certainly do not want to start a controversial debate on this subject, but I will say, on the subject of the forgiveness and excuses which those who negotiated at Durban seem to have been accused of – I was there and I know I had quite a struggle to obtain this text – that of course people of our generation, like those of the previous generation, are not and were not involved in what was all too often misguided colonisation, or in slavery, but I would ask those people the following question. How can we be satisfied with such a banal, factual observation as that, at the same time refusing, by default, to give justice to those people who, even today, still bear the badly healed scars of colonisation and slavery? I should like to reply to what I have been reading in the press by saying that we are not engaged, here, in sanctimoniously and naively cultivating a sentiment of injustice. On the contrary, we have to recognise, on behalf of our forebears, that the evil deeds that were committed were morally debatable, if not downright reprehensible. We must also tell the victims, past and present, that we know that our history has not always been glorious and that by admitting as much, obviously on behalf of others, we are showing our intention of recognising their right to extenuating circumstances and, having said that, we must propose a true partnership, based on mutual respect, and far removed from the humiliating paternalism and miserly gestures of a self-satisfied and satiated lady of the manor.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like, for a moment, to come back to the result. I believe that the result obtained at Durban opens up positive prospects for the continuation of the dialogue between North and South. The European Union has recognised and condemned the immense suffering caused by past and present forms of slavery and trafficking, wherever they took or take place, as well as the most blameworthy aspects of colonialism. It has recognised that slavery and trafficking were crimes against humanity and should always have been crimes against humanity. Durban was therefore an opportunity to look our common past in the face. Some people saw that as an act of regret, others as an act of remorse, and still others as an act of excuse. The important thing, it seems to me, is, above all else, the willingness to close the darkest chapters of our common history so as to be able to construct a new relationship, based on mutual respect, solidarity and partnership. An appeal has been launched so that more funds can be authorised for initiatives taken by developing countries, in particular the new African initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another element which I would not like to pass over in silence. In the final analysis, Durban was a success because, throughout this difficult negotiating process, the Member States of the European Union remained united. Intensive coordination was implemented with the support of the Council Secretariat and the Associated States were kept constantly informed. It was this close cooperation which enabled the Presidency, duly mandated by its European partners, to negotiate delicate compromises with the representatives of the geographical groups concerned, and with the President and Secretary-General of the Conference, Mrs Zuma and Mrs Robinson respectively.</p>
<p class="contents">Regular coordination with the Western Group has also borne fruit. The European Union and its external and common security policy have emerged strengthened from the Durban Conference. Durban was the proof that the European Union is capable of speaking with a single voice on the difficult question – but one that is vital to the future of humanity – of the fight against racism and for respect for human dignity. The European Union asserted itself as an incorruptible negotiating partner and mediator. It presented an image of unity and consistency, and it supported the use of firmness, depending on the circumstances. As a result, its credibility was reinforced, as was its position at international level. The proof of this lies in the extreme flexibility and spirit of openness that the European Union showed in the discussions on the Middle East. The burden of those negotiations really did rest mainly on the European Union following the departure of the United States and Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">The re-launching of the Middle East peace process is one of the European Union’s priorities. However, it believed that the Durban Conference, based as it was on the fight against racism, was not the appropriate forum for dealing with that question Since, however, the Arab and Moslem countries were insistent that the issue should be discussed at Durban, the European Union agreed to take an active role in formulating a draft consensus which was presented by the South African Presidency. In that draft, the European Union was able to retain the principles which it believed to be essential, namely a balanced text with a strong call for negotiations to be resumed and for violence to be brought to an end, while at the same time expressing concern about the increase in anti-Semitism and Islamophobia in the world. A reference to the Holocaust was retained, whereas the equation ‘Zionism equals racism’ disappeared, as these were among the conditions and prerequisites.</p>
<p class="contents">That was what was achieved at Durban. We must now look to the future and put into practice those commitments to which we universally subscribed in South Africa. I must emphasise that everyone should be informed of the positive coverage of this conference. Each of us, and Member States in particular, must now redouble our efforts so as to ensure that we make the most of the exemplary success achieved by the European Union at the Durban Conference. I believe, therefore, that we can be reasonably satisfied with the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">I would simply like to say that you get an even better idea of how successful the conference was if you imagine for a moment what it would have represented, in terms of a message or a negative signal, if Durban had not been a success. I believe that in the context that we are experiencing now, that would certainly not have helped. I think, therefore, that we did our duty, we did exactly what we ought to have done, it seems to me, in extremely difficult conditions. I am very pleased to have succeeded, on behalf of the European Union, with the support of the Commission, with the support of the Council, and with the support of the fifteen Member States, but also – which is very important – with the support of the thirteen candidate countries, to have succeeded, in fact, in saving this conference. If we had not succeeded in saving this conference, I believe it would have had relatively damaging consequences in the longer term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must start by congratulating the Belgian Presidency and because, after all, they do all have names, by offering my special congratulations to the deputy prime minister, Mr Michel, who took centre stage at the Conference and managed to maintain internal cohesion between the Member States throughout and, at the same time, to shoulder the main burden of negotiations at global level.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to thank the European Parliament and the mission for their extremely important contribution to the Conference and for the important part which they played throughout the negotiations and to say that the Commission is satisfied with its contribution and its efforts to support the presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to explain to Parliament and to apologise for being unable to appear in person one and three days before the Conference but health problems at home made it impossible for me to travel.</p>
<p class="contents">The Conference was exciting and difficult, with a heavy workload. The early departure of the United States left the European Union in the position of main speaker and basically left it to shoulder the main burden of the negotiations. I think that the European Union's profile at this Conference was upgraded to a global profile, given that it managed, in a totally hostile environment, to bring important negotiations to a conclusion while maintaining cohesion between the Member States and maintaining excellent relations and cooperation with the candidate countries. Of course, we see this Conference as a success, especially if you compare it with previous attempts in 1978 and 1983. A global message was sent out and specific, globally agreed proposals were tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">One comment which could be made is that, throughout consultations over the eight days of the Conference, the wrong agenda prevailed. The main aim of the Conference was to find a modern definition for racism and to decide on measures to combat it at worldwide level and that would have been a huge success by helping us to deal with the problems of racism today. These two issues were way down, if not off the bottom of the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, the issues which dominated were the Middle East and past wrongdoings. Of course, we cannot forget the past. We need a thorough knowledge of the past if we are to learn from it and avoid repeating it. However, when it poisons relations, cooperation, agreement and future progress, then it really is an enormous obstacle. A hostile climate prevailed at the Conference, both at government level and at the level of non-government organisations. And it must be said, texts appeared couched in terms of hatred which do absolutely nothing to foster reconciliation, build bridges between nations or build a bridge between the future and the past and should be avoided at all costs, especially at international conferences attended by every country in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to refer briefly to the question of non-governmental organisations. The European Commission has consistently supported the participation of non-governmental organisations at the Conference. We value their help in formulating and applying policy. A large sum of money, EUR 3.7 million to be precise, has been earmarked to support the United Nations and, more specifically, the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, in order to help fund the participation of non-governmental organisations, especially from countries which cannot meet their expenses. We have to admit that there is some scepticism as to what their participation achieved and, I think, there was some disappointment about the final communiqué, the final declaration by the forum of non-governmental organisations which Mary Robinson refused to present because it contained inflammatory remarks.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is important not to put all our eggs in one basket. I have to say that the main, important non-governmental organisations working on racism, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and many other non-governmental organisations failed to agree and publicly fell out in an exchange of inflammatory and awkward remarks. Because, unfortunately, the forum was overpowered by very specific and special issues. I already understand that certain Member States are re-examining how funding is provided and, of course, the Commission intends to undertake a similar re-examination.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, despite the fact that numerous countries, for reasons best known to themselves, were unable to make an in-depth and positive contribution to the Durban Conference, we have to say that an agreement was reached which lays the foundations for further cooperation at global level. It sends out a clear message, as the Minister explained, about combating racism at worldwide level and, of course, every country made a commitment to national action plans, national action plans on legislation, the bases of political parties, education, employment and social and cultural life.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we must not rest on our laurels. Recent events after 11 September have shown how easily and often how thoughtlessly racism and xenophobia can be revived. If we learned anything from Durban, it was that we must avoid stigmatising groups, nationalities, societies or religious minorities. We cannot ascribe collective crimes to collective people, but we can condemn specific political or other leaders responsible for political mistakes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will continue to put its efforts into combating racism by cooperating with the Member States and by keeping its eye on a very ambitious agenda; that means all Member States implementing and incorporating the package against discrimination decided last year by 2003, it means implementing the special programme against discrimination, which is already under way, and it means mobilising and guaranteeing the efficient involvement in this issue of the Racism and Xenophobia Monitoring Centre in Vienna. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cornillet (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, there are many people who actually wondered about the usefulness of the Durban Conference. Yet the international community must exist, and it must come together to discuss the issues, even if such discussions sometimes reveal contradictory interests, and I do not believe that walking out is necessarily a solution. At least the Durban Conference had the advantage of bringing together the international community on an issue which is undeniably a subject of common concern to all countries, because racism is a scourge of worldwide proportions, and no country is free from racism or discrimination in one form or another. This conference therefore provided an opportunity to take stock, to make a diagnosis, and what would be the point of such a diagnosis, if there were no treatment?</p>
<p class="contents">What could we expect from the Durban Conference? I do not yet know, Mr Michel, whether it will constitute a success in the long term. What we do know is how it failed, in other words the fact that there was no final declaration, no confirmation of a worldwide willingness to combat racism and to find adequate means of doing so. The objective of the Durban Conference was to compile a whole series of worldwide instruments, to draw up a road map, to work out new strategies for combating racism, and action programmes – which you, Minister, have described – which states can exploit, subject to the subsidiarity which is the key to the issue of combating racism and discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">What lessons can we learn from this? It seems to me that we have been able to avoid falling into three traps.</p>
<p class="contents">The first, which you have already mentioned, is the issue of the Middle East. Any reasonable person knows that the problems of the Middle East would never have been solved at Durban. Attempts were made to turn this into a major issue, but I think that this trap was, fortunately, avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">The second trap is the issue of reparations. Some people would have liked reparations to be the main subject of the debate. This was sheer perverseness, if not perversion, because it meant that there was a risk that development aid would be reduced to a form of reparations. As Mr Michel has quite rightly emphasised, we are all aware of the burden of history borne by certain parties. We must work towards solidarity between human beings rather than perpetual culpability, which in financial terms would have to come to an end one day, because any reparations expressed in terms of money would, of course, be finally paid off sooner or later.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the third trap that was avoided was the victim list. Some people wanted a list to be drawn up. In our case that would have included the Roma, Sintis and Dalits. If one draws up a list of victims, of course, there is a risk that the next thing that will be drawn up is a hierarchy of victims, and some may be regarded as being more victims than others, which seems to me to be completely unproductive as far as racism and discrimination are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, therefore, the declaration is acceptable and I would like to thank Mr Michel, officially, for the essential role that he played as mediator, intercessor and – if I can risk a neologism – explainer. As you have emphasised so well, Mr Michel, Europe was able to make its full influence felt – and I do not believe that it did so only after the departure of the United States – because you showed great personal commitment, and because Europe consisted not only of fifteen countries, but of thirteen others as well. In other words a large part of the human race was giving its mind to this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Commissioner has said, some of the NGOs made themselves look ridiculous. This raises the issue of how representative they actually are. Fortunately, essential partners such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch disassociated themselves from the final declaration, but perhaps it will be necessary to sort out the assistance that we are able to give to the NGOs, many of which, over there, have lost all sense of responsibility to say the least.</p>
<p class="contents">We are very mindful, Minister, of the practical side. The European Union is perhaps not at the bottom of the league table when it comes to combating racism and discrimination, but there is still a great deal to be done. Let us therefore exploit those 225 articles to find means of action that we can put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and I should like to end on this point, I would simply draw attention to the inadequacy of our Parliament’s representation. This point will feature in the joint resolution. Briefly, the European Union is represented by the President-in-Office of the Council. The European Community is represented, as an observer, by both the Commission and Parliament. That is undoubtedly something to think about if we want the European Parliament to play a better role at international conferences, a role other than that of joint observer together with the Commission. Anyway, this point raises the issue of the renegotiation of the Institutional Agreement of 5 July 2000. You will find this proposal again in the joint resolution which will very shortly be put to the vote in this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moraes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, at the heart of my political group's approach to the Durban conference is a renewed determination to tackle racism and to discover what was positive about this conference. I say renewed because racism in its many forms has reared its head again, with the tragic events in New York and Washington. We have now a danger that a renewed wave of Islamophobia and anti-Semitism will come if we do not tackle racism and its root causes.</p>
<p class="contents">That illustrated the tragedy of this conference, because I felt I attended two conferences. One was a historic conference where delegations, like our own European Union delegation, were determined to register that racism is a major human rights issue. We were determined to define for the first time racism in its many international forms, whether caste, a contemporary slavery, or whether discrimination against minorities within our own European Union and indeed the candidate countries. We were determined to do something about racism, to show that with Article 13 we in the European Union had something to say to the rest of the world about how we were approaching our own problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet there was a second conference that I attended, full of confusion, of individual national agendas, a determination not to define racism in different countries because of an embarrassment as to what racism represented in those countries. The confusion arose over the much misunderstood issue of reparations, and indeed the very destructive issue of Zionism and the problems in the Middle East, overshadowed our conference.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to be determined that the first conference, with the ideals we as a delegation defined for it, are renewed in this House today. That requires a united front. It requires us not to just say that Durban was chaotic, therefore we will leave it that way for history. Instead, we as a European Union united, the Commission, the Belgian Presidency – which did an excellent job – those who attended the conference and all of us within this House who want to tackle racism must unite to go back to the original agenda. That original agenda is one which may embarrass some individual countries, but the action programme is now there. It is there for us to exploit and it is there for us to do something about. The issue is not whether this is a failure or not, it is about whether we can now make it a success by renewed determination within this House to get back to the action programme and make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ludford (ELDR).</span></span>   – I agree with the President-in-Office and the Commissioner that the conference can be described as a qualified success. It did get a bad press – in some respects deservedly – but those who say an international conference on racism was not worth holding are wrong. For the first time in 25 years of trying, international standards were set on the human rights of those vulnerable to racial discrimination. That is something to celebrate. We have a basis on which to build in order to tackle one of the great threats to freedom, justice and security in the world, including Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly, however, the conference did start badly. Firstly, there was the NGO forum. Although many of the forum sessions were very worthwhile and indeed inspiring, the NGO voice was hijacked by the proponents of reparations for slavery and those pursuing the line that Zionism is racism. These themes also dominated or sought to hijack the intergovernmental conference. There was gross anti-Semitic abuse with, for example, cartoons circulating that could have figured in Julius Streicher's publications from the 1930s. The document produced by the NGO forum was so bad that the Secretary-General, Mary Robinson, was unable to recommend it to the governments. Some NGOs, including Amnesty International, had to disassociate themselves from it. This was a great shame, because so many people had travelled to Durban with the serious intent to tell the world of real daily suffering. I particularly remember a woman talking about the problems of internal migrants in China. There were also individuals from many groups who suffer individual persecution such as Roma and Dalits, sometimes known as untouchables.</p>
<p class="contents">Admittedly there was a degree of cynical hypocrisy shown by some states in hiding behind the demonisation of Israel and America, including some African countries with appalling records of ethnic discrimination or human rights violations, and Arab countries unwilling to come clean about their own role in the slave trade. This lack of honesty detracted from the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Opinions can differ about whether the US and Israel did the right thing in staying away. One can say that the position of Israel, at least, was impossible. But certainly the absence of the US pushed the European Union into the front line. One can ask if the EU was fully prepared for that. But, admirably led by Mr Michel, as has been said, it rose to the challenge. I have to give Mr Michel particular credit, even if he is my Liberal political colleague. He came for two days and stayed for a week. He displayed great personal commitment to ensure that the European Union spoke with one voice and a determination – even if sometimes a grim determination – to reach agreement. That success was realised.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Middle East the language agreed was, on the whole, balanced. I also believe personally that the language on slavery struck the right tone in speaking of it now as being a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Clearly reparations were not the right means of redress to talk about. The irony of the situation would be that African Americans would seek to claim, not Africans, who were not subject to slave trading.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one of my disappointments at Durban was that with the spotlight on international diplomacy rather than domestic records, the European Union struggled to find the space to highlight its own growing and increasingly solid record in tackling racism. It is a pity that the EU as such is not represented in the UN system, so that the Commission and Parliament are only observers, although the President-in-Office did a very good job. Clearly it was a pity that the Commissioner was prevented from attending for family reasons. We have to find a way of strengthening the ability of all the European institutions to carry on taking a leading role in international human rights and anti-discrimination work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As the Minister has already said, the objective of this conference was obvious, its scope was complex, and it was necessary in order to construct the future. At the same time, the NGO forum was held. Although the final declaration appears to be excessive, it merely reveals, not a split, but a great deal of diversity among the NGOs. Noticeable, in fact, is the absence of the worldwide NGOs, and the virtual absence of the NGOs involved in immigration in Europe. The only NGOs featured in the declaration are the antiracist NGOs and the solidarity NGOs. On the other hand, the dynamism of the international NGOs is also noticeable, in the way they challenge power, assert principles, or, then again, consolidate a power already in place, hence in some cases their lobbying activities and their nickname of VGOs (Voluntary Government Organisations). Yet within this diversity there is a certain amount of logic, the logic of powerful people. On the one hand there is the logic emanating from the rich, developed countries, the former colonisers, and then there is the logic of the poor countries, the ones who were formerly colonised, where power remains to this day hardly what one could call democratic, yet all too often still enjoys the North’s approval.</p>
<p class="contents">Words have meaning. We have to find the right words to provide a solution. The essential question is that of defining the terminology: slavery, colonialism, racism, genocide, apartheid or military occupation. All these words tell of daily crises, the consequences, moreover, of discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">We find that the final text talks of remorse and regrets, but refuses to give any excuses, and still less to envisage the prospect of reparations, or to reaffirm people’s right to live in peace and equality, without having to have recourse to international law. Finally, it is perhaps regrettable that the final declaration is a minimalist declaration which seeks to satisfy everyone by preserving a certain amount of equilibrium. This declaration not only calls into question the credibility and effectiveness of major international meetings, but also raises the question of direct democracy, because in effect it raises the issue of how representative the limits of participative democracy really are.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make one final reference to this so-called hijacking of the conference. Who was hijacking whom? Why? For what purpose? Remember that the United States did not want to take part in this meeting, and that they often threatened to withdraw. The NGOs’ declaration, however hard it might have been, was a good pretext for avoiding any issues with a bearing on the major interests which it was not thought desirable to offend, as well as the issue of reparations. Several countries, including European countries, were secretly relieved to see the conference focus on the Middle East question, which allowed them to dodge the issue of excuses and to put off dealing with the colonial debt. Do not forget that the rich countries of the North built their prosperity on the negro slave trade and on colonial conquest, and they are not all willing to recognise this fully or to make reparation for their past crimes.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, these issues of discrimination against women, children, homosexuals and migrants, and the continued existence of modern slavery, still affect a number of countries which pursue a policy of repression and refuse to allow themselves to be put in the dock. Those powers are still, all too often, supported, and they too prefer to focus on an issue such as that of the Middle East, where they can make a good impression, rather than be called to account for the human rights situation in their own countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the essential objective of this conference was achieved, but we must now hope that there will be real follow-up action enabling projects, guidelines and action programmes to be set up and put into practice, with a view to preventing and abolishing those situations in which discrimination occurs, thereby ensuring that our fine words are finally translated into reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sylla (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Commissioner, Mr President, the final declaration and action programme adopted in Durban was only possible due to the constructive and essential role played by the European Union. It was also due to the Belgian Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Louis Michel’s diplomacy and ability to draw together many points of view, not to mention his natural gift for reconciling the views of all sides. I sincerely believe that the European Union fulfilled its role perfectly, and we can only welcome the work that has been done. I deplore the fact, however, despite Mrs De Palacio’s apologies, which I accept, that the European Commission was not present. I think that at least one commissioner could have represented you at Durban. I also regret the fact that few industrialised countries were represented, and I believe that many countries interpreted this as a lack of interest in the conference. Had they been there, it might have prevented the American and Israeli delegations from leaving. This is even more of a shame because racist violence and support for the populist and xenophobic vote have increased in Europe over recent years; the Freedom Party (FPÖ) led by Jörg Haider in Austria is only one illustration of this. Other political forces masquerading as NGOs have rushed into the void that has been left. Since, although the overwhelming majority of NGOs played a decisive role in preparing for the conference, and made several proposals formulating demands, I still do not agree with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who tries to play down what happened. This is because a small number of NGOs have been busy trying to equate Zionism with racism, and, even worse, have distributed texts and writings, examples of which I have shown to Mr Michel, in which they patently extolled the merits of the Holocaust. And this is something that Parliament cannot play down. These NGOs, or so-called NGOs, these pseudo-NGOs, were not at Durban to defend the Palestinians, they were not there to defend the anti-racists, they were not even there in favour of peace between Israelis and Palestinians. In my view, it is a positive sign that the final declaration acknowledges the right of Palestinians to their own land and that, at the same time, we reject any equation of Zionists with racists, in the same way as in Durban.</p>
<p class="contents">I must therefore ask, as you did, Commissioner, that we know exactly who these NGOs are, what their purpose is and how they are funded before we hold another conference. The over-representation of some delegations leads me to question how they are funded. But this conference provided, above all, an opportunity to weigh up the importance of some demands. And in relation to this, I strongly challenge what my fellow Members, Mr Cornillet and Baroness Ludford said. I think that acknowledging slavery and the slave trade as crimes against humanity was one of the key aims of the conference, and this is a good thing, and we are merely doing justice by acknowledging that 350 years of deprivation, raids, deportations and humiliations are crimes against humanity. This is the least we could have done at this conference. And I hope that all countries and former colonial powers follow the example of France acknowledge slavery and the slave trade, or are made to acknowledge it by their national parliaments, as a crime against humanity. Personally speaking, I am still dubious about financial reparations, as Mr Michel said, I believe. Especially when we know that there are powerful lobbies of American lawyers hiding behind the African Americans’ legitimate demand. On the contrary, there is in fact a consensus that the continent that suffered most from slavery and colonisation, should be helped with the cancellation of its debt, and by urgently and proactively pursuing policies to combat AIDS and illiteracy. We owe at least this to the African continent. In addition, we have – and Mr Michel pointed this out – valuable counterparts in Africa, who are committed, through the New African Initiative, to good governance. This is, therefore, the time to seize their demand to respond with practical measures and start talking.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I regret that there was no mention of the death penalty in the United States, and part of the reason the United States delegation left was because it did not want to talk about racism in its own country. I regret that discrimination on the ground of sexual orientation was not discussed. I regret that the concept of castes was not discussed, and I regret that the statement has no binding character.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s task is, first of all, to carefully monitor the use of new technologies, such as the Internet, which can be used to incite racial hatred; to speed up the implementation of Article 13; to explain the annihilation of the American Indians, slavery, colonialism and the Holocaust in our textbooks and history books, and also the Sabra and Chatila massacres. I believe that racism and anti-Semitism have one aspect in common with terrorism. On the one hand, there are those who carry out the act itself and, on the other hand, there are those who supply them with the ideological weapons. We must also combat the group made up of the Vlaams Blok, the National Front, the FPÖ and other parties, which supply ideological weapons to those carrying out the act itself and who themselves end up attacking the physical integrity of individuals. We have a responsibility to do this as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I regret the withdrawal of the American delegation. This certainly did not do it a particular service in view of its own record on racism in its own country. This compromise resolution makes it very clear that much more needs to be done, especially in relation to our understanding of other cultures and religions. Islam, I have said many times, has in many ways been demonised, mostly by people who know nothing about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Durban was not a failure, nor was it indeed a great success; but it re-emphasised the imperative to make racism a crime, something I have called for many times in this House. It helped refocus governments' attention on issues of racism, which is based largely on ignorance and a fear of the unknown. European governments have a responsibility to show leadership in the area of racism and xenophobia and politicians and civic leaders are failing to address the issue of racism in their own communities. They are showing cowardice and a lack of courage in dealing with this particular issue. We have a long way to go in the European Union, but at least we have made a reasonable beginning in Durban. Those who participated in Durban deserve great credit.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution refers to action against Islamophobia, which I support without reservation. I want to state yet again, here in this House, that I am a friend of Islam. Muslims around the world have unreservedly condemned these terrorist attacks. We must all ensure that under no circumstances is there any sort of backlash whatsoever against the Muslim communities within our Union. These terrorists acts were not carried out in the name of Islam. They were plainly brutal terrorist acts of a premeditated and determined nature. Just let me remind the House that no religion – or political movement for that matter – is without its fundamentalists. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I feel that the United States and Israeli delegations did well to withdraw from the work of the Conference, just as I feel that you did well, President-in-Office of the Council, to stay on to achieve a result, for, in actual fact, the two things are not incompatible.</p>
<p class="contents">The choice made by Israel and the United States served to show the world public what was in danger of happening, that a group of countries, mostly non-democratic with total contempt for their own people, was attempting to exploit the Conference in order to take sides in international politics.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why I support most of what has been asserted by my fellow Members, namely that, in present times, the most dangerous and widespread form of racism in the Member States of the European Union and elsewhere is the conviction that democracy and the rule of law are institutions which are only beneficial for Europe, the West and the United States, and not for some of the other communities in our world, and that they must not be exported and strictly respected in other countries as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The image of dictatorships which oppress their own people, their own race and their own flesh and blood, of dictators and their representatives who have the gall to preach antiracist sermons at the United Nations, is an effective illustration of the obstacles facing the international community.</p>
<p class="contents">None of this can be tolerated, and I feel that the decision taken by the United States and Israeli delegations and the determination of Mr Michel, in particular, and the Council as a whole as well, have served to make this very clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end by associating myself with those who are calling for a detailed inquiry at this juncture into where, within the non-governmental organisations, responsibility for what happened lies – clearly, as always, we must avoid putting everything under the same umbrella – for there is no doubt that responsibility does lie somewhere and it must be ascertained where, not least in view of the generosity displayed by the European Union and the European Commission towards non-governmental organisations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I cannot agree with the optimistic view expounded by Mr Michel, though I recognise willingly the very important role played by him. I was in Durban on that special occasion, and so I can give evidence to this House of a very insidious threat to indigenous peoples running through the provisional agenda of the Durban Summit, paragraph 27 of which states: "The use of the term 'indigenous people' in the World Conference against Racism... cannot be construed as having any implications as to rights under international law". Through that paragraph the United Nations Summit tried to exclude all these peoples from the right to self-determination recognised by the United Nations itself and international covenants. In response to such inadmissible discrimination and intolerance, the NGO forum in Durban denounced very strongly the new expression of neo-colonialists that will, in the long run, provoke the decimation of the cultures and civilisations of these vulnerable peoples. This insidious action was prepared at the Conference against Racism with a view to the future. It looks to the future, not to the past.</p>
<p class="contents">As the NGO final declaration clearly suggests, structural racism in the past, current manifestations of neo-colonialism and the denial of the fundamental right to self-determination lie at the root of indigenous suffering. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, this is partly due to poor preparation. Diplomats and officials should have made more of an effort to reach consensus before the Conference. That would have saved the world community a great deal of money, time and embarrassing moments. Particularly unfortunate was the fact that a number of delegations ran off, for however well-founded their reasons may have been, those who run away are always in the wrong. Against this background, it was all the more surprising that, despite the obstinacy of Louis Michel, for that is how we have all come to know him in Belgium, and now also in the rest of the world, a sound final declaration was obtained after all.</p>
<p class="contents">This final declaration contains a number of important provisions which, if applied, could drastically change the lives of hundreds of thousands, even millions of people. Governments are encouraged to allow minorities to speak their own language, acknowledge their own culture and profess their own religion, to stand up to police services who display racist behaviour and are also encouraged to adjust their legal systems so that they do not discriminate against certain groups. Roma and gypsy children must be given the same education as other children. In the field of migration policy, race discrimination must be banished. I also welcome the sound and balanced provisions on the Middle East, which emphasise the right to an independent State for the Palestinians as well as Israel’s safety. And finally, two centuries after the events, Europe has apologised for the slave trade. After all, we should not forget that at least ten million Africans were transported to America in what is known as forced migration on the largest-scale in the history of mankind. Millions more lost their lives during the slave hunt or one of the infamous cargo ships.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements Commissioner Bolkestein made in a Dutch newspaper last weekend are therefore completely misplaced. ‘I am not satisfied with the excuses of the UN Conference in Durban.’ He said: ‘I myself have never had a slave, so why should I apologise?’ That kind of statement bears witness to a Western arrogance which overlooks the fact that American prosperity is partly built on the labour of slaves, and European prosperity is partly built on the raw materials from former colonies.</p>
<p class="contents">Can this serve as an excuse for governments in developing countries to shirk their responsibility and shift all the blame to the past? No, certainly not. But rather than giving other people lessons in civilisation, we should have the intellectual integrity to describe this chapter in our history as it was: A crime against humanity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are witnessing armed conflicts which originate in and are sustained by racial or ethnic conflicts and we are astonished to hear statements whose content and origin are unacceptable, on the superiority of certain civilisations over others.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council of Ministers, Mr Louis Michel, in particular, on his efforts which led to the final success of the Durban Conference, in which I participated on behalf of this Parliament. His actions clearly demonstrated the European Union’s firm position in relation to racism and xenophobic attitudes.</p>
<p class="contents">Without ignoring the social, political and economic problems which lead to racial discrimination in Europe, I would like to focus on one aspect – the development perspective – which has been somewhat forgotten in the stagnation of recent events and also during the Conference, in relation to the Middle East conflict and the seriousness of the events taking place there, and to the recognition of the suffering caused by Europe’s history and the perversity of slavery and slave trading, the practice of which we today see as a crime against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The majority of ethnic conflicts which involve thousands of victims and regrettable human situations take place in developing countries, mainly in Africa. I therefore believe that the success of this Conference will depend on whether we are today capable of realising everything that was contained in its final declaration.</p>
<p class="contents">In this resolution, we ask the Commission for financial support for the administrations of the developing countries for the implementation of national action plans to eliminate all kinds of discrimination, as was agreed at Durban. Forums and observatories must be created, observatories in Africa, provincial observatories, regional observatories.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ask for support for the United Nations so that it can carry out the monitoring of the results of Durban, so that the fight against racism may remain on the international agenda until it is eradicated.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we must continue working so that the contents of the declaration may be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, the United States should not have abandoned the Conference, but it was not the first time that they have abandoned it, since they had abandoned it on other occasions; this was therefore not important. The important thing is that we in the European Parliament are able to clearly repeat our message with one voice, to journalists, to the media, against racism and in favour of equality and integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But great efforts do not necessarily lead to great results. A lack of effort, however, can lead to disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I should like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council for his efforts in Durban. Sometimes, it seems as if our Commissioners are looking at a different Conference from the one Mr Bolkestein is talking about, when he states that such a conference promotes a sense of victimisation in people who already have the feeling of being victims. That is regrettable, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Diamantopoulou, you state that there was actually a hostile atmosphere at that Conference. It is all the more important then that we are very aware of the fact that we always carry a level of latent racism and latent hostility around with us, and that we are very careful that people keep track of their sense of identity – and I know what I am talking about, for that is a very important theme in our groups.</p>
<p class="contents">From the moment that identity leads to a sense of more worth than, and underestimation, of others, and that that sense is instilled in an entire group and transferred across to other groups, ethnic and racist tension ensues, which can lead to major conflicts. It is unfortunate, but we cannot say that that is not true for Europe. This is borne out by the success of racist parties in some of our countries, the conflicts in the Balkans, or the tension in the candidate countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We must employ a great deal of patience and determination to make a difference. Durban may be a start. It was certainly not the end, for the bulk of the work will need to be done in our own communities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I find that this discussion, in some respects, looks too little to the future and considers too few definite and preventative measures to combat racism so that, if possible, it does not even come into being. I would like to call at this point for the European Union itself to take the lead by good example, and I wish now to refer to two areas of current significance in which we can do something tangible, namely asylum policy and immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we succeed in what we have set ourselves, that is, in implementing a unified asylum policy with minimum standards and rapid and reliable decision-making, we will no longer have the situation that faces us now, with asylum seekers waiting for years in ghettos, constrained to work outside the law and becoming marginalised. Rapid decisions lead to help being made available quickly and to recognised refugees being speedily integrated; it prevents the marginalisation that at present occurs. This would amount to the prevention of racism!</p>
<p class="contents">I seek progress in immigration policy as well. If Member States, as far as they are able and presupposing that work, accommodation and educational opportunities are available, accept citizens from outside States and offer help with integration, then that is another step taken against exclusion and discrimination and in favour of integration, and I believe we should grasp these practical tools in order to be really successful in preventing racism and discrimination. This is an opportunity for our European Union.</p>

Arab States attempted to impute racism to Israel, with the intention of making the Arab world out to be victims of Israeli racism, which was then to be condemned by the conference. This was a perfidious strategy. They attempted to make use of this important conference for their own purposes. Like the conference as a whole, any attempt to seriously get to grips with this strategy was sunk by the terrible events on 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">We now have a situation in which the entire Arab world is in danger of itself being pilloried in a racist way. All people of Arab origin or from an Islamic cultural background are in danger of having the deeds of a small terrorist group laid at their door. There are, unfortunately, already examples of how this can happen openly and violently. It can also, however, happen surreptitiously through concealed mistrust. Either way, it is a creeping venom seeping into our open society and becoming a burden on it.</p>
<p class="contents">This would represent a victory for the terrorists. So let us not allow it to happen! Let us not follow the bad example that cast a pall over the Durban Conference. We Members of Europe's Parliament, above all people, must be wary of rashly pigeonholing people by nationality and religion. Let us be an example. Let us continue to be open and tolerant. But the terrorists must be in no doubt: they will be pursued with rigour, with no regard to race and religion. We here can do something against racism. Let us act accordingly and give an example. That will be worth more than all the conferences in the world, something that will be demonstrated when we take this debate to its post-Durban conclusion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The action plan adopted on 8 September in Durban is an important message and a contribution to creating awareness in the fight against racism and xenophobia. The conference's eventual agreement on a joint declaration is to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although many, but not all, NGO's and also many States strenuously attempted to convert the Conference into a unilateral forum of condemnation of Israel and to make the issue of slavery and colonialism an opportunity for demanding compensation payments, it can be counted a success that the Final Document did not take up extreme positions of this sort and that it came into being at all.</p>
<p class="contents">With hindsight, however, we must ask ourselves whether the European Union's generous support for the NGOs, which I consider justified in principle and which amounted to EUR 3.7 million, always found its way to the right destinations, all the more so as agitprop arguments to the effect that, for example, Zionism is equivalent to racism, are very much part of the political vocabulary of many States, Syria being one example.</p>
<p class="contents">The biggest terrorist attack to date against the civilised world took place three days after the Durban Conference. None other than President Mubarak of Egypt has pointed out that human rights issues are often misused by terrorist organisations in order to build up their international networks. Mark well, though, that human rights and the fight against racial discrimination and xenophobia are indivisible and of global significance. Nobody is immune, as demonstrated by the ethnic conflicts in the Balkans and the most recent tragic events in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The Durban Action Plan is an important document for every State, but also for the European Union as a whole, which bears great responsibility in this respect, above all in the framework of the United Nations.

Unfortunately, the global coalition against terrorism appears to exist alongside a xenophobic revival, as Mrs Diamantopoulou said earlier, and a tendency to demonise whole groups of people, mainly Muslims and Arabs. According to the international press, the majority of the public in Holland, 62% to be precise, in a country with a long tradition of democracy, considers that the terrorist attacks in New York and Washington will seriously impede the social integration of Muslims in Holland. At the same time, there is support in Germany for reviewing the legislative framework governing religious organisations. A few days ago in Britain, a nineteen-year-old Muslim girl and a taxi driver were the victims of an unprovoked attack. During this morning’s debate on asylum and immigration, several members in the House expressed anti-Islamic views.</p>
<p class="contents">These developments are most worrying. Europe’s experiences from the horrendous wars of the twentieth century highlight the danger to peace and democracy and to human dignity of racism, xenophobia and nationalism. In the light of recent events, the European Union and the Member States need to strengthen their legal mechanisms for fighting racism and to take initiatives at global level to reduce the gap between countries and to ostracise violence as a means of resolving differences. Fighting terrorism and dispensing justice should never call our democratic achievements and respect for fundamental freedoms and human rights into question.</p>

Nobody wants to be accused of racism; it is one of those strong and highly-charged words which can easily be used not only to struggle against injustice but also to attack and to brand people.</p>
<p class="contents">The shadow declaration which preceded the NGO Conference on Racism, in which Israel was accused of racism – without any simultaneous condemnation of anti-semitism – created a distorted starting point for the UN conference. We Members of the European Parliament, too, have seen with our own eyes how anti-semitism appears in the form of naked racism in Palestinian textbooks. The tone of debate was unfair to Israel when account is taken of its past and the obvious desire of hostile States to deny Israel's very right to exist. I certainly do not deny the problems of the Palestinians; these need to be rectified. But no solution will be generated by obfuscating facts in one way or the other.</p>
<p class="contents">It is tragicomic that, while condemning discrimination, one is guilty of that very thing oneself. This unfairness unfortunately harmed the credibility of the NGOs and damaged the prestige of the Conference on Racism. As a friend of the civic society and of NGOs I particularly regret this: by its lack of consideration, this body has weakened its own credibility and future operating prospects. I very much appreciate the way in which the most respected human rights organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch immediately dissociated themselves from the text of the NGO conference. Similarly, I wish to thank the representative of the presiding State, Belgium, whose intervention on behalf of the EU justifiably stressed that the conflict in the Middle East is a political one and should not be treated in a conference on racism at all.</p>
<p class="contents">What, then, should have been discussed? What did all this political talk crowd out? According to Amnesty International, many critical matters such as the treatment of refugees, human trafficking, persecution based on the caste system, and the rights of gypsies threatened to remain unnoticed. And, unfortunately, this is what happened. The Indian untouchables, for example, made strong efforts to bring up their own plight in the NGO forum on racism. Discrimination against untouchables is, according to them, a hidden form of apartheid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The twentieth century bore witness to the most horrendous crimes committed in the name of racist doctrines which, we should bear in mind, took place in Europe, whose civilisation was the birthplace of the great declarations on rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Durban Conference, however, was much more than an exercise in the duty of remembrance. Durban reminded us that the modern world has proved itself incapable of eradicating racism and xenophobia from its societies and these, even in Europe, continue to create victims and underlie violent conflicts. Unfortunately, some people have succumbed to the Manichean philosophy, lacking in any historical rigour, that gives Europe a disproportionate and over-simplified responsibility for all the evils and oppression associated with racism, such as the use of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe does not reject its history, neither the enlightened times nor its darker moments, but nor must it allow it to be crassly manipulated. Europe must not allow its history to become a mere settling of accounts, with the past being placed in the dock in order to exonerate the present time and conceal modern responsibilities for the persistence of the abject and anachronistic phenomenon of slavery and, more generally, of the systematic violation of fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Judging history with the eyes of the present is a pernicious exercise in populism that simplifies the complex and, consequently, offends the truth. Manicheism seeks to segregate fanaticism and use the whole gamut of crusades that interpret history as an endless struggle between Good and Evil. A fanatic, by definition, has no interlocutors, only enemies. History is not merely the balancing of criminal offences and civil compensation laid down in current legislation. We reject this pointless exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s political responsibility for affirming the universal values inherent to human dignity is both domestic and international because it is inherent to the most intimate raison d’être of our common project. Our collective European responsibility is expressed in the unreserved confirmation of our place in the front line of combat, by the universal affirmation of human rights and rights protecting against racism and xenophobia and in the determination to pursue and extend its constructive role on the international stage, by liberating humanity from all discrimination based on hatred, prejudice and ignorance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I agree to an extent, as Mr Van Hecke said, I agree to an extent with him in believing we must ensure that we prepare very thoroughly for a conference of this kind. I think that, essentially, we have, to a certain degree, paid a heavy price for the fact that a number of shortfalls were perceived in the preparations for this conference. I believe, to use a term that you are familiar with, that there were still far too many ‘leftovers’ at Durban, which obviously made the task at hand much more complicated. I therefore think that this preparation is obviously extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">My second comment in relation to this type of conference: I am not sure whether to want to draw up a document that provides a comprehensive list of every situation would not be a mistake, and whether or not, at the end of the day, this would adversely affect the substance of the final document. By this I mean that, if we had a more concise text, with a specific number of principles that can be generally applied, I feel that we would probably be able to produce a stronger text. And we can even question whether or not the European Union could perhaps at some point contemplate doing this, in other words, glean from the Durban Conference a basic framework, which would facilitate the roll-out of the Durban achievements in each Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard many people ask the question, ‘So, that was Durban – what comes next?’ Ladies and gentlemen, I must tell you that what happens next depends in the main on the Member States. I believe that it was Mrs Boumediene-Thiery who said that if a State wants to apologise, present or express remorse or regret, at the end of the day, it is up to that State to know how far it can go.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I think that each State can very easily put the finishing touches to or devise its own specific action programme to combat racism, based on what was done at Durban, drawing its inspiration from these principles and from what was agreed at Durban. I also listened earlier to the Commissioner very clearly saying that the Commission was also planning to take some very specific measures. I think that the Commission has already been working on this matter for some time. I therefore feel that there will be a follow-up, that there will be another conference after Durban if that is what we want. In fact, this comes down to the usual question of political will.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I would also like to take advantage of this opportunity to thank all the speakers who have expressed their appreciation of my work, which is much too generous. I believe that I had the support of some extremely competent people from the Commission, Council, and of course from my own delegation. I was also able to count on all those representing the various European countries. I feel that it was logical to do the work that we did. I think that it was perfectly natural.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to perhaps respond to a number of comments about what is lacking in the documents. Yes, they naturally lack a number of points. For example, why is there no mention at all of the caste system in the documents adopted at Durban? This is a particularly important subject for the European Union, I am aware of this, and what is more, I share this concern. As you know, the European Union is concerned about situations involving discrimination throughout the world; therefore it was natural that we also express this concern. We closely followed developments regarding this problem and we supported a paragraph put forward by Switzerland, discussing this problem. The text makes references to discrimination based on ancestry and occupation, which clearly describes types of discrimination, the helpless victims of which live in several countries around the world. Unfortunately, despite all the efforts of the European Union and other countries, particularly South America, it was not possible to reach an agreement with India on this paragraph. Since this conference was based on consensus, as you know, the text was therefore withdrawn, and this is something I regret. However, we must also remain realistic and realise that we cannot achieve everything.</p>
<p class="contents">One speaker quite rightly mentioned the problem of the death penalty. This is a subject that is of particular personal concern to me. As you know, the abolition of the death penalty is one of the European Union’s priorities. I believe that we are right to reiterate this, and we are endeavouring to use every possible opportunity we are given at international level to push forward the debate on this issue. This was the case at the Durban conference. The European Union supported a paragraph of the action programme referring to racial discrimination in the application of the death penalty. The United States strongly opposed this paragraph during the preparatory process, however, and several countries, particularly those in Asia, also rejected it and, without consensus, it was not possible to retain this text either. I am obviously giving these examples in order to convince you that your concerns were relayed and were expressed in Durban, but unfortunately we could not achieve everything.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to briefly mention the behaviour of the NGOs throughout the conference. As stressed in the documents adopted at Durban, civil society, and NGOs therefore, have an important role to play in the fight against racism. That is why the NGO forum organised prior to the Intergovernmental Conference was particularly important for the European Union. In my view, this is also the reason why the European Commission funded most of those taking part in the forum. Unfortunately, although the forum provoked some interesting debates, I, myself, took part in a debate that I found extremely interesting, the forum followed a process that was, at times, dubious and, at others, totally undemocratic. Extremist organisations seem to have monopolised the discussion, which forced Member States to disregard the conclusions of the forum. Some NGOs, such as Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and FIDH, also disassociated themselves from the forum’s outcome. Moreover, we must admit that the aggressive approach and disgraceful verbal abuse from some NGOs raises the question as to why the European Union and its Member States as well – my own country included – give their unconditional support to these organisations. I think that we must also discuss with the NGOs such issues as their accountability, their representativeness and the confines of their responsibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">As I have already said, I enjoyed a very good relationship with most of the NGOs, and I also acknowledge that they have a specific role to play. Earlier, I heard Mrs Boumediene-Thiery use a rather subversive term – which is a great credit to you, Mrs Boumediene-Thiery – but we could have a fundamental difference of opinions. Personally speaking, as a democratically elected politician, I am not willing to give up my prerogative to assume political responsibility on behalf of the people. I have been elected, the people can therefore reject me, which is what I call responsibility, and I must also be accountable to the people – these are, essentially, my two duties. I am not therefore willing to let this prerogative be taken away from me because, when this system of political responsibility ceases to exist, we would no longer have a democracy, in other words. And that is something that I cannot accept.</p>
<p class="contents">I did want to bring up one particular subject – which Mr Sylla mentioned, I believe – that of discrimination on the basis of sexual preference, which is one of many forms of discrimination. The European Union was in favour of highlighting the many forms of discrimination that affect some classes of people. This concept is certainly present in the texts.</p>
<p class="contents">However, when it came to defining potential sources of these many forms of discrimination, it was not possible to include concepts that the European Union considers to be important, such as discrimination based on sexual orientation. This idea was firmly opposed by some countries, as you suspected. The only aspects that everyone found acceptable were the sources of discrimination listed in the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, in other words, race, colour, sex, language, religion, political belief or any other belief, national or social origin, wealth, birth or any other situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we doing in terms of following up this conference? I shall conclude by reiterating my earlier point that it would be the task of each Member State to follow up the Durban Conference, but it has already been decided that the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights will primarily be responsible for providing this follow-up. Several measures must be implemented, particularly the creation of an anti-discrimination unit within the Office of the High Commissioner and the appointment of five highly-regarded independent experts, who will be responsible for monitoring the implementation of the provisions contained in the action programme and the political declaration. These experts will be appointed by the United Nations Secretary-General.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, I wanted to provide you with this clarification, first of all because I was also keen to congratulate those speakers who made such relevant comments, and I wanted to tell them that their strong convictions have served as a significant driving force and support enabling us to defend the points of view that we expressed on your behalf in Durban. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
