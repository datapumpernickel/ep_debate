The proposal on risks to workers from physical agents was submitted eight years ago and the first part, on noise, was approved this year. So we realise just how difficult, both technically and politically, this type of legislation is. On behalf of the Commission, I should therefore like to congratulate the European Parliament, especially the members of the conciliation committee, on implementing what is, technically and politically, a particularly tricky issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Today's final draft of the directive contains three important achievements. First, it provides greater protection for workers in all sectors of the economy, including sea and air transport, which were not covered under current legislation. Secondly, it recognises that the music and entertainment industry is a special case and grants it a five-year transitional period in which to draw up the codes of conduct needed so that workers and employers can honour their legal obligations and, thirdly, it reduces the limit of exposure from 90 db, which was the limit set in the 1986 directive, to 87 db. Clear progress indeed.</p>
<p class="contents">Approval of this directive completes the second stage of the Commission proposal on risks from physical agents. More work is needed on the remaining two sections of the Commission proposal, namely electromagnetic fields and optical radiation.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I should like to call on the co-legislators to keep up their efforts to complete this legal framework on physical agents, which will give us an integrated framework for protecting workers and which, it must be said, has been lying on the negotiating table for far too long. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Thorning-Schmidt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, I would thank the Commissioner for having eventually dealt with the other physical agents, for in that way I do not have to say that there are still elements we have missing. I am delighted, moreover, that the Commission has consistently placed the issue high on its agenda. We all know that noise is a very serious problem for the working environment. It is an area which has been fully explained in terms of science. We know that, in actual fact, very little noise is needed to cause lasting damage to hearing. We also know that damage to hearing can lead to a reduction in people’s capacity to work or to their possibly not being able to obtain jobs in the labour market ever again. It is, then, a very serious state of affairs we are talking about.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore extremely pleased at our being able, tomorrow, to adopt a directive that gives workers better protection than that which they have at present. It is, then, a better directive with which we are concerned here, first of all because we are now at long last obtaining a proper upper limit on the noise to which workers may be exposed. I should like to have seen a lower limit, which is something I also proposed. I should also like to have seen no account taken of protection from personal protection measures, but what we have here is nonetheless an improvement. The other very positive factor is that the directive systematically attaches importance to the prevention made so much of in the framework directive. Prevention is in terms of action values but, in connection with the directive, we have also attached importance to ensuring the presence of properly functioning hearing protectors.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, a number of other provisions that are to be avoided. We must implement alternative working methods that minimise exposure to noise. We must examine the work tools used in enterprises. Overall, employers’ responsibility for making the directive work is emphasised in the directive itself. The directive provides protection and, in addition, it naturally makes clear the responsibility of employers in individual work situations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a couple of words about the music and entertainment sectors. This is a much discussed subject. We have heard about the British pop industry and about bagpipe players, all of which livened up the debate. It is not that I wish to provoke anyone with whom we have been debating this matter, but I should very much like to repeat that noise is, and remains, purely and simply noise. Irrespective of whether it sounds pleasant or unpleasant, noise can cause very serious damage to hearing. We have only to look to our own experience. We are of course aware of who is most often affected by the illness known as tinnitus. It is, in point of fact, people who have lived with pleasant noise or who have been affected by very pleasant noise, namely music. We know, therefore, that noise <span class="italic">is</span> noise. I am pleased that the directive recognises this so clearly. The directive also acknowledges that the music sector may possibly have difficulty implementing the directive’s provisions within the deadline that has been fixed. It has therefore extended the deadline for implementing the directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also very pleased that we have attached importance to prevention and to getting things to work in practice. We have established a transitional period, but this is also to be used for preparing standards governing the behaviour of the whole of the music and entertainment sectors. I am very satisfied with these standards because they are forward-looking and because they will, in a practical way, help the sector to observe the rules. It is also worth pointing out that those standards of behaviour, or ideas for standards of behaviour, arose in the course of the actual work done by the trialogue, and this is therefore a good example of the way in which cooperation through the trialogue can lead to constructive and positive results. It is not just a question of being combative. Good ideas emerge too, which can lead to constructive compromises, and that is something many of us are pleased about. In that connection, gratitude must also of course be expressed to the Commission for the role it has played and to the Council for its constructive cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I just want to say how pleased I am that we have achieved such a broad compromise and such considerable support here in the Chamber. I now hope that the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party will support this compromise and so confirm what its MEPs normally say in the committee, namely that, when there is scientific data and clear evidence that an issue constitutes a problem for workers, we must also legislate to solve that problem. That is a view I hope the ELDR Group will comply with tomorrow. I look forward to our obtaining a really large majority for a good directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this report lays another important stone in the edifice of health protection for European workers, even if, unfortunately, it will still be far too long before we have common European protection standards. In this particular instance, the first proposal dates back to 1993. The noise directive was certainly no easy task, with the Council and Parliament taking up somewhat different positions. But the whole purpose of the conciliation procedure is to bring about agreement even so. Such agreement is, by its very nature, always a compromise but, as I said, we all have reason to be satisfied with this particular compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">Objectively speaking, noise protection has been increased; the previous speaker explained the technical data and details. But what is important is that it is clear-cut; there are no grey areas or confusing discretionary powers when it comes to implementation. The employer’s obligation to provide hearing protectors, check they are effective and make sure people wear them is new. This sets out employers’ general duty of care without any room for misunderstanding. My group was also concerned that an allowance should be made for the music and entertainment industry when it comes to applying the directive. This is a welcome move for reasons of legal truth and legal clarity because it makes no sense to have to keep turning a blind eye to the fact that the directive applies to orchestra members in theory but is never applied in practice for reasons of comfort or on aesthetic grounds. It is therefore simply more honest to allow a transitional period here and let the individual Member States and social partners decide what they want to do themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I should just like to emphasise that, however pleasing it is on paper, this directive needs to be applied in practice. I am becoming more and more convinced that employee protection directives look very pretty on paper but that nobody actually wants to implement them. That may have something to do with economic developments, but it is precisely during hard times that we need to make sure that directives are implemented. I say that with one eye very firmly on the candidate countries because we must set a very clear example here too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Four subjects were covered by the original physical agents directive, noise was one, but the original 1986 directive on noise was due for revision in 1991. Here we are almost at the end of 2002 before we finally have a revised text.</p>
<p class="contents">Vibration was another subject but it took Council eight years to reach a common position on vibration, and, as we have heard from the Commissioner, we still have the aspects concerning fields and waves and optical radiation to be dealt with. Progress is painfully slow. Yet, all around us in this high-tech era we are increasingly being bombarded by fields and waves from wireless local access networks, from blue tooth devices, from class I lasers and the like. I hope we will see a renewed sense of urgency on the part of Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive is to be welcomed. It will bring about direct improvements. Workers will be exposed less to noise at work. Then their representatives will play a part in risk assessment in the choice of hearing protectors. Our preventative audio-metric testing will be made available under certain circumstances. All of these things and many others are to be welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">For the music and entertainment sector, I think we have established a very good approach. Member States will, as we have heard, draw up a code of conduct in consultation with the social partners and will give practical guidelines on how employers and employees can meet their obligations in that sector. The approach has been very much welcomed by the Musicians Union of Great Britain who acted to coordinate the work of musicians' unions across the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of time, I will make just one other point. Many voices were raised in conciliation about the importance of business impact assessment on proposals of this sort – rigorous impact assessment. I will pose the question here that I posed in Committee: what value should we place upon whether a person in their 40s or 50s can actually hear and communicate with their infant grandchildren? Because that is the part of the hearing spectrum industrial hearing loss often destroys. So, let us have a cost-benefit assessment by all means, but let us take all of the costs and all of the benefits into account, not just narrow financial ones. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lynne (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, we have moved a long way from when the rapporteur brought a report first to the Employment and Social Affairs Committee. I think we still have problems for the entertainment and leisure industry but the rest of industry and the workers will find this directive very easy to live with.</p>
<p class="contents">If the original proposals had gone through, industry across the EU would have been decimated and workers thrown out of work – particularly in the construction industry, cement industry, mining and quite a lot of engineering industry – so thank goodness we have returned to some sort of sensible solution and moved back to the Council position where hearing protection can be taken into account when measuring decibel levels. I am glad we have moved back to the weekly measurement granted by Member States if they so deem necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">But the amendment granting the leisure and entertainment business a five-year delay for implementation while the Commission looked at the best way to regulate this industry, taking into account the special problems faced by the pub and club industry in particular, was unfortunately lost that in conciliation, although, with a code of conduct, it is better than was first proposed. I grant you that. But at the present moment the current noise directive is not being implemented in the pub and club industries, neither in the UK nor in Denmark or in many other Member States. The reason it is not being implemented is because it is not workable.</p>
<p class="contents">My problem is that if we add another layer of bureaucracy for the pub and club industry like this, we will cause tremendous problems. That is why I personally refuse to sign off the conciliation because I believe we could have got more from the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I was on my own apart from one notable exception so I appreciate the vote tomorrow will not make any difference at all to the final outcome. We have, through a lot of hard work, got a better deal for industry and workers alike. We could have got a better deal for the entertainment and leisure sector and I am sorry we did not take that opportunity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I often think – because it is usually the case with employment legislation – that it is all a plot by the Secretariat<span class="italic"> </span>to remind us of the folly of the working time directive, not that we need to be reminded of that particular folly on that particular directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding this one, this conciliated text is in my view a bad compromise on a bad directive. It would have been much better for both parties to have kept their original positions and for the legislation to have fallen. Certainly I voted against it; I was the notable exception referred to by my colleague Liz Lynne. I also voted against it in the conciliation committee for this reason, even though we did manage to dilute many of the dafter amendments during that committee process.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the UK is concerned, existing noise regulations have been well thought through and these tighter regulations at EU level are neither necessary nor appropriate. Mr Hughes mentioned the importance of business impact assessments and that they should be carried out thoroughly. I agree with that. It is significant that there has been no proper regulatory impact assessment at EU level to determine the costs and benefits of the proposed directive. Certainly there was one done by the UK which established that the costs far outweighed the benefits and perhaps that is why the EU decided not to do one. This legislation does not reflect the real world.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming two weeks after Parliament approved the atypical workers directive, where extra costs and red tape could mean the loss of 160 000 temporary worker jobs in the UK alone, this latest directive shows that the EU continues to operate in a time warp when it comes to employment and social legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that during the progress of the legislation through the European Parliament there have been three different ministers back in the UK, which may explain why the UK Government has made such a limp response to it. The UK Conservative response will not be limp. We will stand up for common sense and vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think the conciliation procedure was swift and determined to reach a result, the Council was constructive, and I rather had the impression that the PPE-DE and the Liberals had moved some way towards us. I thought that sense had triumphed!</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, and here I agree with the previous speakers, one aspect must give us cause for concern and that is implementation in the Member States, but not – as Mr Bushill-Matthews said – for technical reasons. I think there is another reason why implementation should give us cause for concern. I heard today about a professional musician working with a famous German orchestra who turned down an interview with us out of fear of reprisals. He was to have described his problems as a professional musician but was too frightened to do so, and I am sure he is not the only case.</p>
<p class="contents">Employee protection, as Mrs Stauner said, is a basic necessity in modern working life, not a superfluous luxury. The directive has added some important aspects in order to give employees in all sectors, from music to industry, the security of knowing they have a right to instruction and information on the risks to which they are exposed and that employers must point these risks out to them. There are several options open to the Member States here, not just passive hearing protection. They can also introduce new working methods and develop new jobs in which noise levels are kept to a minimum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moraes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, as the final member speaking on this issue, I would like to repeat and underline that the directive will, over time, render occupational noise-induced hearing loss and associated conditions diseases of the past. That is an achievement by the rapporteur, compounded by the fact that there were a number of national positions which were very difficult at the outset of this report, as has been said by other members. A huge amount of work went into that position. From the United Kingdom position, we were left with the situation where a number of issues had to be ironed out. We now have a situation where our Government – and I am surprised at Mr Bushill-Matthews' statement on this: we may have had three different ministers involved, but the fact is that the United Kingdom Government – and this is one of the governments most interested in this particular health and safety measure, believes that this strikes a good balance between improved worker protection and the need to avoid excessive and unnecessary regulation. I think it is important not to caricature health and safety measures when a huge amount of work has gone into ironing out those national positions. We heard a lot from Mrs Lynne about the impact on musicians in the entertainment sector. We have all in the United Kingdom heard much said on this. The fact is that those sectors have been satisfied by what could have been a far more difficult directive. The rapporteur is to be congratulated on the progress made. That is why I will be voting in favour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
