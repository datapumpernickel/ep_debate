<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, I wish, first of all, to thank the Council and the Commission for the willingness they have shown today to address an issue of such importance, current relevance and seriousness as the situation in Columbia, which the Committee on Development and Cooperation is monitoring and will continue to monitor with the greatest attention and concern.</p>
<p class="contents">It has become clear that the European Union cannot only not remain indifferent to the current situation in that country, in the same way that it cannot – or rather must not – adopt half-hearted positions on this issue. We are all aware of the situation in Columbia. Indeed, there is no shortage of documentation from the most varied sources attesting to the tragedy affecting Columbia and the real risks of the conflict worsening, with serious danger, moreover, of it spreading to the rest of the region. In this regard, I would emphasise the concerns expressed by representatives at the highest level of various Latin American countries at the meeting held on this issue in Rio de Janeiro, in the middle of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">The crucial factor in the current situation is undoubtedly ‘Plan Columbia’, which was agreed in September 1999 between Presidents Clinton and Pastrana, and it is essential that the Council and the Commission stick to their positions and distance themselves even more vigorously from this agreement. They must do so first of all because of its blatantly military nature, but also because it is not the result of any consultation process. Instead, it has generated widespread opposition both inside and outside the country, because it completely fails to address the grave phenomenon of paramilitary activity and, consequently, because it threatens the very negotiation process that has already been started. Also, because this plan, which concentrates on the elimination of drug production and trafficking (by attacking producers, particularly through the use of chemical and biological fumigation), not only threatens Columbia’s rich biodiversity, but will also exacerbate the tragedy of displaced people, who might even have to become refugees in neighbouring countries.</p>
<p class="contents">We are familiar with the statement by the General Affairs Council of 9 October last year. We obviously agree, in essence, with its proposals and we interpret it as moving away from ‘Plan Colombia’. In fact, we believe this to be the position of the vast majority of Member State governments. It is also true, however, that some are attempting to read a complementarity-based approach into this Council declaration with regard to ‘Plan Colombia’. We therefore consider a clarification of the Community position to be crucial, which will prevent an interpretation of it which we believe is abusive, even if this runs counter to the opinion of any of the Member State governments, particularly from the only one that has publicly given a financial and political commitment to the plan. As a matter of fact, I believe that the European Union, and the European Parliament itself, must not support an initiative that clearly stems from a bilateral agreement between the Colombian Government and the US administration. I feel all the more strongly about this because I do not think it should be the European Union’s task to heal the wounds resulting from the actions of third parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Basically, as we stated in the motion for a resolution adopted by the Committee on Development and Cooperation, and as we have stated in a previous resolution by this Parliament, our understanding is that any action by the European Union must be accompanied by a strategy of its own which does not have a military dimension. This is the attitude that I hope will prevail on the approach of European governments towards the Colombian Government on 30 April in Brussels. Incidentally, it is our view that this European Union strategy should start from the premise that the armed conflict that is affecting Colombia is by no means confined to the drugs problem alone. It actually predates that problem by a long way and is fundamentally rooted in deep-seated, pernicious political, economic and social phenomena in the country. That is why I feel that a reform that guarantees another form of distribution of wealth and, specifically, a different form of land distribution by implementing a process of agricultural reform, is crucial and a matter of priority. In fact, we also feel that the problem of drug production and trafficking requires a global approach on the basis of shared responsibility and international cooperation between the producer countries and the consumer countries, which, in the first instance, involves combating the laundering of money generated by trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union’s strategy must also take account of the crucial importance of putting an end to the actions of the paramilitary groups and the impunity with which they operate, often in conjunction with Colombian military forces. These groups are mainly responsible for the wholesale massacres of communities and even of Europeans working with them.</p>
<p class="contents">By the same token, the European Union cannot brush aside the sense of trauma that pervades Colombia as a result of the persecution and massacre of countless leaders and members of the Patriotic Union, committed immediately after their participation in an electoral process. In short, the European Union must fully commit itself to a genuine peace process, which ‘Plan Columbia’ cannot be taken to be and which it even thwarts. We also need to continue to cooperate with Colombia and consolidate this cooperation, which would require, as a matter of priority, an effective commitment by the Colombian Government to implementing structural reforms and the involvement of communities and their organisations in solving the enormous problems that are affecting and overwhelming the country. I hope that this is also the view of the Commission and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me begin by thanking the honourable Member, Mr Miranda, for putting his question to the Council and, in that way, giving us the opportunity to discuss the important issue of how the European Union can best contribute to peace and mutual understanding in Colombia. Let me also begin by saying that the specific situation in Colombia and what the European Union may be able to do in that connection were matters which the Swedish Presidency had the opportunity to discuss face to face with President Pastrana during his visit to Stockholm last week.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is aware of the serious, multifaceted and interdependent problems faced by Colombia. We believe that an integrated strategy is absolutely essential if it is to be possible to solve these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">On several occasions, the European Union has confirmed its intention, as far as possible and in the most appropriate way, to support the efforts to get a peace process under way in Colombia, founded upon respect for human rights and basic freedoms. In its statement on 19 January of this year, the European Union expressed its deep concern about the fact that the armed conflict in Colombia had become more serious and at the fact that the suffering of the civilian population had increased. The Union is convinced that the conflict can only be solved by means of a negotiated agreement and therefore calls for the peace negotiations to be resumed.</p>
<p class="contents">Since October 1999 when President Pastrana, here in the European Parliament, asked for the EU’s help for his plan for peace, prosperity and a strengthening of state power, the Council has had the opportunity, in response to a number of questions from honourable Members, to repeat the main features of the European Union’s position on Colombia and to inform the European Parliament of the way in which the work on this important matter has developed.</p>
<p class="contents">At its meeting on 9 October of last year, the Council confirmed its political support for the efforts to achieve peace that have been made by the democratically elected bodies in Colombia, as well as its desire to join the international community in actively monitoring the negotiation process – a process which, within the framework of consultation with civil society and with the agreement of all parties involved, should lead to a peace founded upon human rights, humanitarian law and basic freedoms.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the context of a continuation of the current peace efforts, the Council also gave notice of its intention to introduce a practical and independent European programme for socio-economic and institutional aid to the peace process in Colombia – a programme aimed at promoting and safeguarding respect for human rights, humanitarian law and basic freedoms, at improving living conditions for the local population, at encouraging the replacement of crops and the protection of bio-diversity and at supporting the programme of structural reforms in all areas which give succour to the armed conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">At the second meeting with the support group for the peace process in Colombia, held in Bogotá on 24 October last year, the Commission stated that the Community’s support for President Pastrana’s peace efforts would amount to EUR 105 million during the period 2000–2006. Approximately EUR 40 million of these funds would be allocated to economic and social development and the fight against poverty, approximately EUR 30 million to so-called alternative development and EUR 25 million to support for reforms of the judicial system and for the promotion of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also stated that it is going to increase the additional support granted to disaster aid projects through ECHO. The Member States are still studying how much is to be set aside for a European aid package for Colombia, but the majority have already communicated their intentions on this matter. The Commission has undertaken to coordinate the efforts to set up an aid package of this kind.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the fight against drugs – discussed under paragraph 8 of Parliament’s resolution of 7 September of last year, to which the honourable Member refers – the European Union has also emphasised the crucial importance of combating this scourge which directly affects all European states and their citizens. The EU has set up a mechanism for cooperating with Latin American and Caribbean countries on drug issues, a mechanism whose action plan was approved in April 1999 and received considerable political support from Heads of State and Government at the 1999 Rio de Janeiro Summit between the European Union and Latin American and Caribbean countries.</p>
<p class="contents">To facilitate the changeover to other products for export, Colombia is also covered by the Generalised System of Preference, or GSP, and, since 1990, also by the Occasional Extra System of Preference. A number of chemical precursors were signed in 1995 between the European Union and the Andean countries and have now come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has not expressed an opinion on the United States’s contribution to Plan Colombia, a significant part of which is intended to be used in the fight against the drugs trade, because this is an issue affecting bilateral relations between Colombia and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to remind the honourable Member of the guidelines – adopted as part of the orientation debate at the meeting of the General Affairs Council on 22 and 23 January of this year – for reinforced operational coordination between the Community, represented by the Commission, and the Member States in the area of external aid. Hopefully, this will help us in the future to adopt an integrated approach to situations such as that in Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – The EU has offered both political and financial support to the peace initiative of President Pastrana of Colombia. We are well aware of the concerns that the military component of Plan Colombia has created especially among representatives of civil society both in Colombia and in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU reservations about some aspects of Plan Colombia are well known to President Pastrana and to his government. The Commission does not intend to take part in any initiative with a military dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">In terms of the fight against drugs we will continue to subscribe to the global and balanced approach endorsed by the United Nations General Assembly special session on drugs of June 1998. Thus in Bogota last October the EU stressed the need not to put alternative development projects at risk by non-selective operation of illicit crop eradication. Within this context we continue to focus on positive measures such as demand reduction, promoting new crops, offering market opportunities in Europe and strengthening the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">As honourable Members may know, the EU decided last October to establish a European support package for the peace process in Colombia whose overall amounts should be decided at the next donors’ meeting. This package of European support covers contributions both from EU Member States and the EU itself. All EU Member States indicated their willingness to provide financial contributions to this package and the majority of them have already put forward their pledges.</p>
<p class="contents">As the Swedish Presidency just announced, EUR 105 million of programmable aid will be made available by the Commission over the period 2000-2006. These funds will be dedicated to modernising administration, strengthening democracy and the rule of law, respect for human rights, protecting the environment and developing alternative crops. Emphasis will also be put on tackling a series of structural problems in the country and, in particular, political, social and economic reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also continue to provide humanitarian aid to assist the all too many displaced people in Colombia. This non-programmable aid has amounted to EUR 24 million since 1997. This year it is envisaged that about EUR 10 million will be made available for these kinds of interventions.</p>
<p class="contents">These areas of cooperation are also priority areas for the government. The EU intends to make its contribution effective as soon as possible. For this reason a mission including experts supplied by the Commission and the Member States is at this moment in Colombia in order to identify a project in an area called the Magdalena Medio, for which the Commission could earmark around EUR 20 million. In this region, violence is at its highest level and the EU initiative will target the promotion of dialogue between the parties in conflict. This will constitute effective implementation of the concept of a peace laboratory. The conclusions of these experts’ mission should be available by the end of February.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from our financial commitment, Europe is also increasing its political role in the conflict. I shall mention the presence of several Member States in the Group of Friends which secured the meeting area with the National Liberation Army agreed on 26 January as well as the meeting promoted by the presidency with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia in Paris on 15 December.</p>
<p class="contents">One last word about the risk of an extension of the Colombian conflict to neighbouring countries. Many have raised their concerns, notably Ecuador and Brazil. There has been, indeed, an increased flow of refugees crossing the border in the affected areas. For this reason the EU emphasised the need for a regional approach to the drug problem and more specifically to the Colombian conflict. This will be one of the major topics of the next EU-Andean Community meeting on drugs scheduled for the second quarter of this year.

We agree, Commissioner, that violence can only create more violence. That is why the PPE Group takes a positive view, not only of what strictly constitutes the Colombia Plan to put an end to the production and trafficking in drugs, but also of the concerted efforts of President Pastrana to hold dialogue with the guerrilla movement and his proposed strategy to deal with the problem at its roots and attack its causes, because the objectives of this strategy are to create alternatives which will facilitate the economic and social recovery of Colombia, the resolution of the armed conflict with the guerrilla movement, the strengthening of the democratic institutions, social development and finally the fight against drug trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, unless the violence is not brought to an end through dialogue, unless rural workers are offered alternatives which will enable them to lead dignified lives, unless the serious problem of displaced people is resolved, unless human rights are respected, unless the foundations on which the rule of law is based are strengthened and impunity is brought to an end, unless drug trafficking is brought to an end, peace in Colombia will be nothing more than a fantasy.</p>
<p class="contents">It therefore seems to us to be essential – and we are delighted about it – that the European Union should support President Pastrana’s peace efforts in the way that the President-in-Office of the Council has just announced and also in the way that the Commission, through Commissioners Patten and Nielson, had announced previously and which it has just reiterated. Thanks to this aid, we are making a contribution to resolving the situations of social justice and to improving the living conditions of the local population, as well as strengthening the democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It also seems essential to us that FARC’s leaders return to the negotiating table and that the time period for the peace zone be extended beyond the weekend which President Pastrana has just proposed, so that the peace talks may continue and reach a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is also why, since we are determined to find peace and well-being for the people of Colombia, we ask that President Pastrana intensify his fight against the paramilitaries and armed groups which violate human rights and spread pain and death amongst the civil population, and we also ask him to apply the United Nations resolutions on human rights. This is the only way, with the concerted effort of all of us, with a truly intense and decisive fight for peace, that it will be possible for hope to return to the people of Colombia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already passed a series of resolutions in support of the peace process in recent years. We hope for a genuine peace process, based on a consensus amongst the various parties to the conflict and civil society, including NGOs, farmers’ organisations and local communities. That is quite different from a plan amounting to financing fumigation and likely to exclude dialogue with the main players involved in the peace process.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe’s external action in Latin America has proved successful when Europe has conducted its own independent policy, promoting solutions and imbuing its cooperation programmes with its own political values regarding human rights, democracy and social cohesion. It is worth recalling events in Central America leading to the San José dialogue. On that occasion, the European Community as it then was supported a regional solution instead of taking sides in the East-West conflict. The European Union must adopt this distinctive approach and promote it at international level.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, as I understand it, the Council and the Commission are prepared to support an independent autonomous approach and to fight against drugs. However, the fight against drugs goes beyond crop-spraying. Furthermore, collusion with the United States’ military plans is out of the question as far as we are concerned. Crop replacement has to be preceded by a dialogue with the peasant farmers, who must be offered other possibilities for development. A commitment to sustainable development is also called for: we are already aware that fumigation using <span class="italic">Fusarium oxysporum</span> is harmful to the environment. Government cooperation is required to facilitate redistribution of the land so as to guarantee the farmers’ survival and put an end to mass migration. In short, a different plan is needed, one based on negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Community cooperation, we are somewhat concerned that the EUR 105 million of aid planned may not be allocated to specific projects to combat poverty and promote human rights. We should like to receive more details concerning these various funds. In particular, we would like some guarantee that NGOs will cofinance the projects for which the funds are intended and will therefore be involved in their management This would also represent a guarantee for the future of Colombia and of this Plan Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the information available to me at present, there are currently no NGO cooperation programmes cofinanced by the Commission in Colombia. If indeed there are some, I would like details on them. What type of programmes are they? In short, we believe that the European Union must pursue its own policy in Colombia. This policy should involve genuine peace, dialogue, the elimination of poverty and prospects for sustainable development. No other route can lead to peace, especially not unpredictable military moves by the United States. The latter are certainly not acceptable to this House, and after what I have heard today, I trust they are not acceptable to the Council or to the Commission either. I believe it is important to make this clear. If we succeed in drawing up a sound peace plan for Colombia with the European Union acting independently, today will have been a good day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These three problems can only be solved in interrelation to one another. Many Columbians live in dead-end situations. More than half the population earns less than two dollars a day. The inequality is shocking. Three percent of Columbians own 70% of the land.</p>
<p class="contents">Many farmers rely on growing coca and poppy as their only means of existence. Social inequality, violent traditions and the lack of state power give guerrilla fighters and paramilitary units free reign to sustain their unscrupulous acts of terror. Their fight for power is essentially a fight for drugs. Lawlessness reigns supreme, and human rights violations are legion.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the world drugs problem must mainly be tackled at root level, that is to say also in the producing countries themselves. That is why it is essential for farmers in Columbia to be offered a reasonable alternative to producing drugs. This should also be the focal point of the European contribution. In addition, Europe and America must, of course, also open up their markets to alternative products from Columbia.</p>
<p class="contents">A unilateral military approach will not offer any solace as long as the deeper causes are not addressed. So far, the contamination of plantations has resulted in serious environmental damage and horrific disorders in people, as well as in a shift of production. However, we should at the same time not be naïve. We need to realise that a hard-line approach is sometimes required <span class="italic">vis-à-vis</span> the drugs mafia. It is not always possible to win over big-time villains by negotiation alone. Europe should mainly focus on the outcome. The world must be set free from drugs and the Columbian population from poverty and violence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is it the first version which was sent straight to us, in English, from the United States before being submitted to the Colombian Congress or the second version, intended for Europe, which stresses the social aspect but certainly does nothing to conceal the basically military nature of the plan. This programme of aid to the Colombian Government aims to combat drug production and trafficking. How is it going to do this? By providing the Colombian Government with weapons. This military equipment is apparently going to be used to destroy cocaine plantations. You will forgive me if I am somewhat dubious about the use of these weapons in a country which, since 1948, has been devastated by a war sparked off by socio-economic reasons that are valid today, but which is increasingly becoming a war between the military-paramilitary alliance and the people. Exactly who does Plan Colombia see as the opposing forces? Officially, it is the Colombian State combating drug traffickers. In reality, the drug barons are protected by paramilitary groups, who are in turn trained by the Colombian army. These are the groups that are killing peasant farmers, the coca growers, and driving out the people living in areas valued highly by the oil companies. That is without even mentioning the pressure exerted on the supporters of the ‘<span class="italic">Nunca Màs</span>’ project who are fighting to keep the memory of these atrocities alive. On the pretext of combating drugs, a war is being waged against the civilian population,. This plan provides direct support to the murderers, by which I mean the paramilitary groups, that have already killed over 150 people since the start of the year and whose close links with the army are obvious. Moreover, on no account can the European Union sanction the lack of democracy or legitimacy evident at the signing of this agreement between the American and Colombian Governments. The European Union and the Member States should not cooperate with this plan; they should oppose it, as do the NGOs and local social movements. There is no question of sharing the responsibility with America. Responsibility for what? Millions of deaths? Can we accept Plan Colombia? I support the view of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. We shall, therefore, vote in favour of this resolution which, far from recommending arms donations, proposes quite the opposite approach, i.e. to encourage scaling down armed conflict, to fight the association of the military and paramilitary groups, to show respect for those working in defence of human rights and to improve the living conditions of the population in conjunction with social movements, rather than against them. Holding talks is the way to achieve peace, not waging war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as a doctor and teacher of medicine, I can tell you that a branch of epidemiology known as the ‘epidemiology of violence’ has come into being in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has made conflict prevention and the peaceful and negotiated resolution of conflicts a fundamental principle of its international role. Plan Colombia, drawn up between the United States and President Pastrana with no involvement by the Colombian Congress, is diametrically opposed to that principle. Consequently, I returned yesterday from the World Social Forum in Porto Alegre bearing a specific undertaking I am prepared to defend in this House. A group of parliamentarians drawn from Latin America, Europe and other parts of the world gave this undertaking to make it quite clear that we should say no to Plan Colombia and yes to a negotiated and peaceful solution to the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Herein lies the difference between the European Union and others who have intervened. Arguably, the best way to combat drug trafficking is to dismantle the international networks for the distribution and laundering of dirty money. The best solution to violence is to persevere with peaceful efforts to achieve democracy, negotiating with and dismantling the paramilitary networks linked to the army and to the state apparatus. The best solution to poverty and inequality is to push ahead with social reform to ensure rights for all. The opportunity before us is there for all to see. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It might be useful to recall that just a few days after his election victory – which incidentally was the greatest and most significant victory by a Colombian President in recent years – President Pastrana met with the top leadership of the FARC, the largest and most long-standing guerrilla group in the Americas. It was the first time in thirty years of conflict that a President-elect came face to face with the leaders of a guerrilla movement on Colombian soil. Three weeks after his investiture, the leadership of the ELN, the second largest guerrilla group in the country and representatives of civil society reached an agreement in the German town of Mainz. Negotiating tables were set up, and a demilitarised zone the size of Switzerland was established under guerrilla control.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately however, this whole period has been characterised by a conspicuous absence of peace. Furthermore, violence, murders, extortion, kidnaps and sabotage by left and right-wing armed groups have become more widespread than ever.</p>
<p class="contents">Combined with the widespread climate of violence the country is enduring this situation has given rise to considerable scepticism regarding resolution of the conflict. What can the European Union do, faced with such a situation? As stated by the Commission and the Council, the only possible way forward is to support a specific European Union response aimed at promoting the strengthening of institutions, respect for human rights, alternative development, humanitarian aid and social development.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Representative of the Council, let me put it to you: do you really believe that at this critical juncture Colombia can allow itself the luxury of foregoing the aid and resources being assembled thanks to international solidarity? An effort is clearly called for. It is also clear, Mr President, that moderation becomes reprehensible when it shies away from commitment. The European Union cannot and must not enter into any commitment other than a firm commitment to offer strong support for peace.</p>
<p class="contents">For peace to be possible, three conditions must be met: cessation of criminal violence, a return to the negotiating table on the part of the guerrillas – President Pastrana has issued an appeal for them to do so and we hope it will be heeded-, and a firm commitment by the government to ensure that all the players in the peace process – every single one of them – reap the benefits of peace, along with civil society. Mr President, I am convinced that generosity, realism, and bold and imaginative proposals are the way forward. Above all, good will is the key to a solution to the Colombian problem which the European Union is able to endorse, as the Council and Commission representatives have stated here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a barely disguised military strategy, sponsored by the US, whose effect will simply be to escalate the conflict, to aggravate the abuse of human rights and at best displace drug production.</p>
<p class="contents">Three quarters of the US contribution to the package is military assistance; only 6% will focus on human rights and only 4% will be put towards helping displaced people. How anyone can argue that this is a plan that will support the peace process is baffling when only 1% of the US contribution is set aside for this specific purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Plan Colombia was not a product of consultation with civil society at a local, national or international level; it was never approved by the Colombian Congress. It has been the object of opposition in every sector of society, local communities, democratically elected governors, the Catholic Church, non-governmental organisations. Support for it would therefore damage the trust and credibility the EU has earned with its projects and in its relations with local communities.</p>
<p class="contents">As for aerial spraying, what is proposed is no less than the use of biological weapons. The toxic fungus spray used to kill the coca has been found to have caused fever in local people, to kill cattle and fish and it has been shown to attack the immune system of humans with effects up to and including death. Dr Mondragon, giving evidence in this Parliament earlier this month, showed that the fumigation of 22,000 hectares of illegal crops last year in Colombia did not prevent 38,000 hectares of new cultivation because the problem is one of no alternative for the peasant farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome tonight, Mr Danielsson’s statement that European support will be independent. This Parliament must support his efforts with Swedish NGOs behind the scenes to promote the peace process for all parties involved that was started in Costa Rica. I am very glad that he was representing the Council and not Mr Solana, who scuttled out before the start of the debate, and who so badly misrepresented the EU when at the Madrid meeting last July he made a pre-emptive statement in support of Plan Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome Commissioner Nielson’s commitment tonight to have nothing to do with the military strategy. That is what this Parliament calls for, but he should disown the Commission press statement of September last year which expressed support for the plan.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Salafranca says there is confusion. There is no confusion. It is not an expression of bad faith in President Pastrana and his attempts to pursue the peace process to point out at the same time that he has failed so far to disband the paramilitary groups, to end the abuses by the Colombian Army or to offer proper protection to human rights defenders, 25 of whom have lost their lives in the last three years. Mr Salafranca condemns abuses by left-wing and right-wing groups. He is right to do so but we do not give any succour to the guerrillas, whose abuse of human rights we condemn, when we say that over 75% of human rights abuses are caused by the paramilitaries and the army.</p>

Plan Colombia is promoted as a means of combating of drug production and trafficking, but since drug eradication and crop spraying started six years ago, the actual coca plantations have almost trebled, which shows that this is not an effective method. It does not work and it is also an ecological disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the drug wars started in the 80s, violence has increased in a terrible way in Colombia. Seventy-five to eighty per cent of the killings are committed by the paramilitary forces to protect big farmers and oil companies. The Colombian Government pretends that it is trying to combat paramilitarianism but in fact it is turning a blind an eye to it. It knows very well that there are clear links between the paramilitaries and the armed forces. If military equipment is increased in accordance with what Plan Colombia is proposing, it will clearly reach the paramilitaries. It will increase the massacres; it will increase the disappearances; it will increase the violations committed against ordinary innocent people. Any plan which includes a military element is not a solution for Colombia. It just exacerbates the situation. Many Member States have a major problem with the military component and it is very cynical to say that we want to help the social area when clearly this plan is a military plan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On several occasions, including in recent months, we have drawn up resolutions on human rights in Columbia, resolutions adopted in this Chamber. Well then, I would like to take the opportunity afforded by this debate to condemn another incident: since 15 September 2000, three Italian citizens, engineers employed by a company which makes sweet-making machines, have been in the hands of the National Liberation Army. Together with these three Italian citizens, there are three other Europeans and thousands of Colombians. Not only have they been held prisoner for four months, it has not been possible to communicate with them at all. The Italian authorities are doing everything in their power but there is a certain unwillingness, even on the part of the Colombian Government, to undertake serious negotiations with the National Liberation Army in order to reach a solution.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I feel that we must make human rights our priority, and I would therefore like to take this opportunity to ask the President of Parliament to send a letter to the Colombian authorities calling for respect for human rights and urging the government to make every endeavour to ensure, since it says that it is negotiating with the Liberation Army and the other forces, that any agreement reached will, without fail, include the immediate liberation of all the European and Colombian citizens – both Europeans and non-Europeans – who are deprived of their freedom and are prisoners of the militaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not, however, support just any kind of peace process but only one based, in the words of one of the NGOs most closely involved in helping Colombia, on respect for human rights and aimed at genuine sustainable development and social justice for Colombia and the surrounding region.

However, on the other side of the Atlantic they advocate precisely the opposite approach.</p>

There is widespread agreement as to the fact that Plan Colombia and these pronouncedly military components pose a threat to the peace negotiations now under way, and will engender an escalation of the conflict in Colombia after more than three decades of civil war, over 300 000 dead, and when we had hoped that it would be possible to engage in dialogue once President Pastrana took office, and resolve the country’s problems, i.e. the conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">The point has been made repeatedly today that the world drugs problem must be tackled at its roots. Naturally I agree with this, but the problem of the conflict in Colombia must also be tackled at the roots, and Europe cannot afford to make the same mistakes as the USA, by believing that the drugs trade is at the root of the intensifying violence and conflict, and at the same time, closing its eyes to the unjust social system and difficult political system in Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Representative of the Council, last September, Parliament called upon the Union to develop an independent strategy for tackling the drugs problem. A month later, in October, the Council declared that the Union supports the peace moves and also wants to attend the negotiations. What we have heard you say today sounds very promising and I believe the Union must continue its work along these lines. It is farcical to believe that we can resolve the conflict in Colombia by deploying military means in order to fight the drugs trade, whilst forgetting the social and political problems facing this country, and it is also a betrayal of the Colombian people, who have already waited so long for peace and stability in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How many resolutions have we adopted? That is why I was delighted to hear the kind of statements the Council and the Commission made so eloquently today. But anyone who believes that Plan Colombia – negotiated by the USA with Pastrana, Mr Salafranca Sánchez-Neyra take note – represents another step in the direction of peace, ought to reflect once again on the fact that it will intensify the war and give succour to the military conflict in neighbouring regions, in other states. I do not recall President Cardoso of Brazil consenting to this plan or greeting it with enthusiasm.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Union here must be to continue to support the peace process and drive it forward, but also to encourage the government in Colombia to restore the rule of law, which is conspicuous by its absence. There is no real separation of powers, there is corruption – we know all that is there – and it is not the task of the European Union – and I am very grateful to you for making this point – to add fuel to the fire, but rather to play a positive and committed role in this peace process.

To Mr Howitt I would say, referring to a press statement half a year ago, that the position of the Commission is the one I have stated tonight. We have our own plan. We have our own philosophy and we will cooperate with all parts of society in Colombia to strengthen the role of peace. We do not need to relate to Plan Colombia. What we are doing forms no part of it.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mrs Sauquillo I would clarify what the planning is on an indicative basis and how we hope be able to spend the EUR 105 million from the Commission: EUR 40 million to projects in the sphere of social and economic development and combating poverty. This includes a series of decentralised initiatives in the areas of health, education, development of agricultural and traditional production, and coastal fishing. EUR 30 million in support of alternative development, EUR 25 million in support of administrative and judicial reform and EUR 10 million in actions to support the promotion and defence of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Over and above this we are envisaging a level of around EUR 10 million per year, part of which we expect to be ECHO activities. I mentioned the displaced persons whose numbers keep growing, so we have a clear commitment to continue ECHO’s presence there. We are expecting to stay at the level we have been at in recent years as far as NGO cofinancing is concerned. This has been at a level of EUR 2.4 million; it could be a little more or a little less. We have activities amounting to EUR 1.3 million over recent years for programmes to protect the environment and tropical forests.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of these activities will be carried out in cooperation with or through different NGOs. It is essential for us to do this if possible with Colombian NGOs and I will be asking European NGOs when they engage in these tasks to find partners in Colombia as in other cases and create partnerships. This will in fact strengthen the message that we are trying to get across. Some other activities aim to stimulate the government to do what we think is right: to concentrate more on poverty, to take more seriously the social aspects of these conflicts. Here the government of Colombia is the partner we need in our attempts to shape a peaceful development there.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not just an issue of whether or not we are using NGOs. This will depend very much on the subject and activity from case to case. But the transformation and the strengthening of a peaceful civil society, which is part of the solution and an element in the solution, can only be stimulated by a stronger involvement of NGOs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
