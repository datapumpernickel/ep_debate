<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span><span class="bold">.</span> – Mr President, before briefly introducing the three Commission proposals, I would like to thank and congratulate the two rapporteurs, Mrs Müller and Mrs Grossetête, as well as the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for all the work and effort they have put into finalising these three reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with the objectives of the proposals. There are three. First and foremost, to guarantee a high level of health protection for European citizens, and that is always the starting point. Secondly, to increase the availability of innovative medicinal products and, at the same time, favour competition with generic products, and, thirdly, to prepare for enlargement, which will very soon become a reality.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the concrete proposals are concerned, I will concentrate on three of them. First, the need to reinforce the role of the European Medicines Evaluation Agency and the centralised procedure. Why? Because the objective is to make new innovative medicines available to all EU citizens, at the same time. This is a question of equality of all patients in Europe. Thus, the Commission has proposed that the centralised authorisation procedure for all medicines containing new active substances be made mandatory. This is the Community solution to the issue of innovation availability and I hope that this House will support it. Additionally, this would produce economies of scale, save resources and time and, finally, lead to improved regulatory efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants, especially in the enlarged EU, to ensure that patients have quicker access to innovative medicines. The mutual recognition procedure has shown its limits. The evaluation process at the London agency takes an average of 180 days – clearly fewer than the maximum of 210 days provided for in the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The centralised procedure would also be positive for small and medium-sized enterprises. Let us take the example of biotechnology. SMEs are very active in this field, where centralised authorisation is already mandatory. Experience has not brought any major problems to light.</p>
<p class="contents">The benefits of a centralised procedure for SMEs are obvious in areas such as orphan drugs, where most of the marketing authorisations are granted to SMEs. This said, the Commission could, with a view to an overall solution, seek supporting measures for SMEs if there are particular obstacles, to help SMEs overcome them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to find the right balance between innovation and competition from generics. Why is this so important? To put it in a nutshell, we need innovative products for the benefit of patients and we need generics to help reduce the pressure on health care costs.</p>
<p class="contents">How then are these needs to be balanced? For innovative medicines, the Commission proposes a new data-protection period. For generics, entry to the market will be speeded up. How will this happen? First, the Commission proposes to harmonise the national data protection periods at 10 years across the board. This will provide a harmonised solution for Europe. The protection period will give the innovative pharmaceutical industry an opportunity to recover its R&amp; D investments. This will also allow for the smoother operation of the internal market. To reward further innovation and research in new products, the proposal provides for a possible extension of the protection period up to 11 years.</p>
<p class="contents">For generics, the Commission proposes to change a long-standing EU policy. We propose now, for the first time in EU legislation, that trials may begin on generics before the expiry of the patent or other form of intellectual property protection. This will speed up the marketing of generics on most of the national markets and will substantially help to increase competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that this is a balanced proposal. It takes account of the interests of the innovative European pharmaceutical industry, which is losing ground compared with the industry in the United States. It means fewer jobs and less research in Europe unless we do things differently. At the same time, it will facilitate the development of a competitive market in generics, and that means medicines at lower cost for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a few words about controlled access to information for patients. I knew this would be a difficult discussion, but, first of all, the Commission is not proposing an American type of direct advertising to patients. The discussions have concentrated to a large extent on the US model, but this is not our model.</p>
<p class="contents">The facts of the matter are that a lot of fragmented information is already available on the web, at least for English-speaking patients. This has two major drawbacks: firstly, it discriminates against non-English-speaking people and, secondly, it means that the information can be piecemeal and unreliable.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposal is that European citizens should obtain information that has been validated by European regulatory authorities and that follows guidelines to be agreed between the Member States and the Commission. It is a prudent proposal. It is a European pilot project, and has nothing in common with the US model. The alternatives to what we have today are, on the one hand, the continuation of massive direct advising to patients via the web. We cannot change this situation by our legislation. The alternative is to enable patients to obtain sound information, validated by the competent European authorities, on medicines for a small number of diseases. I think that this second option increases both choice and security for European patients.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission proposals aim to guarantee a high level of public health to European citizens, to increase, in a balanced way, the availability of innovative medicinal products and generic products and also to be ready for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a challenging piece of legislation. I am looking forward to the debate in the House today and to continued cooperation with Parliament and the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Müller, Rosemarie (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in examining the legislation before us, we need to consider whether more EU involvement is needed when it comes to approving innovative medicinal products, or whether the mutual recognition procedure is the best approach. In other words, do we want a more integrated internal market for medicinal products with a view to giving patients throughout Europe swifter access to new, safe and effective medicines, or is the idea that extremely complicated authorisation procedures should continue to keep new medicines out of patients' hands for as long as possible?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to argue in favour of the wider registration of medical products with new active substances. This has advantages not only for patients, but also for companies, because they can market medicines more quickly than up to now and thus enhance their competitiveness. The support proposed for SMEs should compensate for the drawbacks of the centralised authorisation procedure, which do hit them. As I see it, legislation should focus on patients and their needs. That means that safety and the effectiveness of medical products must play a key role in the authorisation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The procedure must be transparent. Patients, doctors and companies alike must therefore have access to any information not covered by business secrecy protection. In future, comprehensive information on progress with the authorisation procedure, on clinical tests carried out and on side effects and the prices of medical products will be downloadable at any time from a public database.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection, I regret that the Commission's information project on asthma, diabetes and AIDS did not receive the support of a majority of the committee. The Commission proposal was certainly ambiguous and gave rise to fears that advertising for prescription medicines was to be permitted. However, the committee's decision meant that an opportunity to improve patient information has been lost. I feel sure that this ought to be put right over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Pharmacovigilance, that is to say monitoring and reporting of side effects, is important to the safety of a medical product. The obligation to report side effects and submit periodic reports to the authorisation authority ensures continuous comprehensive assessment of any given medical product. There is a very effective safety net in the field of pharmacovigilance. This makes it easier to ascertain side effects and makes it possible to act quickly in the event of a crisis. For these reasons it will be possible to dispense with the procedure for relicensing products every five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Another key aspect of reform is the plan to prepare the boards and committees of the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products for their future remits and for the enlargement of the EU. The structure of the EAEMP is intended to reflect that of the EU Food Safety Authority, with an open application procedure for the Management Board and the Executive Director. Anyone wishing to become a member of one of the agency's boards or committees should have a high degree of scientific expertise and must declare any relevant interests. In addition to the existing scientific committees, there will in future be a committee for herbal medicinal products with the same status. This will make voluntary central authorisation for herbal medicines possible, giving patients throughout Europe the option of using tried and tested herbal medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to health protection, which is important for patients, there is also the issue of competitiveness and innovation in Europe's pharmaceutical industry. The harmonisation of data exclusivity is certainly a step towards increased competitiveness. Under the present arrangements, data exclusivity in Europe ranges from six to ten years, and this is in urgent need of harmonisation. The 10-year-rule gives a signal to pharmaceutical companies to intensify research and market truly innovative products. However, it also gives a signal to generic drug manufacturers to use the Bolar provisions. As I see it, the Commission proposal is a successful attempt to strike a balance between the justifiable desire of pharmaceutical companies to protect their data and the need of public health systems to improve access to cost-effective generic drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, the legislation before us will make an important contribution to improving health protection in Europe, which will be of lasting benefit to patients.</p>

Allow me, first of all, to thank all my fellow Members from all the political groups for the discussions that we have had and the work that they have performed via the 800 amendments. In my opinion, there are rather too many amendments, which may be very detrimental to the quality and coherence of our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The main objective of the proposals is to ensure a high level of health protection for each citizen, particularly by providing rapid access to innovative and safe products, by developing a preventative and on-going system of pharmacovigilance, as well as by improving the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry within the framework of its search for new treatments. We must not forget the essential boost which must be given to the generic medicinal products industry. A medicinal product is a product unlike any other. It is not purchased or consumed like an ordinary, everyday consumer item. Its use is unique and everyone expects a medicinal product to be safe and to work effectively. Safety, quality and efficacy are the three essential pillars of the European medicinal products market. Before being made available to patients, medicinal products must pass through specific and restricted phases in order to obtain a marketing authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, there are two procedures for registering medicinal products: the centralised procedure, managed by the European Agency, under which authorisations valid for all EU Member States are issued, and the mutual recognition procedure, for which the Member States have jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not our intention to alter the existing dual structure; the main task is to optimise the way it works. In reality, the question raised concerns new, active substances. We all agree that there is a difference between new active substances, which number almost 20 per year, and the new drugs, which amount to between 200 and 300 each year. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to introduce the registration, by means of a centralised procedure, of new molecules, so as to ensure that everyone has access to the most innovative therapies. Some Members wanted to question the principle. I would like to say to them that we are faced with a critical choice. You will choose between either health or the market. By adopting the amendment which calls the scope into question, we must respond to the following: how do we explain to those who are ill that their European neighbours will be able to benefit from an innovative and effective treatment, but that they will have to wait a few years until the authorisation is granted to their country? Faced with this perspective, let us take an extreme case involving enlargement: citizens from Slovenia and Portugal could, for example, be treated with a new therapy, but a German or Cypriot citizen could not have access to it. What do we do, in this case, as regards equality in the area of health? Some Members will say that the centralised procedure is costly for SMEs, but in the case of enlargement, the cost of 25 applications for market authorisation using the decentralised procedure will be much higher.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all mindful of the recent examples of medicinal products withdrawn from the market on public health grounds. We know that the issuing of an authorisation for a medicinal product does not, however, mean that checks are no longer needed on its efficacy and safety. It is thus essential to step up pharmacovigilance requirements, in order to offer patients the best possible guarantees, in other words with <span class="italic">ad-hoc</span> inspections at the source of manufacturing, using purely public funding, which is indispensable if independence is to be guaranteed and, lastly, by means of a rapid system for exchanging data collated by all the partners, which will make it possible to achieve coherence in pharmacovigilance systems between Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to manufacture a medicinal product, the applicant first needs to carry out extensive research in order to discover new molecules. We all know that innovation comes at a price. Industry therefore needs to guarantee the protection of this data. It is our duty to encourage research to ensure that science moves forward, hence the interest in retaining our best researchers. We also need to ensure patient safety, but equally to prevent Europe’s industries from falling too far behind other countries, from the United States and Asia. Of course, the usefulness of generic drugs has already been demonstrated. They illustrate the success of our European health systems. The introduction of adequate measures, therefore, particularly by means of the Bolar system will speed up their launch on to the market. We must also remember that generic products are only developed due to innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also expecting all the Member States to run an information campaign for the general public, in order to explain what a generic product is, whilst stressing it is the therapeutic equivalent of the reference medicinal product.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard, more specifically, to veterinary medicinal products, the main challenge is to contend with the problem of the availability of these medicinal products. A balance has been sought between making some provisions more flexible, such as the ‘cascade provisions’ and maintaining the highest level of safety for the consumer, in the case of food-producing animals. When there is no medicinal product available for a condition or a given animal, the cascade system allows the use of medicinal products designed for other species, for other conditions or even the use of medicinal products for human use. This system was improved and broadened for optimal effectiveness and safety.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is proposing to extend the compulsory prescription to all medicinal products designed for food-producing animals, which poses a problem for some Member States, including Ireland and the United Kingdom. A compromise amendment, adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy makes this measure consistent with the national provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we cannot speak about the revision of European pharmaceutical legislation without addressing the issue of information and the Commission proposal, which seeks to provide authorisation, on an experimental basis, over five years. We must also address the communication, by industry, of information relating to specific medicinal products for the following conditions: asthma, AIDS and diabetes. The medicinal products market is unique and our objective must not be to encourage maximum sales. It is vital to maintain a very clear distinction between information and advertising and to place a strict ban on the latter. There is no better information than that given by a doctor or a pharmacist.</p>
<p class="contents">Information systems, however, particularly via the Internet, have been widely developed and it appears quite unfair that only those who have access to the Internet and can speak English are able to gather this data, and not other people. We must avoid, however, any move leading to the development of deceptive and misleading information that seeks to promote the prescription, sale or taking of a specific medicinal product.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment rejected the Commission proposal by a huge majority, as it was deemed to be overly ambiguous. This unmitigated rejection poses a problem, however. I hoped that the concepts of information and advertising would be better defined, and I proposed a system for the prior validation of the information by neutral scientific organisations. This proposal could pave the way for the foundation of an exhaustive new study, which we are awaiting from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, there is an essential source of information. I am referring to package leaflets. All the amendments tabled on this issue seek to improve the way they are written, to make them clearer and easier to understand. This is a very positive point.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I must stress the importance of enlargement. We cannot deny the fact that the revision which will be adopted will apply to the incoming countries. That is why I proposed, in particular, what I shall refer to as the ‘euro-generic’ product. Within some of the candidate countries and for historical or economic reasons, reference medicinal products have never been registered. The updating of generic authorisations in accordance with European legal requirements in the candidate countries therefore requires the possibility of referring to a reference product. The absence of such a product could pave the way for an obligation to withdraw generic medicinal products from the market, which nonetheless conform to the requirements of quality, security and effectiveness. This is a situation which causes problems of access to generic medicinal products. It therefore seems important that a reference medicinal product present in another Member State be able to serve as a reference.</p>
<p class="contents">Each new candidate country has an important role to play as a fully committed player in the integration and development of this ‘Europe of health’ that we are all hoping and praying will be realised.</p>

I am very grateful to the rapporteur and to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy for having taken our suggestions on board in their reports. There is, however, one thing I would to make very clear to this House, and this also applies of course to the Commission and the Member States. If we are to give an agency new remits, then we also need to consider where the money for carrying out those tasks is to come from. We cannot just keep increasing the size of an agency.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a General Budget that only provides us with a certain amount, and Parliament cannot top it up – we can only restructure it. So if we wish to allocate financial means to an agency in future, we have to take those means away from another agency. I know that I am not making myself popular by making these statements, but I am not here to be popular. We need to bear in mind in future that an agency can only carry out the tasks assigned to it with the money at its disposal, and that it cannot act as it likes beyond that. That is not possible, because we do not have the money for that. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They have highlighted – as will I – the importance of this industry a major employer of this industrial research base. It is so important to keep in the European Union, both for the European Union and, above all, for consumers who want safe, effective and affordable medicines. Added to that are the complex needs of the sectors in the industry, of which there are at least three: the in-patent sector, the generic sector and the over-the-counter sector. Many of the amendments are seeking to strike the correct balance between them. We have to encourage the in-patent sector to develop new medicines but the generic sector also provides affordable medicines. If you add to this the whole question of access and affordability on a global scale, you can see just how complex an area this is.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to draw attention to just three points. One is the authorisation procedure. I am urging colleagues to accept duality, at least in the immediate future. Mrs Grossetête perhaps needs to re-examine the whole question of the centralised procedure and access. The fact that medicines are authorised does not mean that they are automatically placed on the market. This applies particularly to veterinary medicines. In their case I really believe that duality should continue.</p>
<p class="contents">On the question of advertising and consumer information, I urge Parliament to accept the amendment that asks the Commission to look again at this issue. The Commission is right – information is available to some, but not to all. That is almost beyond our control.</p>
<p class="contents">On data exclusivity, the balance that the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has come up with is the right one. I hope that Parliament will look at it sensibly. We are going to have an important second reading and possibly a conciliation, so we still have time to try and get this even more right that we have done so far. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The primary objective of all the institutions – Parliament, the Commission and the Member States – should be to introduce, at last, new legislation which is better than the previous legislation and which will provide all patients, including those suffering from serious, terminal illnesses, with as rapid access as possible to new medicinal products which are more powerful and easier to tolerate than existing medicinal products, to alleviate their suffering and extend and improve their quality of life.</p>
<p class="contents">In the short space of time available to me, I will focus on just a few points. As regards the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products, I am completely opposed to the proposal regarding the membership of the management board. A management board such as that proposed by the Commission, and by the rapporteur, Mrs Müller, too, would certainly be doomed to failure. The presence on the management board of members representing the institutions and, in addition, of members with conflicting interests – such as industry, patients and insurance companies – would only lead to confusion, wasted time and major disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I would like to make concerns the centralised procedure, where evaluation is carried out by the European Agency. The concept of ‘new medicinal product’ needs to be better defined, Commissioner. What is meant by the term ‘new medicinal product’? Does it refer to a medicinal product which has the same structure as existing medicinal products but with a very small change, or does it actually refer to medicinal products with a new chemical structure? I hope that you and the Council will think again on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would add my great thanks to Mrs Grossetête with whom I have worked extremely closely on this particular issue. I am only here to represent the Committee on Agriculture on the veterinary medicines side. It would be remiss of me if I did not say at the outset that one of the problems facing agriculture is that it is going through the worst time it has ever had – I will not mention the problems facing British beef today.</p>
<p class="contents">Any legislation that this Parliament adopts and pushes through the Commission could have a detrimental effect on industry if it is not put through correctly. Mrs Grossetête has worked extremely well with me and other members on the veterinary medicines bill and, therefore, we will totally support all the legislation in that bill.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to raise three issues. Mrs Read briefly covered one. I totally endorse what she says about what is termed 'duality'. One of the problems we have in the European Union is that animals in the very far north, for example, are not necessarily the same as animals in the south. I use the term 'the reindeer syndrome', which many colleagues will have heard me say before. Duality is something that will help to promote the proper use of medicines for species that are not found across the European Union. It may be difficult to get someone to spend the money to test these products for one particular species. Therefore, we have retabled Amendment No 137, which I hope the Commission and Mrs Grossetête will consider. I hope this House will consider supporting it. As I have mentioned, this would help those species that are not widespread.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Grossetête mentioned the way that medicines are dispensed in certain countries. I am delighted that she has taken this on board. I fully support the compromise amendment, which is something I worked particularly hard in the Committee on Agriculture to get through. We are in a situation where Member States differ, firstly, in their definition of what a veterinary surgeon is and what it means and, secondly, in the dispensing of these drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">In many instances in the United Kingdom, Ireland and one or two other countries, qualified people dispense minor medicines – in particular, products such as worming pills and flea powders. The real worry is not particularly with food-chain animals. But, if this option is removed, we are in a situation where the pets in the animal world will suffer because people will not be able to afford to go to a veterinary surgeon, for example, to get a worming pill for a cat. Therefore, it is important that we have flexibility. I am delighted that both rapporteurs have taken this on board and am totally in favour of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The final point concerns the use of medicines for equine species. Again, if we are not careful, we are going to inflict hardship on animals that do not deserve it. For example, horses are not eaten in the United Kingdom. It may be that horsemeat is accepted in other countries. If the medicines available to us are restricted, then again it is the animal that suffers. Therefore, it is vitally important that the new Amendment No 65 for equine species is adopted. I shall leave it there, as I have covered the agricultural scene totally. I thank the two rapporteurs for taking on board the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and look forward to a worthwhile result. I hope the Commission will also follow my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As regards the proposal to revise pharmaceutical legislation in order to maintain high standards of public health and complete the single market and, in the field of medicinal products, to meet the challenges of enlargement, apply a more functional and simplified procedure for authorising and supervising medicinal products – by which we mean medicinal products at affordable prices – and, finally, guarantee transparency and access to information on medical products for patients, I should like to comment briefly on the following points.</p>
<p class="contents">Innovation: we depend on scientific research and innovation for new combinations of substances and new drugs to fight and cure disease. But this sort of research needs bold investment by the pharmaceutical industry and this is only feasible if we provide a framework of financial incentives.</p>
<p class="contents">Incentives: these are based mainly on exclusivity, by which we mean protecting industrial property rights and inventions. As a result, the cost of developing a medicinal product is borne by the market and social security systems which, because of the ageing population, are now under tremendous pressure. So we need to strike a balance here between patented exclusivity, the price of medicinal products and the period of protection. This is a hard balance to strike. However, I think that the arrangements achieved in the regulation and now being proposed do strike a balance between exclusivity on the one hand and a reasonable period of protection on the other.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety of medicinal products: this is also a serious requirement and the elements of quality and vigilance are also taken into account in this excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Authorisation: I am in favour of a centralised procedure with a degree of decentralisation to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, subsidiarity: this is a very important factor because it is the Member States that foot the bill and provide medical and medicinal care. Yesterday President Bush made a move precisely because the Member States are under huge financial pressure in this sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferreira (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, revising Community legislation on medicinal products, with the aim of providing improved levels of care, is a good thing and we welcome this new process of harmonisation of veterinary and human medicinal products. Health policy in Europe should not, however, be limited to the text on which we are about to vote, and should have been the subject of a more thorough deliberation. We must once again look at medicine in a context of public health that serves our citizens, as, although medicinal products exist, they must still be accessible to all men and women, and we regret the fact that we have not had a debate on social protection.</p>
<p class="contents">For public health policy to take precedence over industrial policy, the Agency for medicinal products must be part of the Directorate General for Health and Consumer Protection once more, rather than the Directorate General for Enterprise.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also disappointed by other aspects of the Commission proposal. The first I shall mention is that of patient information. We live in a society of high-speed communication and the Internet enables those, who wish or are able to, to access a great deal of information. Although the quality of this information is not always satisfactory, the solution proposed by the Commission to resolve this problem is not the right answer. Giving the pharmaceutical companies the option of communicating information on their products will not make it possible to eradicate erroneous information, but will authorise advertising on prescription-only medicines. This formula, which is permitted in the United States and in New Zealand, has shown its limits. During the last decade, spending by the United States on direct advertising has risen from USD 55 million, reaching USD 2.5 billion in 2000.<span class="bold"> </span>Out of the total increase related to medicinal products, 47% was spent on advertising 50 medicinal products. There is no doubt that this is a commercial strategy and is not out of a concern for information. This is not what we want for European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is independent information provided by independent sources, which do not harm the relationship between patients and doctors and which do not lead to the excessive consumption of medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals on the transparency of data provided by the Agency are heading in this direction. We could certainly have gone a little further. In demanding information, patients are also demanding safety and it is doubtful that the withdrawal of the five-yearly renewal will help to achieve this.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us wait for the new proposals in the area of pharmacovigilance to prove their worth and let us maintain the option of carrying out a genuine scientific evaluation of a medicinal product, five years after it has been placed on the market, in the case of a new medicine. This evaluation could also provide an opportunity to weigh up the therapeutic value of the medicinal product.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I will say that although patients need effective medicinal products, some, unfortunately, need treatment urgently and hope to have access to new treatments, which, although they have not yet provided all possible safety guarantees, are a last resort for these patients. We must listen to them and provide a response to their appeal. This report highlights some considerable challenges. They will have an effect on the policy regarding medicinal products, but also on health policies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the pharmaceutical industry, Europe is losing out to the United States. It is not for nothing that an increasing number of companies have decided to carry out their practical research and development in the United States. European legislation is too opaque, which dampens the companies' motivation to carry out their activities in Europe, and in order to counter this, better European coordination in this field is therefore necessary as a matter of priority. I am greatly in favour of opening up this fossilised market. We must therefore strive for more competition within the European market, and one of the ways of achieving this is, for example, by making generic medicines available sooner, something on which a sound compromise has been reached within the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I would insist on the centralised procedure, which is carried out by the Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products in London, being reinforced so as to guarantee the equal treatment of all pharmaceutical companies and to give patients throughout Europe access to the same medicines. This centralised method also promotes all the objectives pursued by the Commission, such as a high level of health care, completion of the internal market, more transparency, improvement of competition and preparation for enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">I also set great store by the provision of information. It remains a mystery to me why the pharmaceutical industry is not allowed to inform patients about its products. I have said it before, but I should like to repeat it here: the European Union has thus been taken over by events and is discriminating against patients. At the moment, information of this kind is only available to people with a command of English and with access to the Internet, as this information <span class="italic">is</span> available in the United States. Patients who have no access to these resources are kept in the dark by Europe, and it is for this reason too that I think that the Commission's proposal to come up with a trial project is sound and is in any case a good first step. I do believe that by only making information on asthma, AIDS and diabetes available, patients suffering from other diseases are discriminated against, and I would call for this list to be extended.</p>

I agree with them that our main concern must be attention to and clear information for patients.</p>
<p class="contents">Neither must we forget what the honourable Member said in relation to the budget of the Agency and the different agencies. This is a restrictive budget, and in the end those of us who continue to say that the European Union’s general budget is very low if it is to confront enlargement and the spending the new countries will generate will be proved right.</p>
<p class="contents">Since I do not have much time, Mr President, I would like to stress certain aspects of the report: firstly, the guarantee that the officials, experts and authors of reports do not have financial or any other type of interest in the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, something that has been said here on many occasions, the clear differentiation between publicity and information. The free database with different levels for users, health staff, companies and others is all very well. However, as has also been said here, not everybody has access to the Internet and not everybody knows English and the Member States will have to provide patients with other important types of information so that they can decide between effectiveness, side effects and counter-indications.</p>
<p class="contents">A system of penalties for holders of authorisations who fail to comply with the directive, making the actions of the holder in question public. And an increase – as the rapporteurs have said – in the monitoring of pharmaceuticals, because the effects of medication do not end with authorisation, and furthermore there must be continued monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, access to generic medications that reduce pharmaceutical spending should be facilitated and furthermore there should be a guarantee that the Member States will provide information explaining to users that a cheaper medication is not necessarily any less effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has taken this into account by voting – by a broad majority – against any direct to consumer advertising for prescription medicines, whilst increasing the transparency of market authorisation procedures. Patients have a right to objective and reliable information on illnesses and on the therapies available to treat them. What better information can we give than to make available to the public the database containing all the medicinal products registered at the Agency, together with the evaluation report on these products, the reasons for their authorisation or their rejection and the explanatory leaflet on the results of clinical trials, be they positive or negative?</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, information obtained by the pharmaceutical industry alone cannot be objective and more or less equates to advertising direct to consumers. Furthermore, it seems important that stricter rules be adopted when promoting medicinal products for use by professionals, which is what, in fact, happens in my own country. We must increase the transparency and independence of the Agency by making it accessible to consumer and patient representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">The safety and the quality of medicines are based on a scientific evaluation, which highlights the risks and benefits of the product. The risk/benefit<span class="bold"><span class="italic"> </span></span>relationship makes it possible to determine whether or not the market authorisation can be issued. This must be re-assessed, however, in order to take into account the effects related to its use as well as any new scientific data available. The administrative burden involved in the five-yearly renewal of the market authorisation in no way justifies the immediate withdrawal of any periodic re-evaluation of new medicinal products, in particular. That is why we are proposing that at least a re-evaluation takes place once the product has been on the market for five years. Far from running counter to the new provisions on pharmacovigilance, this measure clearly strengthens the safety of medicinal products. Similarly, we are refusing to reduce the time spent on the scientific evaluation of medicinal products, under the centralised procedure as well as the decentralised procedure, and even in the case of the accelerated procedure or the reduction protocol that we support.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the effectiveness of a medicinal product can only be demonstrated when it is compared to that of other medicinal products available to treat the same conditions. Is it any good developing new medicines which add nothing in therapeutic terms or to maintain products that have been overtaken by new medical technologies? The initial evaluation, and that carried out after five years, provide the opportunity to weigh up the added therapeutic value of medicinal products. This measure can only motivate European research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are opposed to the amendments which seek to limit the centralised procedure and to encourage the procedure of mutual recognition, or even to delay generic products coming onto the market. We welcome the adoption in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy of the amendments on the impact of medicinal products on the environment. My fellow Members have supported us on this issue and we are rather pleased by this.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President, although pharmaceutical companies have, by and large, been backed up in the Commission’s initial proposals, we have a duty – and this must be the mission of the European Parliament – to protect the interests of citizens, patients and consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Virtually all of us have used them and come into contact with them. In other words, Parliament's power of co-decision in this area is important as a tangible example of the way European Parliament decisions can affect people's lives. Indeed, as a member of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, I have come to expect representations from many organisations across the board.</p>
<p class="contents">On this occasion, I have been contacted by farming organisations, veterinary groups, agricultural co-operatives, pharmaceutical interests, health stores and numerous individual constituents. Each group has its own particular concerns, but one common theme emerges: the proposed legislation does not take sufficient account of the different situations in the Member States. This is surely a lesson for the Commission. In an ideal situation, the legislation proposed would take account of such diversity.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Ireland breed horses primarily for sporting purposes and meat does not end up at the end of the food chain. Consequently, the same safeguards are not required for medicines given to horses. I could cite many more instances and I have tabled a number of amendments for my group to deal with some of the difficulties. I would say to the Commission that if we are to guarantee the democratic legitimacy of decision-making, we must reassure our citizens that their specific concerns have been taken into consideration. If we proceed with 'one size fits all' legislation which ignores the particularities of individual countries or regions, we risk alienating our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, we have just concluded a long referendum campaign in Ireland, with a successful outcome for the Nice Treaty, and one of the major issues throughout the campaign was the sense of powerlessness and distance. We, as legislators, have a responsibility to ensure that we bring the people with us and keep in touch with their everyday concerns</p>

Accordingly, every life deserves the best possible protection and care from the cradle to the grave. A smoothly running European medicines market fits in well with this ambition.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group believes it to be of major importance that Europe does not present any obstacles which could frustrate the operation of the medicines market. We are therefore of the view that manufacturers of medicines must continue to have the choice between the centralised and decentralised registration of medicines. Compulsory centralised registration would hamper the necessary flexibility which regional products enjoy, it would lead to a brain drain from the national registration authorities and it could present too great a financial obstacle for SMEs, preventing them from introducing certain products onto the market.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we are in favour of more research into the effects of medicines on children. To date, a large proportion of medicines administered to children has only been tested on adults, even though it is surely obvious that children are different from adults in terms of their metabolism, the necessary dosage and the administration method.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we are against allowing medicines to be advertised, because this could lead to an unnecessary increase in the use of medicines. We are, however, in favour of providing patients with extensive information. We therefore await with interest the outcome of the trial proposed by the European Commission in which patients are actively provided with information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This will have an impact on the competitiveness of companies of all sizes in this sector and accordingly on a great many jobs. However, it also of course affects the entire trade, pharmacists and, last but not least, the patient. This mammoth document is, amongst other things, the result of a new strategy that the Commission has already been pursuing for several years. The volume of Community law, which currently stands at over 80 000 pages, is to be simplified and tightened up.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of this particular revision, a single legislative act is to be adopted, taking account of the various substantive changes required and codifying the remaining provisions. The many amendments tabled in committee and now once again in the plenary are just one indication of how difficult this undertaking is. I have enormous respect for the massive amount of work put in by the Commission and by our two rapporteurs, Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, but I am genuinely concerned that we may to some extent have lost track of the overall picture, so that some apparently less important issues have not perhaps been attended to. That is why I would like to draw your attention to homeopathic medicines, not just for humans but also for animals, and I urge you to support these amendments too.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is a co-legislator here and we need to make sure that we do our work carefully. At first reading, we still have a lot of opportunities, but we should also leave the way open for the second reading. That is why I am asking for your support, but I am also calling on the Legal Service and on our rapporteurs to check whether the final outcome is coherent. Only the future can tell whether this pharmaceutical legislation will be easier for the Member States and other stakeholders to apply because of its reduced linguistic complexity.

In a way, they have been the poor relation in these debates because of the immense complexity of the situation with regard to human medicinal substances.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I would like to warn against the Commission's proposals under Article 67 that all veterinary medicines intended for food-producing animals should be available on prescription only. Some Member States, including my own, have a well-established distribution system that allows medicines for which veterinary involvement is not considered necessary for safe and effective use to be obtained without a veterinary certificate. I can see why some professional organisations in some other Member States would be opposed to that, but it has worked effectively for very many years in Ireland as well as the UK. When we now look at the enlargement of the Union, all kinds of problems will arise if we allow ourselves now to move towards a centralised system which allows only by prescription use of such medicines as are currently administered by qualified persons in countries like the UK. I therefore commend Amendment No 43 to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">My second and last point is that on the mandatory centralised procedures proposed by the Commission, the committee decided to move to a more flexible system for human medicines, but did not follow that same route in terms of animal medicines. We should rectify that and we can do so through Amendment No 171.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would make the point that it is a mistake for the Commission to propose that we remove the five-year renewal requirement for marketing authorisation. That is a safety precaution we should retain. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I normally do not thank the rapporteurs, but there is good reason to do so in this case, as it is extremely difficult to attempt to master the whole of this large area.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we all know that the costs of medicines in many EU countries constitute the fastest growing element of healthcare costs. In many countries, the shortfall in funding specifically for medicines is quite large. I therefore believe it was important that the Health Ministers were involved in this issue before the Council was restructured to increase efficiency. I hope that the Health Ministers will also be involved in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I usually also remain highly sceptical when Parliament asks the Commission for more reports. This time, I believe, however, that it would be important for the Commission to follow up trends in medicine prices, taking into account differences in different countries. This may provide us with very valuable information on various restrictions.</p>
<p class="contents">I support what my colleague Mr Maaten said on access to information and what the Commissioner said regarding the fact that the issue is not advertising but access to information. We have many examples of information and other support being given to doctors in an unacceptable manner. Monitoring information would allow us to keep better track of how much money is being used in this sector. I see this as important.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe one of the major problems, which many of the amendments also seize upon, is that we have what has been referred to as paid research. Many respected newspapers have also given their pages over to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I, like Mr Rod, stress that I am glad that the effect of medicines on the environment will also be taken into account. It is not that we wish to set up obstacles to medicines but that the positive effects must be evaluated in relation to other effects. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is proposed, in particular, to extend the length of time that clinical data is to be protected, to increase the flexibility of and accelerate the market authorisation procedure and, above all, to lift the ban on pharmaceutical companies advertising prescription-only medicines to the general public.</p>
<p class="contents">What is essentially being proposed is the model used in the United States, where this ban was lifted in 1997. Based on an exclusively market-driven approach, these proposals consider medicinal products as an everyday, consumer article, almost a product like any other. This approach is combined with that which is increasingly common in international trade negotiations, which seek to subject health and education to the laws of the market within the framework of the liberalisation of services.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this deteriorating situation, a group was set up at European level, bringing together consumer organisations, family organisations, patients’ associations, insurance companies, and health insurance bodies. The ‘Europe and Medicines’ group has been working to provide information and clarification to European bodies and governments.</p>
<p class="contents">This action, which enabled us to get a better feel for the economic, political and ethical challenges of this dossier, has delivered results. Due to this, the majority of members of the Committee on the Environment approved the reports which are not in line with the Commission’s approach and I welcome, in particular, the fact that the reports are opposed to the advertising of medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">My group, in conjunction with the ‘Europe and Medicines’ group, will pursue its efforts to have a responsible policy applied throughout the European Union, one which improves public health, therapeutic progress and consumer protection. In order to do this, three principles should be strengthened in the European medicines regulation system: harmonisation between countries in order to guarantee evaluation and monitoring of a high quality, the independence of institutions responsible for medicinal products, and the transparency of the system for all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Medicines should be accessible to all Europeans, particularly following enlargement. The fact that we have 500 amendments is to do with the different lobbies and, above all, with the conflict between new and generic medicines. I welcome the compromise that has been reached, which offers protection that lasts eight years. I can just about endorse the ten-year market protection for new medicines within the EU. However, it should be possible for manufacturers of generic medicines to sell their products in countries outside of Europe. Those countries are invariably poorer and would benefit from these cheaper medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">My group is delighted that the Commission's proposal to authorise advertising for prescription medicines for AIDS, asthma and diabetes has suffered a crushing defeat in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Despite this, the Liberal Group has re-tabled this absurd proposal. In the USA, advertising for prescription medicines has been decontrolled for the past five years. Sales have increased by 80%, admittedly not only thanks to advertising, but even so. The American population has not become any healthier as a result. The pharmaceutical industry's profits, on the other hand, have soared.</p>
<p class="contents">Patients are in great need of more information, but only if they ask for it. At the moment, they have to make do with American websites. Via the Internet and telephone helplines, it should be possible for patients to obtain information about medicines in their own language. The five-yearly re-evaluation of medicines has now become a formality. My group would prefer to see an improved re-evaluation procedure put in place, a re-evaluation with substance. Does a medicine have value-added? The pharmaceutical industry is decidedly against this. I should, however, like to repeat that it is not commercial interests but health care that should come first. Many medicines are toxic substances. When they leave the body, they are often still toxic, also to the environment. This is why my group is very pleased that consideration will now also be given to the environment in the assessment of new medicines. The European Commission has dropped a major clanger in this respect. Is that because the Directorate-General of Industry is responsible? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is our experience that the licensing system <span class="italic">in toto</span> provides a false guarantee of safety, in that no predictive testing could accurately ascertain the full extent of toxicity and the potential health threat to humans or animals. Thus the key to safety is an effective post-licensing surveillance system, sensitive enough to identify adverse reactions speedily and to enable swift and effective action to be taken. This requires effective administrative and medical systems, including diagnostic systems, in each Member State. Again, our experience is that these systems are far from adequate. We therefore believe that it would be better to focus on this area, rather than extend an already over-complex code. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are, however, taking a step in the right direction as far as greater harmonisation in registration is concerned and also with regard to the conditions for placing medicines, particularly generic medicines, on the market. Admittance to Member State markets, however, remains at the discretion of the individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of today's important areas of discussion is the relationship between the original medicine and the generic product that is introduced onto the market once the patent and data protection have lapsed. A fragile compromise has been tabled, in respect of which I have tabled a better worded amendment. I would ask my fellow MEPs for their support, but I do endorse the compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, I should also like to take this opportunity to issue a warning that speeding up the launch of a generic product will not automatically lead to lower costs. In the Netherlands, I have noticed that the price of a generic product there is higher than the price of the original medicine in a large number of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on pricing policy. Although we are once again bringing transparency to your attention, it is frustrating – and I am also addressing this comment to the rapporteurs of 1989 – that the directive on transparency is not being fleshed out. There are large discrepancies, and we will not solve them today. It is too ridiculous for words that medicines from the Netherlands, where the price paid by consumers for generic medicines is so high, are exported to other Member States in parallel. We should put a stop to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am not in favour of advertising. I am in favour of making self-regulating information accessible on the web. Whether this information originates from national agencies or the industry itself is irrelevant, as long as it is self-regulating. In my view, articulate consumers should not have to resort to websites in America but should also be able to access this information in Europe. I should ask you to carefully reconsider my amendments on this score.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the pharmaceutical industry is doing well, boasting high profits over a long period of time. Health budgets, on the other hand, are not in such good shape, unfortunately. Spending on medicines is increasing in most Member States. The development of medicines is not going well either. There is little real innovation in Europe and, what is worse, the development of medicines to fight the worldwide health crisis, is seriously lagging behind. Although this is a wholly unsatisfactory situation, we can use the review of pharmaceutical legislation to take steps in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We should first of all adopt a sound price policy. The price of medicines is determined at national level, and currently differs widely across the various European Member States. For new medicines, the Commission should lay down a guideline on the basis of the development costs involved. Many countries would like to cut down on public health spending by raising the patients' own contributions for medicines. This is unacceptable. Savings should, in fact, be sought in joint and improved negotiations with the industry instead of by increasing patients' own contributions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, legislation should not hamper, but rather promote, innovation. Industry wants to do this by extending the data protection period, but this is no guarantee for innovation. Quite the opposite, in fact; there is more innovation happening in the United States, which has a shorter period of protection. We must stimulate innovation by emphasising the therapeutic value-added and, above all, by displaying public leadership and by raising questions in the area of research ourselves. Agreements can be reached about the research agenda during the price negotiations. Good prices in exchange for investments in medicines for which there is a worldwide need are a step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must put provisions in place which enable the production of generic versions of essential medicines that are still patented but that are unaffordable in developing countries. This should only apply to medicines for countries that do not yet have the production capacity available themselves. Major steps were taken in Doha to make medicines more affordable in developing countries. All that remains for us to do is to make a small, yet important, step.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must single-mindedly uphold the ban on advertising medicines. Providing direct information or advertising that is aimed at patients is not the right way forward. The pharmaceutical industry is already spending huge amounts of money on marketing. Even more marketing will hike up the price of medicines unnecessarily. At least as important is the argument that we must prevent the industry from talking healthy people into illnesses. There are other ways of ensuring that good information is available to patients.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a word of thanks to Mrs Grossetête and, above all, Mrs Müller for all her intricate work. All her efforts to make medicines more suitable for children and women receive my wholehearted support, as does her plea for a European approach, for which I should also like to express thanks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ries (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I would also like to thank Commissioner Liikanen’s staff, and above all Mrs Grossetête and Mrs Müller, for the quality of their work on one of the most important public health dossiers of our parliamentary term.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the main points have already been covered, I shall devote my speaking time to the points on which there is still disagreement. Firstly, as far as the European Agency for the evaluation of medicinal products in London is concerned, I feel it is important to stress the essential role this body has played for seven years, a role which, in view of the forthcoming enlargement and of improving the way the internal market works, deserves to be extended to all medicinal products using a new active substance. That is why the Liberal Group is categorically opposed to Amendment Nos 136 of the report by Mrs Müller.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the protection of commercial data, the compromise adopted in committee, by 8 Members with 2 abstentions, balances the requirements and is, in my view, perfectly suitable. Why is this? Because no one has been able to demonstrate a direct and unique link between industrial protection and the success of generic products. The case of Germany and the United Kingdom, with ten full years of data protection and generic products which in fact have a 20% market share, illustrate this point remarkably well. If we attack research and development, we are attacking the wrong target and putting the very foundations of health protection at risk. It would be more honest, I believe, to acknowledge the genuine influence, on the development of generic products, of a genuine policy that works as an incentive in terms of price and refunds and, in parallel, of an effort by health professionals to enlighten their patients, and I support Mrs Oomen-Ruijten’s arguments on this point.</p>
<p class="contents">My last point concerns the ‘Information for patients’ section. Like other Members, I am not satisfied with the vote that took place in committee. Firstly, because the European Commission had the courage to tackle head on a considerable and practical problem which, whether you like it or not, must be resolved. Medical information on the Internet, freely accessible, is not monitored at present, which may have damaging consequences, as Commissioner Liikanen mentioned at the beginning of the debate. Next, because accurate information, it must indeed be pointed out, is not necessarily advertising, and because the equation between the two that some skilfully maintain is simplistic and misleading. We should therefore clarify and refine the Commission’s text, which is what Mrs Grossetête tried to do, rather than delete everything.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Mr President – and this is the most important point, the rapporteurs have emphasised this sufficiently – it is vital to maintain a fair balance between the essential priorities of public health and those priorities which aim to encourage the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry, and therefore research in Europe, and the completion of our single market.</p>

Yet, the quest for profits cannot be reconciled with the defence of public health. When one claims to protect public health, one must put the interests of the community first and one must take into account the health of all human beings, whether or not they can afford to pay.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the pharmaceutical industry, well, it is only interested in those who can pay. This is the reason why it wants to work quickly, in order to release medicinal products which yield a high return. In other words, in their jargon, they want ‘blockbusters’ which earn more than one billion dollars per year. Spending insufficient time, however, on research and trials in order to rake in profits more quickly will certainly have a detrimental effect on the safety and health of patients, not to mention those working in these industries.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to condemn the other consequence of the quest for profit, namely job losses, including within the research sector. This is what is happening at the moment at the pharmaceutical company, Aventis, which is cutting 10 000 jobs world-wide and closing factories and research centres in several countries.</p>
<p class="contents">You speak about transparency, but the pharmaceutical industry has always kept its margins under wraps, which are amongst some of the highest in industry, due to the very fact that they are guaranteed by the national health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">We are told that it would be awful if terrorists were to contaminate populations with smallpox, since we would not have the necessary medicinal products to treat people. Whilst that may be true, this disastrous scenario is already happening. Every day, thousands of children die from diseases that we know how to treat, such as measles, and for which medicinal products exist. It is the thirst for profit of large pharmaceutical companies that is responsible for this, and they enjoy the compelling support of the governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am afraid that these reports concentrate too much on approval.

<p class="contents">It is not acceptable for Europe's internal market so obviously not to include the pharmaceutical industry. I hope that by achieving transparency the links between public research and industrial research will also become clearer, and that databases will also make it easier to see who has been involved in given clinical tests and to what extent public research receives external funding.</p>

These are areas which, from the outset, medicinal products were intended to safeguard. These brief comments are not unnecessary. If, after all, medicinal products have, in many hands, become an end in themselves, and have gone against their original aim, Mrs Grossetête’s approach is a welcome restoration of discipline. I genuinely hope that spirit will remain in this directive up until we have finally achieved a result.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Amendment No 16 concerning the identification of the ingredients of generic drugs is in order, as that will promote a more judicious use of them, that is to say, generic substitution. It is a question of using medicinal products rationally and exploiting the price potential of medicines in official drug substitution systems after medicinal product patents expire. Patients’ contributions also go down when they are put on medicines that are similar to, but cheaper than, the original ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Promoting the use of generic drugs fully meets with the European Union’s objectives in the areas of policy on medicinal products and public health. These objectives on the other hand include ensuring the supply of medicines that are new and regarded as important in terms of their therapeutic value to the patients that need them. These medicinal products are patent protected and in general expensive. Experience in my country, Finland, and in many others has shown that practice with regard to prescribing medicines does not move sufficiently in the direction of cheaper alternative medicinal products or alternative imported products unless there is guidance in the shape of government action, in other words, legislation. Such guidance comes in the form of <span class="italic">inter alia </span>reference price systems, doctors’ own budgets for medicinal products, and generic substitution.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I should like to thank those of my colleagues responsible for tabling Amendment Nos 95, which obliges manufacturers to guarantee an adequate supply of medicinal products to wholesalers. Restrictions on supplies, as practised by some manufacturers of pharmaceuticals, cause problems for wholesalers of medicinal products and, ultimately, the patient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know if it is a divine right, as has been said, but it is, in any case, an unassailable right.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, the rapporteurs have – virtually – achieved the impossible. In other words, first of all, they have reconciled the interests of the patient in terms of independent information, safety and rapid access to generic products, even though, in my view, we could certainly have gone much further. That said, the compromises in this area are still acceptable. Next, they have helped to control the budget of insurance companies and health insurers, because, although health is non-negotiable, it comes at a price which is rocketing, due to the progress being made in medicine, the army of pharmaceutical products available and the ageing population. Last, but by no means least, they have managed to preserve the interests of the pharmaceutical firms whose concerns over data exclusivity and financial resources invested in research have been taken on board. I do not believe their competitiveness will suffer as a result, because I know that, through competition, we are also protecting the jobs that these firms provide.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromises reached in the Committee on the Environment actually manage to reflect the specific nature of the European social model, which attempts to ally social issues with competition. I am particularly pleased by the rejection of all advertising of prescription-only medicines, which acknowledges their unique character and prevents a dramatic rise in their use.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still two contentious points, but these merit our attention as they are more scientific in nature. The first concerns the renewal of the five-yearly revision of the marketing authorisation of the medicinal product, which is yet to be resolved. Too many previous examples, however, such as thalidomide, show us that the side effects of a medicinal product can last for much longer than five years and, in addition, developments in medicine happen so quickly that treatment for the same condition can swiftly change. This problem cannot always be prevented by pharmacovigilance, even though it is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is the idea of added therapeutic value for a new medicinal product. This simple idea, very different from the cost-benefit ratio, should however be understood by researchers within the pharmaceutical industry. Since, what use is an innovation if it cannot demonstrate its therapeutic advantage? If we agree to allow pharmaceutical companies to recoup their investment in research through the cost of the product, we have a right to expect that they will do this by adapting to the most widely-used scientific criteria. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Yet I also have a healthy scepticism towards both the pharmaceutical industry and our exaggerated confidence in some of its products, many of which cause a great deal more harm than the illegal recreational drugs which attract the bulk of public attention. For that reason, it would be wrong to place more unnecessary burdens and regulations upon food supplements and the health-food shops that sell them. Many believe these products to be beneficial, and at least they do not cause harm. I regard homeopathic medicines in the same way.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have more patients who are better informed than ever before – that is a good thing. I want people to have access to objective information about medicines and treatment. However, that is quite different from opening the door to the direct advertising of medicines.

These proposals will also give a continuing boost to research, making research worthwhile again and also enabling manufacturers of generic drugs to make a living. I also believe that these proposals will make it possible to take advantage of all the options for maintaining public health.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonising data exclusivity in the European Union will particularly promote research, and at the same time make the task of generic drug manufacturers easier. I fully support this and those affected should not need to make any further demands. However, as I see it, extending the centralised authorisation procedure for medicinal products, as advocated by the Commission in committee, is not in accordance with the principles that have been mentioned. The present twofold authorisation procedure fully meets the requirements of the internal market and guarantees a greater variety of medicinal products, and with lower charges.</p>
<p class="contents">The new plan to impose use of the centralised procedure for products with new active substances will undermine competition between the authorisation procedures. We can include as many processing deadlines as we like in the regulation, but without any competition these figures are meaningless. I know a great many SMEs that carry out research and in particular companies that are doing research and development in the field of ‘orphan drugs’ or veterinary medicines. That is where active substances of this kind are developed. Authorisation for these would have to be applied for in London, and I believe that these companies cannot afford that, nor can they put it into practice. So what we will end up achieving is to halt this kind of research, which really is not acceptable. We should therefore refuse to support the change proposed here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As many colleagues have said, pharmaceutical products are like no other. We must guarantee that these products are all safe and effective. Therefore, on the debate on the centralised procedure, I believe we must have flexibility. We should not restrict choice but allow for choice and support flexibility between the two routes.</p>
<p class="contents">On the renewal of authorisation, I oppose the Commission's proposal to remove five-year renewal of marketing authorisation and rely on enhanced pharmaco-vigilance to ensure product safety and, indeed, exclusivity. I think the compromise which has been reached is a fair one.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Committee on the Environment has rejected direct consumer advertising. We must be very clear that we all want patients to be informed. We all want patients to make informed decisions – no one can argue with this. But we cannot have what happens in the US, where the ten most advertised drugs are the ten best selling drugs. This is where the amendments adopted in committee requesting a report and the question of how information to patients is used and enhanced are so important. Information to patients from the industry varies from excellent approaches and partnership with patients to situations where some patient organisations are being accused of being mere fronts for the industry. We must get the balance right.</p>
<p class="contents">We have an opportunity in the review to do this, to improve research, to secure jobs, to improve availability of products to patients and improve information given to patients.

They have been a great help to many patients. One example is the modern medicines to combat heart failure, which have not only increased survival rates but have also radically increased the quality of life for sufferers.</p>
<p class="contents">When, twenty years ago, I was a newly-qualified general practitioner, the information available to me on medicines used to be locked away to prevent unauthorised access. Much has happened since then. Today, everyone with access to the Internet and with sufficient linguistic ability can find out about treatment principles and information on medicines. This trend is good for healthcare as well as being a requirement from patient organisations. The trend certainly places higher demands on doctors, but a doctor will achieve the best relationship with a patient who is well informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, trying to block or limit information to patients ties in very poorly with the principles of transparency in modern healthcare.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comment on Mr Rod and the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance: Your proposal for double testing of medicines is not just poor but could even be dangerous.

The Commission’s proposal to allow a data protection period of ten years must, in my opinion, remain a solid, immovable pillar. This position is well-balanced and will provide European industry with new incentives and impetus to continue to invest new resources in the development of more effective, safer medicinal products and make them competitive at international level at last.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel it is important to have a sufficiently long period of data protection for well-known medicinal products too, wherever there are new therapeutic indications. As I said before, I do not support the line taken regarding the membership of the management board, which I believe should be made up solely of institutional representatives. I therefore call upon you, Commissioner, and the Council to come up with a balanced model for a management board which can work calmly, free from dispute or conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">I am amazed, reading Amendments Nos 153 and 154, for example, to see that the directive still mentions ‘traditional herbal medicinal products’. I am the rapporteur of another report on traditional herbal medicinal products, and so I do not support Amendments Nos 153 and 154.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Mr President, I am in favour of removing the requirement to re-license products every five years. This is an excessively bureaucratic burden. I hope that we will, at last, have a system of active pharmacovigilance operating throughout the territory which will allow us to introduce continuous monitoring carried out by highly qualified experts – Europe is teeming with clinical pharmacologists – to ensure that any toxic side effects are made known as soon as they occur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Tomorrow we will be voting on the most important revision package to date as regards legislation on medicinal products in the European Union. The key objectives here are as follows: first, achieving a high level of health protection and giving patients rapid access to innovative products; second, the quality, safety and effectiveness of medicinal products in Europe; and, third, further dismantling existing barriers to trade within the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Medicinal products need to be used appropriately and correctly. That is why it is vital for the law to make a clear distinction between information and advertising. All product information should be scientifically checked before it is published. Provisions relating to medicinal products should only apply to products that have a therapeutic benefit and are used therapeutically. Any overlap with food law should be avoided in order to obviate legal uncertainty. For this reason a clear definition of medicinal products and food is urgently needed, as provided for in Amendments Nos 11 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">The achievements of industrial research as regards innovative therapeutic uses should be recognised by means of appropriate data exclusivity for what are termed ‘original products’. I am, however, also supporting Amendment No 40, which grants existing medicinal products an additional three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication. Generic drugs, which must of course meet all requirements as regards quality, safety and effectiveness, should also be established in the European market and it should be possible to market them as soon as the period of protection for the original drug has expired.</p>
<p class="contents">The authorisation procedure is to retain the option of choice between the centralised and decentralised procedures, which has existed since 1995. It has resulted in a marked increase in the efficiency of the authorisation procedures and has not led to the polarisation that some feared. It is essential that mutual recognition should continue for the sake of Europe's small and medium-sized enterprises. We need to create a system that promotes innovation in the interests of all patients.</p>

The whole debate on pharmaco-vigilance versus the compulsory five-year review, and the question of whether to centralise the registration procedure or keep the centralised, national and mutual recognition procedures is critical. With certain necessary changes, we have almost got it right. It is very important that all citizens have equal access to state-of-the-art drugs, regardless of where they live in Europe. It is either a single market or it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to Irish cattle. It is very important that they should have access to the same veterinary medicines as UK cattle, but at the moment they do not.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to get the balance right with access to generic medicines and innovation and research and the needs of the pharmaceutical companies. This also applies to the Commission proposal on POM, prescription only medicines. I would ask the Commissioner to take on board the compromise suggested by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which gets the balance right in this area, because the Commission proposal has caused major problems in many countries, particularly the UK and Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The MRL regulation of 1990 came into force in 1992, and there was a derogation for many countries until 1 January 2000. This resulted in hundreds of veterinary medicine products being removed from the market and huge welfare problems in Europe for minor animal species – including horses – for many years. Industry needs to be allowed to place on the market equine veterinary products that do not have MRLs, to be used according to the cascade principle, with a record of treatment and exclusion from the food chain. Amendment No 65 is necessary, as it ties this principle, which was endorsed by the Committee on the Environment's Amendment No 10, to the passport decision 2000/68/EEC, which amends Decision 93/623/EEC.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask Commissioner Liikanen to look particularly at the passport decision 2000/68/EEC. We must be consistent here. As well as listening to the able people in the DG, please listen to the veterinary experts in the field and in research. No consumer wants to inflict unnecessary pain and suffering on animals for the sake of the food chain, or make criminals of our vets. We have made mistakes here before. Please be careful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, there are a few points on which I differ. One point was not mentioned in the debate at all, although I believe it to be very important: the Commission has proposed that prescriptions would also be required for medicinal products under the decentralised procedure. I believe that this is a step in the right direction, but we should not throw out the baby with the bathwater. I think we need to be careful about ending up in a situation where all medical products that are at present available over the counter require prescriptions, because that would certainly create problems for consumers and would impose unreasonable costs on the health system. I therefore urge you to support Amendment No 151, which I have tabled jointly with several of my colleagues.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important point has already been mentioned many times, but we cannot consider it often enough. We need to come to an arrangement that is acceptable for small and medium-sized pharmaceutical companies. We cannot adopt legislation that, ultimately, only global players like Pfizer can comply with. We need rules that are appropriate for SMEs. In this connection there are a number of important issues, such as the amendment tabled by Mr Nisticò. Three years' data exclusivity in the event of a new indication is something that SMEs are perhaps in a better position to implement than data exclusivity for a totally new substance.</p>
<p class="contents">In committee, I spoke against the pilot project on information and advertising, as I simply cannot understand why the information provided should be extended for three special indications but with far tighter rules in other areas. We need information for all indications and all diseases, and advertising for prescription medicines should be totally ruled out. That is why I agree with the conclusion reached by the committee. However, the committee overshot the mark on a couple of points, so that information that the pharmaceutical industry is allowed to provide now would in future no longer be permissible. We need to sort that out in tomorrow's vote.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I wish to call on the Commission to bring forward a proposal on medical product safety for children as soon as possible. I know that the Commission officials here today and the Commissioner himself regard this as a very important subject, but we have already been waiting too long for a definite legislative proposal. I urge you to present one before the year is out.</p>

I hope, along with the Commission, that marketing authorisations for new active substances are issued by means of the centralised procedure, and I would like to reiterate to my fellow Members, particularly to those from Germany, the example of orphan medicinal products.</p>
<p class="contents">You will, without doubt, remember that at the beginning of our mandate, we voted in favour of a regulation on orphan medicinal products, which allow us to treat rare conditions. The policy on orphan medicinal products, which is a genuine success at European level, stipulates that all market authorisation applications for these medicinal products shall be issued through the centralised procedure. Given that research in the area of orphan medicinal products is carried out by small and medium-sized companies, it follows that all SMEs can use the marketing authorisation application, under the centralised procedure, managed by the European Agency in London. Your argument in favour of the decentralised procedure in the area of new active substances is therefore unfounded, and has no bearing on our discussion today. Think about that.</p>
<p class="contents">At tomorrow’s vote, think about what you will say to any of your fellow citizens who asks you what you have done. Have I really voted to provide better health protection? Have I really tried to achieve the essential objective, namely to improve public health? Have I done everything I can and voted in such a way as to achieve this goal? Ladies and gentlemen, I therefore urge you to think carefully about the vote you will take tomorrow. We simply must encourage improvements in the area of health and promote equality amongst citizens in healthcare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, today's debate has been very instructive and shows the great commitment of many honourable Members of this House to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of interesting issues have been raised. I want to tackle those raised by Members who are still here in the Chamber. It is unfortunate that often Members have disappeared when it is time for me to reply – I hope this is not an improper comment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will comment on six groups of amendments. Firstly, on the extension of the scope of the centralised procedure. Mrs Grossetête put the whole case very well. The whole idea behind this procedure is to guarantee that goods are delivered quickly, equitably and in the interest of all patients in Europe. If we do not have a centralised procedure by the time the ten new Member States join, there will be enormous inequality.</p>
<p class="contents">We take the comment on the SMEs very seriously and, for that reason, we are ready to seek concrete measures that would alleviate the burden on SMEs, for instance, a reduction in fees, direct scientific advice from the agency in London or administrative support.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is also convinced that extended scope for the centralised procedure for human and veterinary medicine would benefit European citizens and businesses alike. For that reason, the Commission cannot accept amendments which reduce the scope of the centralised procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question is the balance between innovation and competition from generics. That is a very sensitive issue. I would be happy to discuss that in depth. In regard to the American system, as Mrs Corbey mentioned, we must remember that we cannot take just one point of comparison. In America, the drugs market is totally deregulated and there is direct consumer advertising. We are not proposing that. It is through data protection that we are trying to strike a balance. We are proposing something that the Commission refused to propose for years – namely the Bola system for generics which, of course, means more competition in the sector after the expiry of a patent and, at the same time, lower prices and lost revenue for those who originated the medicine. It is clearly better for the consumer. It is extremely important that we stick to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, at the same time, to counterbalance it, we want to propose a solution for exclusivity involving a ten-year period and, if there are indications needing to be researched into later, ten plus one.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that European industries have been losing market share, that there are less innovative medicines and research in this field, and that this is in the interests of European patients. I just do not believe it. I am sure that we must try to accept that there are two or three public goods we can defend at the same time. Public health takes top priority but we must also support research innovation in Europe. If we do not support it we are going to be in permanent decline in all sectors. Research-intensive areas are those which create jobs, development and wealth and make it possible to assume our global responsibilities. So both are issues we must try to tackle at the same time. The balance is not always easy. We have done this after very careful consideration.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few amendments seeking to change this and we will oppose them. For instance, Amendment No 34 wants to go further in favour of generics and weaken the position of innovation. To keep the balance, we cannot support it. On the other hand, Amendments Nos 40 and 92 call for additional data protection of three years in two situations. Firstly, when a new indication is developed for an old medicine, and secondly, when a company submits documentation for switching a product from prescription to non-prescription status. These amendments must be seen in the whole context of the data-protection scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the additional data protection on switching, we agree that this request is not unjustified. This could increase the availability of over-the-counter medicines. We can therefore accept Amendment No 92 in principle, but we still retain our right to look at the duration of that additional protection.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the additional data protection for old products is concerned, this entails a proposal that could extend data protection far beyond ten years – up to 14 years, to be precise. That is why we cannot support Amendment No 40.</p>
<p class="contents">The third issue concerns improving information for patients. I feel a little uncomfortable with this debate because I am also against the proposal that many Members oppose, namely the American model. For instance, one Member said that in America the ten most used pharmaceuticals are the ones that are the most advertised. Among the five most advertised medicines at least, no one would have a right to take part in even the pilot project.</p>
<p class="contents">A pilot project does not mean direct advertising. It is only information validated by the competent authorities which can be given at the request of the patient or patients' organisations. It is right that people are against the American direct-to-consumer advertising. That is not what we are proposing.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a situation where abundant information is available on the web, which is not validated and makes the consumer extremely unsure, which concentrates on products which are not on the market and which confuses many citizens when they visit their doctors. Because we cannot stop it, we want to offer the possibility of access to information validated by clear guidelines, accepted by the Community and monitored, observed and controlled by the Medicines Evaluation agency. I understand that people are against the American system, but we have never proposed it. That is why we cannot support Amendment No 101 and others aiming at the same objective.</p>
<p class="contents">The fourth issue concerns relative effectiveness. Some amendments relate to relative effectiveness. They suggest that the added therapeutic value should be considered as a criterion for the authorisation of a medicinal product – alongside quality, safety and efficacy. The Commission agrees that the issue of relative effectiveness is of great importance because it can help the kind of innovation that brings important benefits to patients.</p>
<p class="contents">An authorisation depends on a positive benefit/risk ratio, on the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicine itself, on its own merit. Relative effectiveness is not a reason to deny access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can support the idea that relative effectiveness should be considered at EU level, and can accept in principle some related amendments, like Amendments Nos 4 and 100. The Commission cannot, however, accept amendments that establish relative effectiveness as a fourth hurdle for marketing authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fifth group of amendments concerns legal status. The Commission proposes that the conditions of supply – over-the-counter or prescription-only – should be determined under the mutual recognition procedure. This would obviously lead to a harmonised EU legal status for all products authorised accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate to include legal status in the mutual recognition procedure. But the Commission understands the concerns that this might lead to a situation where too many products are classified as prescription-only medicines because of a 'lowest common denominator' effect among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the European Medicines Evaluation Agency, our proposal follows the lines which were provided for the European Food Safety Authority at the time of our proposal. Amendment No 16 aligns the EMEA Management Board with the model finally adopted for the Food Safety Authority, and the Commission can support this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me just briefly reiterate that Parliament is provided in writing with a full list of the Commission’s positions on each of the amendments<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This development must be supported without jeopardising the operation of the national health systems and whilst respecting the need for maximum safety.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to medicinal products for human use, Amendment No 71, which I tabled, fully supports this approach. It aims to learn lessons from the tragic ‘Bayer affair’ at the very time when the problems posed by the molecule cerivastatin have been raised once again in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reflect on the need to standardise the procedures that apply to clinical and pre-clinical trials. If the traceability of the marketing procedure were better assured, the safety of European patients would become more reliable.</p>
<p class="contents">A credible application of the centralised procedure for marketing medicinal products cannot work without this sort of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">I am opposed, however, to the full withdrawal of the decentralised procedure to the exclusive benefit of the centralised marketing procedure. The choice between these two systems must be maintained so that the European Agency does not remove the prerogatives of our national agencies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
