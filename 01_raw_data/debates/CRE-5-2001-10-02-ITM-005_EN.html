<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Titley (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, 11 September showed us that the world we live in is very insecure. We discovered that the world's security, stability and economy are much more fragile than we previously believed. Wherever we look – whether at the fight against terrorism, the horrors of the Balkans, the nightmare of a small town in Switzerland, the virtual anarchy in parts of Africa – one common theme emerges everywhere: the huge number of weapons which are freely available. That is one of the main causes of instability in the world, and we must act before the tidal wave of weaponry overwhelms us all.</p>
<p class="contents">The Code of Conduct on Arms Exports was a significant development in controlling this trade. It is clear from the second annual report that there is rapidly growing cooperation between Member States, both in terms of implementing the code and of achieving greater mutual understanding of the interpretation of the code. It is also clear that arms export policy in relation to security is becoming more closely aligned.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much greater transparency in arms controls policies. Most EU States, except for Austria, Greece and Luxembourg, now produce their own annual reports, albeit with a huge variance in the quality of information provided. It is worth noting that the NGOs' Safer World holds up the UK's annual report, first introduced by the then Foreign Secretary, Robin Cook, as an example for other countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The code's influence goes beyond the EU: all the accession countries, the EEA, EFTA States, Canada and Turkey now subscribe to the code's principles. Member States are also seeking to apply those principles in wider international fora.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be a mistake to underestimate the importance of what has been achieved or the considerable mindshift that is taking place among Member States in this field. Nonetheless, there are areas where the code needs to be strengthened. The principles of the code will be constantly undermined if action is not taken to control and license arms brokers. It is beyond belief that in many countries you need a licence to own a shotgun but not to trade in weapons of any type. Some arms brokers are legitimate businesses; many, however, are little more than merchants of death. Action in this field must be an absolute priority. Similarly, controlling the activities of EU armaments companies will inevitably be compromised by the uncontrolled licensing of production outside the EU. We further need a more harmonised system of end-use data provision, certification and enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">Controls of official exports are important, but the illegal trade in arms is our biggest problem. I welcome the work of Member States towards a UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons, reminding Parliament that the definition includes things like shoulder-carried, anti-aircraft missiles.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much regret the attitude of the USA to that conference and the influence of its gun lobby. We can only hope that recent events will cause the USA to reflect on the need for global partnerships to remove the causes of insecurity. We must have a global crackdown on this illegal trade.</p>
<p class="contents">Greater transparency is the guardian of our security in this field. Despite the rapid advances made, I would like to see all countries producing publicly available annual export reports in a commonly agreed format. The Council's annual report ought to be more detailed, as I have set out in my report. We would naturally encourage greater scrutiny of arms policies by Member State parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that last year Member States agreed a Common List of Military Equipment to which the code applies. We now need a common list of non-military security and police equipment, and I am happy to accept the amendments on that subject. The list, however, has to be meaningful and provide the basis of effective action in this field and not be a statement of general intent.</p>
<p class="contents">We will not win the war on terrorism – which we are all talking about at the moment – unless we control arms, the tools of this deadly trade. That is the challenge confronting us now and it is even more important today than it was this time last year when we debated the first annual report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Hecke, Johan (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, first of all I should like to congratulate Mr Titley on his very sound and constructive report. His efforts, as well as useful contributions by other fellow MEPs, have enabled this Parliament to reach more or less consensus on an otherwise very sensitive issue: the control of the arms trade.</p>
<p class="contents">In light of the attacks in America, there is growing awareness of the fact that the vast distribution of arms worldwide leads to unstable countries which form the breeding ground for terrorism. The Titley report rightly points out that the 1998 EU Code is a major step forward towards a more coherent and transparent European policy on arms exports.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, a number of shortcomings and flaws have been flagged, five of which I should like mention.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the annual reports of the Member States are not harmonised. Some countries, including Great Britain and Ireland, give a detailed account of the permits issued and of the amount and value of exported arms. Other countries, such as Austria and Greece, give no information whatsoever about the licences issued. In that way, an efficient, effective assessment is, of course, difficult. The annual report would, therefore, need to meet a number of standards. Each permit issued should be accompanied by a detailed description of the material, the addressee and end user. For permits refused, the reason for refusal should be explained in more detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, in my opinion, the monitoring procedures concerning the end user of the exported arms should be stepped up. In Africa, Togo and Burkina Faso are officially the end users of arms supplied from Bulgaria, whilst in reality, these are passed on to Liberia and the rebels of Sierra Leone. Embassies of EU Member States could play a more supervisory role <span class="italic">in situ</span>. Penal measures should also be introduced for transit countries that violate arms embargos.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, I am of the opinion that tighter controls should be in place for the production of military equipment under licence abroad by EU companies or in the framework of industrial joint venture agreements. It is not acceptable for a certain country to be refused a licence for weapons and for arms manufacturers to be able to circumvent that ban by supplying arms components which are then assembled on site.</p>
<p class="contents">A fourth shortcoming is that there is no control whatsoever on private arms dealers, the number of which is rising all the time since the end of the cold war. Of the five hundred million light arms in circulation worldwide, forty to sixty percent of these are illegal, according to the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">A final serious shortcoming of the EU Code of Conduct is that it is not legally binding. At the moment, it is a no-strings-attached gentlemen’s agreement. Sanctions cannot be imposed on those who breach the Code.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to express the hope that the EU Code of Conduct will form the basis for a worldwide code on the export of arms. It makes no sense whatsoever for Europe to be committed to controlling the arms trade, while China and Russia continue to export weapons to crisis areas without any restrictions. In that sense, the UN Conference in July was a missed opportunity, and I believe that this topic must remain a permanent feature in the transatlantic dialogue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wiersma (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Mr Titley has lived up to his reputation and has produced an excellent report on the Code of Conduct concerning arms exports, on which we would like to congratulate him. Needless to say, the report receives the full backing of the Group of the Party of European Socialists. That is why I should not so much like to confine myself to the technicalities of the report, but rather to a number of general observations.</p>
<p class="contents">On 11 September, the first reports rolled in about the horrific attacks in the United States during the vote of the Titley report in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. The European Union has reacted adequately and coherently. All available means are being deployed right across the pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">One would wish for the same promptness of action in other areas too. The EU can do anything if it puts its mind to it. Where the arms export is concerned, we have to make do with a Code of Conduct which is considerably restricted by Article 296 of the EC Treaty which protects national security interests. That is such a vague concept that Member States, if they so wish, can more or less do their own thing. In fact, it has never been clear to me in what way national security interests can be different from those of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The arms export agreements are also typified by a large degree of voluntariness, but also, for example, by inconsistent agreements on the end use of exported arms. That is why an EU-wide and effective approach is lacking. Not all relevant information is made available, which obstructs the transparency of the policy. Annual reports are useful, but joint action is preferable, of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Titley’s report mentions a few areas which require attention, such as the destabilising distribution of hand-held weapons. That causes great chaos in some parts of the world. The trade in these weapons also sustains phenomena such as child soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">My group would like to turn this into a priority, also in cooperation with the candidate countries, the countries of the Stability Pact and countries such as Ukraine and Russia, for we know that many of the hand-held weapons which are in circulation in the world originate from those countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must make every effort, together with those countries, to tackle the often criminal trade in weapons. Here too we require a new international coalition. In the light of 11 September, it is important to tighten the agreements on the export of so-called dual-use goods.</p>
<p class="contents">I am curious about the discussions which are undoubtedly already taking place behind the scenes. The citizens would like to know how the export policy will be adopted to prevent the wrong expertise from falling into the wrong hands. I would quote the reports on terrorism and the use of weapons of mass destruction in this connection. Here too, better cooperation with Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">What will happen to the export of encryption software? Will new arrangements be made in this connection? The least we can ask from the Council and the Commission is to indicate the role which can improve the organised arms export policy in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as I am concerned, the debate on Article 296 can be re-opened. Arms export must form an integral part of the new EU security policy. Only then will it be truly effective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McKenna (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome much of what is in the report, particularly the need for transparency, the issue dealing with the end use of weapons and the illegal trade in arms. As Mr Titley mentioned, the control of small arms is important. It is a major problem, as we have seen from the tragic events in Switzerland.</p>
<p class="contents">There needs to be a mechanism to control non-military security and police equipment. But I do not support the idea of a European defence industry and we need to look at getting rid of the defence industry. The recent tragic events in the United States have actually given a shot in the arm to the arms industries. I will mention one in particular because it is relevant to Ireland, and that is Raytheon. This company has seen a 40% jump in share prices as a result of the events of 11 September and thereafter.</p>
<p class="contents">We must look at the whole issue of arms production in the first place. I mentioned Raytheon because it is ironic that, in spite of the peace process in Northern Ireland, Nobel peace prize winners stood on a platform welcoming into Derry Raytheon, one of the world's biggest arms manufacturing companies. It is appalling to encourage manufacturers of weapons, or their components, into a place where people are killing each other every day with weapons so that these products can then be transported to other parts of the world to cause havoc and deprivation. We do not want peace here and wars in other parts of the world. We should look at ending the trade in weapons completely and the idea of government support for an industry that is responsible for death and destruction around the world is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards torture weapons, we have a situation where these weapons are being sent to certain parts of the world with an EU stamp on them. This is completely unacceptable. In my own country, Ireland, there has in recent times been an increase in the arms industry, mainly involving US-based arms manufacturing. This manufacturing comprises mainly components, but irrespective of whether components or end-use weapons are concerned, we should not accept the production of weapons. There are far more beneficial ways of creating employment for people in a given area than the production of something that is used to kill another human being. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are some aspects of the report that we do not agree with, such as that referring to the defence industry, but, generally speaking, this effort to achieve transparency and for the EU to play a crucial, I would say leading, role in the process of world disarmament and also in achieving peace is positive, and, for this reason, we think that it is a good report.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are various aspects that could be improved, especially following the sad events of 11 September, since when North America has been promoting the indiscriminate sale of arms to all those it considers to be potential allies in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We think that this is an appropriate moment to adopt clearly transparent behaviour that would avoid these double standards, and for this reason we, through our colleague Mr Brie, have tabled several amendments which seek specifically to prevent such problems – such as cases, for example, in which arms are indirectly sold to countries that contravene EU agreements through third countries, as is the case, for example, with Turkey, or Israel, bombing or attacking the Palestinians, or Pakistan. For this reason it would be a good idea to have more control over these sales.</p>
<p class="contents">We also think that it is important – as stated by Mr Titley in his speech – to include terrorism as an objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we also think it imperative, in order to improve transparency, for the Commission itself to draw up a report that clarifies this series of measures so that the role of the EU can be much greater and more decisive in achieving a world at peace and without arms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now the very concepts of what constitutes a weapon are in doubt, when a civilian aeroplane can become a missile when guided by a murderous ideal. We may be tempted to adopt an attitude which is at once relativist, with regard to the means, and ultra-safe, with regard to actions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say, however, that there is now a greater need than ever to prevent tendencies that are not firmly anchored in politics. Particularly at a time when, as is becoming obvious, we need to speed up the construction of our common foreign and security policy, which must be given the appropriate resources and be supported by an effective shared commitment. This policy must go ahead on the basis of cohesion, which also means trust between Member States, and of coherence between the ideas that are put forward and practical action.</p>
<p class="contents">We are today discussing an issue, arms exports, to which these principles must be applied, today more than ever before. It would, of course, be better if there were no need to discuss weapons, but, unfortunately, the world we live in is not like that. The European Union’s Code of Conduct on arms exports adopted in 1999 is a key instrument for harmonisation and control in this field. With regard to the Council’s second annual report, on implementing this Code of Conduct, the rapporteur himself welcomes the greater transparency and the convergence between Member States arms exports policies and the adoption of common principles by third countries. He also, however, highlights the need to go further, putting an end to illegal sales and exercising greater control over arms dealers’ fees and on the destination of arms. I therefore support the thrust of this report, although once again, I wish to emphasise the need for coherence and cohesion in this field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is also true of a European Code of Conduct. But I hope that the tragic circumstances in which we find ourselves will also galvanise us into action, for example in order to render this Code of Conduct compulsory, as Mr Titley rightly pointed out in his report, and finally to also make progress in supervising the arms trade. For although that is what we intend to do, if we have no control over the end-user certificate, it is impossible to check whether that arms trade is legal or not.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the production under licence by EU countries in third countries is another one of such issues. Ultimately, we will need to reach the stage where we have black lists of countries to which we do not under any circumstance supply weapons.

The UN Conference in July was a failure: in my opinion, the EU should commit itself resolutely once more to enforcing a reduction. As regards transparency, I feel that this is still too superficial and that Parliamentary scrutiny should be obligatory for arms exports.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is no reference to the OCCAT Agreement which actually protects industrial cooperation and is the basis for laws such as Italy’s which make it possible to export arms without infringing human rights rules. Then there is an arms exports control policy which must be in line with European common foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, I consider the Titley report to be important, but I feel – this is my point of view and is not a criticism of the Titley report – that the European Union should, in these tragic times, set itself the target of disarmament, not rearmament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to say that I find the Council report very interesting. This Code of Conduct is also of major importance and this debate is very dignified, although we should ask ourselves how much we are actually achieving. We must have the courage to go deeper into certain complex issues which are still to be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these issues, which has already been mentioned by all those who have spoken, is the need to make this code law, that is to convert it into a legally binding instrument, seeing as, nowadays, everything depends on the good will of the Member States of the European Union, which are even free to decide whether or not to submit an annual report, which not all the Member States have chosen to do.</p>
<p class="contents">Another complex issue which has yet to be resolved is that of a Community system of controlling the end use, the final recipient of the arms exported and the brokers who, in the arms trade, in arms trafficking – the word trafficking may be more appropriate, more to the point – are the real money-makers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a matter of serious concern that all this is not happening, that we do not have such a control facility, bearing in mind, for example, that the Taliban will probably be fighting in Afghanistan with arms supplied by the West, including some of the countries of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the candidate countries. What guarantees will we have that the candidate countries will be able to respect this Code of Conduct properly?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, as regards these questions, there is only one risk, which is engendered by our hypocrisy in disregarding – as has been pointed out – the great difference between a gentleman’s agreement and a law.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore close by reiterating that, until the Code of Conduct becomes law, we will be at fault, and this report’s due reference to the values of democracy and the protection of human rights is likely to be reduced to a mere, ineffective appeal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite this, we must observe that its demands do not reach their target either as regards parliamentary scrutiny or as regards transparency. As far as parliamentary scrutiny is concerned, there is no demand for formal provision for an opinion by the European Parliament, and that is the least we can ask for if we are to have some degree of influence.</p>
<p class="contents">I take an even more critical line on what is said about transparency. Here, Mr Titley speaks of transparency in the form of a framework agreement. We know, however, that the framework agreement between six EU States to promote the defence of industry and of a global defence market is precisely the most opaque procedure ever, that it clasps tightly what it used to give: no parliamentary scrutiny and no debate, even on the conclusion and ratification of this agreement. That must be changed.</p>

Tensions, armed conflict and mutual genocide are being provoked and fomented in order to promote the production and consumption of all sorts of arms and munitions, thereby increasing sales and boosting profits. And governments have no objection; in fact they are doing their utmost here, given that, as we all know, they cream off huge sums of money from manufacturers supplying arms.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever Mr Titley's intentions as rapporteur, in today's general climate of militarisation and warmongering, with a new structure to NATO, with the militarisation of the European Union and, more importantly, with the shameless exploitation of the terrorist attack in the United States, codes like this, even if they do not pull the wool over the people's eyes, are no more than a hypocritical wish list.

As his report and his speech have made clear, the issue of arms exports is tremendously complex and close collaboration is required by everyone in order to address its many different angles.</p>
<p class="contents">There were a number of good speeches in the debate, some of which referred to the relevance of the appalling events of 11 September and their aftermath.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to respond to what Mr Paisley had to say. As he is not in his place, maybe my remarks will be borne to him on angels' wings. I agree with the definitional point he made. It is an enormously important point for us to make. Some of us from Spain or the United Kingdom have personal experience of this; some of us have friends who have been murdered by terrorists. There is no such thing as a good terrorist. There is no distinction between good and bad terrorism. What is a terrorist? A terrorist is a man or woman or, alas, a deluded child who sets out in the morning to murder innocent men, women and children to make a political point – the propaganda of the deed. That is not justified. It is never justified. There are never extenuating circumstances, any more than there are ever extenuating circumstances from extrajudicial killings by a State. So I hope that when we start talking about definitions we will remember what terrorism really is. We will have views about the political roots of terrorism. We will have strong views about the importance of trying to find political solutions to some problems. However, I hope we will not be morally confused about what constitutes a terrorist act.</p>
<p class="contents">During the debate on last year's report, I stated that the ultimate responsibility for arms exports belongs to national governments. However, it is also clear that some aspects of the arms trade lie within the remit of the common foreign and security policy, with which the Commission is fully associated. The Commission is making every effort to move forward with the implementation of those recommendations which lie within Community competence and we stand ready to collaborate with Member States where joint responsibilities are involved, for example when one is talking about dual-use goods.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliament is already aware, the associated countries of central and eastern Europe, Cyprus, Turkey, Malta, and our EEA/EFTA partners have issued declarations through which they align themselves with the criteria and the principles contained in the European Union's Code of Conduct on Arms Exports. The Union has continued to assist the candidates in their efforts to bring their legislation and administration fully into line with the provisions of the code. Furthermore, the European Union continues to urge the world's main arms exporters to subscribe to the principles and criteria developed in our code. We would react most favourably to the idea of drafting an international code of conduct on arms transactions, on the condition that it is based on the same principles as the European Union code.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission strongly supports the honourable Member's call for the establishment of common rules for European Union control of the legal trade in small arms and light weapons, as well as effective European Union controls to combat and eradicate trafficking in these arms. In this respect we welcome the agreement reached at the July 2001 UN Conference on the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons. Although the final text falls well short of the Union's initial expectations, it marks an important step forward. It represents a delicate and hard-fought compromise, which would not have been achievable only a couple of years ago. If all parties involved were to adopt a more positive attitude, the agreement would become a more effective tool for addressing the concerns of all participants in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time the international community has set out some principles for national and international measures which might curb the illegal trade in small arms. They aim to establish reliable controls on the production, export and transit of weapons; to apply reliable markings to them in order to trace their origin more successfully; to criminalise their unlicensed production and trade; to regulate the activities of brokers; and to destroy surplus stockpiles and all confiscated weapons.</p>
<p class="contents">A new conference will be held no later than 2006 – I suspect that recent events may bring that date forward – and in the intervening period, biennial meetings will consider the progress made on turning the objectives of the conclusions into tangible reality. We will work hard with the Member States to ensure an active and ambitious follow-up.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union's commitment to concrete action in the field of small arms is illustrated by a number of projects currently under way or under consideration in different parts of the world. In Cambodia the European Union gives technical, administrative and financial support to the government and selected NGOs for actions aimed at promoting the collection, control and destruction of weapons. We also support Operation Rachel, a joint South Africa-Mozambique project, to collect and destroy arms left over since the civil war. We provide equipment to the Georgian and Ossetian police forces as part of a programme which consists of the voluntary handover and subsequent destruction of small arms in the region. We also support the UN Regional Centre for Peace, Disarmament and Development in Lima, which works to promote the control of small arms in Latin America and the Caribbean. We are also considering further projects in the Balkans, Africa and South Pacific.</p>
<p class="contents">During the past few months Commission services have begun drafting EC legislation on a number of non-military items such as instruments of torture, to which the provisions of the code should, in our view, apply. Work is now near completion, and the Commission intends to submit a proposal to the Council soon. This marks a first step in tackling the issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Compilation of a more extended list, which might include items that also have civilian uses – instruments of internal repression such as riot-control equipment, for example – would require the commitment of significant additional resources. If we are going to take on such a task – which involves establishing the eventual end use of the items and, perhaps, the identity of the end user – then we shall need more resources. However we will, of course, pay careful attention to what Parliament has to say on that issue. Progress in that field is conditional on the willingness of Member States and Parliament to make additional resources available for these purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">So I repeat our gratitude to the honourable Member, Mr Titley, for an important report. I hope that year by year we can continue to respond constructively to what he has to say.</p>
<p class="contents">Anybody who looks at the violence around the world, the violence often associated with the breakdown of States, from Somalia to Sudan, to Sierra Leone, to Afghanistan; anybody who looks at the situation created by the breakdown of States knows how much the trade and small arms is responsible for continuing the violence and making the violence far more lethal. So this report is an important one, and I hope we can respond to it over the coming months and years with appropriately constructive behaviour. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
