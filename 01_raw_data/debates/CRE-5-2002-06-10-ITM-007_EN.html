The consequences for the air transport sector of 11 September appear to have been almost overcome, and annual growth rates of up to 5% are again being assumed, which means that air travel will increase twofold by 2015. Whilst we are responding in political terms to this challenge by creating a single European sky, we still need greater capacity at our overstretched airports. There is also a need for more airport infrastructure, but none of us can seriously imagine that we might manage to double the number of runways by 2015, and so we have to generate additional capacity. It is vital that this be done by as efficient as possible a system of allocating takeoff and landing rights on overloaded airports. The old Regulation on slots dates back to 1993 and can no longer cope with present-day challenges; its lack of precision meant that it was not uniformly applied by the Member States. It failed to guarantee fair and transparent allocation of slots, put new applicants at a disadvantage and gave rise to problems such as illicit trading in slots. The Commission proposal on new rules for the allocation of slots is a necessary intermediate step. A final regulation must result from discussions over the next few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though the intermediate step we are taking today appears to many to mainly bring with it technical improvements to details of the old Regulation, it does at the same time have political implications that are necessary from the point of view of regulatory policy and will seem to some people to have a very broad scope. At this point, I would like to thank the members of the committee for their fine cooperation and their concentration on the issues. Despite some differences of opinion, we have succeeded in keeping the balance of the regulatory package as a whole before our eyes. Our improvements to the Commission proposal are intended to make the Commission text more precise, to establish standard European criteria for granting the status of coordinated airports, to further enhance the coordinator's authority and independence, to retain flexibility and security in terms of planning for established air carriers and to promote the new applicants' flexibility and opportunities for gaining access to the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say something about the individual points. Firstly, at the heart of the Regulation lies a new definition of the slots as a right of usage, and thus the property neither of airlines, nor of airports, but rather a public good. The committee has additionally stipulated that the whole of the airport infrastructure required for a flight falls within the definition of a right of usage. We have for the first time pointed out the connection between airway slots and airport slots, which will make it easier to synchronise the two in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is uncontentious but not, for that reason, insignificant. We have further strengthened the position of the coordinator, freeing him from any obligations to pay compensation, which I believe to be indispensable to his independence. We have defined his competences more clearly over against the coordination committee; he has the right to withhold slots if airlines fail to comply with their duty to provide information, and he is entitled to compare his data with other coordinators and schedules facilitators in order to bring to light any inconsistencies in schedules.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should discuss the established airlines' legitimate interests. Contrary to the Commission proposal, we are in favour of them continuing to have the option of re-timing in order to progressively optimise their schedules. We have widened the exceptions to the ‘use-it-or-lose-it’<span class="italic"> </span>rule in order to be able to take the impact of events like those of 11 September, for example, and we have set aside the Commission's proposal that ‘grandfather rights’ should be linked to the size of aircraft, believing as we do that the companies need greater flexibility, which is desirable both for economic and environmental reasons. The alternative would no doubt have been counterproductive.</p>
<p class="contents">I turn, fourthly, to the legitimate interests of the new carriers. The Commission's definition of new applicants was, admittedly, not agreeable to many of the established airlines, but we consider it right in principle, as there is a fundamental contradiction between the concentration process which can be observed in air transport and the competition for routes that liberalisation is actually seeking to bring about. We have tightened up the definition of new applicants in order further to strengthen them and make it easier for them to transfer and exchange slots.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, where there are clear rules, there must also be the possibility of sanctions. We have laid it down that slots can be withdrawn after one warning if they are being misused. Member States can also impose fines.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to end with a glance into the future. Many members of the committee wanted to have new fundamental rules as soon as possible, and that I can understand, as the intermediate step we are taking today does not yet satisfy the need for renewal. However, the effects of this Regulation need first to be evaluated, as the air transport market is both a highly sensitive area and one of great importance to the economy, making a rush job inappropriate. We also still have time – which we need – to seek the consent of the main actors in the air transport market. The study on models for the allocation of slots, produced at the Commission's behest, has speeded up, but certainly not yet completed, this process of reaching a consensus.</p>
<p class="contents">Our attempt at finding air transport a place in the logic of optimising transport overall could not, unfortunately, be enshrined in the Regulation on slots. I think that is a pity, but we should not lose sight of this facet of future legislation. I hope that the report will get as big a majority in plenary tomorrow as it did in the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Foster (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, firstly I should like to thank Mr Stockmann, the rapporteur, for meeting with me and organising the seminar last December in Brussels. It was clear then that all sides of industry, including airlines large and small, airports and others, fully supported the update of Regulation 95/93, in other words the technical revision, but believed that changing the rules on market access at this stage were premature and the consequences had not been thought through.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is both complex and contentious. It is obvious that there is a gulf between us on some of the key elements. It is the point that attempts to deal with these proposals, slot definition, market access issues, slot transferability and new entrants, etc., that should have been considered in a second phase. I will highlight some of the particular difficulties later.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only is the inclusion of these elements uncalled for in Phase I, but some will also reduce the much-needed flexibility required in the system. The amendments initially submitted by myself and some of my colleagues were designed to maintain and enhance the flexibility in the system that all airlines currently have, which works to the advantage of passengers. To remove those rights, as proposed by the Commission, would be severely detrimental to the system and cause it to break down.</p>
<p class="contents">I and others have re-tabled three key amendments, which will be voted on tomorrow. These deal with the slot allocation process and the slot exchanges between carriers. I hope the House will support them.</p>
<p class="contents">On a general point, it is worth reminding the Commission that the definition and use of a slot cannot be decided in isolation by the European Union. There are 168 slot-coordinated airports worldwide and many third country carriers operating into Europe. Any changes to definition and use would need to be agreed at international level in order not to cause chaos. There is no reference to that in the Commission's proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Initially I deliberately did not get into the argument of slot ownership, not least because it is highly contentious and will, I believe, encounter serious legal challenges. But, whatever the argument, I find it naive to say that the Commission's view that slots belong to the people is bizarre. Perhaps the Commission believes that it should own them on behalf of the people. The fact is that the ownership of the slots should be determined by contracts between parties.</p>
<p class="contents">That brings me to my final point. I believe that a slot is a commodity which should be traded if necessary. This is also the view of the AEA, IATA and fourteen Member States in recognition of the future shortage of airport capacity across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I also strongly disagree with the myth – which is perpetuated – that only the major airlines benefit. This is not the case. It has been proved by the fact that at Heathrow BA's share of slots has declined since secondary trading began over ten years ago. The choice for consumers has drastically improved.</p>
<p class="contents">We need a proposal that will produce a more transparent, more practical, more efficient and effective slot regulation, one that does not harm the legitimate interests of the aviation industry. Unfortunately this is not it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is vital to have careful coordination of slots to improve efficiency and safety at airports. Take-off and landing times are also of considerable economic importance for air carriers. Our group supports the rapporteur’s efforts to adopt the key elements of the Commission proposal: an independent coordinator, priority being given to new entrants, and the legal status of slots specifically as a right of use.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to have a system of allocation of slots that is as flexible as possible for those companies, for example, that do business abroad. The right of Member States to limit ‘grandfather rights’ to operate aircraft of a specified minimum size serves little purpose. Discriminating against small aircraft could, for example, lead to problems for a small country’s traffic heading for another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has tabled two amendments. The purpose of Amendment No 56 is to clarify the Commission proposal regarding the allocation of slots to new entrants. The amendment preserves the idea of priority being given them, but at the same time specifies that priority should be dependent on the number of slots requested. In my opinion, Amendment No 45 weakens the position of new entrants. I would also ask what the Commission’s view is of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has started to take action to avoid congestion at airports. The purpose of the new market mechanisms is to more effectively coordinate supply and demand regarding slots. Finding long-term solutions has nevertheless been a very slow process in recent years. Amendment No 57 represents the desire of our group to have the Commission commit to submitting a more comprehensive proposal on slots. Our group believes the present system must be radically revised. There has to be greater access to the slots market than there is at present. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now – halfway through the Commission’s mandate – this is also evident in practice. This proposal is one of many. The problems in aviation are making themselves felt in the air and at the airports. It seems as if the problems on the ground are less pronounced than they are in the air, but appearances are deceptive, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has nurtured the wish to review the allocation of slots for a long time. The intransparent manner in which these rights have been ‘allocated’ to airline companies to date is not so much creating clarity as raising more questions. This, in fact, touches the very core of this proposal. Namely the question whether these slot rights are 'owned' or constitute a 'right of usage'. I take the view that the latter is the case, given the public nature of airports. If agreement exists in this matter, there is, in my view, no reason to decide on changing the rules of the game at this stage. Indeed, if we have to wait until a general consensus has been reached, a decision might be a long time coming.</p>
<p class="contents">An important line of approach for this proposal is the opportunities offered to newcomers on the market. In the interest of an effectively functioning market, it is necessary that they are afforded the opportunity to join. However, we should remain mindful of the fact that a qualitatively sound network should continue to exist. The policy must be adapted accordingly. The distribution of slots must therefore not result in newcomers being accorded discarded slots only. A good mixture of applications of current providers and newcomers is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, Mr President, that we can largely identify with the Stockmann report as it has been submitted by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. We will support it accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I speak for the majority of my group when I say that my colleague Mrs Foster, for whom I have very high regard, has this evening put forward an opinion held by a minority in our group. The majority in my group, just as in the committee, supports the Commission proposal to unambiguously clarify the legal nature of slots and to finally make clear that trading in slots between one airline and another is illegal and will remain so. As rights of usage, the slots belong neither to the air carriers nor to the airports, and have only an ancillary role. They enable air space to be used efficiently, economically, and in a way that treats the environment with respect, and so my group will be voting against Mrs Foster's three amendments tomorrow, believing as we do that the Commission is very much in the right.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe that the new version of the slot regulation aims at formulating the rules for the allocation of slots in a way that is more transparent and more favourable to competition. Of course, the ‘grandfather rights’ of the existing airlines are to be safeguarded, but only to some extent. We need competition, and I hope that my British colleagues will agree with me on that. We need competition, and so we also need new slots for new air carriers, in order to better organise competition in air travel and for the passengers' benefit.</p>
<p class="contents">The end result is that the coordinators' roles and independence are strengthened. This is to enhance the possibility of taking unused times from the existing airlines and allocating them to others, thus improving the efficiency with which airspace is used in an economical and environmentally friendly way. That is the objective.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Madam Vice-President, please let us conclude by pointing out that I hope that the Council will, under Spanish Presidency, take a significant step in June. We have done our homework. We have, admittedly, produced 52 amendments in committee, but they are in the interests of greater precision. I hope that the Commission will work a miraculous transformation and support most of them.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it strikes me as important that the Council should reach a decision quickly, as we want the revised slots regulation to benefit air carriers, and we want it without delay. Airlines have found themselves in difficulties as a result of the general economic recession and of the events of 11 September. We believe that a revised slots regulation will help airlines, airports and passengers, and so we ask you to support the Stockmann report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one can have the sky to himself. The liberalised airline market makes the free movement of goods and people possible and you can even find your very own flight attendant on board an aircraft, which is what happened to me. We can promote competition through proper control of slots. Mr Stockmann has in my opinion succeeded splendidly in balancing the position of the large dominant companies with the need of new, dynamic companies to exploit their own innovative approach. Consumers and the business world will benefit significantly from this sort of development both in the form of lower prices and new services.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage the Commission has submitted a proposal to us that is slightly larger and broader in scope than the original one, but we cannot wait around for a year in a rapidly developing aviation industry. I therefore earnestly support the approach that has been chosen. It is of crucial importance to open up the market to the new entrants and it is more than fair that they should have half the vacant slots. The slots must also be fairly allocated to foreign companies. Protectionism must have its wings clipped, whatever the cost. Good air connections have intrinsic value, but that is something national airlines cannot have. Monopolies are the poor man’s worst enemy, and new Sabenas simply cannot any longer be supported out of the taxpayer’s pocket.</p>
<p class="contents">Next we must create transatlantic airspace and end the bilateral agreements between the Member States of the EU and the United States of America. The current practice very obviously favours the Americans, and I also expect the Commission to act quickly after the Court of Justice has given a decision in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a lot of room in the airline industry for greater efficiency, and that might be said of us here too in the European Parliament, and for that reason I will end my speech here. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We found the regulation of open skies a very difficult issue. I am also a former director of the second largest airline in Britain.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned to tell you that I left London at one o'clock this afternoon and I arrived here at nine o'clock this evening. That is as a consequence of a complete monopoly on this route to and from London. That is not the reason why I am standing up although I am taking action about what happens to me and my other colleagues from the English contingent regularly when we fly from London to Strasbourg.</p>
<p class="contents">Deregulation is important, competition is important and in Mr Stockmann's report ably shadowed by my colleague, Ms Foster, we have struck a balance of some kind. It is also important to understand that although we want to open things up quickly and deregulate quickly and introduce competition the aviation industry also requires heavy investment. Therefore it is not just like starting a taxi firm to start an airline. I speak as someone who has started two airlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore we have to be careful that we do not destabilise the European aviation industry like the reforms in the United States where the entire American aviation industry went into a tailspin. We must be careful that we do not destabilise it by moving too quickly without carrying industry with us. It requires heavy financial and capital investment to be able to do this and I would like to ask the Commissioner to be careful when she implements some of these proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the current rules relating to slots have worked relatively well considering the extra pressure on the system resulting from the increase in air traffic. But I say ‘relatively’ because the reality is that studies and complaints indicate that, unfortunately, there is often a total lack of transparency in the functioning, the allocation and the development of the use of these slots, and that, furthermore, the various Member States of the Union have not been interpreting the current rules in a uniform manner. Far from it. On this basis, on 20 June 2001, the Commission decided to review the rules and to approach it in two stages. I must point out that all of this coincides with what has been said and repeated in this Parliament on various occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the two stages in which we propose to implement this reform, the first stage is aimed at clarifying the different provisions of the Regulation which, on being applied, have proven to be clearly deficient and have led to differing interpretations amongst the Member States. But furthermore it is a question of resolving a series of deficiencies which have been pointed out to us by the airlines and the airports, and by the different operators. Finally, some of you have pointed out something fundamental: the need to define what a slot is and we clearly opt for defining it as a right of use.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be aware, however, that this is extremely important if we want to achieve legal certainty and move beyond the current situation in which there is nothing, there is no concrete definition of the nature of slots. Because how can we possibly establish a right of ownership, ladies and gentlemen? There are slots for taking off, for landing, but also for overflying. There are no rights of ownership, but rights of use in relation to a public asset such as airspace, the take-off and landing possibilities other than the facilities of the airports or the areas to be overflown in accordance with the support and assistance provided to air traffic from different locations.</p>
<p class="contents">While this is the first stage, which is essentially technical – and I thank Mr Deva for saying that we have achieved a good balance, for that is what I believe we are doing – the second stage is the revision of the possibilities for distributing slots, introducing transparent and non-discriminatory market mechanisms. Of course, we will do so carefully, prudently, in order to prevent any excessive or unbearable shock to our air sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Our intention is to consolidate the European air sector; in no way do we intend to weaken it. However, while awaiting this second proposal – for which we are preparing studies which guarantee that this shock does not occur – the current situation must be made clear. With this approach in mind, the proposal intends to guarantee the greatest possible efficiency in the use of such a scarce resource as slots and ensure uniformity in the interpretation of the regulations and the application of the Regulations and therefore in legal certainty. To this end, the proposal introduces effective and transparent procedures and the system of penalties which will allow us to achieve the greatest degree of efficiency without having to modify the system of acquired rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Parliament, and especially Mr Stockmann, for the work you have done – in which you have always taken a constructive approach – and for your dedication. We particularly appreciate your balanced and pragmatic approach: we believe that, of the 57 amendments presented, the majority (35 in total) add clarity to the proposal and make it more efficient and therefore the Commission can accept them, with modification in some cases. However, we reject the other 22, which I will refer to briefly.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Amendments Nos 53, 54 and 55, which could significantly upset the balance of the proposal, affecting essential points such as the prohibition on creating a black market by means of false exchanges, as well as those relating to penalties. Furthermore, these amendments have not been adopted by the RETT Committee and the Commission must reject them. Secondly, we must reject Amendments Nos 1, 7, 18 and 28, which would significantly change the balanced objectives of the proposal we are presenting today. Amendment No 8 exempts the coordinator from all responsibility, despite their greater obligations and capacities, and the Commission cannot therefore support it.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we could accept Amendment No 48 with modifications to the wording in order to guarantee that coordinators are held responsible in the case of serious negligence or wilful misconduct.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 20 is incompatible with the definition of a slot and ignores the need to always analyse capacities before imposing the coordination of slots. It must therefore also be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers Amendment No 23 to be excessively broad and does not agree with it; we feel the same about Amendment No 25, which ignores the procedural rules, which are an operative requirement for the coordination committee if transparency is to be guaranteed. We therefore reject both. Likewise, Amendments Nos 33 and 34, except the reference to the guidelines at Community level.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also reject Amendments Nos 35 and 43, since they impact negatively on the recognised Community law on intermodality and public service obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add that Amendment No 57, which Mr Pohjamo referred to, introduces a time period which is impossible to comply with. The Commission has just begun a procedure for selecting an expert who will have to produce a report and we will have it in the summer of 2003 at the earliest. The Commission has committed itself to consulting the air transport sector and the Member States on the results of a study on the market system for the allocation of slots before proceeding to a new legislative proposal on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we believe that Amendments Nos 2, 15, 26, 38, 45, 46 and 50 are either redundant or inconsistent with worldwide practices in the allocation of slots and therefore we cannot accept them.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to say that I agree with what Mr Jarzembowski said in relation to urgency. Let us hope that the Council can adopt a decision at the next meeting, although I think that will be difficult, given the development of the technical work.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to thank you for your contributions and your work, with a very special mention for Mr Stockmann, whose work has been tremendous. I hope that you will support this Commission proposal in the vote tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
