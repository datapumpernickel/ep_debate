If you consider the current situation and track the developments in demand, it can be assumed that this result is certain to be surpassed in 2005. Far from this being merely a short-term fluctuation in growth, the need for energy in many major countries, such as China and India, means that these profits will increase still further.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of these increases in profit amount, in 2004 alone, to 20, 30, 40, or 50% over against 2003. What are the companies doing with these great profits? It is interesting to have a look at their balance sheets on the Internet; most of these profits go to the shareholders, and a substantial chunk of them is used to buy back shares; Shell, for example, in the fourth quarter of 2004 alone, spent EUR 1.6 billion on doing that and is planning to spend between EUR 2.3 billion and EUR 3.9 billion in 2005. BP did likewise, and is indeed setting aside even more for next year – EUR 6 billion for share withdrawal, for stabilisation, for the avoidance of excessive influence on the part of its shareholders, and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, though, we have a situation – one about which you, Commissioner, have had a lot of positive things to say – in which the European Union is endeavouring to develop sustainable energy systems and to spend money on research. Unless I am wrong, EUR 900 million have been set aside for Community research in these various areas between 2003 and 2006. The fact is that that is a fraction of what the big oil companies – I am not talking about the medium-sized or small ones – operating in Europe and elsewhere, have earned. It is a fraction of what the big oil companies use to buy up their own shares and make themselves rather less liable to the influence of their own shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a great discrepancy here. I do not begrudge anyone their profits, but we know perfectly well that what the oil firms are receiving are mainly windfall profits, resulting not from their own investments or efforts, but from the state of the market, that is to say, from increases in supply and demand. I therefore think it really is time that these profits also yielded up something for the development and application of alternative, renewable energies, in other words for sustainable energy systems in general.</p>
<p class="contents">In the ordinary way of things, we would do that with taxes, but that is not possible. The industry itself has always expressed great interest in voluntary agreements, and would like to make a public show of its sense of responsibility. What, for the international oil companies, could be better than to show their responsibility by being willing to do as the Commission wishes – which I hope it does – and discuss this with it, in order that we may together come to a voluntary agreement to use at least some of these windfall profits for research into, and development of, sustainable energy systems. With this in mind, I would ask the Commission – and you too, Commissioner – to give this proposal some serious thought and to talk to the big groups in the hope of getting something for this purpose. This would enable us to apply funds to other important research tasks. The oil companies would be well advised to show themselves to be socially responsible and to develop alternative energy systems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have before us the recent Commission report, which notes a serious delay in relation to the objectives set in Directive 2001/77. Consequently, we need to do more. I personally believe that this endeavour needs to be supported along three lines of approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The first line of approach is to create a more beneficial political environment in which to promote alternative forms of energy. Here, the role of governments is decisive, given that the large multinational companies in the energy sector are still investing primarily in oil and it will not be easy for them to abandon this unilateral approach. What is needed, therefore, is a package of government incentives to encourage investments in alternative forms of energy and create profitable markets for alternative forms of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">The second line of approach is to create a suitable legal framework which supports alternative forms of energy. In other words, we need to protect these markets from the shackles of an energy system built – together with its legal bases – at a time when alternative forms of energy were almost unheard of.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and most important line of approach, and it is on this that the question focuses which I and my honourable friends have submitted to the European Commission, is to rapidly develop public and private investment in research, in order to develop better and cheaper technologies in connection with alternative forms of energy. Developing alternative forms of energy depends first and foremost on research into the development of new technologies and now is our opportunity, now that the large companies which trade in oil are amassing a fortune in excessive profits made by taking advantage of rises in stock exchange prices, now that, as we have all realised, the framework programme for research and development is inadequate with the resources at its disposal; this is our opportunity to promote the idea of imposing a clean energy tax on the oil industry, which can be used to finance the development of alternative forms of energy. It might, for example, be no more than 1% of companies’ net profits, in order to safeguard their competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">I await the Commission’s response and – more importantly – the next steps with interest. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have the very large oil-producing countries in the Middle East, where there is unrest and where oil resources are limited. On the other side of us, we have a very large country, Russia, where Putin has seen that energy is power and where he is accumulating more and more of this power, in the form of the various energy companies in Russia, in his own hands, that is to say literally in the Kremlin. We have ten new Member States that are very dependent indeed upon energy imports from Russia. In addition, we have old Member States, for example Germany, where half of gas imports come from Russia. Seen from the point of view of security policy, all this means, then, a very unbalanced and unsettled situation.</p>
<p class="contents">What is more, we have huge environmental problems, which we are all agreed must be solved, together with very ambitious environmental objectives. At the same time, energy prices are rising. Consumption is rising. European industry constantly needs more energy, as do households and transport. As I have already mentioned, certain countries are hugely dependent upon imports.</p>
<p class="contents">We have enormous problems with energy networks. In Sweden, we had a storm which meant that getting on for 50 000 households, together of course with industry and small enterprises in the areas affected, were without electricity for more than two months after this storm, something that is completely unacceptable. We also remember when the whole of Italy was plunged into darkness for many hours. We thus have an instability in the energy networks that is not acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has described what are known as the TEN projects as being incredibly important, but we see how, in area after area, they come to a standstill and do not develop at the rate anticipated in the original decisions. All in all, we are thus in an extremely worrying situation.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to energy policy in Europe, we must stabilise access to energy. We must ensure that the transmission networks operate and are stable and that the companies invest in new technology so that simple storms or similar events do not entail protracted power failures. We must ensure that the TEN projects work. My first question is therefore as follows: how will the Commission ensure that the energy supply is stabilised?</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must transform the energy supply in Europe, that is to say we must obtain the environmentally friendly energy that we are agreed is needed. This means that the Commission has a very great responsibility. It is not usual for there to be cooperation between policy areas, but we have an agricultural reform whereby biomass could be produced on portions of agricultural land in Europe that are at present unused. We have industry that requires energy. We also have both environmental and employment objectives that must be complied with. I therefore want, secondly, to know how different parts of the Commission cooperate in order to achieve solutions to these problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we need to give new impetus to the energy supply, that is to say produce more energy. My question concerns what is being done to ensure that, through district heating, co-generation etc., Europe’s basic industry also produces more energy. Mr President, energy is power. The thing is, to ensure that this power is used in the right way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Piebalgs,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. Mr President, I agree with the sentiment underlying these questions: how to find solutions to the challenges as a response to our Kyoto obligations, to high oil and gas prices, and how to deal with Europe’s increasing reliance on imported hydrocarbon. These are key issues for the new Commission, as I have already indicated to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">The whole point of a coherent energy policy is to develop a package of mutually reinforcing policies that together achieve the three core objectives: competitiveness, sustainable development and security of supply.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first of all address the issue of our external dependency on oil. The latest oil price increases are a strong reminder that the oil market remains volatile. It is clear that the current and future competition for hydrocarbons resources does and will continue to affect the global security of supply and economic growth. My concern is even higher when we look at energy forecasts. If nothing is done, energy imports by 2030 could amount to 70% of total needs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should of course continue our policy of diversification and our dialogue with the producer countries. However, because of the degree of dependency, the European Union has little room for manoeuvre to influence energy supply. In addition, our own energy sources are either low or, in certain cases, less competitive. It is therefore essentially on the demand side that the EU can and should intervene. That is why I believe that the Union should concentrate on guiding and steering demand.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, the European Commission has already committed itself to actions designed to diversify the different energy sources, to promote energy efficiency and support renewables. All those actions point to a reduction in the use of hydrocarbons in our society and a decrease in their share of the energy mix. As I have already announced, I will continue and strengthen the EU’s actions in these fields. I will make a special effort on energy efficiency. Stronger action on energy efficiency will not only benefit our security of supply, but also other key objectives including those linked to the Lisbon Agenda. This spring I will present a green paper on energy efficiency to outline my ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Although I understand the intention of honourable Members to cross-subsidise renewable energy, I am afraid that it will be difficult to judge what ‘windfall’ profits are, or what ‘too much involvement in enterprise policy’ is. It will also be difficult to tell companies how to spend their profits. At the same time I am following the advice of honourable Members.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also to point out that major oil companies, such as BP, Shell, Repsol and Total, have already started substantial research, development and deployment activities in renewable energies and CO2 capture and storage. In my discussions with them I always stress the importance of their playing an increasingly active role in this area. In my further contacts with the oil companies active in the European Union area I will, therefore, strongly encourage their commitment to research into and development of renewable energies and CO2 capture and storage. Having said that, I have to stress that the European Union has in recent years established a framework for the promotion of renewables that is unique in the world, with directives on the promotion of green electricity and biofuels. A spin-off from these directives has been the development of support systems in most Member States and a continuation of the leading role of the EU in eco-technology.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, the Commission has been actively supporting research into and the demonstration and use of alternative forms of energy. This is expected to continue in the coming years. In this respect, I have to mention in particular the co-financing of the research and development activities, in particular the financial support for the research and technological development phases, and for the demonstration of large-scale installations and the penetration of these new technologies into the market. Such financial support is currently made available under the Sixth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development. In this context, the proposal of the Commission regarding the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development, which is planned to be adopted in April 2005, will open the interinstitutional debate on the key European Union priorities for research and technological development for the coming years.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to come to the issue of environmental goals and competitiveness. The European commitments, not least those related to climate change, have been translated into a number of operational targets in energy policy that at the same time promote the competitiveness of our industry. Therefore, the environmental goals are fully integrated into the energy policy objectives and instruments. One good example is Directive 2001/77/EC on green electricity, which has generated an extra effort with regard to the production and installation of windmills. A significant number of jobs has been created in this new and rapidly growing industry, where some European countries are now world market leaders. Another example is the directive on biofuels. The production of these fuels not only contributes to meeting our Kyoto targets, but also has a positive effect on rural development and therefore on our global economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the most important direct effect on our economy will, however, come from strong policy action to increase energy efficiency throughout our society. It is estimated that 20% of our total energy use could be saved in a cost-efficient way. Not only would energy efficiency save money, it will also create jobs in Europe and be of benefit to the environment. That is why the Commission has made eco-technologies one of the political priorities in the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my conviction that environmental goals, security of supply and competitiveness go very well together. The Commission has proved in the past that it is ready to take action in this field. I certainly intend to make a real effort to reinforce these policies.</p>

Profits are good, as a measure of the success of enterprises and as a means of investment in the future in research and development and replacement capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Higher oil prices make more money for governments, not oil companies, as tax is the biggest component in road fuel costs to the consumer. So perhaps this question should be addressed to the Member States instead.</p>
<p class="contents">We should beware of directing investment and interfering in companies’ decisions on investment. Governments and public bodies are not very successful at picking winners. I wonder whether those who seek to tell companies what to do with their profits would be as quick to offer to share losses in the future. This is knocking on an open door, because the companies are already investing very substantial sums in alternative and successor technologies in researching a whole range of different technologies. They are doing it for obvious supply and commercial reasons. When oil and gas run out, these companies want to be supplying alternative and successor fuels. Shell and BP are investing huge sums of money in photovoltaics and wind and a whole range of synthetic fuel technologies. Perhaps colleagues should take comfort from the Labour minister who says that windfall taxes are not on the agenda. They are not a sound way of proceeding. Let market mechanisms be the way to encourage renewable and alternative sources of energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have not received a clear answer to this. Whether this would even be sensible is something to be considered. It has been mentioned that companies are already doing just this, albeit on a small scale compared to the huge importance of these issues we are speaking about.</p>
<p class="contents">National oil companies have always been profitable, not by accident and not just last year, but for decades. The more than EUR 60 billion profit made last year is so incredible that it even exceeds many countries’ budgets. In the case of my country, it is double. This then is more about countries than just companies.</p>
<p class="contents">The huge earnings are of course due to China’s growth, and, in particular, the situation in the Middle East, which is to say the war there. It is public knowledge that oil companies have even sometimes contributed to the outbreak of war or insurrection, with oil prices rising as a consequence. We know that the industry also has cartels and that it is not a very gentlemanly business. War has been waged over oil on many occasions in the Middle East. In other words people have got their hands dirty with this substance of such great importance to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">High oil prices are obviously very harmful to the economy and now the question is whether these profits will be used for any sensible purpose, and how sensible. We are insisting that they should be spent on research into alternative energies, which, ultimately, as Mr Chichester said, is of benefit to the companies themselves. In this way we would at the same time be fulfilling our own share of our environmental targets. The Commissioner said that it is difficult to interfere in the business of companies. It is difficult because they are bigger than states, but I would urge you to be courageous, because we have a responsibility to the citizens of Europe and, in fact, the future of all humanity. These are, therefore, not trifling matters. There are actually two alternatives: increase research or raise taxes. One or perhaps both. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This weekend I was in Wels, Austria, attending one of the biggest renewable energy fairs. What has been done in Upper Austria could be done in other regions of Europe, because in Upper Austria today only 7% of all new houses are heated with oil. 20% of oil use in Europe is for heating houses. In Upper Austria they have more or less completely switched to wood pellets and other renewables. So we definitely need a directive to promote the use of renewables in the heat and cooling sector, in other words low-temperature energy uses.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I hope that your colleague, Mr Barrot, will contribute to your efforts to bring more efficiency to the transport sector. We are not efficient enough when it comes to standards for cars. We need a better modal shift in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue brings me to what oil companies could really do. We have a directive on biofuel. We have to finance the implementation of these directives from our limited public budgets. What if we obliged the oil companies that sell fuel in Europe gradually to increase the minimum amounts of green fuels available at the pumps? Then the payment would no longer have to come from scarce public resources, but from the huge profits of oil companies. This would be a very clear signal to the oil companies that they have to invest in alternatives and do more to promote them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Admittedly, there will be a report from the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, but I am sure we will be waiting another few months for it. For that reason, it is a good thing that it is on the agenda today.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason, though, why the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats did not put its name to the question was that we have certain doubts about the way in which this is now being articulated. I share the misgivings that Commissioner Piebalgs has expressed. Another issue is that there are a number of companies that are already doing a very great deal in the field of renewable energies, and others that are not yet doing so, and there is a lack of nuance in treating them both the same. We have to do something. Politicians like ourselves, at the European and national levels, have to create the right framework conditions, so that those who invest a great deal in renewable energies receive an additional incentive to do so by finding the right conditions. I am grateful to Commissioner Piebalgs for stating the fundamental principles so clearly. I agree that renewable energies play an important part in a strategy for reducing our dependence on fossil fuels and helping us to achieve the Kyoto objective. Energy efficiency is another important area, and we believe that nuclear power, too, should make its contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, like to leave the Commissioner and the House with a final thought. Among renewable energies, I believe, we have to prioritise in a new way. A very great deal has been done in the fields of wind power and photovoltaic electricity, but we know that there are problems inherent in both these forms. Photovoltaic electricity still requires the spending of a very considerable amount of money in order to save a tonne of CO2. There is a good deal more potential with biomass, and also in the use of heat, that is, solar energy for heating purposes. The Commission will be heading in the right direction if it addresses this issue and improves the framework conditions in Europe for use of solar energy for heating purposes and for the use of biomass as a whole. Where that is concerned, I think all the groups in this House are behind you. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I do not think his answer was a sufficient response to the question put to him. The request that was made has a strength, validity and coherence of its own.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of serious problems to face in Europe, as you well know. The first concerns the fact that the European Union is consuming more and more energy and importing more and more energy products; the second concerns the relationship between energy development and the environment, particularly after the Kyoto Protocol is implemented; and the third concerns the quality of life in our cities from the perspective of energy pollution.</p>
<p class="contents">These points increasingly lead to the conclusion that we must think about the energy of the future, renewable energies in particular, and about constant research into alternative forms of energy. By promoting renewables, I believe we can help to achieve the targets of our general energy policy, security of supply and competitiveness, as well as improving and strengthening environmental protection and sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a general awareness and belief that to achieve all that we need not just coherent political choices, but also huge public and private resources. In this specific case, I find it perfectly natural to call on businesses such as the oil companies – which have been able to enjoy special market conditions and make sizeable profits – to play their part alongside others with appropriate funding for plans and projects relating to alternative, renewable forms of energy.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this approach we would be genuinely encouraging not a restriction on companies’ freedom to make profits, which should be left unaltered, but what is commonly called ‘corporate social responsibility’. Of the possible actions already brought up in the debate, one that I regard as extremely important is taking action in our major cities and large towns by investing resources to improve them from an energy and environmental point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to send out a clear signal that this is a turning point, and to do that it is absolutely essential to have everybody, including the oil companies, on board. That would be a useful answer that the Commission could give to every European citizen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Coming from Scotland, I have a vested interest in this subject. We have just over 5 million people and yet, with all our natural assets, the University of Scotland has calculated that we could contribute 1% of the world’s renewable energy needs. That would be worth some GBP 14 billion or EUR 20 billion per annum. Green energy is not a loss leader. To achieve this, we need leadership, which, sadly, the Scottish Government is not providing. We in Scotland and in Europe need a coherent energy plan. The European Commission is in an ideal position to provide the leadership and structure that these emerging technologies need.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr Swoboda, now just listen to me. The ideological baggage you packed into your question defies description. The Commissioner gave a factual answer; he used the opportunity to set out a number of starting points relating to his prospects for a proper energy policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it erroneous to take the energy and oil firms’ windfall profits as a pretext for distracting from one’s own responsibility for renewable energies, and for that error the Socialists and Communists in this House must bear responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We have just heard the figures: EUR 60 billion in profits! Let me remind Mr Turmes that oil prices are driven up not only by the oil-producing countries and the crude oil companies, but also and primarily by states, through taxation. In my own Member State, Germany, alone, approximate calculations indicate that the public become liable to over EUR 30 billion in additional taxes every year. This is a problem from which this sort of question should not divert attention, and I am grateful to the Greens and Liberals for having broadened the issue and enabled us to have a proper and wide-ranging debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">What we can do is, I think, plain to see. We all remember well the debate we had on biofuels; it was not this House, but the unwillingness of the Member States, that prevented the inclusion of mandatory blending, and now Mr Swoboda wants to impose on the Commission an obligation it will never be able to discharge. We have to keep our feet on the ground and stick to the areas where we are in a position to do something – security of energy supply, the development of alternative forms of energy, promoting research, the overall framework. That is where we have to discharge this responsibility, but not by taking the excessive profits of oil companies as our starting point.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1973, it was estimated that the oil reserves would last for another 30 years. The reason why they will now last for far longer is that these profits were used to seek out new stocks of crude oil. We rely on that being where the responsibility for the security of our energy supply is discharged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An outstanding document, entitled ‘Sustainable and Secure Energy Supplies’ was presented which will also be discussed at the end of this month in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. The parliamentary delegations at the conference once again established that we failed to complete the tasks laid down in Gothenburg and Lisbon. We are unable to increase the renewable energy percentage from 6% to 12%.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that fossil energy sources are finite, we must work towards intensifying research programmes. That is what we in this House will also be doing next Wednesday when we discuss the Locatelli report. The combination of private and public means is the perfect formula for the Lisbon agenda. The need for new investment variants and new forms – public private partnership, if you like – is also at issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the priorities of this Parliament and on a voluntary basis – except for ‘stealth taxes’ on energy, which are unacceptable – but within these pre-conditions, Commissioner Piebalgs can certainly enter into dialogue without any problem. The European investments in hydrogen technology, for example, as argued by the High Level Group, are necessary. We realise that the oil companies have a lot of freedom at the moment. They are significant partners and they are already doing a great deal, but it is impossible to get them to cross this line on a voluntary basis. I would like to find out from the Commissioner how he tackles the discussions he referred to in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are two advantages and one disadvantage to applying the protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The advantages are a) protection of the environment and human health and b) the pressure for technological innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The disadvantage is that, until innovation is marketable, there remains the question of the adverse impact in industry, such as a reduction in exports by 3.8 to 5.1%.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, renewable sources of energy can contribute to a secure energy supply in Europe; however, they can also contribute to the Lisbon Strategy via technological development, technology exports, job creation and environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there appears to be a gulf between the successful demonstration of innovative technologies and their actual penetration of the market and I think that it is a <span class="italic">sine qua non </span>that this gulf be bridged as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">What measures do you, as Commissioner, intend to take in this direction, apart from the promotion – and/or the possibility – of concluding voluntary agreements with the energy industry? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Even if part of the profits of oil companies were spent on this, I am not convinced it would be enough. For this we have to, at the very least, advance on two other fronts, those being commitments by Member States, and centralised research and development. Let us look at the first: commitments and approaches by Member States. </p>
<p class="contents">According to the Commission report before the European Parliament ‘several countries have still not taken practical steps in the interests of reaching stated objectives’, and at Community level the target of 22.1% (of energy) by 2010 (coming from renewable sources) is in danger, and a figure of only 18 to 19% looks realistic. </p>
<p class="contents">Huge differences appear between the performances of individual Member States, with, for example, my own country of Hungary in last place, only undertaking to reach 3.6% by 2010, even though it is the site of Europe’s greatest geothermal energy resource, and which to this day has not generated a single watt of electricity. Because of this I support the creation of a conference on renewable sources of energy, which would deal with the differing situations of the Member States, and would aim at reaching agreement.It is essential, in addition, that Member States are responsible for ensuring that environmentally friendly electricity can obtain a share of the market, and take into account the administrative, legal, technical, and grid-access obstacles. </p>
<p class="contents">Greater aid and joint financing is necessary not only from the Union, but also from Member States. The Commission should do everything to ensure that Member States have greater financial access to development, and also that external costs should appear in the price of energy used. It is definitely worrying to note that in the last twenty years spending on research and development in the field of renewable energy has typically reduced at the national and European level. I suggest in the interests of aid that in the 7th EU technology research and development framework programme starting in 2007, research and development programmes on renewable energy should appear as a separate spending item. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Energy policy has not been sufficiently debated either in this House or in the European Union. I would not like the public to view energy policy purely from the perspective of climate change. Energy policy is so important that it needs to be debated properly.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate shows that we can encourage markets by creating the right conditions. The European Union has achieved remarkable success. The very fact that we are asking ourselves how we can achieve the target of 22% for green electricity, when the current forecast is for an insufficient 19%, is already a success in itself. We must continue to provide specific requirements to encourage the markets to respond. The Commission will bring forward concrete new proposals concerning renewables, biomass and clean vehicles, and is working on new proposals. In this way we can encourage the market to respond to the needs of society. At the same time, the biggest challenge is to foster concerted efforts to create new technologies. CO2 capture and storage and other new environmental technologies are now on the agenda. That is one of the areas where the Commission’s actions should be strengthened by actions by the Members States and industry. I look forward to working with the European Parliament with a view to achieving such energy policy priorities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
