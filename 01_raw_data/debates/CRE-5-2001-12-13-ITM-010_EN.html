<p class="contents">At a time when democratic elections should be in preparation, Mugabe’s only response has been to encourage and establish an atmosphere of terror in his country – everywhere, in the countryside and in the towns. This makes it crucial that the elections are able proceed in a normal way, and that the international community continues to insist that they are. But nothing suggests that Mr Mugabe is receptive to this justified democratic demand from within his own country, where even in the previous elections it was clear that the virtual majority wanted a change of government.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Mugabe is clinging to power and to that end regards all possible legitimate and especially illegitimate means as justified. For example, journalists must now apply for a work permit before they are allowed to write. This of course runs counter to freedom of expression. The printing works of the few still more or less independent papers are smashed up. In this way opinion forming is hampered. Today I received the manifesto of the women’s organisations, which complain that women obliged to sell the fruits of their labour on the land to a state institution are either not paid at all or else far too late, in a country where inflation is running at 86%.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall therefore vote in favour of this motion with great determination for this and many other reasons mentioned in the text.</p>

That is why it is so incredibly tragic to see it heading straight for the abyss. Zimbabwe has been discussed by us many times in this House, as I know it has also been in the other institutions. We have often thought we have seen some small glimpse of hope or gleam of light. We have been wrong every time. There are no such glimmers. The situation is alarming. Zimbabwe is a lawless, economically impoverished country governed by a dictatorial old ruler who has completely lost contact with reality and with his own people.</p>
<p class="contents">Robert Mugabe breaks promise after promise made to surrounding countries. He has not succeeded in stopping the illegal land occupations or in bringing about fair land reform. Human rights are infringed on a daily basis, and the opposition is harassed and persecuted in an unacceptable way. The regime is thoroughly corrupt and, in terms of democracy, the impending elections, in which election workers are threatened, harassed and imprisoned, cannot be called anything other than a joke. Freedom of expression is totally restricted.</p>
<p class="contents">We must immediately break off all communication with, and suspend all assistance to, the Zimbabwean regime. All Mugabe’s foreign assets and all those of his family should be frozen. I really want to appeal to both the Commission and the Council to be crystal-clear in their condemnation of Mugabe’s regime and to state that our and the world community’s patience is at an end. We must establish a broad, international coalition and form of cooperation with the SADC states so as to put pressure on the regime and take measures against it. At the same time, it is of course important to find ways of supporting the opposition. There is a small number of courageous people who, at risk to their own lives, are fighting for democracy and human dignity.</p>

The reason for this is our enormous concern at the continued deterioration of the situation in that country with such a short time to go before the presidential elections.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of September there were some indications that Mugabe might be prepared to respond to international pressure. Sadly, it is now very obvious that the commitments given at Abuja were a sham. It would seem that Mugabe thinks he can make a few promises, buy a little more time and then carry on with his repressive policies while the economy of a once prosperous Zimbabwe collapses. Half a million Zimbabweans are now on the verge of starvation. Opposition politicians go in fear of their lives. Mugabe's absolute contempt for international opinion was further demonstrated by his defiance towards the EU troika which visited Harare at the end of November. We now have to show that we are serious in our threats to take action. At the moment Mugabe thinks he is untouchable and even flies to Spain for medical treatment.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not proposing the blunt instrument of economic sanctions. We know that this would impact on the population at large and in any case we are only too aware how such measures can be evaded. We are calling for smart sanctions that would directly hit Mugabe, his family and his cronies. Steps should be taken immediately to freeze their overseas assets and to impose a travel ban. The decision to move in this direction should be taken by ministers at Laeken this weekend. Our resolve should be made absolutely clear in the meeting scheduled to take place next week between the European Union and Zimbabwean representatives under the terms of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">If Mugabe does not take immediate and verifiable action in the way that the international community is demanding, the European Union must be ready at once to impose the smart sanctions. Our resolution today sets out clearly what has to be done. Let us not dilute the message in any way. The resolution is a basis for action now.</p>

We have the Council to thank for finally getting Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement moving since the last resolution. We hope that contacts with Zimbabwe in this context will bear fruit, although we do not really expect this man to show the slightest interest in our measures. On the contrary, he will get his own party to elect him as a presidential candidate in Victoria Falls this weekend and he is already preparing to make a farce of these elections.</p>
<p class="contents">For a start, he is now demanding proof of residency as well as identity cards as proof of electoral status. A great many people find it very hard to provide such proof. And now he wants to hold the elections in constituencies, rather than as nationwide elections throughout the country. People who are not registered in the large towns where they work will have to travel home. Most will not be able to afford to do so. The aim is to ensure that as many people as possible are excluded <span class="italic">de facto </span>from the elections, because he knows that this will stop the majority of his opponents from voting. There are 200 000 people currently starving in the Masningo province because Governor Hungwe has stopped food from being distributed by NGOs. The Governor has demanded that the food be delivered to him first so that he can arrange for it to be distributed. Then, of course, he will only feed his own people.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not let this man get away with it. We must ensure that we take targeted measures to stop Mr Mugabe in time, and I call on us all to do so.</p>

Like Mr Gahler, I was one of the parliamentary election observers at the time and saw for myself how Mugabe and his rent-a-mob were driving the country straight towards catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite massive attempts to intimidate the electors – and we shall no doubt see an action replay of that now – and despite massive support for the opposition candidates, which has ended in death in a multitude of cases, the MDC achieved a remarkable result, clearly signalling to Mugabe that political change was on the horizon.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, with presidential elections imminent, Mugabe is again tightening the screw of force and terror. There is no sign of the return to the rule of law promised in the Abuja agreement; on the contrary. By using more and more legislative repression, massively restricting the freedom of the press, threatening the opposition, continuing to occupy farms and permanently undermining the rule of law, Mugabe is isolating himself more and more, including from his traditional allies in southern Africa. This was blatantly obvious at the last meeting of the ACP/EU joint parliamentary assembly in Brussels in October. These countries are being sucked into free fall by the humanitarian and economic disaster in Zimbabwe and further pressure is needed to make Robert Mugabe change direction and hold the presidential elections in accordance with the standards of free and fair elections, and this is where we also need the support of the institutions of the European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mugabe is sacrificing countless human lives, literally and figuratively, to his utterly ruthless aim of retaining power.</p>
<p class="contents">The shocking Dutch newspaper headline of less than a week ago ‘Zimbabwe stinks of blood lust’<span class="italic"> </span>sadly completely sums up the content of the article by the paper’s correspondent in Harare. The accompanying vulgar cartoon from the Zimbabwean state paper <span class="italic">The Herald</span> underlines this ominous message. The cartoon turns Mugabe’s major challenger in next year’s presidential elections, Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change, into a downright caricature. He is depicted as the yes-man of rich white farmers in his own country and of Western powers.</p>
<p class="contents">However, Zimbabwean political reality looks completely different. Naked state terror against white farmers, their black managers and agricultural labourers as well as against political opponents of Mugabe’s party, ZANU-PF. State terror manifests itself in ten or so methods of repression: undermining the judicial system, politicisation of the army and police, attacks on press freedom, occupation of the estates of white farmers, slander against independent institutions like the Red Cross, purportedly acting as cover organisations for the opposition, electoral fraud, tapping the opposition’s telephone traffic, detention of and slurs on members of the opposition MDC party, violence and intimidation against supposed supporters of the opposition and, finally, murder of political opponents.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to ask the Commission urgently, in its meeting with Zimbabwean Government representatives at the beginning of next week, to speak up above all for those domestic organisations that help the victims of political violence in Zimbabwe, who now total hundreds of thousands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

About 1000 white farmers, owning most of the land, produced the food and the surplus. After independence in Zimbabwe, the Lancaster House Agreement between Britain, as the colonial power, and Zimbabwe allowed for land redistribution to black families and appropriate compensation to white farmers without any loss of production.</p>
<p class="contents">Mugabe has failed in implementing these reforms. He has failed to settle the poor black families. Since independence, Mugabe has had much time to establish real democracy, rule of law and prosperity for all. Instead, he has enriched himself, his friends and destroyed his country's economy. He has made the poor even poorer. He has intimidated, looted and deprived the white farmers who produced so much wealth for his nation.</p>
<p class="contents">Zimbabwe needs a free and fair election now. Mugabe should not fear. He will be judged on his record. If he is a statesman, like Mandela, then he should step down with dignity and let someone else from Zanu-PF contest the election. If he is still a Catholic, then he should listen to Archbishop Ncube of Zimbabwe who has also condemned him regularly without fear. Mr Mugabe cannot and will not be remembered in Africa unless he gives his countrymen a chance to breathe, walk without fear and seek opportunities to enhance their quality of life. I have a simple message for Mr Mugabe – be an African elder and retire gracefully to your village. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, Article 96 consultations will not be easy but we should give them a chance. Zimbabwe confirmed its participation, but the original date of 19 December for the start of these consultations was yesterday postponed. We do not have an indication of another date. The idea is to hold them next month.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been indicated that SADC, ACP and the OAU will be invited to and included in these consultations. This is good because it broadens out the scope by anchoring in Africa the kind of discussion we have to go through with Zimbabwe.</p>
<p class="contents">The consultations will focus on the issues which matter to us – human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance and the escalation of violence. The consultations will provide an opportunity to seek the government's views and their firm commitment in the following areas: politically motivated violence, elections, freedom of the media, the judiciary and illegal occupation of properties. I would like to reassure Parliament that these consultations cover practically the totality of the issues raised in their draft resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to stress that there will also be a clear EU position on the points Zimbabwe is bound to raise, such as land reform, interference in its internal affairs, alleged support for the opposition and the imposition of what they call "white values". Finally, not pre-judging the outcome of the consultations and handling them in the spirit of the Cotonou agreement is not only necessary to address the situation with Zimbabwe, it is also necessary to maintain mutual trust and confidence between the EU and ACP countries. But respecting the rules and the spirit of these consultations is not the same as carrying them out in a vague and weak manner. This is not how the piano is going to be played!</p>
<p class="contents">As regards electoral monitoring, the Commission is getting prepared for this. The Government of Zimbabwe has announced that it will not accept monitors; it will only invite friends to observe the presidential elections. The auguries for an EU presence are not too good, but we will be able to mount an EU mission should this be feasible. We are maintaining flexibility to react to developments and possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">A key requirement will be that no international observation mission – whether multilateral or bilateral – is manipulated by Mugabe into sending short-term observers only for polling day. We have to keep in mind that last year polling day itself was relatively calm. It is clear that the campaigning period in the run-up to the poll is crucial for determining the fairness of the electoral process itself. The Commission considers that a minimum length of observation time – that is, one month – is necessary and we are discouraging others from sending short-term observers only.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has suggested that the EU focus its approach on the SADC Parliamentary Forum's norms and standards, which comply with the UN standards and have been endorsed by Zimbabwe's ruling ZANU-PF Party. There are indications that other international partners, such as the Commonwealth and the United States, will agree to use those standards, which would then allow the international community to judge the openness and fairness of the elections.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel, the SADC Electoral Forum and the Electoral Commissions Forum of SADC countries are being encouraged to open a dialogue with the Zimbabwe authorities and the political parties, on the preparations for the presidential election. We see close collaboration with SADC in this election-related activity as a way of creating some sort of base-line case so that we will be able to do something if we cannot participate directly. But this is the preferred option, and Zimbabwe should welcome the EU observers.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has remained engaged in the country in order, on the one hand, not to pre-judge the outcome of the consultations and at the same time to up the stakes for Zimbabwe of an eventual failure – thus increasing the pressure on them to cooperate. This is the rationale of what we are doing at this moment. We have therefore taken the following actions: the Commission has currently a mission on the ground to assess humanitarian needs and food security issues. This we will do in any case, whatever the political outcome. Preliminary results show that, remarkably, the deterioration of the situation is much slower than could have been expected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also participated in the UNDP land mission. Successful or not, it is worth exerting a positive pressure on Zimbabwe by doing anything possible to move forward the dossier of land reform. The Commission has maintained, as I mentioned before, its offer to support the electoral process.</p>
<p class="contents">We continue preparing our cooperation under the new five-year funding cycle, not least to demonstrate to the Government of Zimbabwe what it has to lose. We will not take any decisions on whether or not to proceed with signing and implementing the Country Strategy for Zimbabwe until after the consultations have been concluded. To sign or not to sign is a very important question in many cases and here it is quite clear that we want the consultations concluded before we move on. But not to prepare would also imply lack of respect of the whole process of planning in the Cotonou framework.</p>
<p class="contents">The regional dimension is important. It appears that Zimbabwe's neighbours are becoming increasingly concerned with the deterioration of the situation and the potentially very dramatic consequences for the country and the whole region. This is why we have taken the initiative to maintain close contact with SADC and Nigeria in view of Article 96 consultations. It is, in fact, the first time ever that the opening of these consultations has included a reference to the use of our partners in the region. The General Affairs Council accepted this approach, ensuring close coordination and complementarity with SADC and the Abuja process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and presidency have proceeded with a series of informal exchanges with SADC and Nigeria against this background. We note that these African partners are already exerting effective peer pressure on Mugabe so that a solution to the crisis may be found. The emerging African ownership approach has to be welcomed, particularly in view of the negative effect that the continuing crisis in Zimbabwe is having on its neighbours. I must confess that the outlook is not optimistic. Things look very bad as we move into these consultations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
