In a statement made yesterday, the Commission strongly deplored yesterday’s verdict by the Ankara State Security Court confirming the sentencing of Mrs Zana to serve her full prison term until June 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me briefly remind you of the background to this case. As part of the political reforms adopted in Turkey in the period 2002/2003, new provisions were introduced in the Turkish legal system allowing for the retrial of persons whose convictions the European Court of Human Rights has found to violate the European Convention on Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. This was a specific priority under the Accession Partnership with Turkey. Another priority concerns the need to remedy the situation of those persons prosecuted or sentenced for non-violent expression of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the introduction of these new provisions, a decision was taken in February 2003, under which Mrs Zana and her three co-defendants were to be retried by the Ankara State Security Court. However, in spite of the several sessions held by the Ankara State Security Court, retrial largely resulted in a repetition of the previous trial, leading to persistent concerns about the respect for the rights of the defence and the principle of presumption of innocence, as acknowledged by independent international experts.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has repeatedly expressed its concerns to the Turkish authorities in the framework of the political dialogue. In our view, while fully respecting the principle of independence of the judiciary, the way this case has been handled shows the gap that exists between the spirit of the reforms and their actual implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">As I mentioned, the trial against Mrs Zana was held at a State Security Court. It is worth recalling that, according to the relevant priority under the Accession Partnership, the European Union has repeatedly asked Turkey to align the functioning of the State Security Courts with European standards. We note that the abolition of these courts is among the measures envisaged in the next package of legislative reforms announced in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to point out that in his speech before the Turkish Parliament in January 2004, President Prodi called for the immediate release of Mrs Zana. Moreover, the Commission has raised this issue several times in its regular report and within the framework of the political dialogue with the Turkish authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that the lawyers representing the defendants have announced their intention to refer the case to the Court of Cassation and hope that it will be dealt with in accordance with all the relevant principles of equal justice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Probably uniquely in this House, I actually knew Leyla Zana before she was tried and convicted. I first met her in the late 1980s. She is, to put it mildly, a controversial figure.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless the action that she took is perfectly within the realms of democratic expression. After all, all she did was to say something in the Kurdish language within her Parliament. Mrs Ahern and others sometimes choose to use the Irish language within this Parliament. Indeed my Quaestor colleague, Mrs Banotti, did so in her opening speech. However, I do not think even the worst enemies of Fine Gael would wish Mrs Banotti to be locked up for 15 years for that.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been complete over-reaction from the very beginning. The way in which the trial was conducted was unacceptable and it was thanks to the intervention of the Council of Europe that a retrial was held. It is a great disappointment to me and my group that the Turkish judicial authorities did not show themselves to have sufficient flexibility to use this opportunity of having a retrial that would effectively have exonerated Mrs Zana.</p>
<p class="contents">She has been the victim of what is in effect a struggle between a reactionary judiciary and a state that is trying to reform. I welcome the packages of reforms that have been adopted and I also welcome the fact that the state security courts are to be abolished. This is not before time.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people are indeed working hard for democracy in Turkey, and the AKP deputy Faruk Ünsal spoke out against this particular verdict. I hope that in passing in what I think will be a unanimous resolution, supported right across the House, that we can send a message, not to the Turkish Government but to the Turkish judiciary, to be realistic, to get up to date and, for a change, to support their government in trying to restore respect for the Turkish judiciary within Turkey. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I, too, am far from agreeing with all her views; to judge by her latest letter – which I have here – to, among others, Javier Solana and President Prodi, her assessment of Öçalan and of the PKK’s successor organisations is perhaps somewhat naive, rather exaggerated or understated, depending on your chosen way of putting it, but – as has already been said – none of these things are reasons for someone to be locked up for many years and their sentence confirmed in the teeth of rulings by European courts. I entirely agree with the Commissioner that this shows that there is still a great discrepancy between a parliamentary decision in favour of reforms, and those reforms being implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not to be taken as criticism of the government, which, as I see it, has, in so far as it has been able to do so, made quite plain its interest in a different decision on Leyla Zana being reached. We really do, though, have to urge, beg, or urgently petition the government to really put its whole weight behind the reforms in order to push them through, especially in the justice system, for I do think we will have major problems if the government proposes the right things, if the parliament backs them up, but the necessary democratic practices are not in place in the administration or in the law courts to make them happen. This government, too, when decisions are taken in December, is sure to have the charge laid at its door that too little has been done by way of implementation and that too little effort is being made to bring Turkey’s administration and its justice system up to modern European standards. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the recent Joint Parliamentary Committee meeting in Turkey, we brought up the issue of the Leyla Zana trial, as we always do. Justice Minister Cicek promised us that in the next package of constitutional reforms, which I think is to be published this week, the State Security Courts would be scrapped. This is, of course, first-class news because these courts do not contribute to justice; they do not contribute to security. The Turkish Government fully appreciates the political importance of the Zana case for the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">As a strong Turkophile, let me be quite clear that, if Leyla Zana and her colleagues are not released soon, it will be impossible for Turkey's closest friends to argue that accession negotiations should be opened from December. No country can seriously contemplate European membership with nearly six thousand prisoners of conscience, no matter how controversial those people prove to be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Among the many serious aspects of this trial that have already been mentioned by fellow Members and the Commission representative, whom I thank, what matters is the very fact that the 1994 sentence has been confirmed. The Strasbourg Court condemned the 1994 trial because it was illegal in many respects and called for a new trial to take place. The sentence is not based on the proceedings of this trial, but explicit reference is made to the 1994 sentence. The behaviour of the State Security Court in Ankara not only affronted the European Union but also the Strasbourg Court.</p>
<p class="contents">I attended all of the trial hearings: the right to defence was breached in a most blatant manner; more specifically – and to keep it short – the defence was denied any possibility of objectively replying to claims made by the prosecution witnesses. By the way it acted throughout the 14 hearings, the Court was only concerned with protecting the 1994 sentence.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not add any more general comments since I agree with what has been said by those Members who spoke before me. In October, the European Commission will put forward its proposal on whether or not to open, and if so when, the negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union. Having also listened to the Commissioner, I believe that the European Commission’s assessment will be a conscientious one. Having heard my fellow Members, I also believe that the future Parliament will conscientiously assess the advisability or otherwise of opening negotiations for Turkey’s accession to the European Union or whether to open them immediately. At the moment, frankly, the conditions for opening negotiations do not exist. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who have been involved in this matter over the past months and years have been able to see with their own eyes that this trial was a farce. The judges and especially the public prosecutor had absolutely no interest in properly reinvestigating the old evidence from 1994. And in this trial the defence once again had no opportunity to call new witnesses who wanted to put forward contrary evidence. This was a copy of a bad trial, and the result of a bad trial is a bad verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">But one thing should be quite clear: this says less about the government's attitude to reform than about the stubborn resistance of conservatives. These judges, yesterday's judges, wanted to show who is boss. Their answer is clear: we are the bosses, not the European Parliament or the European Commission in Brussels, and not the Government in Ankara either: we are the ones who decide what will happen in this case. I think that the only way the Government can limit the damage it has undoubtedly suffered in connection with its request to start negotiations in December is to show that this is an exception to the rule. That rule must remain the same: reforms on paper must be put into practice.</p>
<p class="contents">Two examples. There has already been mention of the plans – and I emphasise the word 'plans' – to abolish State Security Courts. I should like to call on the Government to make haste in this matter, not to drag things out, and to ensure that these courts are actually abolished by December.</p>
<p class="contents">The second example, highly symbolic of course in this context, is the use of the Kurdish language, which we should remember was where this whole issue started. On paper, once again on paper, the use of this language is permitted, but in practice there are still numerous administrative hurdles. So it is very important that by the end of the year the Kurdish language can actually be used in the education system and in the media.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, for those who have concluded solely on the basis of this matter that negotiations should not start, I would like to remind you of what Ms Zana herself said. In a letter to the European Parliament she said: I would rather be in prison in a country that is negotiating with the European Union than free in a country on which Europe has turned its back. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would prefer Ms Leyla Zana to be at liberty in a country that is negotiating with the European Union. That is actually the only option which I find acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in fact very rare for someone to have spent so long in prison and to have held the Sakharov prize for almost as long. The situation is quite extraordinary. It is also very unusual for the European Union to have continued proceeding on a 'business as usual' basis for so long. This cannot continue. We must make more of a nuisance of ourselves, exert more pressure so that this pressure can in turn be exerted on the opposing forces in Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">The old state philosophy, the old type of Kemalism, still holds considerable sway as can be seen in this trial. Those in charge are themselves supporters of this old philosophy and of course time and again come to the same conclusion. I agree with other Members who have already taken the floor and made the point that the unusual feature here is that the Government, as we must recognise, is doing its best and has adopted some dramatic legal reforms. The Government was behind the change allowing trials to be reopened, in particular. It also introduced the option to free someone from prison, but this is not used: the legislation is either not used at all or not used properly. I believe that we must persuade our own governments of this. It is not just a question of isolated symptoms, like the serious case of Leyla Zana and her associates. It is a consequence of a more profound question which we must discuss with Turkey. I would also add that in my opinion it is essential to build up contacts between European judges and public prosecutors and their Turkish counterparts in order to change attitudes, as the wrong attitude can take us down the wrong track time after time, falling into the trap of nationalistic hatred against minorities caused by the fear that they could undermine the integrity of the State.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons I think that we must press for the existing opportunities to be used to free Ms Leyla Zana and others imprisoned for similar so-called offences in anticipation of reform of the entire legal process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been restarted twice. The Supreme Court, at the request of Europe and the European Court of Human Rights, has restarted the trial. The verdict is identical. We could not be more disappointed and, faced with such confusion, there is nothing more to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I went to see Leyla Zana in 1995 at her prison in Ankara, with the other Kurdish prisoners, prisoners of conscience, we must remember. It was the year when the Customs Union was to be voted on. I was very confused and said to myself that maybe I should give Turkey a chance, since I was in favour of its accession in the future. I therefore went to the country to learn about its evolution, which I wanted to give a chance by voting for the Customs Union. I thought that maybe this would have an effect on respect for human rights, respect for minorities and freedom of expression.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, I must recognise today that, unfortunately, things have hardly developed in a positive way. I am, nevertheless, Mr President, in favour of Turkey entering the European Union. I am, however, sorry that Turkey continues to violate human rights and I insist that a considerable effort be made. Otherwise I fear that accession is in a bad way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unaffected by the official reforms in Turkey, the court is doing things the way they were done in the old days, so anyone who had attended the hearings – as I did – could conclude that the initial judgment, founded upon one sentence spoken in Kurdish and harshly criticised by the European Court of Human Rights, would be upheld. Turkey could have used the trial as a means of demonstrating that its reforms of the justice system exist not only on paper. This was not, in the final analysis, about the minutiae of the law, but about a woman whose fate had become a symbol of the failure of Turkish politics and Turkish justice, a woman whose trial was a test of how seriously reforms were being taken. Neither that, nor the fact that the eyes of the world were upon them, could induce the court to conduct a trial in accordance with the rule of law. Let me ask you this, then: if even the case of Leyla Zana cannot bring about change in the Turkish legal system, how are reforms to be implemented at all?</p>
<p class="contents">In principle – and let me make this clear – I am in favour of Turkey joining the EU, provided that it meets the relevant conditions. Turkey has known for years that there must be drastic change in it if it is to have a prospect of acceding, but yesterday’s judgment shows that the willingness to do so is still not yet present, and so the EU must now, at last, cut short all this talk about the commencement of accession negotiations being imminent. Those who, in the aftermath of this ruling, continue to insist that accession negotiations will be possible in six months’ time, show only their indifference to the Copenhagen criteria and their interest in the implementation of strategic objectives to the exclusion of all else. Far from it; the fact remains that the criteria for accession to the EU have been laid down and must still be met. For as long as Turkey ignores that fact, there can be no accession negotiations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
