<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paolo De Castro, </span></span>  <span class="italic">author. </span>− <span class="italic">(IT) </span>Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the dairy farming sector is going through one of the deepest and most serious crises of the last few decades: the fall in the price of milk and the more general crisis in the dairy farming market have now become a source of concern throughout Europe. This is a cyclical crisis, caused by the difficult economic situation, which has led to a decline in milk consumption and created stagnant markets, with the prices paid to producers in free fall.</p>
<p class="contents">The prices paid to milk producers have plummeted everywhere, averaging 24 cents per litre within the European Union. Many economic operators are in an even more serious situation, as they get prices of less than 20-21 cents, when their production costs come to at least 40 cents per litre.</p>
<p class="contents">Other markets, such as the cereal, olive oil and fruit and vegetable markets, are showing some alarming signs too. On this front, first of all, we should continue to make use of all the measures at our disposal so as to stabilise the market and to stimulate an upturn in consumption, but at the same time we need to be able to look to the future with medium- and long-term policies and to do everything possible to identify acceptable and lasting solutions aimed at minimising the risk of price fluctuations.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context the Commission proposals extending the intervention period for butter and skimmed milk powder have been welcomed and accepted within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, as the unanimous vote of 2 September demonstrates. We believe, however, that these proposals are not enough to mitigate the serious consequences of the crisis in the sector. That is why, still in relation to the adoption of the European Commission’s proposal, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has adopted an amendment to my proposal that also reintroduces aid for private storage of cheese, which was abolished under the health check on the common agricultural policy in November 2008.</p>
<p class="contents">This was a unanimous decision, Madam President, Commissioner, representing what are, in essence, identical views shared by the members of the Committee on Agriculture, which I have the honour of chairing, and expressing our desire to send out a strong signal to the Council and the Commission at a sensitive time for an extremely important sector for European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">As well as being a first important demonstration of the positive leadership that we as the European Parliament want to provide when looking ahead to codecision in agricultural matters too, this is a measure that can also offer immediate help to dairy farmers, who are grappling with an increasingly difficult market and with an obvious and dramatic fall in sales.</p>
<p class="contents">However, these initial measures, on which we will vote today, are not enough to support the producers in crisis, and that is why the Committee on Agriculture, through an oral question and a resolution on which we are preparing to vote, is calling on the European Commission to introduce new and effective measures to combat the crisis and to support the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to encourage and at the same time support the European Commission in the process of deciding what must be done to end the crisis in the European dairy farming sector once and for all. In this sense we hope that the Commission will provide an exhaustive answer to our questions and will take our proposals seriously, so that interinstitutional cooperation produces the results that European agriculture deserves and shows its solidarity by offering practical support to European farmers in crisis, who need our help today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to say that I am very happy with the questions put by the Committee on Agriculture, because this gives me an excellent opportunity to clarify the actions that have already been taken.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also thank Parliament for its ongoing work in this area. We are all committed to finding solutions. You are, and so am I.</p>
<p class="contents">Not everyone agrees with my preferred solutions, but I strongly believe that these solutions are working, that they will work, and they are also solutions that we can defend politically.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Paolo De Castro asked on behalf of the Committee that we say what we are actually doing. The top line is good news: prices are improving. For example, in the course of one month butter prices went up by 4% in France, 8% in Germany and even more in the UK.</p>
<p class="contents">Skimmed milk powder also went up by 4% in France and Germany, and 2-3% if we look at the average all over Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Average milk prices have been going up, and Albert Deß just told me this morning that the spot market prices are now at 30 cents in certain areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that intervention buying on cheese has almost stopped because the market price is higher than the intervention price, which is another positive signal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not yet where we want to be, but we are heading in the right direction. This makes me more confident than ever before that the policy approach that we have been taking from the very beginning is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">You know the key elements of what we have been doing. We have been using all the market measures available and here we expect to spend approximately EUR 600 million over a 12-month period.</p>
<p class="contents">We have indicated the possibility for Member States to start the direct payment of the single farm payment to farmers from 16 October instead of 1 December, and we decided under the 2003 reform to decouple the dairy premium – EUR 5 billion every year – and transport it directly into the single payment scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">We have the recovery package and the decisions taken in the health check that provide another EUR 4.2 billion to face the new challenges, including restructuring in the dairy sector. All this of course is on top of what we can do under the rural development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Just for clarification to Paolo De Castro, intervention for cheese was actually abolished in 1994. I think there must be some confusion between intervention and private storage because private storage was abolished by the decisions in the health check.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, our current approach seems to be working. I am therefore more determined than ever before not to go back to the future in ways which would hurt our dairy sector in the long term and leave our farmers without any kind of predictability.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, making a U-turn on the health check decision is not an option and something that the European Council, the heads of state, explicitly asked me not to do.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the idea of keeping the quota system after 2013 is not on the table. Freezing quotas is not on the table, and neither is any return to the use of certain expensive but inefficient market instruments of the past. They are not on the table.</p>
<p class="contents">This certainly does not mean that we have now done the job in terms of policy. I think it is time for further action. We need to follow up on the dairy report from this July, use the measures in there and then decide on other actions for the longer term.</p>
<p class="contents">If I could start with the report, I will look first at state aid. The report floated the idea that Member States could temporarily offer aid of up to EUR 15 000 for farmers under this temporary crisis framework. The Commission has actually already launched the boat and expects to change the rules in the coming weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is streamlining the procedures for responding to prices in the dairy sector. At this moment, milk is not actually included in Article 186 of the single Common Market Organisation which allows the Commission to take temporary actions quickly under its own power during times of market disturbances. I am therefore proposing that we include the dairy sector in Article 186, and this will enable us to spring into action in the future if we hit serious problems in the dairy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, our recent extension of intervention had to be approved by the Council, and Parliament voted on this as well, but, if the dairy sector had been included in this Article 186, we could have acted immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally speaking, we could with almost immediate effect mobilise measures stimulating demand and/or we could limit the marketing of milk, and all this would only be put in place on a temporary basis and under the condition that we had the necessary financing available.</p>
<p class="contents">The third follow-up point from the report concerns the buying-up schemes by Member States. One way to restructure is that Member States can actually buy quotas from farmers and put these quotas into the national reserve.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the national reserve counts in a sense as part of the Member States’ total quota, so if individual producers go over their quota, but Member States as a whole do not exceed their quota, with the national reserve included, then no super levy is actually paid.</p>
<p class="contents">What I intend to propose is that bought-up quota kept within the national reserve will not count as part of the national quota when it comes to deciding whether we have to add or to ask the farmers to pay the super levy or not.</p>
<p class="contents">If the super levy should then be collected anyway, then the part corresponding to the bought-up quota could then be used for restructuring. It might sound a bit complicated, but it is actually a very efficient tool.</p>
<p class="contents">All of these steps are actions that we are taking now with an almost immediate impact on the markets, but we also need to do something about steps for the medium and longer term. I would like to thank France and Germany here for their ideas and their input on these different possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">The first longer-term issue is about using contractual relations between milk farmers and the dairy industry to better balance supply and demand in the dairy market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this is a much, much better approach than the quota system, and it already works in parts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Milk producers and dairies have clear agreements which remove a lot of the uncertainty. On the other hand, some Member States simply do not use this possibility, but this can be changed by looking for a legal framework for these contractual relations, whilst clearly safeguarding fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The second long-term issue is about the balance of power, and you know that we have had this discussion a lot of times. We need to be able to see within the whole chain from primary producer to supermarket chains where the added value is disappearing.</p>
<p class="contents">We will look into future markets as well and, finally, I think a lot can be done on production costs and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to deal properly with all these ideas for the medium and long term, I want to establish a working group with experts from the Member States and the Commission so they can go to the heart of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">For me, the problem in the dairy market is not only an issue between the Commission and Member States. Parliament actually plays an important role as well, and I am looking forward to the discussion here today on this important issue.</p>
<p class="contents">Thank you for being so patient. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The dairy sector is in trouble. Many dairy farmers are seeing their very existence under threat. The main reason for this is a huge drop in milk product sales. The Commission really should have acted more swiftly in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also have preferred to see stronger sales promotion measures instead of a greater amount of intervention, such as butter fat being used once again in the ice cream industry. Last year, when the price of butter reached more than EUR 4 for a short time, a large proportion of the ice cream industry stopped processing butter fat. I know the figures for Germany, which show that around 100 000 tonnes is no longer being processed by the food industry, which corresponds to a million tonnes of milk. We must try to stimulate sales once again, in order to clear these quantities from the market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the groups that have helped in drawing up our joint motion for a resolution. Unfortunately, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance did not participate in this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, as a short-term measure we are calling for an increase in the de minimis subsidies in an additional motion which is being tabled with 40 signatures, because this would be an opportunity to help the smaller dairy farmers in particular. It would also make sense to introduce an early retirement regulation. I know a lot of farmers who are 58 years old and who would like to stop working soon. An appropriate regulation would be needed for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, I would like to thank you sincerely for your work. I would ask you to put in place appropriate regulations to improve the situation of our dairy farmers. Perhaps you will still have the chance to remedy this situation in the near future.</p>

There is no doubt that we must take action to alleviate their pain, but let me make it very clear that this is a short-term crisis which requires short-term market measures by the Commission, as outlined in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us also be clear that, for too long, European consumers have paid for a dysfunctional agricultural policy which has failed both farmers and consumers. This crisis should not therefore be used as an excuse to turn our backs on the road to further reform and liberalisation of the CAP. That is why we have tabled amendments to this effect and why I welcome your reassurance on this matter.</p>

Tens of thousands of jobs have been destroyed in rural areas. The European Union had counted on growth in world demand. Its experts got it very wrong. The financial and economic crisis that we are experiencing has direct effects on agriculture and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">The decision by Mrs Boel, Commissioner for Agriculture, to maintain the increase in quotas and the Council’s wish to dismantle them by 2015 are a provocation to milk producers. Times have changed. European policy must be adjusted to suit a new global environment. The milk prices imposed on producers do not cover production costs. On each litre of milk, some small farmers are losing up to 30 cents. At the end of the year, many of them will not have made a single euro, or will even have lost money. Some of them, too, as we are told by regional officials, are today going so far as to take their own lives.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this unprecedented crisis, the European Union must take significant steps, quickly. We call upon the Heads of State or Government who are meeting this evening to prepare for the G20 to place the issue of the dairy crisis on the agenda for their meeting, so that appropriate steps can be taken to respond to livestock farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must boost the negotiation capacities of dairy farms, so that they are no longer subject to the dictates of the agri-food industry. It should also put in place a safety net to guarantee a remunerative price so that the price never falls below the production costs. The European Union must put a stop to its export refunds programme. It has just committed the enormous sum of EUR 480 million, adopted with the backing of various parliamentary groups from both the right and the left, in order to sell its surpluses cheaply on the world markets. It is destroying hundreds of thousands of farming jobs in the south and is cynically pushing farmers to move off the land or to immigrate.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, the European Union must immediately make drastic reductions, of 5%, in European milk quotas, in a way that is inversely proportional to the volume delivered by small producers, in order to swiftly re-establish a balance between supply and demand. A laisser-faire policy is unacceptable. It has terrible consequences in terms of employment and land use patterns.</p>

They sat on their hands for too long, and many farmers have suffered grievously for that. We can either decide to help the industry, or we can decide that we will ultimately let our farmers go out of business: then we can import from abroad with all the problems that brings us.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome your remarks for the future, Commissioner, but I am not happy about your remarks for the short term. I think we need to do more in the short term to help the industry through this present crisis. Those short-term measures require immediate action.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course I remember the time of the milk lakes and the butter mountains, and I do not want to go back to that. I do not think anybody in the industry wants to go back to that situation: neither the farmer, nor the processors, nor the Commission nor we in this Parliament. We do not want to return to that, but one of the main problems I see at this moment in time is that, while the farmers have taken a drastic reduction in what they are receiving for their milk, consumers are paying almost the same as they paid before.</p>
<p class="contents">Until we tackle the power of the supermarkets in this area we will not have the answer. They have to be controlled. We need an ombudsman, someone who can tell the supermarkets that they are acting beyond their remit, that they are ripping the people off, ripping the farmers off and putting them out of business in the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In an effort to make the market measures more balanced, where benefits are not given solely to those Member States involved in butter and skimmed milk powder production, I call for the reintroduction of Community aid for private storage of cheese with a long maturation period.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the matter of the origin marking and labelling of dairy products and to the traceability of products: this is a request that comes directly from European consumers – in ever greater numbers – and one that might help us to tackle the crisis in the dairy farming sector.

In my country, in Northern Ireland, the dairy sector is of vital importance. When the dairy sector struggles, the rest of the rural economy struggles. Currently dairy farmers receive just over 20 cents per litre for milk amid escalating costs. In Northern Ireland not only have they had to contend with poor milk prices and high costs, but we have suffered a third consecutive wet summer and this has had a devastating effect on the dairy industry in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">It was distressing last night to see farmers in Belgium so angry and feeling so helpless that they are spraying milk onto their fields in protest at the poor price of milk and the difficulties that they too are encountering. The Commission has taken welcome steps to put a base on the market but we cannot sustain prices at an uneconomically low level.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to take short-term measures to help: measures that will increase demand for milk; measures that will cut the cost of production; measures that will address the supply chain with its decreasing farm-gate prices and high supermarket prices; and measures that in the long term will create a sustainable industry and a future for young farmers who are experiencing severe difficulties with low prices and high bank charges. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the weekend I met a group of Irishwomen called ‘Farm Women for a Fair Price’ and I think we should note the words ‘fair price’ because producers are not getting a decent or fair price – and that is what this debate is about.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be churlish not to welcome the comments from the Commissioner about a stability coming into the market place, although at a very low level, and I acknowledge that the Commission has taken steps and spent money to bring stability to the market place. It is just that it is not enough and it did not happen quickly enough and we have a severe crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that, in relation to the future, your comments are particularly welcome. I am worried that this House is divided on the issue of milk quotas because when we have codecision, if the Lisbon Treaty comes into force, we are going to have to think more coherently as a group and give clear signals to farmers rather than divided messages, so let me repeat that your comments about making links between producers and processors, about production levels, are something we need to explore, something we have to have a further debate on.</p>
<p class="contents">But we need to ask you, Commissioner, what type of market support measures do you think will exist in the absence of quotas that can ensure a fair and decent price to our producers? And, also, please tackle the marketplace: it is not working. Everybody says they are making no money from milk, including the supermarkets –which I doubt profusely – but we need more clarity, and we need fairness for farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think that there are two parts to this debate. There is the immediate question of how we can extricate ourselves from this crisis. All measures, ranging from assistance for farmers to intervention measures, are necessary – in fact, absolutely necessary. We must endorse them and even call for them to be enlarged in scope. That is what we, together with several fellow Members, are proposing here in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is the structural question regarding the management of the dairy market, and this is where our views diverge from yours, Commissioner. You propose that we move in the direction of using contractual relations. I can tell you in advance that introducing contractual relations between industrial firms and farmers will, in the long term, result in those industries competing with each other, on a Europe-wide scale.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to regulate a market, we need public regulation. There is no other solution. After this crisis, that is what the debate must be about. I think that, in this debate, we must respect all opinions and all options; I fear that we acted too quickly at the time of the health check to settle an issue such as quotas, which up until now, as I would like to point out to all those who have spoken, have made it possible to maintain dairy production in Europe, to ensure that the dairy industry is highly developed and, at the same time, to keep prices at a level that was easily affordable for customers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The livelihoods of dairy farmers are under serious threat.</p>
<p class="contents">While the Commission’s decision to extend the intervention period for butter and skimmed-milk powder until 2010 is very much welcome, short-term measures would not alleviate the pressure on dairy farmers in the long term. Actions must be taken now that will manage, not just the current difficulties, but are long-term and will ensure a sustainable and successful industry into the future. Financial assistance is required by dairy farmers immediately. The creation of an EU dairy fund of EUR 600 million, as called for by Parliament in the 2009 budget procedure, is urgently needed. Dairy farmers are entitled to fair prices, and an appropriate system of price supports is required to guarantee milk producers a reasonable minimum price per litre and a reasonable income for them to survive. Irish and European dairy farmers must not be forced out of business and I urge the Commission and the Council to take immediate and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, may I say to you that you have been a very successful Commissioner, and I pay tribute to the immense work you have done. You have recently announced that you are stepping down, and I would urge you to solve, or to make as much of a contribution to solving this problem as possible, before your departure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The current situation is unsustainable and requires a political solution. Clearly, the measures adopted to date by the Commission have been unable to alleviate the crisis or provide a viable alternative to the quota replacement scheme planned for 2015. As a result, in Spain for example – Galicia to be precise – 14 000 milk producers have had to cope with root-and-branch restructuring in order to continue living and working on the land, but today they are still on the verge of imminent disappearance.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons, in the same way that the Commission has intervened in other sectors, it must also intervene in the milk sector, by regulating production, redistributing quotas, offering temporary compensation, encouraging product traceability and helping to bring producers and consumers closer together by correcting the dysfunctions caused by the distribution oligopoly.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has the Commission not positively intervened to prevent the negative consequences of this oligopoly established by the major distributors?</p>

I feel that the biggest problem lies with the retail industry, which is making huge profits off the backs of our dairy farmers. When we see what the supermarkets are charging consumers for milk, and then look at what the dairy farmer actually receives, the difference is just incredible.</p>
<p class="contents">The work and the major cost in producing milk are borne by the farmer, but at the same time the supermarkets are reaping huge profits. The margin that the farmer receives is so unfair. We need to put pressure on the supermarkets to pay a fair price to the industry, and it is my view that the price of milk in the supermarkets will not have to change. The consumer will not have to pay any more for their milk. The supermarkets need to reduce their profit margins. It is quite scandalous when we see the massive profits that these supermarkets are enjoying every year and at the same time our dairy industry is struggling. If action is not taken on the issue in the very near future then I really do believe that many of our dairy farmers in Wales, and the rest of the UK, will go out of business.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one quick point on what the Commissioner said this morning about the super levy. I am concerned by those comments. I think it will hit our most efficient producers – those who have risen to the challenge, responded to the market and invested heavily in their farms, following a lead from the Commission that quotas will be abolished. Imposing a super levy goes against the structural changes which both the EU and the UK Government claim to support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This type of measure would not only not provide a solution, but would be a mistake, at least from the following points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is no basic economic link between the increase in milk quotas and the fall in market prices. Quotas have increased, while production has fallen. I cannot see where the link is. The market itself offers the explanation for falling prices. I believe that setting fixed quotas would lead to a rise in prices over time. However, the beneficiaries will be, once again, not the producers, but the processors and retailers. If we want to limit production we should perhaps encourage producers to stop livestock rearing voluntarily, by providing incentives rather than measures which could distort the market. Assuming quotas are frozen, what is going to happen when, for instance, demand on the global market picks up again? What could European producers do? Because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on…</p>

<p class="contents">As I was saying, what could European producers do, assuming demand on the global market picks up again? Because dairy production does not have a tap that we can just turn off and on willy-nilly. If we were to cut production now, farmers would obviously give up cow rearing, but it would be very difficult to replenish the livestock when we realise that what some people now imagine would be a good measure is, in reality, a big mistake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today we are talking about our dairy farmers and whether we are going to leave them in the lurch or deal with them in an honest manner. I do not believe that we should leave them in the lurch, but should be honest in our dealings with them. Yes, short-term measures to overcome the crisis are urgently needed. Yes, intervention is perfectly acceptable for a short period if the price of milk has reached rock bottom, and additional subsidies, loans and funds to combat the crisis are justified. However, what is totally unacceptable is, firstly, to start up discussions about milk quotas again and, secondly, to reintroduce tax-funded export refunds for products supplied to developing countries. We abandoned this one way street in 2003 and I appeal to you to keep it that way for the sake of our dairy farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission’s intervention measures have also succeeded in preventing milk prices from falling even further and the market seems to be relaxing. However, I do not think that this intervention is really a good means of achieving this, because it will result in stocks piling up which could burden a recovering market later on.

I think this is the right decision to make. I also welcome her proposals to meet this current crisis as a sensible and appropriate way to support producers through a difficult time.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two points that I want to make. Firstly, in my view, the implementation of the super levy at this time would be inappropriate. It is a short-term, knee-jerk reaction. It will send all the wrong messages and it will only effectively penalise efficient producers who are making plans to stay in the industry for the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need to recognise that there is little or no direct relationship between the price in the retail sector and the raw material price received at the farm gate. That is what I term a dysfunctional price-chain mechanism.</p>
<p class="contents">The major influence will always be the global marketplace, and we have to recognise that the global marketplace will always be volatile. I therefore urge the Commission in the long term to come forward with plans to ensure that there will be some sort of stability mechanism for the benefit not only of producers but also, of course, of consumers in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You should know that it takes a wise woman to recognise that she was wrong. That is a saying in Spain, which could very well be applied to this situation. For months the milk sector has been suffering one of the worst crises in its history. Despite that, because the European Commission and certain governments – seemingly including my own, the Spanish Government – do not want to allow their arms to be twisted, they are refusing to go back on the decisions relating to the health check of the common agricultural policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Those decisions were taken without any thought for the fragility of this sector, and in a market context very different from the one that has developed since that compromise was agreed. It makes you think that the Member States did not want to see, or could not see, at that time, the storm that was approaching. The reform has very quickly become irrelevant, due to the major turnaround in the market, which demonstrates that the sector is totally at the mercy of price volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that major producers such as France and Germany – countries which, in absolute terms, obtained the biggest increase in their national production quotas in this agreement – are now the ones asking for a review of the health check decisions raises a lot of issues.</p>
<p class="contents">As I see it, the Member States were wrong and should have listened more carefully to the voices, including mine, which were calling for any final decision on the future of the sector to be postponed until 2011.</p>

They receive only 19 cents per litre. The crisis is caused by an over-abundant supply of milk, which is making prices drop sharply. Deregulation is encouraging volatility, and market conditions now are totally the opposite of what they were a short time ago.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, please stop stubbornly hiding behind choices made last year and take into account what is really happening on the ground now!</p>
<p class="contents">The Council is also to blame, firstly for not being here to listen to the debate, but also for not taking decisions, because it is swayed more by purely national interests than by a European vision of agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">The market is not working. There is over-production. It would be very simple to freeze the 1% increase in quotas, or to reduce the quotas immediately by 3 to 5%, because we urgently need to come up with some short-term solutions. Adopting this measure would kill two birds with one stone: we would give the producers a decent price once again and, by reducing production, we would reduce the European bill of hundreds of millions of euros spent on various interventions, including export refunds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They still receive very little money for their products, below the viability threshold. This also applies to those farmers who have invested a great deal of money, including EU funding and loans.

I recognise that Europe’s dairy farmers are facing a crisis on a major scale, but I simply do not understand how my fellow Members can think that you, in the Commission, have not done enough. I would definitely like to call on you, Mrs Fischer Boel, to reiterate what you have done. It seems to me that the list of initiatives coming from the Commission is a long one, in fact it is almost too long. It is almost as if we are destroying the progress that we made in connection with the health check. I would also like to point out that the efforts that have been made thus far on behalf of the dairy farmers have clearly not been mirrored in relation to those workers in the car industry who have lost their jobs or those workers in the shipbuilding industry who have lost their jobs as a result of the current economic crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">So I can only ask that we take a little care about how we handle this crisis and that we also make sure that we do not destroy the sound progress that was made, despite everything, as a result of the health check. The idea of freezing the milk quotas is, I think, completely hopeless! Nor can we go back to the old models by granting export refunds – that simply ruins the market for someone elsewhere in the world. We have to be careful. Commissioner, I would nonetheless like to ask you to reiterate the long list of activities that you have already undertaken so that my fellow Members can see that there is certainly no need for us to go crazy and start enacting numerous additional measures with the result that we destroy the sound progress that has been made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What that means is that our producers are in the process of decapitalising.</p>
<p class="contents">Just now, you listed the measures you have taken in the past nine months. Those measures do exist, we will grant you that. They have not, however, produced the anticipated effects because, in our view, they are not extensive enough, and there is definitely too much uncertainty about how effective their target is.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning you mentioned a recovery in the market, but the producers will certainly only see the effects of this in the payments made at the beginning of next year. The agricultural products market is not the same as the market in metals or the energy market. It calls for regulatory tools, because the cycles of the seasons and nature also have an effect on market conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Your interpretation of the health check, carried out under the French Presidency, surprises us, since the interim assessments that it produced in relation to the dairy sector leave all avenues open, including the possibility of new decisions on tools for regulating the markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The French delegation, to which I belong, is convinced that a renewed quotas system will be necessary after 2013. The tension that existed on the food products market prior to the current economic crisis has demonstrated the fragility of the balance across the world between production and consumption.</p>
<p class="contents">After having partially dismantled the intervention tools, we have neither the right nor the legitimacy to dismantle today the production tools that we will need in the short term.</p>

The main problem, therefore, is that there is a large hole somewhere. This problem has to be resolved. In the Czech Republic we now have fewer cattle than we had after the Napoleonic wars.

<p class="contents">As regards the quota system; it seems to be the scapegoat of this whole situation in which we find ourselves. I do not underestimate – and I have been very precise on this since the very beginning of the discussion – that the dairy sector, not only in Europe but globally, finds itself in an unprecedented crisis. That must be very clear. So I certainly do understand the frustration that I see among farmers in different parts of Europe, not all over, but in different parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The abolition of the quota system was decided back in 2003 so it is not a decision that was taken overnight while nobody knew what was happening. Then, in the health check, we had the discussion on increasing the quotas to try to find a soft landing for the dairy farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">But I think that those who want to point their finger at the quota system for being the reason for all the problems in which dairy farmers find themselves are wrong. Because we see that even with a quota system in place, we have not been able to maintain high prices and the structural changes in the dairy sector have taken place anyway. If you look at 1984, when the quota system was introduced, we had 1.6 million dairy farmers in the old EU-10. Today in EU-10 we have 300 000 dairy farmers: less than one fifth of the number of dairy farmers today compared to 1984 with a quota system in place. So these structural changes are taking place anyway.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think that going back or rolling back the decision in the health check is the right policy, and here I am supported by all heads of state saying clearly in their decisions from the meeting in June that I have to stick to the decisions from the health check. I have never, ever, during the health check discussions, signalled any openness to roll back these decisions because that would certainly jeopardise predictability for farmers within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">But, José Bové, I think you said I had not been acting with preciseness; that is, the laissez-faire attitude. I do not think it is fair to say that we have been doing nothing. I am not going to repeat all the different measures that we have been taking. I think that, if Member States want to pay specific attention to the dairy sector, they now have the possibility with the health check to reallocate the direct payments so they give a special preference to the grassland areas. That is a possibility and I know that at least one big Member State has taken the opportunity to use this possibility, and for the mountainous areas there are lots of different possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We have production in Europe today that is 45% below quota, so what would happen if we actually wanted to cut quota by 5%? We would actually damage the situation for the young farmers that have invested in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I would recommend to those countries, those Member States, who really want to help their dairy sector that they use this buy-up of quotas from those who want to leave the dairy sector. That is a much better way of securing the maintenance of those who have invested while giving a helping hand to those that want to leave the sector. That is I think the right policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I then just correct the misunderstanding on the super levy? We are not introducing a new super levy system. We are just giving the possibility that, if Member States are buying up quotas from farmers, they can reduce the number of kilos or tonnes from their ceiling, but it is not a new super levy that will punish any of the farmers.</p>
<p class="contents">Just on some of the promotion. We have already reserved EUR 14 million for promotion for the rest of this year. We have agreed on extending the school milk scheme; yogurt that is low in sugar – that is, containing no more than 7% sugar – will now be introduced into the school milk scheme. Labelling – I hear from different Members of Parliament that there is interest in a labelling system. Let us discuss that in the context of the quality paper that is actually on the table at the moment. So I think there are lots of possibilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, finally, on the food chain, I completely agree with you that that there is no transparency in this chain and we cannot see where the added value is disappearing. Therefore, I am looking forward to the presenting of this report before the end of the year so we can see what the situation actually looks like.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, if you look at the supermarket situation all over Europe, there are huge differences. Germany has a tradition or number of discount supermarkets. These supermarkets are using dairy or milk products, drinking milk as a <span class="italic">produit d'appel</span> to get the consumers in, and they are offering a very low price but they are just handing over the bill to the farmers, paying them the low price. So, I think it would be very interesting and necessary to see what is actually happening in this chain, so let us get this transparency on the table and let us, internally in the Commission, but also in Member States’ competition authorities, look into the market.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been a very interesting discussion here today. I hope that you have noticed the short-term measures and the long-term measures that have been worked out together with France and Germany. I am sure that we will have some very interesting discussions on the future of the dairy sector in Europe because we all want our dairy sector to have a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Commission and Member States’ governments are also responsible for the current grave situation affecting the dairy sector, as in 2008 they supported raising the quotas, resulting in the creation of milk surpluses and the collapse of prices.</p>
<p class="contents">This decision was based on the European Commission’s erroneous market forecasts. However, the European Commission did not abandon its intention even when it became obvious that the production increase was contrary to market trends.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the European Union must immediately drop its measures leading to an increase in dairy production. Furthermore, we also oppose the permanent removal of quotas after 2015. The important lesson to be learned from the current crisis is that the dairy market needs to be regulated. Without this, prices will become unpredictable. European dairy producers cannot endure the losses caused by large-scale price volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that, with a view to easing the crisis, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development voted in favour of my initiative, which would raise the export subsidies amount from EUR 450 million to EUR 600 million. Without the export subsidies some of the surpluses would remain on the EU internal market, which would lead to a further price decrease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But quotas alone will not save the dairy sector. While the Commission is correct to adopt a long-term view, it cannot detach itself from reality - and the stark reality is that the agriculture industry, in particular the dairy sector, is in real danger. The lowest milk prices since 1983, together with high costs, poor weather and lack of credit, have created an unprecedented cash flow and income crisis for dairy farm families in 2009. While the indications are that markets have bottomed out, badly needed price increases still appear some way off, and EU action is needed. I agree with IFA President Padraig Walshe and Dairy Chairman Richard Kennedy that the quickest way to speed up price recovery is for the EU Commission to make more aggressive use of all market supports such as: </p>
<p class="contents">- Export refunds</p>
<p class="contents">- Processing aids</p>

The producer price for milk fell, and at present many milk producers are having to sell dairy products at a price that does not reflect production costs. The survival of milk producers is now seriously under threat. Up until now it has not been possible to resolve the crisis in the dairy sector with the measures the Commission has implemented. Now it is time to roll up our sleeves and come up with new solutions. The Commission must stabilise the dairy market in Europe quickly. At the same time it should also undertake a thorough evaluation of the future of the dairy industry together with actors in the sector and the Member States.

Of course, I welcome the flexibility that it is permitting, which will enable the national aid ceiling to be increased from EUR 7 500 to EUR 15 000 for producers who are struggling. It is nonetheless vital for us to adopt more effective intervention tools. In order to deal with the growing volatility of prices, our markets must be regulated to a greater extent. The joint statement made by 16 Member States on the state of the European dairy market offers the Commission some valuable suggestions on improving the regulation of dairy markets. I also believe that it is necessary, as seven Member States are requesting, to look at temporarily suspending the increase in quotas. I would also like to reiterate my support for the introduction of a ‘Dairy Fund’ to help producers’ organisations and cooperatives, and also to support agricultural investment, modernisation, diversification of dairy farming, measures linked to geographical location and marketing measures for dairy products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fall in the prices of milk and dairy products primarily affects farms with low incomes. For this reason, I do not think that the quota system ought to be frozen in all Member States, but each state ought to decide how to set their own quotas. The problem is that, compared to 1983-84, only one-fifth of producers have remained in the market, and we are now at risk of more farms closing down. We therefore need to adopt urgent measures to prevent this from happening. We ought to take the following measures to end the crisis in this sector: extend the measures envisaged for storing butter, milk powder and cheeses, speed up the creation of a dairy product fund to meet the needs of small producers and young farmers, and reach an understanding with the supermarkets in terms of setting a fair price for both agricultural producers and retailers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
