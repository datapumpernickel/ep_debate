<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>Respect for human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law are core EU values which the EU is consistently promoting in its relations with third countries.</p>
<p>At the 14th EU-Ukraine Summit, which took place in Brussels on 22 November 2010, the leaders recalled that EU-Ukraine relations were based on common values and a common history, and that the EU had acknowledged Ukraine's European aspirations and welcomed its European choice. They also noted that the depth of the EU-Ukraine relationship would be determined by the implementation of reforms and by further consolidation of common values.</p>
<p>The parties discussed the issue of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values and the rule of law based on an independent and impartial judiciary. They stressed in particular the importance of a free media. Following the recent local elections, the leaders recalled the need for further strengthening of democratic development in Ukraine, in particular the electoral framework.</p>
<p>The leaders took note of the recent constitutional developments in Ukraine. The EU side encouraged the Ukrainian authorities to undertake constitutional reform in an inclusive and comprehensive manner in close cooperation with the Venice Commission of the Council of Europe.</p>
<p>The leaders expressed their satisfaction at the progress achieved in EU-Ukraine relations. In this regard they stressed the importance of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement which is currently being negotiated and looked forward to the conclusion of negotiations as soon as possible while retaining the quality and viability of the Association Agreement.</p>
<p>The Council is concerned at consistent and wide-spread reports of deterioration in respect for fundamental freedoms and democratic principles in Ukraine. Particularly worrying are complaints related to freedom of the media, freedom of assembly and freedom of association. The EU will continue to use every opportunity to underline the importance of full respect for rule of law, including in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and notably with regard to the principle of a fair, impartial and independent justice, as well as the need to ensure that the criminal law is not used for political ends.</p>
<p>The EU is also following closely the situation of the rights of persons belonging to minorities in Ukraine and is monitoring developments in Ukraine's progress towards a modern legal framework for ensuring the rights of persons belonging to minorities and towards implementation of the Council of Europe Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities. The EU will continue to regularly raise these issues with the Ukrainian authorities as part of its on-going dialogue with Ukraine.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000109"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>As in all trade negotiations, through its Trade Policy Committee, the Council is following the developments in the negotiations with Mercosur closely. The Council is focussing particularly on the fulfilment of the conditions laid down in the negotiating mandate which was adopted by the Council on 13 September 1999. The Council has taken careful note of the Commission’s commitment to remain within this mandate and to remain vigilant about any adverse impact of a possible agreement, in particular on the most sensitive products.</p>
<p>In this respect, it should be underlined that Commissioner Ciolos has repeatedly recognised the sensitivity of the Mercosur negotiations for the EU agriculture sector. Most recently at the Council session on 17 March 2011, he assured the Council that the Commission is following a cautious approach in these negotiations, taking into account the defensive and offensive interests of the EU in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>On the issue of consistency between agricultural policy and trade policy and the consequences of the re-launch of negotiations with the Mercosur, the attention of the honourable Member is drawn to the conclusions adopted by the Council in June 2010 on the international competitiveness of the European agri-food model<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>A growing world population results in increasing food demand. Droughts, floods and natural catastrophes have played their part together with surging energy prices and export restrictions by some of our global partners. Moreover, excessive price volatility can destabilise agricultural economies and affect food security at the local and regional level.</p>
<p>In this context, two of the objectives of the CAP as set out in the Treaty are particularly important. First, ensuring that supplies reach consumers at reasonable prices. Second, increasing agricultural productivity by promoting technical progress and by ensuring the rational development of agricultural production and the optimum utilisation of the factors of production, in particular labour.</p>
<p>The June 2010 European Council's concluded that a sustainable, productive and competitive agricultural sector will make an important contribution to the Europe 2020 strategy, considering the growth and employment potential of rural areas while ensuring fair competition</p>
<p>The Presidency conclusions on the CAP towards 2020<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which were supported last month by a very large majority of Members of the Council, recognise that economically viable and environmentally sustainable food production remains the key objective for the future CAP.</p>
<p>The Council has noted the views of the European Parliament as expressed in recent resolutions, particularly on the recognition of agriculture as a strategic sector in the context of food security, on the EU protein deficit and on the link between EU agriculture and international trade. The Council looks forward to the debate with the Parliament on the Commission's proposals on the CAP post 2013 later in the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In its Conclusions on Improving Environmental Policy Instruments, adopted on 20 December 2010, the Council welcomed that more environmental considerations have been integrated into strategic initiatives like the Europe 2020 Strategy, which puts forward the promotion of a more resource efficient, greener and more competitive economy<a href="#defann_4_1" name="refann_4_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Council also called for intensified greening of the EU Financial Framework, inter alia to promote the transition to a safe and sustainable low carbon, resource efficient, biodiversity friendly and climate resilient economy<a href="#defann_4_2" name="refann_4_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In its Conclusions of 4 February 2011<a href="#defann_4_3" name="refann_4_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> the European Council underlined that it is vital to promote a regulatory framework attractive to investment. It was highlighted that the EU and its Member States will promote investment in renewable and safe and sustainable low carbon technologies and focus on implementing the technology priorities established in the European Strategic Energy Technology (SET) plan.<a href="#defann_4_4" name="refann_4_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> Furthermore, it is stated that at national level, Member States recall their willingness to devote at least 50% of ETS revenue to finance climate-related action, including innovative projects. The European Council also underlined that investments in energy efficiency will enhance competitiveness and support security of energy supply and sustainability at low cost and that a determined action is needed to tap the considerable potential for higher energy savings of buildings, transport, products and processes.<a href="#defann_4_5" name="refann_4_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a></p>
<p>The Council also stressed, in its Conclusions on "Energy 2020: A strategy for competitive, sustainable and secure energy", adopted on 28 February <a href="#defann_4_6" name="refann_4_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>, that, building upon the SET-Plan activities, initiatives concerning technologies in relation with electricity storage, sustainable biofuels, smart grids, and smart cities, as well as clean vehicles, ocean and marine energy should be launched. The Council stressed also that the EU competitive position should be reflected in the financial commitments of the industry as well as in public funding terms and would benefit from a range of financial instruments. Research, development and deployment of safe and sustainable low carbon technologies should be prioritized in future programmes.</p>
<p>The Council also considered that leverage of existing means could be facilitated by making use of innovative financing mechanisms. Possible innovative financing tools would need further analysis and they would need to be flexible in order to cater for national circumstances.</p>
<p>The European Energy Programme for Recovery (EEPR)<a href="#defann_4_7" name="refann_4_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a> provides financing for energy projects to contribute i.a. to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The complementing measure adopted in 2010<a href="#defann_4_8" name="refann_4_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> created a financial facility giving additional support to energy efficiency and renewable energy initiatives.</p>
<p>In total, EU level financial support to renewable energies has amounted to roughly 3.26 bn EUR per year during the 2007-2009 period<a href="#defann_4_9" name="refann_4_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>. A major new source of financial support for renewables at the EU level is the "NER 300" programme<a href="#defann_4_10" name="refann_4_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Investment in "green" innovation and infrastructure is also supported through Cohesion Policy<a href="#defann_4_11" name="refann_4_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a>, the Intelligent Energy Europe Programme<a href="#defann_4_12" name="refann_4_12"><sup>(12)</sup></a> (including through the tool ELENA), and the Seventh Framework Programme for research, technological development and demonstration (2007-2013)<a href="#defann_4_13" name="refann_4_13"><sup>(13)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In March 2011, the Commission presented the Communication “Roadmap for moving to a competitive low carbon economy in 2050”<a href="#defann_4_14" name="refann_4_14"><sup>(14)</sup></a> (the 2050 Decarbonisation Roadmap) and the Communication on an "Energy Efficiency Plan 2011"<a href="#defann_4_15" name="refann_4_15"><sup>(15)</sup></a>, currently under discussion in the Council.</p>
<p>Important decisions will be taken in the next few months, for instance in terms of the Multiannual Financial Framework, the implementation of the White Paper on Transport, the Energy Efficiency Plan, and the Common Agricultural Policy. It is therefore key for the Environment Council, in its June session, to agree on a set of conclusions that set out strategic and operational steps forward.</p>
<p>In light of the above, on 14 March, the Environmental Council welcomed the presentation of the Commission on the 2050 Decarbonisation Roadmap and stated that it aims to adopt Council Conclusions at the June Environmental Council on it, with a view to the June 2011 European Council. Furthermore, as energy efficiency has a central role in a low-carbon growth and is closely linked to the 2050 Decarbonisation Roadmap, it is important to note that the TTE- Energy Council also plans to adopt council conclusions on the Energy Efficiency Plan 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The European Union is fighting homelessness and housing exclusion in the framework of the Europe 2020 Strategy, adopted by the European Council on 17 June 2010<a href="#defann_5_1" name="refann_5_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Actions on this matter are taken more specifically under the heading of the flagship initiative "European Platform against Poverty and Social Exclusion: A European framework for social and territorial cohesion"<a href="#defann_5_2" name="refann_5_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. This Platform will set a dynamic framework for action to ensure that people experiencing poverty and social exclusion are enabled to live in dignity and take an active part in society<a href="#defann_5_3" name="refann_5_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. In its Conclusions on the Platform, adopted on 7 March 2011, the Council recalled "that certain groups of the population are particularly exposed to the risk of poverty and social exclusion while others are subject to the most extreme forms of poverty (such as homelessness)"<a href="#defann_5_4" name="refann_5_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The homelessness issue is covered by the Open Method of Coordination in the area of Social Protection and Social Inclusion (Social OMC), including peer reviews. In order to support national strategies in the fight against homelessness, the Council bases its work on the outcome of the European Consensus Conference on Homelessness, organised in December 2010 under Belgian Presidency<a href="#defann_5_5" name="refann_5_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>, and on the 2010 Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion<a href="#defann_5_6" name="refann_5_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>. In this report it is underlined that integrated strategies to address housing exclusion and homelessness have an important role to play in post-crisis policies, with a view to build cohesive and environmentally sustainable societies<a href="#defann_5_7" name="refann_5_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>. In its contribution to the European Council (24-25 March 2011), the Social Protection Committee underlines that it will continue work on homelessness and housing exclusion<a href="#defann_5_8" name="refann_5_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In December 2010, the Council adopted a Declaration on "The European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion: Working together to fight poverty in 2010 and beyond"<a href="#defann_5_9" name="refann_5_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>, in order to mark the closing of this European Year. In this declaration the Council underlined that particular attention should be given to vulnerable groups and to extreme forms of poverty such as homelessness. The Council also highlighted that the European Union and its Member States should work together at European, national, regional and local levels in the fight against poverty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Turkey is a contracting party to the 1951 Geneva Convention on refugees and its supplementary protocol. It has nevertheless set conditions that impose a geographical limitation. Thus Turkey has imposed the restriction that it will only consider asylum applications based on facts that have taken place in Europe. This means that asylum applications by non-European citizens will not be considered admissible by the Turkish state under any circumstances. This is a violation of the rights of refugees as defined in the Geneva Convention and is incompatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (Articles 18 and 19) and the principle of equal treatment.</p>
<p>Has the European Union, by action or omission, accepted the peculiar nature of the above conditions placed on the Geneva Convention, in violation of the principles of humane and equal treatment? Has it called on Turkey to lift these conditions?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council is well aware of the fact that Turkey maintains geographical limitations to the Geneva Convention on refugees and its supplementary protocol. The EU position on the matter, however, remains very clear - this limitation is not in line with the EU acquis on asylum, and Turkey should lift it, and fully implement the Geneva Convention and its supplementary protocol.</p>
<p>Turkey, as a candidate country, has to meet the political criteria set down by the Copenhagen European Council, in particular by fulfilling the requirements of the Negotiating Framework and the Accession Partnership. It also follows from the Negotiating Framework that Turkey is expected to progressively align with the EU acquis - including in the area of asylum.</p>
<p>The lifting of this geographical limitation is also highlighted as a priority in the revised Accession Partnership with Turkey. I would like to recall that the Council systematically calls on Turkey to step up its efforts in meeting the requirements specified in the Negotiating Framework, covering inter alia implementation of the Accession Partnership. The need for sustained efforts in the area of asylum was particularly stressed by the Union at the EU-Turkey Association Council (Ministerial level) on 10 May 2010, and the matter is also regularly raised by the Commission in its meetings with Turkey.</p>
<p>I can therefore assure the honourable Member that this issue will continue to be closely followed and systematically raised at all levels, as appropriate, as full implementation of the 1951 Geneva Convention and its 1967 Protocol forms part of the requirements against which Turkey's progress in the negotiations is being measured.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000126"></a>

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The events unfolding in our southern neighbourhood are of historic proportions and are evolving very quickly. They reflect a profound transformation process in the countries of the Southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>These changes will have lasting consequences for the people and countries of the region. We pay tribute to the courage demonstrated by the people of the region. They have pursued with dignity their legitimate aspirations for democratic change. The changes now underway carry the hope for better life and for greater respect of human rights, pluralism, the rule of law and social justice.</p>
<p>Movement towards democracy is not an easy path - there are risks and uncertainties associated with these transitions. While acknowledging the difficulties, the European Union has taken the clear option of supporting the quest of the peoples of the region for democratic change.</p>
<p>The European Union is keen to support countries in search for a transition from autocratic regimes to democracy, as it has done notably in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The EU is determined to support all steps towards democratic transformation, allowing for peaceful change, growth and prosperity in the Southern neighbourhood. This was confirmed at the highest level by the European Council at its extraordinary meeting of 11 March 2011. Heads of States and governments discussed the developments in the region and extended their full support to the ongoing democratic transformation. They underlined our shared interest for a democratic, stable, prosperous and peaceful Southern Mediterranean.</p>
<p>With a view to a qualitative step forward in our relations with our Southern neighbours, the Commission and the High Representative on 8 March released a joint Communication on a "Partnership for Democracy and Shared Prosperity with the Southern Mediterranean".</p>
<p>The Communication is based on the principle of a joint commitment to commonly shared values such as democracy, human rights, social justice, good governance and the rule of law. The demands for political participation, dignity, freedom and employment opportunities expressed in recent weeks can only be addressed through ambitious political and economic reforms. All countries in the region need to undertake or accelerate such political and economic reforms.</p>
<p>Our renewed policy should take into account the specificity of each situation and country in the region. Existing partnership and assistance programmes will be reviewed in close cooperation with the partners in the region, with the objective of better targeting present needs, based on a country-focused approach.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000133"></a>

In those Conclusions, the Council reaffirms "the need to continue investing in transport infrastructure to ensure proper development of the TEN-T in all transport modes, as a basis for the internal market and competitiveness, economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union and its connection to neighbouring countries, focusing on the "European added value", and taking into account, inter alia, environmental objectives, when defining the future TEN-T policy." It also emphasises that, "while major transnational traffic flows are an important criterion for the planning of the TEN-T, economic, social and territorial cohesion and access to the TEN-T are vital too, and are addressed, to a large extent, by the comprehensive network layer of the current TEN-T; therefore, and given its importance as a reference basis for a variety of legislation in the transport sector, advocates maintaining this comprehensive network."</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>During its extraordinary meeting on energy on 21 March 2011<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Council discussed the response at EU and Member state level to the recent developments in Japan. The Presidency highlighted that the priority is, first and foremost, to provide this country with humanitarian as well as technical assistance.</p>
<p>As far as nuclear safety is concerned, during the same meeting the Council underlined that the priority is to ensure that the highest standards are in force and that improving safety is a continuing process. The Council also welcomed voluntary steps taken by national authorities and industry operators regarding the review of the safety of nuclear facilities.</p>
<p>The Council took also note that there is a shared willingness to launch a process for the definition of a comprehensive risk and safety assessment ("stress-test") of nuclear plants in Europe. In this context, the Council underlined the importance of transparency regarding both the outcome of this assessment and measures taken by member states at national level.</p>
<p>On the same meeting, Member States and the Commission invited ENSREG (European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group) and other relevant bodies to define the scope and modalities of such tests, making use of the available expertise and in due course of the lessons to be learnt from the recent accident. The Council took note of the possible areas (flood risks, seismic risks, back-up systems, emergency procedures) that could be the basis for this assessment. The Council also underlined the need to involve neighbouring third countries in a similar safety and risk assessment for existing and future plants.</p>
<p>These conclusions have been confirmed by the European Council on its meeting of 24-25 March 2011<a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The European Council underlined that the assessments ("stress-tests") will be conducted by independent national authorities and through peer review and that their outcome and any necessary subsequent measures that will be taken should be shared with the Commission and within the ENSREG and should be made public. The European Council will assess initial findings by the end of 2011, on the basis of a report from the Commission.</p>
<p>The European Council highlighted that the priority of ensuring the safety of nuclear plants obviously cannot stop at our borders and that the EU will request that similar "stress tests" be carried out in the neighbouring countries and worldwide, regarding both existing and planned plants. In this regard full use should be made of relevant international organisations.</p>
<p>In this context, the European Council also underlined that the highest standards for nuclear safety should be implemented and continuously improved in the EU and promoted internationally.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

In Parliament’s report on the UN Human Rights Council and the EU’s role in it, adopted in February 2009, the EP strongly advocated the introduction of membership criteria for this important UN body.

<p>(EN) The present answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on either the Council or its members as such, was not presented orally at Question Time to the Council during the April 2011 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>UN General Assembly resolution 60/251 establishing the Human Rights Council (HRC), clarifies that the Members of this body have to "uphold the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights, and shall fully cooperate with the Council". Consequently, when electing the 47 Members of the HRC, the General Assembly shall take into account the human rights records and commitments of all candidates.</p>
<p>Until now, the UN General Assembly has not fully implemented this principle, as we have seen in the case of Libya. That is why the issue of “quality membership” must form an important part of the ongoing HRC Review, and indeed the UN General Assembly decided to include the issue in the New York leg of the Review. The co-facilitators appointed by the President of the General Assembly to steer the HRC Review debate in New York organised a first meeting specifically to address this matter on 29 March. As a contribution to this debate, the EU has put forward concrete ideas, such as holding hearings for candidates to the HRC prior to the elections, involving Member States, NGOs and National Human Rights Institutions. These hearings should focus on voluntary pledges and commitments, as well as on how the candidate country intends to comply with the requirement of upholding the highest standards in the promotion and protection of human rights.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000117"></a>

<p>(EN) While the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological development (FP7, 2007-2013) does not provide for sports-related research as such, FP7 does promote research on the health benefits of physical activity.</p>
<p>The FP7 Health and Food, Agriculture and Fisheries Biotechnologies Themes and the Regions of Knowledge activity, have however addressed physical activity and its links to health promotion and disease prevention and development through a number of FP7 projects. Some EUR 39 million have been invested in such research funding over the period 2005 to 2010, translating into some eight EU projects. On-going evaluations may also result in other projects being funded in this area.</p>
<p>A number of relevant FP7 projects have been funded over the last four years. The PAPA project aims to promote adolescent health through a behavioural change intervention aimed at improved the quality of their participation in physical activity via youth sport, in particular football.

The EXGENSIS project (FP6) focuses on intracellular signaling pathways during exercise and the effects of such exercise. The TOYBOX project uses behavioural models to understand and promote fun, healthy food, play and policy for the prevention of obesity in early childhood, while the I.FAMILY project starting in March 2012 will investigate how the built environment impacts on physical activity, sedentary behaviours and sleep patterns interact with dietary behaviour.</p>
<p>At a regional level, the AFRESH project aims at developing a research agenda for reducing diet- and physical inactivity-related (chronic) diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular diseases and various types of cancer, by developing innovative products and services within the field of nutrition and physical activity.</p>
<p>To conclude, the Commission fully recognises the fact that physical activity is a key factor contributing to the prevention of major lifestyle related diseases such as obesity and that relevant research is needed to provide the necessary basis for more effective and efficient evidence-based strategies of health promotion and disease prevention.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000121"></a>

<p>(EN) The United States is the international partner with whom the European Union has the richest, most intensive relations in Science and Technology (S&amp;T). This is true from all points of view: amounts of mutual Research and Development (R&amp;D) investment, flows of scientists and researchers, volumes of cooperative activities and the number of co-authored publications and patents. International cooperation is important for supporting the Europe 2020 goals and so activities with the United States need to be a priority. The Commissioner in charge for Industry and Entrepreneurship, Mr Tajani, has travelled to the United States (US) twice in 2010 to boost the EU-US collaboration, including the first trip abroad as Commissioner.</p>
<p>The 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007-2013) is the main funding mechanism for European-level research, which also supports the EU's international cooperation. Outside Europe, the United States is the number one participant in the 7th Framework Programme, with well over 300 signed grant agreements and other collaborations. Its participation is particularly strong in the themes of Health, Information and Communication Technologies, Nanotechnologies and Materials, Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and Biotechnologies, and Environment.</p>
<p>The Science and Technology Cooperation Agreement between the EU and the United States was renewed in 2009 until 2013. In May 2010 in Washington DC the annual joint meeting was held under this agreement, coordinated on the United States side by the Department of State. Both parties took stock of progress under that agreement, and new ways of working together are being developed. These range from the twinning of projects through to the mutual opening of research programmes, such as those in the area of health research with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The next meeting under the agreement is planned for September 2011 in Brussels.</p>
<p>The S&amp;T agreement also provides the framework for a number of Implementing Arrangements with specific United States government departments and agencies. One example is the Implementing Arrangement with the Department of Homeland Security on civil security research, which was signed in November 2010 by the Commissioner in charge for Industry and Entrepreneurship Mr Tajani. The Joint Research Centre is currently leading discussions on a similar arrangement with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), on issues as diverse as environmental contaminants, coastal hazards, space weather, climate change and crisis management. This year will also see the renewal of our 20-year relationship with the United States on biotechnology research, as well as the continuation of our dialogue on civil space cooperation.</p>
<p>Innovation is an area where Europe has a strong interest in sharing experiences with the United States on how best to turn knowledge into stronger economic growth and job creation. Among the most interesting developments over the past year is the new Transatlantic Innovation Action Partnership, launched under the Transatlantic Economic Council (TEC). This partnership responds to the political direction given to the TEC at the last EU-US summit, i.e. to promote innovation, streamline regulation, and eliminate barriers to trade and investment. In December 2010, the TEC agreed on an initial work plan for the Innovation Action Partnership. Work has started in the areas of the bio-economy, raw materials and the cross-cutting aspects of innovation policy.</p>
<p>The EU-US Energy Council, established at the end of 2009, is another important development. Three working groups – on energy policy, technologies development and markets – have established themselves and agreed their remits during 2010. The Working Group on Technology and R&amp;D has organised itself to produce operational deliverables. The EU also collaborates with the United States in multilateral settings such as the fusion reactor, ITER<a href="#defann_12_1" name="refann_12_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In order to gain more from joint efforts, the Commission will continue working on a more strategic focus to our research collaboration. This will concentrate on the global challenges, and be consistent with the Europe 2020 goals, as well as the aims of the Innovation Union initiative.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As the honourable Member rightly states, the Innovation Union is at the heart of our strategy for growth and jobs. It will help secure future economic growth for the EU through the development of our capacity to create new knowledge and to transform it into successful products. A key role in this process will be played by enhanced research cooperation between the Member States, notably through Joint Programming.</p>
<p>Concerning the expansion of R&amp;D in certain regions, the underlying principle governing the allocation of research funding under the Framework Programme is excellence. This means that only the very best research proposals are selected for funding. It is not possible therefore, nor would it be desirable, for the Commission to try to direct research funding under the FP to specific regions.</p>
<p>However, as the honourable Member suggests, it is clear that some regions have established advantages in given domains of research, whether they be natural advantages or related to past investment in research capacity, including human resources. Regions with such advantages will be well placed to submit strong research proposals that have a good chance of attracting EU research funding.</p>
<p>Of course, regional advantages will not always be as obvious as sunshine in Spain and wind in Ireland. Therefore, regions need to be able to identify and develop their potential advantages. This is why the Commission is strongly in favour of the development of smart specialisation strategies in the regions.</p>
<p>Smart specialisation is one of the 10 conditions for well-performing national and regional research and innovation systems under the Innovation Union's self assessment tool. It aims at encouraging national and regional authorities to concentrate resources on a limited number of priorities to ensure a more effective use of public funds and help to leverage private investment.</p>
<p>Smart specialisation strategies are a means to exploit regional diversity, stimulate cooperation across national and regional borders and open up new opportunities by avoiding fragmentation and ensuring that knowledge flows more freely across the EU. They can be instrumental in helping regions to identify both their key assets and the factors that hamper innovation; to concentrate resources on key priorities and to design the right policy mix to unleash smart growth. They can also ensure a more effective and complimentary use of EU funds and national and regional investments.</p>
<p>To assist the regions in this process the Commission is in the process of launching a ‘Smart Specialisation Platform’ with the necessary resources to spread information, encourage mutual learning and increase capacities and skills.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000129"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers research in the HIV/AIDS and in malaria fields as a high priority and has been supporting research in these areas through the Research Framework Programmes (FP), with the overall aim to structure and integrate European research by creating a close partnership between research teams in European and disease-endemic countries as well as between industrial and public sector research.</p>
<p>From 1998 until 2010, the EU has supported collaborative research with EUR 259.9 million on 84 HIV/AIDS projects and EUR 150.3 million on 59 malaria projects. EU-funded research includes new therapeutic and preventive strategies against the two diseases, from early discovery to clinical testing of new drugs, vaccine candidates, HIV microbicides and new tools for malaria vector control. Throughout its funding, strong emphasis has been put on collaboration with disease-endemic countries, in particular Sub-Saharan Africa. Particular achievements have been the comparability of data sets on new drugs or vaccine candidates, helping to harmonize pre-clinical assays and animal models and making European research more competitive at international level.</p>
<p>Two concrete examples are: the HIVIS project, which delivered an IV/AIDS vaccine candidate, which is now in the late phases of clinical trial to assess safety and immunogenicity, and the malaria basic research network BioMalPar, which has developed into a cornerstone of EU basic research with an integrative malaria graduate school. At present the Commission is setting its priorities for future funding in the HIV/AIDS and malaria areas for the next 2012 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7, 2007-2013) Health calls.</p>
<p>In 2003, the European &amp; Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) was established by the EU to support clinical research and capacity building on the three main poverty-related diseases of HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis with a focus on sub-Saharan Africa. EDCTP is the first initiative based on Article 169 of the EU treaty (now Article 185). It is funded with EUR 200 million by the EU through FP6 and co-funded with EUR 200 million from 16 European EDCTP partner countries. Additional co-funding comes from third parties. Since 2003, EDCTP supported 163 projects with a total value of approximately EUR 311 million.

<p>(EN) The Commission intends that EU funding for research and innovation will be provided from 2014 onwards through a Common Strategic Framework for Research and Innovation Funding.</p>
<p>The Common Strategic Framework was proposed in the EU Budget Review. The main principles on which it will be based were outlined there: supporting key Europe 2020 policy priorities, increasing EU added value and generating more impact from EU expenditure.</p>
<p>The aim of the Common Strategic Framework is to make EU research and innovation funding more efficient, with greater impact and providing simplified access for participants.</p>
<p>The Commission adopted on 9 February 2011 a Green Paper entitled: “From Challenges to Opportunities: Towards a Common Strategic Framework for EU research and innovation funding”<a href="#defann_15_1" name="refann_15_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Green Paper has outlined three major objectives for the Common Strategic Framework: tackling major societal challenges, strengthening the competitiveness of Europe's industry and raising the levels of excellence in the European research base. Research into food, agriculture and biotechnology can contribute to tackle these challenges.</p>
<p>The Commission is seeking input from as broad a range of stakeholders as possible, including that of the other EU institutions. Stakeholders are invited to provide input until 20 May 2011.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently consulting its stakeholders and the outcome of the consultation will feed into its further proposal development. Therefore, it is at this stage premature to discuss the possible architecture of the future programme or the role of any particular themes or sectors therein, including potential budgets. The overall budget will depend on the decisions on the future multi-annual financial perspectives for the post 2013 period.</p>
<p>Several studies and reports (United Kingdom Foresight "The Future of Food and Farming", the on-going work on agriculture foresight carried out by the Standing Committee on Agricultural Research, the 2009 OECD report on "Challenges for Agricultural Research", etc.) advocate for ambitious research programmes in agriculture. They focus on the challenges that agriculture will need to respond to in the coming decades: catering for the food needs of a growing population, with more resource-efficient and environmentally sustainable practices deriving from increases in scarcities (water, energy, soil depletion, etc.), taking into account the needs to mitigate and adapt to climate change.</p>
<p>Within this context a number of important questions arise. How should research and innovation best enhance the smart use of biological (animal and plant production and health and their inputs, biomass availability, forestry management and waste), and physical resources (land use, soil integrity, water availability, climate change, etc)? How can research and innovation best contribute to increase yields and enhance soils in a sustainable manner, while preserving, ecosystems? How can the agri-sector competiveness best be fostered through science and technology applied to farming, food processing and bio based industries? All those questions and many more will be duly considered in the coming months.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) With reference to the honourable Members question on what steps the Commission has taken in response to the alleged violations of EU environmental law with regard to the Kaliakra Peninsula and other Natura 2000 protected areas in Bulgaria, the Commission would refer to the number of infringement procedures it has initiated against Bulgaria, and to the constructive dialogue it has engaged in with both the Bulgarian authorities and the environmental NGOs.</p>
<p>More specifically, with regard to the Special Protection Areas (SPAs) part of the Natura 2000 network in Bulgaria, as a result of the above-mentioned dialogue the Commission is expecting concrete steps for the extension of Rila, Pirin, Lomovete, Central Balkan, and Western Rhodopes SPAs. The Bulgarian authorities committed to finalize and formally adopt those extensions by the end of March 2011. The Commission was informed that on 11.3.2011 the National Council for Biodiversity, which is the expert advisory body to the Bulgarian Minister of Environment and Water, has discussed concrete proposals for extensions of the above-mentioned SPAs. This indicates that the relevant national procedure is moving forward as agreed. With regard to Kaliakra SPA, recently both the Bulgarian authorities and the environmental NGOs submitted large quantity of technical information which the Commission services are carefully studying and evaluating.</p>
<p>With reference to the honourable Members question on what action the Commission will take to ensure that the irregularities referred to in the complementary letter of formal notice (LFN) sent to the Bulgarian authorities on 18.3.2010 are rectified, the Commission would refer to the large amount of technical information submitted by the Bulgarian authorities in their reply to the complementary LFN of 20.5.2010, and in their additional communication of 8.9.2010. This LFN is additional to the LFN sent on 3.11.2009. Both letters address large number of plans and projects authorised without considering the protection of IBAs and SPAs. Given the volumes and complexity of the information received, the technical assessment has been outsourced and is expected to be finalized by the end of March 2011. Furthermore, additional technical information has been provided to the Commission by environmental NGOs on 3.3.2011. This information is currently being carefully studied and evaluated.</p>
<p>With reference to the honourable Members question on when the Commission intends to move to the next stage and send a ‘reasoned opinion’ to Bulgaria, why the Commission is hesitating over launching the procedure under Article 258 TFEU<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and what the Commission intends to do to address the situation in Bulgaria, the Commission would point out that the cases concerned involve a high degree of factual and technical analysis. Because the Commission bears the burden of proof in any infringement procedure, the Commission services need to check and analyse all the available information very carefully. Furthermore, any future decisions with regard to the infringement procedures against Bulgaria for bad application of EU environmental law are decisions for the Commission as a whole and will be based on both sound legal analysis as well as precise factual and scientific information.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As acknowledged by the Commission in its Communication of 2010 towards a new EU Biodiversity Strategy, the EU failed to achieve its 2010 Biodiversity targets. Only 17% of the Species and Habitats of European conservation concern, protected under the EU Habitats Directive, have a favourable conservation status.</p>
<p>Reaching the new 2020 EU headline target to halt biodiversity loss and restore ecosystems and the services they provide will require a significant effort to step up implementation of the Birds and Habitats Directives to ensure significant and measurable progress towards achieving a favourable conservation status for species and habitats of European importance. This headline target will be addressed in a new EU Biodiversity Strategy that will be adopted by the Commission shortly. The Strategy will also respond to the global commitments made by the EU in Nagoya last October in the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity.</p>
<p>The EU Birds and Habitats Directives are critical tools to achieve EU biodiversity goals and as they stand are fully fit for purpose. The Commission will therefore not accept their watering down at this crucial time of implementation.</p>
<p>As regards implementation and enforcement of EU environmental legislation more generally, the Commission intends to come forward with a new Communication on this issue later in 2011 in order to improve the overall governance structure and knowledge base that underpins the implementation of the environmental acquis.

<p>(EN) The Commission takes due account of scientific assessment, where decisions on environmental matters are concerned. This is in fact a requirement under the Treaty, which specifically stipulates that environment policy shall take account of available scientific data, and the Commission is committed to an evidence and science-based approach to policy-making.</p>
<p>In developing and implementing EU environment policy, the Commission uses research, data and analysis of the European Environment Agency, the Joint Research Centre and other EU-funded research. It also commissions specific studies to bring together the most relevant, best and up-to-date knowledge, as and when required.</p>
<p>Whilst Member States remain fully responsible for the full and correct implementation of European environmental legislation and requirements, the Commission takes a strict but helpful approach in its role of ensuring they meet these obligations. On the one hand it takes a strict but balanced approach to infringements, whilst on the other hand it seeks to offer as much assistance as possible in pursuit of the delivery of EU environment policy objectives, so that EU-wide environmental improvements can be achieved.</p>
<p>Solidarity is a core principle of the EU. One of the ways solidarity is expressed is via the EU budget. Financial support is available to Member States from the LIFE-plus environment financial instrument. Support from the Structural Funds is also possible. The Cohesion Fund, for example, contributes some EUR6.5 billion per year towards environmental infrastructure, focusing on waste water, water supply and waste, mostly in the new Member States.</p>
<p>Other significant environment-related funding is available under Rural Development, managed through the Common Agricultural Policy. In addition, scientific capacity-building in the environment field is supported through EU-funded research.</p>
<p>The Commission also supports the Member States' efforts to achieve environmental goals in a number of other ways, inter alia by issuing guidelines that aim to provide information useful to those implementing environment policy. In specific areas of policy where this is thought to be useful, these guidelines go beyond the information provided within EU environment legislation and are drafted with better implementation in mind. Also, specific advice is offered to individual Member States by the European Commission, e.g. through periodic 'package meetings' where a number of environment policy implementation issues can be raised in a bilateral setting. In addition, the Commission gives individual expert advice to officials at various levels in Member States, on request. And finally, there is a wide range of support offered by the European Environment Agency, whose role includes support for Member States and others across a wide range of policy issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000146"></a>

Gathering the electronic waste from many small sources is a big collective task which is best achieved by setting a clear and ambitious legislative framework. This is the reason for being of the Directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment, or WEEE<a href="#defann_20_4" name="refann_20_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> The current collection rate is about one third of waste electrical and electronic equipment generated, and it is realistic to raise it to 85% by 2016 as proposed by the Commission<a href="#defann_20_5" name="refann_20_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a> and as supported by the Parliament in first reading. The Council has proposed a later date (2020 or 2022) for achieving such an ambition level and new promising debates are expected in the coming months to finalise this dossier in second reading.</p>
<p>The WEEE Directive also includes minimum recycling targets, differentiated by category of equipment. According to the 'producer responsibility' principle, producers are responsible to set up systems for the proper treatment of WEEE collected. They profit from the recovery of precious materials, which indeed are a significant source of secondary often precious raw material.</p>
<p>Unfortunately in the foreseeable future recycling can not replace the use of primary materials entirely. Demand for new products keeps rising, the resources become available only after a certain time, and recycling rates are not 100%. Collection and recycling rates must be raised as much as possible. And while primary mining is still needed, rules remain necessary to ensure that extractive industries operate in an environmentally sound manner.</p>
<p>There is a comprehensive set of rules in place for this purpose, including the Directives on Environmental Impact Assessments, Strategic Environmental Assessments, and Industrial Emissions. More specifically, cyanide mining technologies are covered in the Mining Waste Directive. The Commission's priority must be to ensure the full implementation of this Directive. It includes several requirements to ensure the safety of mining waste facilities and limit their impact on the environment. Strict limit values for cyanide concentration – the strictest world wide to the Commission's best knowledge - are defined in the Directive.</p>
<p>Waste facilities have to be operated using the "best available technique" concept as defined in a publically available reference document. The Commission is now working on the development of inspection guidance for the Member States to ensure a full enforcement of the Directive.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the Commission would like to insist on the importance of moving towards a resource efficient society. The example provided by the honourable Member on the recycling of discarded mobile phones is particularly relevant. Recycling more provides several advantages from reducing environmental impacts to ensuring a sustainable and stable access to raw material and developing jobs and innovation in the Union.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) On 11 March 2011, the Commission adopted a Commission Decision<a href="#defann_21_1" name="refann_21_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the United Kingdom (UK) request to be exempted from the obligation to apply the PM10 limit values in London and Gibraltar. As regards London, this was the second time the UK requested an exemption after the first request was rejected by the Commission in December 2009.</p>
<p>According to this Decision, the UK authorities have to adjust the air quality plan for London by 11 June 2011. This is the date by which the exemption ends and the PM10 daily limit value will have to be met.</p>
<p>As stated in the Commission Decision, the UK has produced an air quality plan outlining how it plans to reach compliance by 11 June 2011. However, in view of the very narrow margin by which compliance is projected and the risk of further exceedances, the Commission has asked the UK authorities to adopt further measures effective for controlling or, where necessary, suspending activities which contribute to the risk of the limit value being exceeded. This is meant to ensure the full toolbox for addressing exceedances is readily available when/if required, irrespective of whether such exceedances would appear.</p>
<p>The competence to decide on the measures lies entirely with the Member States. Under the "subsidiarity" principle it is acknowledged that Member States - and their local authorities - are best placed to identify the most efficient and tailor made measures to address high concentration levels in their air quality zones.</p>
<p>As the long term measures are provided for in the already existing air quality plan, the short-term measures are meant to address any risk of exceedances during, for example, specific pollution episodes. Those measures are therefore not supposed to address a sustained exceedance problem over the long-term but rather meant to be seen as complementing instead of 'emergency' actions.</p>
<p>Measures that could fall under this category could be measures in relation to motor-vehicle traffic, construction works, the use of industrial plants or products and domestic heating. They could consist of controlling and, where necessary, suspending those activities contributing to the risk of the limit value being exceeded. Specific actions aimed at the protection of sensitive population groups, including children, may also be considered.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission understands the concerns of the honourable Member. Similar preoccupations have been expressed by other Members of the European Parliament, Member States and the European industry.</p>
<p>At the moment, the EU has no international commitments vis-à-vis China in the area of public procurement. As a consequence, Chinese suppliers and/or Chinese goods do not enjoy a secured access to the EU procurement markets, unlike the General Partnership Agreement (GPA) or Free Trade Agreement (FTA) partners for sectors covered by these agreements. Since China is currently negotiating accession to the GPA this situation could change in the coming years. In the context of the accession process the EU requests China to commit to setting ambitious market access goals.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Commission will present a legislative proposal clarifying the terms of access to the EU public procurement markets for bids and suppliers from third countries, covering procurement committed internationally and procurement not committed. The objective of this proposal will be to restore fair competition in the internal market and to ensure an increased leverage of the EU in international negotiations. This proposal has been announced by the Commission in its Communications "Towards a Single Market Act"<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> and "Trade, Growth and World Affairs"<a href="#defann_22_2" name="refann_22_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. It will clarify the position of third countries (and their suppliers) which have not subscribed to any international commitments vis-à-vis the EU in this field and should be based on a principle of reciprocity. The Commission is currently conducting an impact assessment in order to make a cost-benefit analysis of the possible options.</p>
<p>The current EU rules on public procurement already contain provisions on abnormally low tenders. These provisions give contracting authorities the power, after having verified the constituent elements of the tender, to reject the tender if they consider that there are no sufficient guarantees that the tenderer will perform the contract according to the terms offered. Moreover, contracting authorities should require contractors to execute the works in accordance with the terms of the concluded contract and can, under the conditions defined in the law of the Member State concerned, ask the competent court to issue an injunction to this end.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware that European business and in particular small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have to bear disproportionately high costs when they seek patent protection in Europe. Most of these costs come from the patent translation requirements imposed by the Member States. It is clear that these costs have an adverse effect on the global competitiveness innovative businesses in Europe.</p>
<p>In 2000, the Commission presented a proposal with the objective of creating an EU patent. The EU patent would have allowed SMEs to get patent protection through a single application in the entire EU. Also, the translation requirements would have been limited.</p>
<p>Member States, however, could not reach a unianimous agreement that would have been necessary for the creation of the EU patent. This failure was confirmed at the Competitiveness Council meeting on 10 December 2010 and subsequently 25 Member States decided to embark on enhanced cooperation in the area of the creation of unitary patent protection.</p>
<p>On 10 March 2011, following the consent given by the European Parliament, the Competitiveness Council authorised the launch of enhanced cooperation between 25 Member States. At this stage, Spain and Italy decided not to participate. They have the possibility to join in the future.</p>
<p>The Commission will soon present its proposals for the implementing regulations with simplified registration and translation requirements. The timely adoption of these regulations by the Council and the European Parliament would ensure that European SMEs could get patent protection for the territories of 25 Member States for less than 10% of the sum they have to pay today for patent protection in the entire EU. In addition they would continue to have the possiblity to apply for patent protection in Spain and Italy. If they do, they would still not pay more altogether than 20% of the sum they have to pay today for patent protection in the 27 countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000130"></a>

Such tests have been conducted in Japan and in India. It is calculated that approximately 220 million tons of red mud is stored within the territory of the EU in various forms. These solutions are within reach. Nonetheless, further research is needed in order to perfect them, and their application will require considerable investment.</p>

<p>(EN) In the Communication on raw materials adopted on 2<span class="sup">nd</span> February 2011, the Commission stated that the extraction of useful materials from waste – including mining waste – is one of the main sources of metals and minerals for European industry. It was also recognised that the use of secondary raw materials contributes to resource efficiency, to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, to the preservation of the environment and the reduction of external dependence on raw materials.</p>
<p>That said, the potential of many of these resources is not being fully exploited and the barriers which prevent recycling need to be further addressed.</p>
<p>In order to help address this situation, in 2011 the Commission will assess whether to launch an Innovation Partnership on raw materials within the Europe 2020 Flagship on Innovation Union. Such a partnership could enhance innovation in recycling and in other parts of the raw materials value chain. As such, innovative ways to recover resources from mining waste – including 'red mud' – could be considered within this proposed partnership.</p>
<p>Under the next FP7 call for proposals to be published in July 2011, the industrial technologies theme called "Nanosciences, Nanotechnologies, Materials and New Production Technologies" – NMP plans to finance R&amp;D proposals on new environmentally friendly approaches in minerals processing.</p>
<p>The planned mineral processing topic is directly relevant to the question in terms of targeting R&amp;D on:</p>
<p>novel technologies for the processing of low-quality raw materials and tailings with increased removal of impurities and recovery of usable minerals, including base and precious metals, but also critical raw materials for the EU , for example rare earth elements;</p>
<p>closed process system with non-toxic reagents with zero impact on existing surroundings, and where appropriate mobile mineral processing plants;</p>
<p>advanced waste, water and energy management; and</p>
<p>better process control and automation through intelligent IT based systems for process intensification and reducing human exposure.</p>
<p>Red mud recycling is also covered by this research topic. It is expected that between EUR 15-20 Mio will be spent on several research projects.</p>
<p>In addition, LIFE is the EU’s financial instrument supporting environmental and nature conservation projects throughout the EU. In 2003, a Greek project on "Rehabilitation of abandoned bauxite surface mines using alumina red mud as filler" was financed by LIFE. This project (LIFE03 ENV/GR/000213) succeeded in developing a full design for the refilling of abandoned open pit mines with red mud. Its tests showed the success and potential environmental benefits of this innovative dry disposal system of red mud as a way of both rehabilitating disused pits and reducing pollution of the sea.</p>
<p>The LIFE programme is composed of three strands (LIFE+ Nature &amp; Biodiversity; LIFE+ Environment Policy &amp; Governance and LIFE+ Information &amp; Communication). A project on industrial reutilization and recycling of red mud in Europe could be financed under the LIFE+ Environment Policy &amp; Governance strand.</p>
<p>The LIFE + 2011 Call for porposals has been published the 26 February 2011 and the deadline for the applicants to send their proposals is set at 18 July 2011.</p>
<p>Finally, recycling is one of the prioirites under the Competitiveness and Innovaiton Framework Programme- eco-innovation strand. The market replication projects support innovative solutions concerned with replication of eco-innovative techniques, products, services or practices. This instrument is oriented towards SMEs and aims to close the gap between research and market up-take as well as broader market penetration of eco-innovation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000131"></a>

Without special assistance, these children face serious disadvantage by the end of their primary education, which makes it very difficult for them to move on to secondary and tertiary education. In the long run, learning difficulties worsen employment opportunities and, therefore, result in poverty and social exclusion, as well as in a decline in Europe’s competitiveness.</p>

<p>(EN) As regards learning difficulties, the Commission supports, through the Open Method of Coordination, the implementation of the 2008 Council Conclusions on European cooperation in schools. These conclusions invite the Member States to increase levels of literacy and numeracy, identify learning difficulties early and ensure timely and adequate learning support for each student.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Commission collaborates with and contributes to the work of the European Agency for the Development of Special Needs Education, which provides Member States with opportunities to exchange and learn from their varied practices in supporting people with various learning difficulties. The Commission closely monitors developments in the area of Special Needs Education through its annual Progress Reports</p>
<p>Through the Lifelong Learning Programme, the Commission also provides financial support to promote the education and inclusion of those children and adults with special needs. One priority for the Comenius programme, for example, is to identify and disseminate effective approaches in this field and help train teachers and school leaders to promote full inclusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore the European Union has been a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities since 22 January 2011. All Member States have signed the Convention and the majority of them have also ratified. Article 24 of the Convention places obligations on State Parties to realise the right of persons with disabilities to education.</p>
<p>In order to support the implementation of the Convention, the Commission adopted in 2010 a European Disability Strategy 2010-2020<a href="#defann_25_1" name="refann_25_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The recent Council Conclusions on preparatory work for the pilot European Innovation Partnership (EIP) "Active and Healthy Ageing", as adopted by the Council ("Competitiveness") at its meeting on 9-10 March 2011 mark the start of the pilot EIP functioning, with the establishment of a Steering Group and the envisaged participation of representatives of Member States representatives (i.e. Belgium, Spain, Hungary and Poland) in the work of the Partnership.</p>
<p>We now have all the necessary elements in place to start undertaking the preparatory work for the pilot including, notably, drawing up recommendations for a Strategic Implementation Plan, by end of summer 2011, on the basis of which initiatives will be put forward through appropriate institutional channels for the implementation of the pilot EIP. The Commission will then, and in principle before the end of 2011, present its views and proposals in a Communication to Council and Parliament for their political endorsement.</p>
<p>The Commission will seek to build synergies between the pilot EIP on Active and healthy Ageing and the 2012 European Year for Active Ageing. The European Year 2012 should ensure greater visibility for the EIP. On the other hand, the EIP, which will run until 2020, could be a good vehicle to implement some of the commitments undertaken by stakeholders during the 2012 European Year on Active Ageing and respond to the call of the Council for common principles for active ageing (EPSCO Council conclusions on active ageing adopted in 7 June 2010).</p>
<p>On the basis of the Council conclusions of 26 November 2010 and also taking into account the experience in setting up the present pilot EIP, the views of the stakeholders, and the evaluation of the pilot EIP later in the year, the Commission expects to launch a second wave of innovation partnerships by end of 2011.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000138"></a>

Publishers today are developing new business models both in print and in the digital environment and therefore face heavy investment costs. I come from a tiny Member State – Estonia – where newspaper distribution is quite small, but the cost of digital switch-over is the same for the whole sector. Therefore, sharing such a significant part of the subscription revenue with Apple could result in higher prices to the customers. The EU should ensure that publishers have the right legislative framework in which to draw up their media offers. This includes ensuring either zero or reduced rates of VAT for both printed and online newspapers. Moreover, for publishers, the freedom to choose payment systems is paramount, as is maintaining direct contact with their subscribers.

<p>(EN) The Commission is actively following the evolution of electronic publications on tablet devices. The Commission's assessment is as follows. These products are in their early stages. Many details of how the market(s) will function are currently the subject of intense negotiations among the market parties. Clearly it is in the interest of public authorities that these converge towards a set of business practices that will deliver a sustainable basis for innovative goods and services.</p>
<p>Apple's behaviour could infringe EU rules if Apple were to implement anticompetitive agreements that foreclose competition or abuse a dominant position on the relevant market(s). As there are several platforms and a large number of devices that can provide similar functionalities, it is not clear that any one company, including Apple, has attained a dominant position at this stage.</p>
<p>Apart from undistorted competition, the Commission wants innovative products to take full advantage of Single Market freedoms so that citizens can consume digital content, including press, anywhere at anytime.</p>
<p>The Commission will shortly be announcing the establishment of one or more high level groups to consider inter alia the future of news media. The tablet developments will certainly be discussed within this group framework and the Commission will continue to follow them closely.</p>
<p>The alignment of VAT rates for electronic and printed press is already being debated. The honourable Member will be aware that the Commission launched a much wider policy debate on the overhaul of the VAT system in its Green Paper published in December 2010. The ensuing consultation remains open till the end of May 2011. Responses to the questions posed in the Green Paper will no doubt provide evidence that will help orient future policy responses, namely whether the current structure of VAT rates hinders the effective operation of the Single Market by distorting competition; whether it constitutes asymmetric treatment of comparable products, notably of online press services compared with other press products and services having similar content; or whether it engenders high compliance costs for undertakings.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000139"></a>

<p>(FR) A green common agricultural policy (CAP) is a key objective of the reform under way to better meet environmental challenges. The future CAP should make an important contribution to the management of natural resources, in particular with a view to supporting the EU’s international commitments. Indeed, the objectives to be achieved in terms of climate change and biodiversity are an integral part of the Europe 2020 strategy, in which the CAP plays a full part.</p>
<p>In accordance, therefore, with the broad lines of the CAP reform project, set out in the Commission Communication of 18 November 2010<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, the future CAP must meet, at the same time, the requirements of food security, management of natural resources and vitality of rural areas. As regards maintaining biodiversity and combating climate change, both the first pillar and the second pillar of the CAP must help to achieve this. The Commission proposes in particular a green component under the first pillar to accommodate the obligation for farmers to carry out actions such as, for example, permanent meadow upkeep, crop rotation, vegetation cover and environmental set-aside, and those provided for in Natura 2000 areas.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently looking at various possible ways of implementing this. If the green CAP is to be effective, it is essential to strike the right balance in terms of the cost/benefit of the measures concerned and to ensure that the direct payment management and control system does not become unwieldy. At the same time, green direct payments would go hand in hand with a redefinition of conditionality and appropriate rural development measures. An impact assessment is being carried out with a view to the presentation of legislative proposals by the end of the year.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission will provide the European Parliament with a comprehensive reply to the Resolution on EU agriculture and international trade<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> referred to by the honourable Member in her question, in accordance with the rules in force concerning the follow up by the Commission regarding non-legislative Resolutions of the Parliament.</p>
<p>While it is a fact that trade liberalisation raises challenges for EU agriculture, it is important to highlight that trade agreements provide new opportunities to EU agriculture stemming from our partners' concessions and it would be wrong to simply portray increased trade openness as a mere lose-lose scenario for EU agriculture. In addition, the wider benefits potentially delivered by trade openings for the European economy as a whole need to be borne in mind.</p>
<p>As regards the specific issue of trade negotiations with Mercosur, the negotiations on a EU - Mercosur Association Agreement have been re-launched in view of reaching a balanced and comprehensive agreement between the two regions, which would deepen relations and offer great political and economic benefits to both sides. The Commission is fully committed to pursue this goal. The re-launch of these negotiations has received support from both stakeholders and the European Parliament.</p>
<p>Mercosur is a large and dynamic economy with a GDP growth rate of around 8% in 2010. An agreement with Mercosur would be the first comprehensive deal on trade for our South American partners. It would give EU exporters an edge over their competitors in the rest of the world by enshrining privileged access to a market of 260 million people of middle income in one region of the world where purchasing power is rising fastest.</p>
<p>In general, the very challenge when negotiating multilateral or bilateral trade agreements that impact EU agriculture is to strike the right balance between our offensive and our defensive interests in agriculture as well as between agriculture and other areas of our trade negotiations. The Commission is very conscious of this and will continue to pursue such a goal, in close cooperation with the Parliament and the Council, with respect to the range of ongoing talks to which the EU remains fully committed, whether in multilateral or in bilateral contexts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

This could include, among others, capacity building and technical assistance for election preparation, institution building as well as election observation. The development of the ongoing reforms in Egypt is in the hands of the Egyptian authorities and the Egyptian people. The Commission is ready to provide support, as soon as Egypt asks for it. The Commission has repeatedly expressed its interest in observing the Egyptian elections in the past. With the ongoing democratic reform, this issue is growing in importance. The EU will be ready to send a fully fledged, or a more limited electoral assessment or electoral expert’s mission if the Egyptian authorities invite us to do so.</p>
<p>The popular uprising of 25 January 2011 started thanks to the engagement of the youth and emerging political movements. The EU attaches great importance to working with these groups of civil society. For this reason EUR 2 million has been allocated from the Instrument for Stability for immediate support to the civil society organisations and civic movements. The main objective of the programme will be to increase their capacity to participate in the ongoing reform, create platforms for exchange of views, provide expertise and trainings and support public awareness. The programme will mobilise experts from Europe, including Central and Eastern Europe, as well as from the Arab region. Special attention will be paid to the role of women.</p>
<p>A civil society support package in the amount of EUR 17,7 million is also being launched locally in Cairo through the calls for proposals. Their timeframe is longer and the projects will start mostly around summer, hence their focus is adjusted to women rights, youth, children rights, media, freedom of belief, freedom of expression, combating torture, etc.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2011-000147"></a>

<p>When establishing the Pilot ‘Blue Belt’ Project in November 2010, the Commission chose to concentrate on ships engaged exclusively in internal EU trade. In particular, the beneficial use of SafeSeaNet is underlined in the project, as a tool to reduce administrative burdens on short sea shipping. However, deep sea shipping could also benefit from the use of SafeSeaNet as a tool to reduce administrative burdens, as these operators also carry goods between EU ports during parts of their international voyages.</p>
<p>How will the Commission ensure that deep sea shipping also benefits from the potential facilitations foreseen in the Blue Belt project, and how does it intend to fully integrate these operators in the pilot projects?</p>
<p>Will the Commission work in future towards a genuine single European maritime area, in which both short sea shipping and deep sea shipping draw on the benefits of SafeSeaNet, thereby ensuring a level playing field with other modes of transport and reducing administrative burdens in all parts of the shipping industry?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As stated in the White Paper on transport policy<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, further simplification of administrative procedures in force in maritime transport is still necessary to encourage that waterborne transport is used to its full potential.</p>
<p>In this respect, the Blue Belt pilot project, undertaken by the European Maritime Safety Agency in cooperation with customs authorities and a number of volunteering shipping companies and due for completion in 2011, will show to the customs authorities in Member States how EU monitoring capabilities developed by this Agency can help them in their daily task, and how usual administrative formalities can be eased, without reducing the level of compliance to the various legislations. Amongst the more than two hundred vessels which will participate to the pilot project a number are involved in deep sea operations. It means that, while the overall objective of the Blue Belt pilot project is to facilitate the use of maritime transport for the intra-EU carriage of goods, the pilot project will also explore the potential of administrative facilitation for all types of maritime transport services.</p>
<p>The Commission will also specifically look into issues concerning intra-EU maritime services calling in a Third Country Port, as announced in the action plan on the European Maritime Transport Space without barriers<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> adopted in 2009.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is well aware of the recent, totally unacceptable incidents in the European Parliament. It is the primary responsibility of the Parliament and its Members to take the necessary actions and measures to prevent similar behaviour in the future.</p>
<p>The Commission has drafted a Code of Conduct for Commissioners which is stricter than its previous one and among the strictest codes currently in force. The Parliament has been consulted on the draft and the Commission will adopt the new Code as soon as possible taking into account the comments of the Parliament.</p>
<p>This shall not prevent the Commission and the Parliament from reflecting together how can be found the best possible standards for the members of all institutions with their respective roles and mandates. But it would be up to the Parliament to initiate the debate with rules it would envisage for Members of the Parliament. The Commission do not want to give the impression that the Commission tries to regulate the work of Members of the Parliament.</p>
<p>With regard to the Transparency Register, the honourable Member will be aware that a draft agreement on a joint transparency register of the Parliament and the Commission, prepared by a working group led by Parliament Vice-President Wallis and Commission Vice-President Šefčovič, is currently under examination in the Constitutional Affairs' (AFCO) Committee (President Casini report). The Commission and the Parliament have invited the Council to join the agreement and contacts are on-going in this regard.</p>
<p>Especially under the current circumstances, the Commission strongly recommend a quick adoption of the agreement as it is and plead not to delay its implementation by new legal and political discussions about the voluntary or mandatory character of the register. The discussions and especially a legislative process would take months and years before a register would see the light of the day.</p>
<p>The Commission and the Parliament must bear in mind that we do not need a register to ban behaviour which is most obviously unethical and possibly even criminal. It is for the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF), prosecutors and the Courts to enforce the laws which exist.</p>
<p>The contribution of the Transparency Register will be to provide information to citizens, civil servants and to all of us about all those organisations which are influencing the discussions in both our institutions.</p>
<p>All those who register − be they lobbyists, think tanks, NGOs or others – will provide information about their intentions, their finances and their main activities. They will subscribe to a code of conduct and a system of sanctions in case of breach of the rules. There are already today around 3,800 organisations in the current Commission register.</p>
<p>All those who will not be in the Transparency Register will have to be asked why they are not in and if they have anything to hide. And everyone should be more than prudent when dealing with such organisations.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
