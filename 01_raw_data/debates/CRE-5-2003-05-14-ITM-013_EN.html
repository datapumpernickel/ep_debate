<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Echerer (Verts/ALE)</span></span>  . – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> A very good evening to you, Mr President, at this late hour, shortly before midnight, when we few are together. I would just like to play a question and answer game with you. Let us talk about an international hit film, a European film that has been a success around the world. Let us take as our example the film ‘Four Weddings and a Funeral’. Do you know who wrote the script? No? Shame on you! Do you know who composed the music for it? That neither! Do you know who directed it? Perhaps someone can remember? No, they cannot. Could you tell me who the film’s backers were, or who its producer was? Hmm. I assume, though, that you have heard of its two stars, Hugh Grant and Andy McDowell. We could carry on this question-and-answer game for ever and a day, whether with ‘Amélie’ or with ‘The Pianist’, it does not matter which.</p>
<p class="contents">Both directors and producers know all too well what is valuable to them about their actors – firstly, their talent, and secondly their name – whilst the public have quite personal reasons for their adulation of their celluloid heroes and heroines. Successes at film festivals, the sought-after jangling of money in box-office tills, good viewer figures – all these things are directly dependent on a performer’s quality as an actor and on his or her popularity with the public. Let me clarify this by saying that I do not want to be misunderstood as attempting to assess the merits of any one of the creative professions in the film world; such is not my objective. Film-making is a collaborative effort in which everyone is important, from the author to the producer. All are doing their work, and all of them – with the exception of one professional group – are protected internationally. Authors enjoy the protection of the Berne Convention and of the WIPO copyright treaties. Producers and players of music are protected internationally by the Rome Convention and the WIPO Performers and Phonograms Treaty. Even television stations, which are, primarily, more consumers than creators, have their rights guaranteed by the Rome Convention, and these are to be brought up to date by the WIPO treaty on the rights of broadcasting companies, something that is awaited, being urgently necessary, right and important. Performers in films, though, are still not covered by the Performers and Phonograms Treaty. Why? Since 1996, negotiations within the WIPO have produced no favourable outcome for the heroes and heroines of the screen, who also got no result from the diplomatic conference in December 2000; nor did bilateral meetings between WIPO members achieve the desired objective. The signatory states are now to meet again, in Geneva, from 18 to 20 June.</p>
<p class="contents">Performers in films have been waiting for years for a minimum of protection for their copyrights at an international level. Whilst the EU has always acknowledged the economic importance of artistic output, we know all too well that what is today the work of an artist will tomorrow be part of our cultural heritage. Within the EU, performers are protected by national legislation, but in most countries their rights are minimal or non-existent. The failure to harmonise these rights internationally means that the performers in works originating in the EU are no longer protected, so that their free circulation is curtailed, with adverse effects on the distribution of European works at an international level. All in all, then, these are hardly good conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">You will be familiar with the saying that ‘the world is a village’. Technological developments over recent years, media convergence and technological developments yet to come mean that this saying is more true than ever before. Borders are eliminated and obstacles removed, legislators and all interested parties are faced with a plethora of challenges. One of them is that of providing international protection for the work of performers, in respect of which the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport wishes to send Geneva a political signal.</p>
<p class="contents">As it is the Commission that will be representing the EU’s Member States at the WIPO negotiations in June of this year, we would like to put the following questions to you and be given answers to them. What view does the Commission take of this discrepancy between audiovisual performers and other creative artists? Should they not enjoy the same international protection as all their colleagues in the music world? Is the Commission able to inform us of the current position in the WIPO negotiations as regards audiovisual performers? Thirdly, what actions does the Commission contemplate taking in order to do away with this discrimination against one single professional group?</p>

<p class="contents">It recalls that the European Community and its Member States on 26 September 2002, at the WIPO General Assembly, reiterated their continued commitment to a meaningful update of the Rome Convention of 1961 as regards the protection of audio-visual performances in order to provide audio-visual performers with the international protection they deserve.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission attaches great importance to finally settling this issue of unfinished business from the 1996 WIPO Diplomatic Conference, which adopted the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">While some progress was made on this issue during the WIPO Diplomatic Conference on the Protection of Audio-visual Performances of December 2000, the existing differences could not be bridged during three weeks of intensive negotiations at the conference, nor during other contacts over the last two years.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Community and its Member States are committed to resolving this issue and can therefore support the organisation by the WIPO Secretariat of an ad hoc informal meeting in Geneva from 18 to 20 June 2003. The Commission will actively participate at this meeting, where all participants, including WIPO member states, and interested intergovernmental and non-governmental organisations, should have the opportunity to exchange views and information. The issue of the protection of audio-visual performances should remain on the Agenda of the WIPO General Assembly for its session in September 2003. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that it is only together that we can reach the goal that is set before us – that of more protection for the rights of audiovisual artists.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret the fact that we did not have time to discuss these issues in committee, but time is pressing upon us, 18 June is getting closer, and it is right that we should today send a strong signal of our resolve to see the WIPO Treaties supplemented as soon as possible in order to bridge this gap and finally bring about the legal protection that audiovisual artists need. I would like, therefore, to suggest that the Commission should forward to us, not only here in plenary in good time before the conference, but also after it in the relevant specialist committee, a report on the outcome of the negotiations and on the progress that – it is to be hoped – will have been achieved. Should you come up against serious difficulties in preparing for the conference, I would say that we needed, as soon as the next meeting of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, to receive a report on the subject from the Commission, that is to say, one with comprehensive information before and after the deliberations, so that we can in fact take this matter forward.</p>
<p class="contents">Please allow me to draw your attention to a point that I regard as crucial, but which does not put a question mark against our fundamental support. I refer to the issue of the relationship of artists to those who play the most important part in transmitting their artistic performances, that is, the radio and television stations. It is, I think, something of an over-simplification to say that the radio and television stations do not create works, but do nothing more than consume them. What I would like to make clear in this regard is that what is at issue here is exclusivity. This is, of course, primarily about artists and the protection of their work, and it is precisely that loophole that the law has to close, but I do think that it is also important that we should find a way of bringing on board potentially competing interests, so that they do not, overtly or covertly, tend to prevent us from finding a solution to the problems. So we wish you good luck with the negotiations, and ask that you keep Parliament informed about what comes out of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have to declare an interest: as a broadcaster and a film producer in my time, I am still in receipt of hard-won royalties of one kind or another from some of these activities. We are looking today in the world from which I emerged, at a situation where diversity of output is growing and where the power of those who control that output and buy the rights in it is also growing. Those who currently do not have a negotiated position for more than one payment for their own activities are the losers in all of that. For those in the audio-visual sector, this is a situation which has worsened, not improved.</p>
<p class="contents">As the questioner pointed out, music performers have a very strong union which over the years has been able to protect their position. For producers there is now some degree of recompense and this can be negotiated over time. No such rights apply in the case of audio-visual performers. We know precisely what they face because without the protection of treaty they are constantly confronting a larger power - one which has all the power and all the regiments of lawyers you could possibly want - which can smash them down.</p>
<p class="contents">It took the great artist Peggy Lee nearly 20 years to outface the Disney Corporation to receive continuing payments for the voiceovers that she had done for some Disney cartoon films. If it took her that long because she had no power of treaty to support her, what happens to the unknown and obscure artist who is placed in the position which the questioner has raised tonight?</p>
<p class="contents">I have one final question which perhaps will not be answered now, but which will recur in the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport. We know that on the eve of the WIPO informal meeting, we have one further chance to address this matter in September. What happens if those negotiations fail, as the last ones and the ones before that failed? What is the Commission going to do then? Are we going to persist with this issue, or are we going to lay it aside with a regretful sigh while the power of those who own the rights and jealously maintain them is extended, and while the audio-visual artists remain confined in the shadows? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to clarify my – perhaps somewhat over-simplified – statement to the effect that broadcasting companies were more consumers than creators, I would like to add that this is not a value-judgment, but simply a statement of fact. They are both consumers and creators, but not exclusively so, and even so they can enjoy protection at international level, which film performers cannot. On this I agree absolutely with Mrs Hieronymi. This is a loophole that we should close, and I am glad that the various powers are making a united effort to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">When we talk about this international protection for audiovisual performers that we desire, what do we mean by it? This is, primarily, about their moral rights. Imagine that one of your speeches here in plenary were to be used without your authorisation, in a modified form, or perhaps even misused; as its author, you would be able to defend yourself, but, as a performer, you would have hardly any options, and only rarely the right to do anything about it. A second aspect, and an important one, is the use of names. It is of immense importance to any creative artist that he should be able to put his name to his work, even if he is a mere cog, a part of the whole. That is every bit as important to performers, including those outside the European Union. Now, although one does not perhaps have to worry as much about the likes of Hugh Grant as about the thousands who are less prominent, even national film celebrities sometimes go through bad years, when it just happens that they are not on set for a single day all year. That may be the luck of the artist and something that one cannot do anything about, but the rent still has to be paid. What would help them is something to which they do, in fact, have every right – to have a share in the added value of successful productions – whether this be through the practice of buy-outs, through appropriate remuneration, or by way of the options that are open to us in the European Union. I do think that all the audiovisual performers outside the EU, who do not enjoy these rights, are waiting expectantly for a signal from us. I am glad that we are fighting this battle side by side, and I wish you good luck, or, to put it in thespian language: break a leg! May the exercise be a success! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
