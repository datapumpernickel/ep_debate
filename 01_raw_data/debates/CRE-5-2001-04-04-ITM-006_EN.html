<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Miranda (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner Lamy, on the eve of the Third United Nations Conference on the Least Developed Countries, which will be taking place in the European Parliament in Brussels in the middle of May, I think it is crucial that we debate and confirm the strategy the European Union should adopt on this matter and on that occasion. That is the precise purpose of the oral questions to the Council and the Commission that I am presenting today. I also hope to make a contribution to this with the proposal for a resolution that I am tabling.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all – I hope – aware of the tragic situation these countries are experiencing. They have a per capita GDP 100 times lower than that of the developed countries. They have a real growth rate of almost zero, if we take account of population growth, the fall in the price of raw products by around 30% in 1998-1999, a life expectancy of no more than 51 years, an illiteracy rate of around 50%, and the list could go on endlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">The worst aspect of this is that there is no light at the end of the tunnel, because many of these countries, around one-third, are still suffering from endless conflicts that sap all available resources, as well as those that are not available. I therefore feel that this conference must do more than simply repeat the diagnosis that is made so often and neither should it be a mere list, exhaustive or not, of intentions that systematically go unfulfilled. It is crucial that practical measures are adopted in the context of an overall strategy, which sets a new international economic order, strategies that are designed to comply with and strengthen the 1986 United Nations declaration, which recognises the right to sustainable development as an undeniable human right. It is also crucial that the European Union and each of the Member States adopt a position clearly endorsing this right by fighting to ensure that the current trend to reduce financial aid by the industrialised countries is reversed and that a timetable is set to increase aid by 0.7% of GDP, by acting in such a way that the 1992 Rio de Janeiro commitments are reiterated, by contributing to the definitive writing-off of the debt that is clearly smothering these countries, by making themselves available and taking action on conflict prevention, and by paying particular attention to arms trafficking and combating this trade. Finally, the Union and the Member States must adopt a position by abandoning the approach of focusing everything on the liberalisation of the markets and by genuinely working for a profound change to the rules and provisions of the WTO that penalise these countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, we must remember that only 12 developing countries are represented in Geneva. Furthermore, as I stated in my proposal for a resolution, we must also bear in mind that access to the markets is not, in itself, a sufficient condition for guaranteeing economic growth and that economic growth, in itself, does not automatically lead to an equitable form of development either. Therefore, just as important, if not more important, than these countries having access to the markets, we must also ensure that they are self-sufficient and have a secure supply of food, hence the law that helps them to protect their production and their rural population. In this context, I wish to say a few words about the ‘everything but arms’ initiative, which we will have the opportunity to discuss in depth in a forthcoming part-session, even if the Council has taken the unacceptable decision to ignore this Parliament. I would simply like to emphasise that this is an initiative to be welcomed, although it is of limited scope and although it contains some aspects that need to be fine-tuned. Since it is merely the first step, as has been said, it must be supplemented with various other types of measure such as those that I have just outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, at a time when the need to fight poverty is being so greatly emphasised, I think I should emphasise two more specific objectives that are worth repeating: health and education. As I stated in my proposal for a resolution, the industrialised countries must make a decisive contribution to the development of programmes in these fields. Above all, as we accepted recently in this House, we must ensure that the right of the countries most affected by AIDS and other diseases to manufacture and sell the necessary drugs or to import them free from copyright costs is recognised. On these and other aspects, many of which are developed further in the resolution that I have tabled, we now await the words of the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Danielsson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council.</span> – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the guidelines for participation in the UN’s third conference on the least developed countries, which the Council adopted on 22 December 2000, the European Union confirms its firm intention to do everything to ensure that the UN Action Plan for sustainable development in the least developed countries and for the progressive incorporation of these countries into the global economy contains practical and operational political guidelines and measures that are based on three factors.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, active and responsible participation by national authorities, civil society, the private sector and local players in the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a worldwide partnership for the least developed countries, which means, amongst other things, mobilising the entire international community and increasing the coordination between everyone working on development issues at international, regional and national level.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, an effective evaluation of the results of the Action Plan that was adopted in 1990 and an analysis of the needs and expectations of the least developed countries as established during the preparations for the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Within the framework of the Union’s development assistance policy a very great part of the assistance is devoted to precisely these least developed countries, particularly through the ACP/EU conventions. I would remind you that 40 of the 49 least developed countries are also included in the group of ACP countries. The Union feels that the elimination of poverty in these countries should be the central aim of the conference. The Union supports the reinforced HIPC initiative and its implementation, i.e. in accordance with the terms confirmed in Cologne in 1999, which enables <span class="italic">more</span> countries to get debt relief <span class="italic">faster</span> and increases the focus on the fight against poverty, i.e. the idea that the resources that are released by debt write-offs within HIPC are to be used to fight poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union cannot accept the commitments and/or obligations in respect of debt write-offs that go beyond the terms that apply under the HIPC initiative. This means that any claims for a moratorium on debt payments before the debtor countries reach the so-called end point, and/or 100 percent debt is written off at this point, cannot be accepted. Poor countries that do not qualify for debt relief in accordance with the terms that apply to the HIPC initiative but which are having payment difficulties are instead advised to attempt to renegotiate their debt with the Paris Club, the London Club or another relevant creditor.</p>
<p class="contents">The resources that are released under the HIPC initiative are to be used to fight poverty in accordance with the countries’ own poverty strategies.</p>
<p class="contents">On 28 February 2001 the Council approved a Regulation extending exemption from duty with no restriction on quantity to include <span class="italic">all</span> products originating from the 49 least developed countries in the world with the exception of arms and ammunition – what is known is the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative. The Regulation became applicable on 5 March this year. Discussion of this matter began with the Commission putting forward a proposal in October last year. I am pleased to be able to confirm that the main principles of the Commission’s proposal were expressly retained in the final text adopted, i.e. that the Community should take meaningful measures to improve the economic situation in the least developed countries by guaranteeing free access to its markets for all such products, even if this would mean additional costs for the Community. In nearly all cases this access was established from 5 March this year. Only in the matter of bananas, sugar and rice was it established that this should enter into force at a later date. However, the crucial factor was that a particular period and timetable for full access to the market was agreed for these products. The market for bananas will be fully liberalised from 2006 and that for sugar and rice from July 2009 and September 2009 respectively. During this period duty on these three products will be reduced and duty-free quotas will be established for sugar and rice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation is therefore of crucial economic significance for the least developed countries. However, it also has an even greater political and economic significance in respect of the preparations for the next round of negotiations in the WTO. The fact that in this regard it is, in the first instance, development priorities that have formed the basis for a decision on a trade matter has incredibly great symbolic value. The decision shows our partners in the WTO negotiations – both developing countries and industrial countries – that the Union is serious in its commitment to incorporate development issues into these negotiations. It shows that we will enter into the negotiations with the firm intention not just of serving our own interests, but also the interests of the most needy members of the global society, particularly the least developed countries. It shows that the Union fully accepts a moral and economic responsibility in accordance with the Union’s position as the world’s biggest trading bloc. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The aim of this conference will be first of all to assess the results of the action programme which was launched in 1990, to take stock of what has been done in the meantime in the way of development aid, debt reduction, investment and trade. Another aim will be to draw up a new action programme for the next ten years, and we have agreed, in a joint agreement with the United Nations, that this conference should also give its attention to a certain number of measures having immediate effect, so that it will not yield to the temptation of taking refuge in too many generalities.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparations for this conference are underway. Obviously, as joint host, the European Union has a special interest in making this conference a success: teams from the Commission and a certain number of Commissioners are working on it together.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall try to ensure that a programme of sound action emerges from this conference so as to give a framework of encouragement to the development efforts of these 49 or 50 countries, once again trying to make it all as specific as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this in mind that we have ensured – and we at the Commission would like to thank the Swedish Presidency for this – that the decisions taken on the basis of this initiative, ‘Everything but arms’, are taken in good time so that this initiative can constitute an achievement of the May conference. That is probably, at the present time, the most visible issue and measure that this conference will have helped to raise and accelerate, and that is no mean achievement We must now try to use this conference as a lever to encourage other trading partners in the world to improve market access for exports from the least-developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we are so keen on this initiative, that is not because we think it is sufficient in itself. It is clear that, without an appropriate environment and other aid efforts, the vast majority of the LDCs are incapable, on their own, of taking advantage of commercial openings. We must therefore supplement this strong signal, this effort to which we have committed ourselves, by other measures aimed at effectively increasing the export capacity of the countries in question, and helping them to become integrated into the multilateral worldwide trading system.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore intend to supplement this initiative by other measures, a certain number of which are connected with trade, by technical assistance as regards the administrative capacity of these countries, and by increasing what we do in the context of the integrated fund which links us with the IMF, the World Bank and the WTO, in a technical assistance project which deals with commercial issues in Geneva. Having said that, there are also other trade mechanisms which we should look at, in order to satisfy ourselves that they are not holding back or unduly restricting the opening up of markets to the least developed countries. I am thinking, in particular, of all the rules on health and plant health, or of various obstacles to trade, where we should not reduce the standards that we have set, because our own public want to keep them, but where we could ensure that our efforts to provide technical assistance are effectively targeted so that they enable those countries to comply with them. I am thinking, in particular, of all aspects of health and plant health.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that these conditions for access to the market will help to improve the volume of foreign investment in those countries, provided that they are accompanied by an effective increase in their export capacity, and we should like to take the opportunity of this conference to go further in improving the promotion of investment in those countries, in particular by better use of the existing multilateral mechanisms, perhaps by using more actively what is already available in the way of guarantees for investment in least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">This being the case, let us not hide behind speeches that are too politically correct. We must also be clear. It is up to these countries themselves to create an environment that is more investment-friendly, by means of internal policies which we can support, and advise on, but which are, after all, the result of internal policy decisions which are sometimes difficult to take, and we are not responsible for this difficulty in taking decisions. From this point of view it is important that the role of each party should be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">We must remember that these measures that I have just spoken about, which come into effect immediately, are only part of the result. They have to be there in order to lend a certain amount of credibility to the action programme for the next ten years. This action programme will serve as an itinerary. I believe that it is very important to have an itinerary in this area, and it must be one that we can control together. In fact I believe – and my Commission colleagues share this view – that it is only by exerting stronger collective pressure that we shall be able to speed up the abolition of poverty and the promotion of sustainable development in these countries, so that one of these days perhaps we shall be able, to quote Mr Miranda’s expression, to see the light at the end of the tunnel. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must be pointed out that the poorest and the least developed countries must be given special attention and, in the process, elimination of extreme poverty should be the primary goal. According to UNCTAD calculations, while the gross domestic product of 49 LDCs rose by no more than 0.9% per year in real terms between 1990 and 1998, worldwide GDP grew by more than 2.5% per year.</p>
<p class="contents">Good governance is a key issue in the LDCs. I would like to take this opportunity to point out that there are many countries which are nominally democratic, but where, owing to their lack of an effective and fair legal system, there is no freedom for their people. We in this Parliament should promote the rule of law as an essential criterion when we look at good governance criteria. It is a matter of record also that the proportion of our aid budgets that goes to the LDCs has fallen while the proportion that goes to middle-ranking countries, such as Morocco and Algeria, has risen. This is absolutely wrong. The aid budget must concentrate on the poorest. That is what our citizens expect and require. Using the aid budget as some sort of underhand immigration policy is wrong. Have an anti-immigration policy, by all means, but be honest about it. We must not rob the poorest countries to achieve our own political ends.</p>
<p class="contents">Drastic reductions in the debt burden of heavily indebted poor countries are urgently needed as action taken so far under the HIPC initiative will, as a result of falling raw material prices, be completely inadequate for any sustained financial relief. I must also stress the need to guarantee funds to be set up or topped up in order to provide incentives for greater private investment and for the implementation of measures to encourage small loan arrangements, such as those introduced by the Gramien Bank in Bangladesh.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must do everything we can to prevent conflict. Conflict prevention is a key to helping the LDCs grow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most of the 640 million people who live in the Least Developed Countries, just over one-tenth of the world's entire population, are struggling to survive on less than two dollars a day. Their average life expectancy is 50 years. Half of them are illiterate and two-thirds of the world's children, most of them little girls, are not in any kind of primary education. LDCs have seen a severe drop in capital flows, down 45% since 1990; and official development assistance continues to go down, having fallen by 30% since 1990.</p>
<p class="contents">As the President-in-Office has said, the HIPC initiative is yielding very slow results and coming in too late. Too many LDCs have totally unsustainable debt burdens. Many LDCs, such as Zambia for example, where I was recently, are still spending twice as much on debt servicing as they are on health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">This UN Conference therefore has to be about a new deal for LDCs; one that promotes pro-poor economic growth, poverty reduction and sustainable development. There will be, as Mr Lamy knows, a thematic session on trade, which I know he will expect to be used by the LDCs as a platform in preparation for the Qatar ministerial meeting. I am sure they will give ample evidence of the fall in commodity prices – which have fallen by 30% from 1998 to 1999 – and we will need to acknowledge that globalisation and liberalisation have had very mixed results. Everything but arms represents significant progress. I wonder whether Commissioner Lamy would be able to predict that other countries such as the US or Japan might be prepared to follow his excellent lead. I think I see him smile, and this might present us with some difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">At this point it would be interesting to hear from Commissioner Lamy which LDC countries in particular are likely to export arms, as the title of this initiative is a bit perplexing.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, this Conference is about analysing what we can do that is deliverable for the least developed countries when millions of people are unable to treat pneumonia, diarrhoea, TB or AIDS; when you have no medicines to give to your sick child or your dying wife; when your child is at school under a tree trying to learn to write its name with a twig. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over the past decade, aid to developing countries has fallen by 24% and that to the poorest by as much as 45%. This is absolutely unacceptable. The UN Conference is pointless if it remains bogged down in fine promises and vague declarations. The poorest countries only benefit from concrete and binding agreements. Trade concessions on their own are not sufficient. The rich countries must ease their burden of debt by a substantial amount. Repayment means that in many countries, any form of development is frustrated even before it gets off the ground. It is of the utmost importance that we should pursue a separate discharge policy for each developing country individually.</p>
<p class="contents">It is entirely reasonable to prescribe conditions in our debt and aid policy with regard to the fight against poverty, sound administration and sound management of public finance. Debt relief has no meaning if debts keep mounting up. The European Commission’s policy should therefore be aimed at developing capacity and sensible financial management. Only then can countries develop education and health care; only then can investments be stimulated.</p>
<p class="contents">In many of the poorest developing countries, power, as well as available resources, are very badly distributed. If political and economic power are not distinctly separated, only corruption can reign supreme. It is hopeless to fight poverty if countries remain trapped in violent conflict. Let us call a spade a spade: tyranny and unbounded greed on the part of irresponsible leaders are just as important in terms of causing inadequate development as is a drop in aid. The chasm between rich and poor can only be bridged if our aid effort is stepped up considerably and if the countries are better governed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How honest are we, in fact, when we claim that we mainly fight poverty in the least developed countries? Our fellow MEPs have illustrated this amply. Furthermore, we find that our aid does not even reach the poorest in the poor countries – and surely that is what all this is about – for they remain in poverty. How coherent is our own policy? How honest are we when we claim that we are quite willing to import everything, except weapons, from the poor countries? Is this not, in the first instance, an act of goodwill to include the southern countries in a new WTO round? I wonder about that, for I note that we remain caught up in our own incoherence. I would like to quote the delay of imports of sugar as a case in point: that is nothing but a disgrace! Must we really continue to support our own sugar production?

<p class="contents">We discovered these facts just now. The mandate for the third UN conference covers, in particular, public development aid, debt and trade. In that case, we must not try to evade the following conclusion, namely that the commitments made for the preceding decade have not been fulfilled. It has often been said, but it is necessary to repeat it, that the decrease in the flow of public development aid is unacceptable. It has dwindled by almost half during the last decade, falling to only 0.05% of the GDP of the donor countries, far below the 0.7% objective set by the UN. In Europe, only the northern countries are meeting this commitment. Moreover, the proportion of this public development aid that is spent on economic infrastructure and the production sector has also been reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the future hold for these countries, if they cannot achieve a level of development which will enable them to make choices that are truly independent? There is no need to seek further afield for the reasons for the results that have been obtained. The mere mention of the fall in life expectancy to 51 years gives an indication of the size of the disaster. Behind the experts’ reports there are men and women who are living in extreme poverty: 614 million people, or one tenth of the world’s population, who live on less than two dollars a day.</p>
<p class="contents">Worse that this, as UNCTAD reports, the least-developed countries are caught in a downward spiral and a vicious circle of economic regression, social tensions and violence, which all reinforce one another. Thus the proportion of their GDP accounted for by the manufacturing sector has not increased, and in some cases it has even decreased. The LDCs are still, in many cases, exporters of only one or two basic products. Production capacity has been reduced in some countries. For example, the committee that is preparing for the third conference has even noted that very often the industries created to supply the internal market have been forced out of the market by the increasingly keen competition from imports which is the result of liberalising trade.</p>
<p class="contents">The third UN conference must not be just another ritual gathering, and I believe that the European Union, which is to some extent hosting the summit, should help to make sure that it does not turn into one. Europe’s political authority is achieved from its capacity to stand up to an all-consuming globalisation governed only by the laws of commerce and of money. The effectiveness of its development policy is measured by practical action, and there are avenues which still need to be explored as a matter of urgency, such as debt cancellation, the need for urgent action to recognise the right of countries hit by AIDS to manufacture and sell the necessary medicines, the need for high-quality public education services to contribute to the crucial development of human capabilities, and the need to help these countries to become self-sufficient in food.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that development cannot be summed up simply as the organisation of trading relations...</p>

The percentage of the GDP dedicated by the wealthy States to the development of poor countries is increasingly small. We know that, in many cases, these same wealthy countries flood the poor countries with toxic waste or allow shady businesses to operate in tourism as well. Our Group has put forward a proposal for the reinsertion of students from those countries who have studied in European universities and wish to start work in their country of origin. This would prevent that brain drain which is currently holding back development to such a degree. It might cost little to treat a sick person and even less to prevent the illness, but AIDS is continuing to spread because of a lack of political will and economic commitment. Globalisation is proving to be a tragedy for all those who are poor and is certainly not increasing the prosperity of the wealthy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If arrangements are to be of immediate effect, as the Commission wishes, the EU must appreciate that the HIPC agreement is quite inadequate. There is a need for an international agreement aimed at genuinely releasing the developing countries from their debts by, for example, integrating the international objectives on poverty so that a sustainable debt is defined on the basis of the countries’ need to combat poverty. At present, a sustainable debt is defined in the HIPC initiative on the basis of non-documented sustainability values, and most of those countries that have obtained debt relief are spending more on debt repayment than on health and education.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, the EU ought to promote coherence in development policy and supplement this with effective support for developing the infrastructure of the developing countries so that they can carve out a place for themselves on the world market. There are enough tasks to get to grips with. These are already well defined. What we now need is not more words, but action; and action which hopefully does not end up like the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative in which the Commission produced a fine proposal which, unfortunately, was completely destroyed by the Council which postponed the agreement on rice, sugar and bananas until the year 2009.

Let us hope that the rest of the industrialised world will follow our lead. But we need much more than that, and the health initiative for the least developed countries – “All but AIDS” – is a case in point. 95% of people suffering from AIDS live in developing countries. Also, diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis claim too many victims annually. Healthcare in the poorest countries is seriously underfunded. It appears that the least developed countries are spending as little as USD 8 per person on healthcare. According to the WHO, this figure should be 8 or 9 times higher. That is why the European Union should have the courage to take unilateral initiatives at the third UN Conference in May. I would like to list a few of these initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">European aid in the field of healthcare should be discontinued, so that the poorest countries, such as India, can buy medicines against AIDS cheaply using our aid money.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the EU should ask the Member States to abolish the export tax on medicines for poverty-associated illnesses.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, aid for basic healthcare should be doubled in the 2001 Community budget. Half of that amount should be earmarked for the least developed countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, European legislation on orphan medicines should be tailored to the needs of the developing countries, so that the pharmaceutical industry in Europe is encouraged to also produce medicines for the poor countries, such as medicines against AIDS, malaria, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we should openly declare our support for Brazil and South Africa as soon as charges are brought against them.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we should defend the position on cheap medicines and the right to parallel imports, even in international forums, and should ask the TRIPS agreement to be adapted accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">My seventh, and last, suggestion would be for all EU Member States to join forces to set up an international health and poverty fund, a fund from which an international, strategic long-term approach can be financed. Europe should also free up extra monies for this fund. Such a coherent initiative – “All but AIDS” – would be a fantastic contribution on the part of the Commission, and would send out a clear message that we, alongside “Everything but Arms”, can take a unilateral step ourselves. Such a unilateral step coming from Europe would have far greater impact, precisely in the new Bush era, than all kinds of general declarations. We need tangible results. I am convinced that the EU and Mr Lamy are extremely well placed to achieve these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is an important first step that has been taken and one which, as I pointed out in my introduction, shows that the Union is genuinely prepared to let development aspects control its priorities in trade matters. I agree that it would be desirable to go even further, but do not let us diminish this first step.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I will simply answer Mr Deva by saying that I am pleased that he mentions the matter of conflict prevention as an important part of our continued efforts when it comes to assisting the least developed countries. The Swedish Presidency has made conflict prevention one of its core issues. We at the Council have also asked if we may come back to this Chamber later this spring to discuss conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, conflict prevention will be an important issue at the European Council’s conference in Gothenburg in June. I hope that this will provide an important reminder that the prevention of conflicts and efforts to help the least developed countries are very closely related. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first has to do with the issue the President-in-Office of the Council has just addressed. Like most of you, I think that development results from an, at times very mysterious, alchemy, the ingredients of which are easy to name but whose mixture is difficult to achieve. Like Mr Deva and the President-in-Office, I think that peace is probably the decisive ingredient ahead of such elements as the fight against corruption. There are many others but I hope we can avoid giving the impression that the least-developed countries have a monopoly over such difficulties and troubles. I think we ourselves do not always come out unscathed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Sandbæk, the ‘Everything but arms’ initiative is a concrete action for which we had to battle hard, with the complicity of our chairman and friend, Leif Pagrotski, to obtain a qualified majority. What would you have said had we failed in our attempt? These concrete decisions have been taken and are now going to be implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Kinnock wanted to know which LDC countries in particular are likely to export arms. The list has not been finalised. I think that the conference on the LDCs will enable us to exert a bit of pressure. Chile and New Zealand have displayed positive tendencies. We are well aware that, at least at this stage, Japan will not fall into line as regards the totality of its imports, especially because of its rice problems. Nonetheless, as regards industrial rates, it has already taken measures which are in the right direction. Finally, the United States will have to review its system of generalised preferences this year and, thanks to the various lobbying methods at our disposal in Congress, we will see to it that, when it does, it will have our initiative engraved in its memory.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to dispel any impression that we have in some way bought the agreement of least-developed countries so as to organise a round of commercial negotiations which is in our interest but not theirs. Such an impression is totally without foundation. In the first place, this round is of interest to LDCs, even to the extent that, between the law of the jungle of unregulated international exchange and a round of commercial negotiations which will establish new rules, their choice seems to be made. Secondly, it is a question of giving credence to our own position and, Mrs Maes, of showing that, within the framework of our general policy, we are capable, without any equivalent concession, of taking it upon ourselves to resolve internal political difficulties in order to move towards what we have to do.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final comment has to do with access to medicines. This point was brought up by Mr Miranda, Mrs Boudjenah and Mr van den Berg. As I responded yesterday in this very House to a question by Mrs Carlotti on this subject, we have, within the Commission, put on the table a comprehensive action plan covering not only the problems of finance in terms of development aid and those of additional incentives for public research, but also problems relating to the commercial aspects associated with intellectual property and the availability of medicines. This general plan is now on the table. You are aware of it. It is available for you to read. It will be debated in the General Affairs Council on 14 May in sufficient time for the conclusions of this Council to be presented at the conference on LDCs which will take place at the end of May.</p>
<p class="contents">So you see that, from this standpoint, all of us, including the presidency which, as the President-in-Office has just pointed out, is making this a priority, have tried to ensure that a certain number of Commission proposals are transformed into action after they have passed before the Council and Parliament, so that we can look ahead to this conference at least with an easy conscience. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
