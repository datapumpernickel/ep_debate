Firstly, we needed to take action on a formal level in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges the Member States to appoint safety advisers and to organise the training, instruction and examination of these people but does not explain this explicitly. Secondly, by adopting this directive we achieve a) an increase in safety when dangerous goods are both transported and transhipped; b) a reduction in distortions of competition resulting from wide variations in national training structures and training costs and c) equal opportunities for safety advisers on the European labour market. Thirdly, this directive, as it currently stands in the common position, guarantees – in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards – a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the European Union; by adopting it we contribute to the Member States' bearing a high level of individual responsibility. All of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed.</p>
<p class="contents">Our amendments from the first reading have, I believe, been taken into account very satisfactorily. They have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance, or they have been rejected because the corresponding European arrangements have not been included, for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions. The one unanimously adopted amendment of the Committee on Regional Policy and Transport, which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive, is something which I would urge you to support. By not setting a specific date for the Member States to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force, we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay. I would urge you to endorse this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As an Austrian, I still have a vivid memory, as, I believe, we all do, of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the Tauern Tunnel, where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense. The renovation project, which lasted for months, cut off this important route between the north and south of Europe. The traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the EU to the limit. In fact, all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province.</p>
<p class="contents">Prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available, so that the right action is taken in good time. All the same, we must not content ourselves with enacting European law to ensure greater safety. We also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the Member States in good time and – even more importantly – we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards. Please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address one final point. We must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that, where transport safety in Europe is concerned, there is still much more to be done. In this context, I should like to make a request and ask the Commissioner responsible, who is with us here today, to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future, so that we in Europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road, rail and inland waterway. I congratulate him on his excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport safety has sadly been in the news recently: the Paddington rail crash in London, the terrible rail crash in Norway, the two aviation crashes involving EU citizens and the natural disaster involving the<span class="italic"> Erika</span> off Brittany – all within the last four months – remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has pointed out to the House that in its common position the Council has accepted six of Parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of Parliament's other amendments has been retained. My Group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the European Union as safe as possible. When it comes to safety my Group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety. We still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like, first of all, to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and, secondly, the Commission for the proposal it has submitted. We are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also, in fact, with minimum requirements. This is a pity, in a sense. Needless to say, safety on roads, railways and inland waterways is of key importance and, given the international nature of these types of transport, training for safety advisors should also be harmonised, therefore, as well as the requirements of the new ADR, for example, which is under way. </p>
<p class="contents">This is important, but so is enforcement and there are, of course, a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this. Just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years, for example in Belgium, the Netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead. Or ships from Eastern Europe which moor adjacent to ships over here, with all the obvious risks that this entails. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it has transpired that research in the ports in Belgium, Finland, but also in Japan has shown that 50% of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment. In short, the issue is an important one. </p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned, in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from 1 January of this year. There will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present, especially with smaller companies, as these cannot afford safety advisors. These smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo, which causes problems. It is therefore also being requested that ISO 9002 certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses.</p>
<p class="contents">The work is done. All that remains is the business of enforcement. I would like to mention one final point. With regard to enforcement, proper agreements must also be concluded with the Eastern European countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until 1 July 2001, that is to say in eighteen months’ time. This gives them a competitive edge for the interim period. This is not in itself anything dreadful, but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road, rail and inland waterways and incorporate these, as part of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The ever increasing volume of goods passing through Europe entails all kinds of risks, known and unknown, for employees and the social environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements. The relevant standards which have been laid down in another Directive, 95/35/EC, seem sufficiently adequate to advise people in a responsible manner on the organisation of the transport of dangerous goods. I am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the Council on minimum standards regarding examinations, although I would have preferred it if uniform, set standards and modules had been established, so that certificates would be of equal value internationally. This, however, does not seem feasible. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I can, therefore, give it my wholehearted support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to make just a few comments. Firstly, I should like to ask the Commissioner – and I am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground – to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety, be it on the roads, on the waterways or at sea. Considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a Commission proposal first made on 19 March 1998, even though Parliament responded relatively quickly, this time lag is a little too long. This is not just the fault of the Commission, but I believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point has already been mentioned: it concerns the minimum standards. In principle, I believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules. However, when it comes to safety, I am rather sceptical because safety in Sweden, for example, is in principle no different from safety in Germany, Italy or Austria. I can live with these minimum standards, but I would ask the Commission to monitor the situation very carefully. Should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point has also been mentioned already. As you know, like Mr Rack, I come from a transit country, where this issue plays a particularly important role. We do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as Austria or other transit countries. But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We understand that it is important that the two institutions – Parliament and Commission – cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question.</p>
<p class="contents">Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission’s priorities in the field of transport. As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end. The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety. In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the <span class="italic">Erika </span>disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport.</p>
<p class="contents">But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the <span class="italic">Erika </span>disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
