<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, as we all know, the textiles and clothing sector occupies a prominent place in international trade, with flows of EUR 350 000 million in 2002. That is more than 5% of all world exports. It is a key sector for the developing countries. It accounts for 50% of world textiles exports and 70% of world clothing exports. For many of them it is the main source of exports and of industrial employment.</p>
<p class="contents">For us Europeans, too, investment, the move upmarket and the world leadership we have acquired in a sector like fashion have also made it a key sector for the future. Europe is now the world’s biggest exporter in textiles and the second largest in clothing. In today’s Europe, 2 million people are employed in textiles and clothing, and in the enlarged Europe that will be 2.5 million and a turnover of EUR 200 000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Knowing how sensitive textiles and clothing are in a large number of countries, the European Commission organised an international conference on 5 and 6 May last, which was attended by delegates from over 80 countries. We discussed the challenges facing the sector in the years ahead, especially with the final abolition of quotas on 1 January 2005, which is also the proposed date for the conclusion of the current World Trade Organisation negotiations. Four major findings emerged from that conference.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the developing countries are very vulnerable, especially those that are the most dependent on textiles and clothing exports. This is especially true of the least advanced countries and those with weak or not very diversified economies. It is also the case of the countries which have preferential agreements with us, like the countries of the southern and eastern Mediterranean, some of the ACP countries and other small exporters. Most of these countries depend very much on the textiles and clothing sector for their export revenue, since it may account for virtually all their exports and much of their employment.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, market access conditions in textiles and clothing differ greatly from one part of the world to another. While Europe imposes customs duties averaging 9%, for example, many countries have duties as high as 30% or even higher, as well as retaining major non-tariff barriers. If we therefore confine liberalisation to abolishing quotas in 2005, we are likely to be faced with an unbalanced world market where competition is, as it were, focussed on the markets of the industrialised countries, our markets, where growth is weak.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the importance of the Euro-Mediterranean area. That is the natural area of competition for the European industry. I will come back to this. We have projects concerning it.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, increasing competition is likely to intensify pressure on natural and human resources and presents serious problems in terms of sustainable development, but also of conditions of fair competition where fundamental social rights are involved, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Having identified these issues, what are the answers, answers that must of course be found not by us, or by the Americans, or by the Indians or by the Chinese, but found through talks with all the parties concerned in accordance with the rules of the World Trade Organisation?</p>
<p class="contents">The first answer is development. If we are to alleviate the effects on the poorer and weaker countries of abolishing quotas, we must think how to concentrate the preferential access we grant to the developing countries, through the generalised system of preferences, for example, on what will probably be the most vulnerable countries. I am thinking of the least developed countries. I am thinking of the ACP group of countries. I am thinking of the small economies. We will also have to look at ways of making it easier for the countries concerned to make use of those preferences – I am thinking of the rules of origin, for example – while ensuring, of course, that those countries are indeed the ones which really benefit from the preferences we give.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must use the Doha round to obtain market access conditions that are fair and similar all over the world. We cannot be satisfied with confining the opening of markets to the abolition of quotas in 2005. As I said, that would create imbalances in terms of access; but our present proposal in multilateral talks is based on arguments of fairness. We are calling on all the other members of the WTO to move their customs duties towards a common level, the lowest possible, and obviously to abolish non-tariff barriers. All countries, except, to our mind, the least developed countries, must contribute to this, including of course those whose textiles and clothing exports are highly competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to use this debate to reassure both the European industry and the countries which enjoy preferential access to the Union’s markets. It is not our intention to further reduce our already quite low customs duties without getting wider access to external markets in return. We also think changes should be made gradually, with transitional periods for the application of common customs duties to allow those who have problems to make the necessary adjustments.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Euro-Mediterranean area. It is in the process of becoming integrated and it should soon enjoy the expected benefits of the pan—Euro-Mediterranean cumulation of origin rules that should come into effect in the very near future. This new protocol on rules of origin should be presented to the trade ministers at the Euromed conference in Palermo on 7 July next. This system of diagonal cumulation of origin will allow economic operators in the Euromed area as a whole to expand their potential sources of supply by allowing producers in that area, which will be unified from this point of view, to use intermediate products from the whole of the area without any barriers. We expect this to have a positive effect on trade, contributing to the development of intra-regional trade in particular. Our aim is to be able to apply this cumulation effectively in all the countries of the area by the end of 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the promotion of sustainable development: we must give priority to incentives and respect for multilateral norms. We must continue to look at how public action can ensure that liberalisation will not be detrimental to working conditions or the environment and prevent non-compliance with social or environmental standards being used as a competitive advantage. We might, for example, consider increasing tariff preference margins within the Generalised System of Preferences for countries which apply these international standards, or encouraging private programmes for promoting sustainable development, or, again, looking at ways of increasing consumer information on products so as to give the fair trade option to those consumers that want it.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, and I will end here, the European Commission is very much aware of what is at stake in the textiles and clothing sector in terms of sustainable development, the fight against poverty, industrial and social policy and regional balances within the Union. It is a sector where the questions of fair distribution of the benefits of trade and globalisation are keenly felt and a sector that offers us the possibility of developing industrial and commercial policies that do justice to all these legitimate concerns. In the European Commission we have begun a study to identify the categories of products most at risk, the effects of liberalisation on production, its effects on employment in the enlarged Union and its impact in the regions that are the most dependent on textiles production. Both sides of industry are following these developments very closely with us in a sectoral social committee. We are also holding talks with the economic and social partners to identify what further measures might be taken to encourage competitiveness in the sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my colleague, Mr Erkki Liikanen, and myself are planning to present a communication on commercial and industrial policy in the textiles and clothing sector after 2005 to the Members of the Commission next autumn and then to Parliament and the Council in order to provide – as is our mission – all the parties concerned with a clear, predictable and coherent framework that will enable them, for their part, to plan their strategies, investments and activities. We must join forces to show the way forward for the textiles and clothing sector as a whole. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Ferrer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Madam President, Commissioner, I wish first of all to thank you for being here today and for the statement you have just made, which attests to the sensitivity you have shown throughout the years towards the European textile and clothing sector.</p>
<p class="contents">In its recent Communication on industrial policy, the Commission acknowledges that the vitality and dynamism of the industry are crucial to Europe’s ability to maintain and increase its prosperity and at the same time achieve its social ambitions.</p>
<p class="contents">From this statement we can infer the need for a European industrial policy which, in order to be effective, must not only cover the strictly industrial aspects, but must also be a horizontal policy that embraces, amongst others, the social and environmental aspects and above all, trade policy. And if this is valid and necessary for industry in general, and to preserve jobs, it is even more so in the case of the European textile and clothing industry, which has a turnover of EUR 196 billion every year, involves more than 113 000 businesses, provides work for two million people – or 7.6% of total employment in the manufacturing industry – and is characterised by significant regional concentration. Although everyone is aware of these figures, I believe they are worth repeating, because they demonstrate the sector’s importance.</p>
<p class="contents">This is furthermore a dynamic and competitive industry which, thanks to the efforts made in research and technological development, thanks to the design and quality of the products and as a result of its having specialised, has been able to consolidate and increase its influence and importance for the European and the world economy.</p>
<p class="contents">It is accordingly worth recalling that the industry in Europe is the world’s largest exporter of textiles, ahead of China, and the third largest in clothing, after China and Hong Kong and consequently has enormous export potential, which needs to be developed. This is precisely why trade policy is so important.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, this sector faces many challenges, in particular – and this is something to which you also referred – the challenge of the quota restriction as of 1 January 2005, which will mean a radical change in the world’s commercial landscape. The sector is very aware of this, since it is one of the most exposed to the effects of globalisation through the stiff competition it faces due to the lower wage costs and the large export capacity of many developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another challenge facing the industry is China’s accession to the WTO, and by way of illustration, it is worth recalling those studies predicting that once quantity restrictions are eliminated, China could see a 150% increase in its global textile and clothing exports and could consequently gain 50% of the world market share.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore crucial for Europe that markets are genuinely and universally opened up, especially in those countries that are particularly dominant and competitive in the textile and clothing sector but which remain closed to European exports, either as a result of high customs duties, in addition to further duties and taxes, or by means of non-tariff barriers that make trade with those countries unviable.</p>
<p class="contents">What is needed, Commissioner, for the sector’s survival at European level and for the continued existence of the millions of jobs that are at stake is above all a defensive trade policy. I can therefore only welcome the content of the statement you have just made and simply express my hope that when it comes to discussing your proposals at the WTO, they are truly allowed to prosper.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that reconciling the totally legitimate interests of European industry with the need to make the development agenda a reality will not be easy, but you do have this Parliament’s full support for achieving this, Commissioner. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You should be in no doubt that you have the support of all parliamentary groups, including mine, of course, for all the measures and positions that you have announced for the forthcoming discussions in the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Less than two months ago, Parliament’s Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy held a hearing, at which one of the speakers was the Chairman of Euratex, the textile employers’ association, who concluded his speech by asking what we could do to solve the problems facing the textile industry.</p>
<p class="contents">From these benches, I now wish to say, in line with the Commission, that these sittings constitute part of the answers that the sector is asking us to provide in order to remedy an extremely serious situation, which I will not go into again, since the Commissioner is fully aware of it.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to issues of market access, the Commissioner has said that until other Member countries demonstrate greater openness, we will not lower tariffs and customs duties. I should like to ask you whether, since there is such a significant imbalance between the amounts we charge and those charged by other countries, in the event that significant agreements are not concluded in this field, we can once again put forward the idea of increasing customs duties to whatever level we wish on textile products imported from these other countries that are not willing to lower their own.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Commissioner, I wish to ask you a very specific question concerning the recognition of industrial property rights. We are frequently told by representatives of the textile sector that, with regard to some of these property rights, such as design, which is not as visible as others such as trademarks, although countries have signed TRIPs agreements within the World Trade Organisation, they tend not to comply with them. I should like to ask you whether you intend to take any action on this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He regrets, however, that it could not finally be resolved, as the central hypothesis was not accepted by the majority parties, the Group of the Party of European Socialists and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats.</p>
<p class="contents">Some of my fellow Members have already commented here on the huge importance of the textile and clothing industry in the European Union, but it should be remembered that this industry is concentrated above all in southern European countries, in less prosperous regions. I am thinking in particular of two significant areas in Portugal, Covilhã and the Ave Valley. It must also be borne in mind, however, that after enlargement we will have to add almost 600 000 more jobs to the two million already included in this sector, and many hundreds of thousands more in areas of industrial production such as Germany and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know that restructuring in this sector has already led many firms to relocate to the east of Europe or to African or Asian countries, and that this has led to an increase in unemployment in the European Union. We also know that we cannot do without a full evaluation of the social, economic and territorial effects both of the bilateral agreements already signed and of possible greater liberalisation after the current Agreement on Textiles and Clothing expires at the end of next year.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, then, we believe that it is essential to adopt an action plan introducing practical measures aimed at maintaining a harmonious, efficient production line. Support for SMEs, research and professional training should also be increased. During the current Doha agenda negotiations under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), however, it is essential that specific features of the textile and clothing sector be taken into account. In particular, reciprocity should be guaranteed in future agreements and trading relations between the European Union and third countries in this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The European textile industry can no longer be used as a bargaining chip in other negotiations on the service or hi-tech sectors. In order to maintain rates of employment and development throughout vast areas of the European Union, customs duties must be kept at their current levels, which are in any case among the lowest in the world. Neither fresh cuts nor the removal of non-tariff barriers must be accepted in this sector, except on a reciprocal basis, always taking the tariffs actually imposed as a starting-point rather than those made known to the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I attach the greatest importance to the establishment of some sort of watchdog, made up of representatives of employers, employees and the Commission, to monitor how the situation develops. This body would function as an early warning system designed to bring any problems arising to a speedy resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am not convinced that we are hearing answers that are going to deal with the total exploitation that exists in a lot of the textile industries in many countries throughout the world – whether through child labour, poverty wages or whatever.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned, we are already seeing a shift in production from the European Union to other countries. I was in Athens last week looking at the case of Schiesser-Palco, an underwear producer – they promised me a sample for the Commissioner but the post has not managed to deliver on that! That company is relocating 500 jobs to Bulgaria. The workers there resent being seen as a cheap option when they believe that they are already working for poverty wages, but in a high-unemployment situation it is very difficult to resist taking any job that is available. We are seeing the same sort of relocation through India, Sri Lanka, Latin America and China – where, we are told, the future of textile manufacturing lies.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not convinced that we have had an answer yet as to what is possible under current WTO rules, which means that it can be very difficult to resist imports on the current process and production rules, and difficult to differentiate on labour standards and so on. There seems to be a push coming from certain quarters that corporate social responsibility and consumer power should be the key tools in ensuring standards throughout the consumer chain. It will be left to campaigners like Clean Clothes and No Sweat to make sure that labour and environmental standards are maintained.</p>
<p class="contents">I am interested to know exactly what we think is possible under the current WTO rules, and whether the Commission agrees with the Vice-President of Levi-Strauss, who was arguing that ILO standards should be part of all bilateral and multilateral trade agreements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From 1 January 2005, the textile industry will indeed face a great challenge: after that date, quantitative restrictions on access to European Union, United States and Canadian markets will be lifted for all members of the World Trade Organisation. In other words, WTO members will have almost unrestricted access to those markets.</p>
<p class="contents">In accordance with the Doha Development Agenda, the aim of this measure is to channel the liberalisation of international trade in such a way as to benefit developing countries. The textile industry is very important in these countries. I would mention India, Pakistan and China in particular. China is a typical case: the World Bank predicts that its textile exports will double in the next five years. As the Commissioner mentioned, this sector is tremendously significant. The jobs of 2 000 000 people and total revenues of EUR 200 billion depend on it.</p>
<p class="contents">After expansion, the number of people employed in this sector will rise to over 2 500 000. This industry has one of the longest traditions in my country’s economic structure. Portugal is one of the biggest textile and clothing producers in the Union. Its exports in this sector represent 20% of its total exports. Portuguese textile products are a feature of all the major world markets, especially in the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese textile and clothing industry is mainly composed of small and medium-sized enterprises, almost exclusively concentrated in the north of the country. Under these circumstances, it is vital to reflect at length on how to minimise the negative effects and maximise the potential released for European Union businesses by liberalised markets. It is essential to consolidate those features which will allow European textile companies to compete on the open market. The only possible methods of maintaining and increasing the significance and importance of the textiles and clothing sector in the European and world economies are research, technological development, information technology, training and professional development.</p>
<p class="contents">The institutions concerned should guarantee that conditions favour competitiveness and respect for international commercial law. In particular, they should combat starvation wages and child labour, as well as promoting improvements in welfare and health benefits, guarantees of basic employment rights, and the adoption of anti-fraud and other provisions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the specific case of Portugal, the next step should be a round of multilateral negotiations, under the auspices of the Doha Development Agenda, which will then be translated into tariff harmonisation and removal of non-tariff barriers. In practice, this will allow access to the market. We are aware of the great challenge we are facing. We maintain that future negotiations should be conducted thoroughly, without rushing, in order to achieve a balance between the Doha development commitments and the interests of the Union textile and clothing industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commissioner’s speech soothed and calmed our worries, but did not banish them completely. The proposals and strategy he set out for us here today seem to be moving in the right direction. The European textiles and clothing sector has been tossed on many threatening and stormy seas. We must also remember that it was the first sector in Europe to be affected by the industrial revolution. This sector should be treated with care, not considered redundant, as occasionally seems to be the case in the discourse of certain Eurocrats and negotiators. For it is exposed to competition from products which, as we all know, are produced at minimal labour costs, in truly dire social conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Commissioner, Portugal appears anxious and expectant, as do other European regions and countries. Some of my fellow Members have already said that this is a vital issue for Portugal, especially for northern areas of the country, and this point always bears repeating. Are other countries, such as France, for example, not worried by the liberalisation of agricultural markets? Does France not fight for the famous principal of cultural exception? Since that is the case, it should come as no surprise that other countries of the European Union, with very significant industries and sectors in social and economic terms, demand justice and the proper defence of their rights, and will not make exceptions.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouraging poorer countries to develop is an ideal shared by all of us, particularly those on the left, such as myself. Not, however, to the detriment of the most vulnerable economies and poorest citizens in the European Union. That is false justice. The cost of the complete liberalisation of the textile industry will not be distributed fairly if the negotiations are badly managed by all countries and companies involved. Some will lose more than others, and the European spirit will be the weaker for it. I wish you every success in the negotiations, Commissioner. Moreover, when we are able to assess their results, we hope to be able to praise and applaud you as we have done in hope here today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Removing quantitative barriers should provide a chance of growth even for the small and medium-sized enterprises which operate in the textiles regions of Europe. These enterprises must be able to extend their interests to new markets and invent new forms of cooperation with the countries entering the international market. The abolition<span class="bold"> </span>of the MultiFibre Agreement will, however, lead to a situation which is characterised by more intense, concentrated competition in the mature markets. We are not, of course, asking for protectionist measures; on the contrary, we are calling for more open, transparent markets, as Mrs Ferrer has said. It is inevitable that globalisation of the markets should facilitate the decentralisation of many traditional activities towards developing countries, where production costs are lower. The fight to eradicate poverty and disseminate prosperity must be furthered by the elimination of customs barriers, but the fact cannot be disregarded that the activities of many European industries are under greater threat from social and environmental dumping than from economic competition.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore like to focus on a number of points mentioned by the Commissioner. Access must be improved for Community products, which are usually of higher quality, to third markets, many of which are protected by high<span class="bold"> </span>duties and non-tariff barriers. The liberalisation process must go hand in hand with a guarantee of reciprocity, as the Commissioner has rightly said. The textiles and clothing industry must be shielded from unfair competition, which means that minimum standards of protection of the working environment must be guaranteed. Lastly, given our experiences in other fields, not least, we should explore the possibility of launching a process which makes a quality label mandatory for textiles and clothing products, to provide a guarantee to the consumer but also to curb the flows of illegal imports which jeopardise economic growth and the proper functioning of international trade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whether this amounts to the creation of clusters or to something else, this is a very important measure, but it will probably need money.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps, Commissioner, there is one thing that I should point out. Let us assume that, in 2005, European tariffs on textiles will be the lowest, and that barriers to trade, whether these be in the form of tariffs or not, will be being removed. What I say to you, though, has to do with the history of the European Union’s textile industry; it is that we will still, probably, have to deal with protectionist measures, or with the maintenance of protectionist measures, on the part of the United States or of Japan. That is my main concern in all this, and there are signs that this is again happening already. It is something we have often seen over the past twenty years. How many times, or for how much longer, must these two textile power blocs be allowed to do as they please with Europe’s textile industry? I see that as one of the core issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need when it comes to the removal of barriers to trade, whether these be in the form of tariffs or not, is fairness; that is what needs to be promoted in this regard, both here and in the accession countries, where, I believe the main development in the textile industry will be. I can see China and India being another major problem with which we will have to deal. If China in particular is not induced to accept mechanisms of self-restraint, Europe can write off even its top-quality and most capital-intensive textile industry. We should not lose sight of that when we go to the negotiating table. Last, but not least, I would like to point out, having just come from the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, that we continue to be concerned that core labour standards and principles of human rights should not be shelved, and that they are of great importance, particularly where China is concerned.</p>

Unfortunately, the Palko clothing factory closed recently, turning hundreds of workers out into the street.</p>
<p class="contents">In the face of this worrying picture, there are a further two elements which, I think, add to our concerns. First, we have what is, of course, an unavoidable reduction in duty from the end of 2004, beginning of 2005, on third country imports and, secondly, we have the perennial problem of third countries, especially Pakistan and the countries of the Far East, giving their textile industries visible or invisible subsidies. Obviously, this situation needs to be addressed.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer, by way of example, to four areas of action. First, an observatory needs to be set up on our part so that we can monitor third country subsidies and report them both to the World Trade Organisation and wherever else necessary. Secondly, a systematic effort must be made for our quality products to penetrate third countries, by dealing with the various ways this effort is being circumvented by third countries. Thirdly, we need to turn our attention to imitation products. A proposal has already been submitted for a label which should be adopted on our part. Other proposals can also be adopted, but the most important thing is for us to agree on the objective and, fourthly, given that this sector is important for employment, I think that the European Union should use European Commission programmes to help reinforce the sector. This can be done both through the community support framework and outside the community support framework, especially in the field of research and technology and innovation so that we can reinforce the sector as regards competitiveness, which is the key word. I think that the Commissioner is moving in the right direction, but we all need to urge him to step up his efforts so that we can address the huge problem that we appear to face. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like other speakers, I also represent one of the regions of the European Union which is heavily dependent on textiles, the East Midlands. There are 2 000 textile companies and 60 000 people directly employed in the industry. It contributes GBP 4 billion a year to the regional economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Opening up trade and access creates challenges. Some of our companies have responded by developing new types of technical textiles, for example a Hinckley company developed special flight socks, and a Derby company developed special heat-resistant clothing for use by firefighters. But we need to recognise within the EU that not all companies are able to evolve in this way. The Commissioner mentioned the essential sector of textiles for developing countries. It is true that developing countries’ economies could receive a huge boost for a more open trading regime, but this is not automatic and not without its problems. If we are not careful, we might end up with increased mobility of exploitation, which would hardly achieve either the goals of the EU or the legitimate goals of the poorer and poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">We should, of course, endeavour to use trade agreements to spread core labour values and to carry out the delicate task of improving conditions for workers in developing countries who often see such moves as hidden protectionism. We still see child labour, serious union repression and predominantly low-paid women. Those three factors, incidentally, are also present within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, you have a Herculean task ahead of you to reconcile all of this, and we very much hope you are going to have success. It is necessary for textile workers within the EU and those many in other parts of the world who seek to earn their living and improve their own economies and their own lives through the textiles industry. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will now respond to the few further points raised in your speeches.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Ferrer, I share your vision for the future of the textiles and clothing sector in Europe. There is a word for it: dynamism. It is a vision of an industry on the offensive. The textiles and clothing industry is not an industry of the past whose gradual shrinkage needs to be managed as painlessly as possible. That is not my view of it, and it is not yours. It is not the idea behind our commercial and industrial policies. It is also what I understood from what Mr Lage said.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Berenguer Fuster, indeed, we will continue to lower our tariff protection only if others do the same. Whether you call it reciprocity or you call it something else, it is the basis of our policy. And you are right to stress, as Mr Hatzidakis also does, that there are intellectual property issues behind all that and that it is important that we continue to fight – as we are doing over geographical ascriptions, for example – to ensure that everything that makes for quality, everything that is of good taste, everything to do with design and that is often our comparative advantage is not illegally imitated and therefore, in a way, stolen.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Figueiredo, yes, we are working on the impact of further liberalisation on employment, on the regional fabric and on skills. It is in fact part of the idea we are working on with Mr Erkki Liikanen for a post-2005 strategy that we would like to be able to present in the autumn of this year.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lambert and Mrs Read have stressed the link between trade and fundamental social norms. To the question: can we make this link? I have a very clear and very frank answer. Yes, we can make it in our unilateral commercial policy. When we give advantages, we can give additional advantages by establishing this link, and that is what we are doing. Yes, we can do it at bilateral level. When we enter into association agreements or trade agreements with some third countries, observance of fundamental social norms is part of our bilateral agreements. Yes, we can do it by working, as we have started to do – and as Mr Bodrato has suggested – on fair-trade labelling, which allows consumers, citizen consumers, to choose between products manufactured under conditions that are more or less sustainable from a social and environmental point of view. On the other hand, no, we cannot for the present do it multilaterally. We have tried, we Europeans. It was virtually the only failure at Doha: on this point we came up, at multilateral level, against a coalition of refusals formed by the United States on the one hand and the developing countries on the other. This link is not therefore part of the programme that will take us to the end of 2004. We will have to come back to it later.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bastos, I agree with your concept of fair negotiations. But we must make a distinction, in social matters, between, on the one hand, the basic social norms – child labour, equal pay for men and women, trade union rights, a ban on forced labour – that are part of the multilateral commitments given by most of the countries on this planet, and, on the other hand, wage norms. We know that wages in the developing countries are lower than here. In a way, they are lower by definition because otherwise they would not be developing countries. That does not mean we do not all want to see them rise.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Ettl is right: non-tariff barriers often replace tariff barriers when they are removed. A lot of governments play that game. In a way, we have become experts in detecting, attacking and dealing with this kind of device, and we are constantly improving our information system, together with our partners on both sides of industry, so that we can detect such practices better, sooner and more quickly, since in many cases they are in fact incompatible with international trade rules.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the answers I wanted to give. I will conclude by saying that in a sense this sector is a textbook case of globalisation as we Europeans and the European Commission conceive it. Yes, globalisation has its effects. Yes, globalisation results in relocation. Yes, it is a challenge to our competitiveness, our creativity and our skills. That is why we need public policies to create a framework that will allow the sector to continue to move upmarket, to continue to create added value, to continue to increase in quality. That is only possible if the rules of the game are established and followed. That used to be true at national level. It has become true at European level. It is in the process of becoming true at world level.</p>
