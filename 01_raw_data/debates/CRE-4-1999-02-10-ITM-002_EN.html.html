<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Barros Moura </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this report takes as its starting point the undeniable success of the adoption of the single currency after a rigorously applied convergence process. The achievement of Economic and Monetary Union, with an independent European Central Bank, is a quantum leap for the European Union, leading to the emergence of a genuine supranational political authority with responsibilities in matters of monetary and exchange‐rate policies that once belonged to the sovereign States.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the institutional establishment of Economic and Monetary Union has been unbalanced, in that the power to centrally manage monetary policy is not matched by any real powers for the Union to effectively coordinate economic policies by means of broad guidelines or any binding multilateral surveillance. At the same time, the inadequacy of the Union"s arrangements for ensuring transparency and democratic accountability in the activity of the European Central Bank has become apparent.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to deal with these problems, my report recommends two approaches: one is to explore in depth the opportunities offered by the existing Treaties, in particular through the interinstitutional agreement already proposed by the European Parliament, and the other is to reform the Treaties, now that the successful introduction of the euro has eliminated the risk that starting the review process might jeopardise EMU itself – the famous ‘Pandora"s box" theory.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation, that of a common monetary authority without matching political authority, highlights the Union"s democratic deficit and also conflicts with national economic and social policies, where a possible clash with centralised monetary policy could undermine that rigorous centralised policy as regards the need to safeguard the overriding aim of maintaining price stability. However, we should also be seeking to guarantee all of the European Union"s policies, including job creation and fighting unemployment, at the same level.</p>
<p class="contents">The report therefore recommends that EMU should be accompanied by effective means of establishing and guaranteeing coordinated economic policies in Europe so as to promote solidarity, economic and social cohesion and equal opportunities among all citizens of the Member States. This calls for a constitutional framework, the only elements of which I should like to highlight for the time being are an Economic and Social Union as a counterweight to Economic and Monetary Union, and a new social contract to underpin intra‐European solidarity. This should involve a minimum of social harmonisation: labour legislation, social security, combating social exclusion and creating jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals on Monetary Union are intended to guarantee the independence of the European Central Bank while strengthening its democratic accountability. The proposals on Economic Union are essentially intended to guarantee effective coordination and coherence between the Union"s economic policies and those of the Member States, by means of a set of binding ‘policy mix" policies.</p>
<p class="contents">For that purpose, given the shortcomings of the Stability Pact, the recommendation will have to be replaced by a decision on the annual preparation of the broad economic policy guidelines and the multilateral surveillance of their application.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the institutions are concerned, the report calls for Parliament"s monitoring and codecision roles to be reinforced in all areas of EMU. It also recommends strengthening the initiative‐taking and political impetus of the Commission, whose political accountability would also be improved in that way. It further calls for improved coordination of the Council"s work so as to give macroeconomic regulation priority over the tendency to centralise all powers in ECOFIN. And it recommends monitoring the formal economic coordination carried out by the Euro−11 Council by means of legitimate democratic machinery, and participation by national parliaments in monitoring EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as EMU"s external representation is concerned, the report recommends speaking with one voice – to be decided upon jointly by the Council, Commission and European Central Bank, according to their respective powers in international financial bodies like the IMF or G−8. The aim will be to use the power conferred by the euro, a monetary unit that may even challenge the supremacy of the dollar, to economically regulate globalisation in such as way as to promote justice and to challenge the hegemony of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to refer to the proposals for new European policies which, according to the report, are vital in view of the introduction of EMU. These are: a guarantee that employment will be the Union"s top economic priority; harmonisation of taxes; a social policy promoting and safeguarding the European social model; and a federal‐type budget that promotes economic and social cohesion and helps us to tackle crises or asymmetrical shocks in one or more Member States. We do not intend to call EMU into question but we want this quantum leap forward to be mirrored by corresponding democratic progress in the political, economic and social fields.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Herman </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy. – (FR) </span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, given the lack of time, I will mention just three issues: the coordination of national economic policies; the legal framework for supervision; and the external representation of the monetary union.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first issue, the current situation is unsatisfactory. This is because we were told in Amsterdam not to touch the monetary union title for fear that this would open Pandora"s box from which anything could emerge. This was just a pretext to hide the disquiet, uncertainty and lack of conviction of many governments. However, this problem, which was pushed under the carpet then, is now reappearing. We have one monetary policy for 15 different economic policies. Clearly, we should try to balance this situation from an operational and functional point of view but this is not being achieved. We were told that recommendations would be made, represented by the infamous broad economic policy guidelines. However, we realised straightaway that these guidelines were a disaster.</p>
<p class="contents">This was because the representatives of the national administrations and national finance departments all decided to maintain the status quo and refrain from any criticism of the policies conducted by their respective countries. The result was that these guidelines have been reduced to formulaic and generalised declarations of principle which commit no‐one. This approach was therefore a failure and has resulted in the development of totally divergent and uncoordinated economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This situation should be viewed in terms of the striking contrast between the US economy which is bursting with health and the languid European economy. Since the triumphant introduction of the euro, reality, in the shape of inadequate national economic policies, has reestablished its grip. I do not want to cause a political controversy, but we must recognise that the fact these problems have not been resolved just because once again the majority of those in power are Socialists.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue involves the legal framework for supervision. There is not yet sufficient awareness in political circles of the enormous changes that the international financial markets have experienced. Politicians believe that the current system, in which each country organises its own banking supervision, is adequate. But times are changing. The Internet and globalisation are now prevalent and the instruments for supervising these financial markets are clearly inadequate, even at European level. An extraordinary transformation is therefore needed mentally and culturally to cope with this. Clearly, the current situation in Europe is unsatisfactory and it must change. I am not alone in thinking this, as reasonable and moderate people like Mr Lamfalussy also share this view.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot go into detail on this issue due to lack of time. Also, I want to briefly mention the third issue of external representation. We have seen the results of this. At the moment, the people of Europe are still incapable of speaking with one voice on monetary problems, even though they have one monetary policy. We keep returning to the same problem of everyone wanting to retain their authority and refusing the Commission the right to speak on their behalf. This means that, in the G7 or elsewhere, we are paying our dues but we cannot make decisions or exercise any influence.</p>
<p class="contents">These three issues must be resolved. I note that the Council is not present. I know that Mr de Silguy is convinced of the validity of my thoughts, but it is the Council that must be convinced. I believe that the Commission and Parliament would do better to work together in order to try to achieve this.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Randzio‐Plath </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">chairman of the Subcommittee on Monetary Affairs. – (DE)</span> Mr President, in his excellent report the rapporteur has rightly pointed to the further problems of institutional questions in the context of monetary union but also of enlargement. We must indeed put far greater intellectual and political emphasis on finding means of resolving these questions, in relation to the international representation of EMU but above all in relation to policy coordination. On the international aspect I would add that just as the rapporteur said, we must speak with one voice here. But in this context we must also give the Commission, as the motor of European integration and guardian of the Treaties, equal rights of participation in this international representation. Parliament must continue to support that.</p>
<p class="contents">What is particularly important is that we use the successful launch of monetary union in order to reduce the democratic deficit in the European Union. It really is time for the European Parliament to be given a codecision right that is consistent with the further democratic development of this European Union; that right must apply not just to the annual economic report and the economic policy guidelines but also to the whole procedure for determining the excessive deficit and to the deliberations on the stability plans and convergence programmes. This is particularly necessary with a view to enlargement as well as to monetary union and the form it assumes.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I want to point to one other matter. The idea of the Euro−11 Council may be useful and may be very pragmatic. I am not criticising, indeed I am welcoming the Council"s efforts to improve economic coordination and begin preliminary discussions on the kind of policy mix that can act as a positive incentive to growth, investment and employment. After all, the crucial point is that today we can no longer just have the European Central Bank responsible for monetary policy, the social partners for wage policy and the states for financial policy. We need all these players to act together.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament must not be kept out of this interplay. The Euro−11 Council is not an institution enshrined in the Treaties. So we really do need an interinstitutional agreement. I very much hope that the German and the Finnish Presidencies will find a procedure for including the European Parliament in these discussions and that we who represent the people of Europe can actually offer some impetus towards achieving a balanced policy mix that promotes employment in the European Union. This interinstitutional agreement is overdue. We called for it in 1994 and it must be concluded before the year 2000.</p>

This is urgently needed if we are to round off the whole project and make it effective. But I would warn against using the term ‘counterpart". We do not want a counterpart to the European Central Bank; rather, we want to complement it. We do not want a political counterpart that runs counter to the European Central Bank"s search for stability, for that is something that is beyond dispute and irrevocable; nor do we support the attempts to undermine the Stability Pact through the policy mix.</p>
<p class="contents">I think we must make it clear that this complementary policy of coordination is the key to supporting stability, to making stability a prerequisite, to ensuring that stability is not one aim among many others; it is on this basis that we must pursue a sensible economic policy aimed at growth, progress and employment. That is a different approach from the one Mrs Randzio‐Plath put forward just now. We also believe that the kind of social contract envisaged is not acceptable as it stands. We want to see an approximation of social policies, but not to opt for a social contract that acts as a counterpart to the European Central Bank. After all, until now we have been pursuing a sensible social policy based on minimum standards rather than harmonisation, and I believe that is an important aspect that we must not forget!</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, allow me to make a final remark on external representation. We must emphasise the need to upgrade the Commission"s role, as Mr Herman also pointed out. European economic and monetary union comes under the first pillar. It is a Community task. But the finance ministers are acting as though it were an intergovernmental matter, in terms of both external representation and the role they are taking upon themselves with the Euro−11 Council. That is why Parliament should now make it clear that we will not allow a Community task to be watered down into an intergovernmental task, just to flatter the vanity of the finance ministers.</p>

But that does not seem to be the case at all, because there is just one reference to enlargement, and then only indirectly in Recital A. The rapporteur is not really concerned with enlargement and its consequences for EMU or vice versa. The rapporteur has used this report to argue for an enforceable and compulsory policy mix of social, fiscal and economic measures which must be as mandatory as the measures on EMU.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not doubt that the rapporteur believes in all good faith that growth and employment are things which can be decreed, despite the wealth of evidence to the contrary. I and my group do not share this belief, and a large majority of us will consequently be voting against the Barros Moura report.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I should like to clarify our position. We support the European Parliament"s increased and more on‐going involvement in determining global guidelines. It is just that we do not want guidelines to become directives. We therefore support the proposed interinstitutional agreement. We are in favour of social convergence, but we do not believe these minium standards can be imposed from above.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we most certainly support strict and clear rules of jurisprudence. But we do not believe that a Council of Ministers – even if it is made up of wise men – can bring employment and prosperity to Europe by means of an enforced policy mix.</p>

<p class="contents">Firstly, you say that there is no point in calling into question the foundations of Economic and Monetary Union. However, in my opinion, the current economic realities, combined with social tensions and social and national conflicts, will result in the contract being redefined. In particular, there is a fundamental structural division in the legal framework and in our institutional procedures between the economic sphere and the social sphere. This is causing the social sphere to be marginalised. Moreover, you are only considering the basic minimums. In this respect, there is one point in Mr Herman"s opinion which I particularly support: the reunification of the procedures for coordinating employment policies with economic policies. This would be a very important step in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">You also accept the budgetary stability pact in its current state. In my opinion, we must recognise the need for public expenditure to be increased in order to finance development. This does not involve the budgetary deficit in itself, but rather the financing of development. Lastly, with regard to the statutes of the European Central Bank and the European System of Central Banks, you are only considering limited improvements. I believe that we need a kind of framework directive to regulate the European System of Central Banks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, and more briefly, you are staking everything on the coordination of economic policies. However, as has been said, there is a lack of will, content and means. In my opinion, we need a greatly improved democratic method. The role of the European Parliament in debating economic and social policy choices will become essential, in coordination, I hope, with the national parliaments. This cannot be left, as you propose, to a simple consultation and debate on a single text from the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, will the relationship between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank involve the Bank"s policy being legitimised by Parliament or a political force being established to counterbalance the ECB? We need a dialogue within a political framework so that the EU policies which serve social and sustainable development objectives will necessarily be involved in monetary policy choices. The work must therefore continue.</p>

For those with the insight to realise it, that was a dangerous illusion even at that time. I believe that today it is clear to us all that it was an illusion. Anyone who thought the common currency must and would necessarily lead to a common economic policy, then to an employment policy and finally to a social union is now disappointed. One employment summit after another has failed. The economic players of European integration will not manage to create a political Europe: they cannot because many people are far too interested in creating a market Europe and not a political Europe.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Spiers </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, there is a good deal to welcome in Mr Barros Moura's report. Whatever Mr Voggenhuber says, EMU will certainly have great political consequences. It is premature to expect to see an immediate and fully fledged economic and social union after five weeks. There will be great political consequences from EMU which have very often being underplayed or even denied by its proponents. Mr Barros Moura is to be congratulated for highlighting those political consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">He is also to be congratulated on seeking to ensure that EMU will not widen the democratic deficit more than is absolutely necessary. No doubt it will widen: an independent and barely accountable central bank publishing its minutes someway down the line seems to me to be utterly undesirable. However, Mr Barros Moura makes various sensible proposals for ensuring that the democratic deficit is not too greatly widened.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I have several concerns about the report and I speak here on behalf of the other British Labour MEPs. In particular, we do not welcome the proposal to enshrine the euro‐X Council in the Treaty. Already four EU members are not actually members of Monetary Union and, as enlargement proceeds, other members will join the European Union without taking on the euro. We must be wary of institutionalising a two‐tier Europe in the way that entrenching the euro‐X Council in the Treaty would.</p>
<p class="contents">We also do not accept the need to harmonise taxes by qualified majority. Already, not only in Britain, but across Europe there is great scepticism and concern about the effects that monetary union will have and it can only be a success if it proceeds by consensus. To try and force people into tax harmonisation in this way will certainly not help achieve that consensus in the United Kingdom. For that reason also, the reference to a federal style budgetary system was decidedly unhelpful: anybody here who knows anything about British politics knows you must never use the ‘f' word in a European context if you are trying to persuade people to get more closely involved in the European Union. For those and other reasons the British Labour MEPs will be abstaining on Mr Barros Moura's report.</p>

<p class="contents">I believe that this report and our support for Mr Barros Moura prove that the consensus needed on the implications of Economic and Monetary Union does exist. I also believe that the decision of 2 May is of great significance. As far as Spanish people are concerned, for two centuries 2 May has represented the rebellion against the French. However, I believe that from 1998 on, 2 May will mean something else: it will mean that we are building Europe together.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the most important element of the report by Mr Barros Moura is that it looks to the future. There is no doubt that the way forward is fraught with difficulties, since we are building something that is completely new. I think it was Baron Lamfalussy who said that in the process of building a single currency there were more ‘ifs" and more conditionals than in the famous poem ‘If" by Rudyard Kipling. There are clearly many ‘ifs" along the path towards the creation of the single currency.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Barros Moura outlines the problems we are going to face in the future. He does this very well in respect of the role of the European Parliament and the new European policies. I realise that there are many things that Mr Spiers does not like – he seems to me to be more Old Labour than New Labour. However, Mr Spiers, it will happen in the end.</p>
<p class="contents">Whether we like it or not, we will eventually have to bring our fiscal policies more into line with each other, and decisions will have to be taken by qualified majority. In an enlarged Europe with 28 or 30 Member States – which is the issue Mr Barros Moura raises – it will be impossible for decisions to be taken unanimously. Clearly, what we really want is consensus, but decisions will have to be taken if we want Europe to work.</p>
<p class="contents">This House has always led the way on the issue of European integration and I am sure that it wants Europe to work. I believe that many of the points made by Mr Barros Moura are useful and will be useful in the future. We will therefore support his report.</p>

It is not a threat to employment. It will benefit employment and social stability. It is a safeguard against acts of stupidity carried out in the past to the detriment of prosperity and stability, especially by some social democratic governments. But it is still the Social Democrats who believe they can protect us against the effects of the euro through new centralised control instruments. That is complete nonsense! On the contrary, the euro is what protects us against old‐fashioned social democratic policies of devaluation, deficit and interference in the operation of central banks.</p>
<p class="contents">For those of us who come from a country which has lived with fixed exchange rate policies for 17 years, this has been the backbone of the prosperity, stability and employment we have enjoyed during that period. We look forward to being able to join the euro and so enjoy its full benefits.</p>

<p class="contents">I think that it proves one thing above all: that the Amsterdam Treaty has already come to the end of its useful life and it is time that we took steps to revise it. This is in fact what Mr Fischer said the other day in Parliament, and it is now being said by others in the German Presidency. I read in the press, Mr President, that there are committees of wise men already working informally on revision of the Treaty. I think that the European Parliament should be preparing rather more officially for this new revision, with all of us participating in it.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Mr Barros Moura"s proposals are very good ones and I wish to highlight those relating to the interinstitutional agreement, which could give a political interpretation to the existing terms of the Treaty, to control of the Euro−11 Council – it is hypocritical to allow it to decide on policy and for us not to say anything on the matter – and to the Community"s policy and the pact on employment, without which neither the euro nor EMU has any legitimacy in the eyes of EU citizens.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Berès </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Amsterdam Treaty has been mentioned today, yet this Treaty was not even allowed to mention the institutional consequences of the transition to Economic and Monetary Union. We are now considering this issue and not before time. If we failed to do so, we would be allowing the intergovernmental approach to sneak in by the back door, which is something we do not want. At first glance, I feel that there are three essential aspects to this issue. Firstly, as stated by Mr Herzog, we need a closer link between the broad economic policy guidelines and the employment guidelines. We have been calling for this for some time in this House. Otherwise, the social sphere will remain an appendage of the economic sphere, which is not the best way to resolve the matters facing us. Secondly, the external representation of the euro zone is clearly only just beginning. This was a matter of urgency and that meant that a solution was cobbled together which is not satisfactory in the long term. A more substantial solution must be found. Thirdly, the transition to EMU and the changeover to the euro will force us to adopt qualified majority voting, both in taxation and in the whole social sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">I now come to the crux of the matter. The institutional consequences of the changeover to the euro cannot be analysed solely in the context of enlargement. They must also be considered in the wider context of the institutional reform needed. In this dual context, the existence of the Euro Council is positive because it ensures an element of effectiveness which we need. However, it is just being created and we must think about the future. We must therefore strengthen the democratic control of this body. Given its effectiveness, it must be controlled and we must determine how it interacts with this House. It must also be included in the overall institutional mechanism with regard to enlargement. The essential issue in the reports by Mr Barros Moura and Mr Bourlanges is the interlinking of these two questions. The ECOFIN Council cannot become the dominant Council and the General Affairs Council must regain its coordinating position. If this means that it no longer deals with foreign affairs, then so be it. However, we do need a Council to coordinate foreign affairs, the economic and financial situation and employment, but this role cannot be played by the ECOFIN Council.</p>

<p class="contents">It reinforces the institutional expression of a multi‐speed Europe and, in the name of a single economic policy, it aims to bestow on ECOFIN characteristics of an economic government and, on the general guidelines of economic policy, a legal substance which will be compulsory for Member States. These are choices which strengthen the policies of imposing a centralist Europe, and which reduce to zero the possibilities of Member States to shape their own economic and social policies. These are choices which give rise to concern among working people and the public at large, who are suffering the consequences of the choices made at Maastricht and over EMU and the stability pact.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying, Mr President, that, under these conditions, we cannot support the report.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">de Silguy, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the report by Mr Barros Moura is to be welcomed, coming, as it does, just after the introduction of the euro. It has come at a good time as it is useful to consider the consequences of Economic and Monetary Union and the imminent institutional reform of the Union prior to the next enlargement. The Commission broadly supports many of the proposals and analyses in this report. However, I believe that this work must be extended by looking towards the future, as Mr Méndez de Vigo just mentioned. And this is the right time given the operating practices of Economic and Monetary Union and the dynamic created by the euro in other European policies and institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I would like to mention briefly two points in response to your questions. The first point concerns the economic aspects of Economic and Monetary Union from an institutional perspective while the second relates to the effects of implementing Economic and Monetary Union on the institutional balance of the Community.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first point, EMU has its own unique structure, as several Members have pointed out, because it consists of a single monetary policy combined with separate national economic policies. This is why we need to coordinate these policies and why the European Councils have for many years been defining the framework for increased coordination of economic policies. However, this is not a question of establishing counterweights, as Mr Brok quite rightly pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">This increased coordination is based on a whole series of instruments with which you are familiar. These are the broad guidelines, the excessive deficits and the stability and growth pact. However, along with the Commission, I agree with your rapporteur when he says that the broad economic policy guidelines must be the overall instrument for coordinating economic policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Amsterdam European Council asked for the broad guidelines to take account of the employment guidelines. And since the Vienna European Council, we have had the prospect of two complementary contributions: one concerning the internal market, the Cardiff 1 report, and the other involving the economic reforms, the Cardiff 2 report. Therefore, the introduction of the euro has clearly encouraged and is encouraging the development of a genuine European economic policy programme. It is therefore the content of the broad economic policy guidelines that is important. They will affect budgetary policies, our level of competitiveness, and the exchange rate policy together with economic reforms and structural policies, both in the market in goods and services and in the labour market. All these elements aim to make our economic policy work to the advantage of growth and employment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a brief outline of the current legal and institutional framework. As the rapporteur has quite rightly pointed out, it is the Commission"s responsibility to see to it that this work is coherent by ensuring that the various components of this economic policy coordination come together perfectly. I note with interest your proposal – which was highlighted by Mr Herzog and Mrs Berès – to develop the guidelines for employment at the same time as the broad economic policy guidelines. Personally, I agree with you but this is a very controversial point, even within the Commission, because it poses various problems. I am not going to go into detail on these today but this is why, given the failure to fully resolve this problem, we have included the content of the employment guidelines in the broad economic policy guidelines. This will form the work for next June.</p>
<p class="contents">To fulfil its task, the Commission is clearly trying to ensure that this work is coordinated. However, the Commission is also responsible for constantly monitoring the economic situation of the Member States. This is why we are insisting on professionalism, promptness and awareness and these are the instructions and the method being applied, at least in the services under my responsibility. This is also why the services of Directorate‐General II have recently been completely reorganised to allow us to assess the situation of the euro zone as accurately as possible using analyses and forecasts. We must learn to learn to think in terms of the euro zone.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we are currently thinking of organising economic discussions in Brussels, in the form of study days, in which this House would be involved. They would take place from this year and could be held at regular intervals, for example, once or twice a year. They would obviously be run with the help of top independent experts and would allow the debate on European economic policy to be extended. The aim would be to make this policy more visible and more transparent and therefore to contribute to the democratic debate you are calling for.</p>
<p class="contents">Your rapporteur asks us to go further and to consider the scope of the broad guidelines, with a view to creating an obligatory policy mix. You have suggested amending Article 103(2). However, I would remind you that the current Treaty already provides for the adoption of the broad economic policy guidelines by a qualified majority in the Council. Nevertheless, I have taken note of your wish and the Commission will consider your proposal with interest. In any event, we understand the reasons behind it.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this issue must be considered in light of the operating practices of Economic and Monetary Union, which is only just starting out. It must also be considered in light of the respective roles of the Euro−11 and the ECOFIN Council. I had proposed to you that the Euro−11 be recognised in the Treaty, but my understanding was that Mr Spiers did not agree. This is a problem which is arising now and which will arise in the future in the light of experience gained.</p>
<p class="contents">For its part, the Commission has always been in favour of improving the operation of the broad economic policy guidelines. These are not a failure, Mr Herman, even if this aspect is not as good or as successful as we would have liked. We will make more specific, formal proposals on the 1999 broad economic policy guidelines for each Member State this year, and you can expect to receive these in March.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to external representation, an agreement was signed in Vienna. This must be respected and it is the responsibility of the German Presidency to ensure that it is accepted by our main trading partners and our main international partners. I have every confidence that the German Presidency will ensure that this agreement by the Heads of State and Government is respected, remembering that this is a minimum and transitory agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I must briefly mention concerns the institutional balance. Mrs Randzio‐Plath very rightly underlined the democratic deficit affecting the European Union in the context of EMU. I believe that an interinstitutional agreement is a good idea. This is actually one of two courses set out by your rapporteur and something that was also highlighted by Mr Papayannakis. The Commission is in favour of this and has always supported the possibility of reaching such an agreement. In my opinion, the practices already used in this respect should be made official and some of the courses mentioned by the rapporteur should be explored, in terms of both defining and monitoring the multilateral surveillance.</p>
<p class="contents">The euro will also have an impact on certain policies. I am thinking mainly of fiscal policy, if only to prevent the tax race as it were. I am also thinking of social policy as this House must take part in drawing up the new social contract and in the actions intended to preserve the European social model. These are areas into which the Economic and Monetary Union will clearly extend, although I am not going to go into them in detail here.</p>
<p class="contents">I will end by mentioning the final stage, that is, the new institutional developments. EMU offers us the option of a method that involves defining precise objectives – transition conditions and deadlines – and ensuring a form of organised flexibility to inspire certain institutional innovations. This method must be given particular consideration with the imminent enlargement of the European Union in the context of our discussions on the institutional question. There are two key issues involved here. The first is qualified majority voting. Mrs Berès is right: if we want to avoid the risk of paralysis in the decision‐making system, we must extend this type of voting and bring it into general use. However, the problem with this, as pointed out by Mr Spiers, is the fiscal policy. A choice must be made between effectiveness and national sovereignty and in this case the dilemma must be resolved. The second key issue is the workings of the Commission, the institutions in general, and therefore the Council. Whatever formula is envisaged, it must respond to the triple requirement of effectiveness, representation and democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I must point out, like your rapporteur, that in my opinion, the euro can now act as a genuine catalyst which Europe can use to become structured, stronger, more developed and enlarged. Europe still has to be able to adapt and reform itself. It is in this respect that your report is an interesting and useful element which will contribute to the discussions in the months to come.</p>

The broad economic policy guidelines must be as realistic, precise and specific as possible. The ideal situation would be for these to be binding and obligatory but, as the Treaty currently stands, this is not possible. We must therefore proceed pragmatically which means initially using the system of group pressure and ministerial pressure in order to succeed in pushing through changes. This is beginning, as noted last Monday in the ECOFIN Council, with regard to the stability and convergence programmes. It is in the light of experience that we will see to what extent and in what way we can introduce an additional stage to make the system more binding. To be too hasty would be prejudicial and would probably be contrary to the objectives set out by those who are in favour of making the guidelines binding.</p>
