Unfortunately, Mr Lipietz was unable to come to Strasbourg for this sitting for pressing personal reasons. I am therefore taking his place, being a member of the same committee and of the same group.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that financial conglomerates own a substantial proportion of the domestic financial markets of many Member States. Some of them belong to bigger groups that are present on the EU’s financial markets. If the businesses belonging to conglomerates of this type were to face financial difficulties, they could seriously affect the overall financial system. At the present time, these cross-sector financial groups are not adequately regulated by current legislation. Therefore, we can only welcome the fact that the Commission, in the spring of 2001, presented a proposal for a directive to bring in the supervision of financial conglomerates such as these. The events of the past year, such as the collapse of e-commerce, numerous financial scandals, including the highly publicised collapse of Enron, and also increased pressure on insurance companies in the wake of 11 September, have inevitably highlighted the need for better regulation of this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal and the amendments by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs received Parliament's firm support at first reading stage at the beginning of this year. The Council also made swift progress on this dossier by reaching a common position shortly afterwards. The outcome of the Council’s deliberations is also extremely encouraging. Parliament can most certainly welcome the fact that the Council has retained almost all the elements contained in the amendments adopted by the European Parliament at first reading and that the common position has taken sufficient account of the main concerns expressed by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the fact that there are a few areas where the common position could have been improved further, your rapporteur’s major concern is to see this new and enhanced regulatory framework implemented as soon as possible. He therefore proposes – and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs approved this position almost unanimously – that the common position be adopted in its current form. This will enable us to ensure that European conglomerates will, in the very near future, be governed by the most up-to-date, most efficient and most effective regulation and controls possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Financial conglomerates are important players in European financial markets. A significant number of them are also systemically important groups. If such a group were to face financial difficulties it could seriously affect financial markets and people's savings. Currently the supervision of such groups is not adequately regulated in European financial legislation. The directive will therefore address an important loophole in our financial legislation. Its adoption will contribute to financial market stability, the need for which has been demonstrated dramatically over the past months.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has also recognised the importance of this directive and has unanimously agreed on a common position. The common position has taken into account Parliament's main concerns expressed at first reading and is faithful to the objectives and the spirit of the Commission proposal. For all these reasons, I commend the Council common position to Parliament and urge its rapid adoption. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is of great importance to the European financial market, to the internal market, and to financial services. In particular, we have to see to it that there is no recurrence in Europe of cases of the magnitude of Enron or World Com. It makes a fundamental contribution to the stability of Europe's financial markets. The success of a regulation of this sort is in the financial institutions' own best interests.</p>
<p class="contents">The conglomerates are of course houses offering services in the fields of securities, insurance and banking. We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, tabled a number of amendments, relating in particular to the choice of methods of calculation available, but these were subtle distinctions. At the end of the day, we are very satisfied with the draft as a whole, which should be adopted in this form.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, though, especially like to point out an innovation in this directive, one that is of great importance to us in terms of the overall discussion of financial supervision in Europe. I refer to the role and structure of the so-called coordinator, who is in future to be appointed for a financial conglomerate. An increasing number of such conglomerates are coming into being, for example, in my own country, Germany, by the buying-up of Allianz Versicherung by the Dresdner Bank, thus creating a classic conglomerate which is also active right across Europe. This coordinator is expected in future to be part of a country's own supervisory authority and to make sure that the work of Europe's various supervisory authorities is coordinated, and that accounting standards are the same. He is to ensure, on the one hand, that unnecessary bureaucracy is avoided, but also, on the other, that information concerning this conglomerate is exchanged, thus enabling a better grasp of the conglomerate's complexities.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the good and important thing about this is that it gets us closer to answering the question of what shape financial supervision in Europe will take in future. Being myself at present unable to feel at all at home with the idea of a European super-authority to deal with financial supervision, I believe that we should extend this idea and concept beyond financial conglomerates to other fields and thereby gain useful experience before we give consideration to an overarching authority. I believe that the Conglomerates Directive can, in this respect, lead the way and give a good example. Therefore, speaking on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I can tell you that we will be voting in favour of this directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A number of European countries, such as Great Britain and Sweden, have overall financial supervision and have already had good experience of how it works.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall financial supervision makes it possible to deal with the same risks in the same way. That represents progress towards greater competition neutrality on the financial markets. Supervision of this kind also continues to guarantee that consumers and workers are better protected when such conglomerates collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">Across the world, the financial markets have moved closer together. This became clear when it was via the financial markets that the American economic downturn was transported to Europe faster and with greater force than even the experts had reckoned with.</p>
<p class="contents">What is true of economic downturns is also true of crises in the financial markets: neither is now a merely regional problem. Supervision of financial conglomerates has as its objective greater stability on the international financial and capital markets. It must, however, be borne in mind that cannot be achieved only by means of a regulation covering only the territory of the European Union. I do think that the directive will lead to discussion in the Member States as to what the ‘right way of implementation’ is, as, on many points, it makes no provision for specific rules, allowing instead wide-ranging discretion for the national supervisory authorities. It is positively dangerous for a directive primarily intended to apply to conglomerates that operate internationally to be transposed into national law in different ways from one state to another. This will involve national law on supervision imposing responsibilities on conglomerates or removing them from them, and this will affect competitiveness to a high degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to express my concern that, by sorting out questions of detail, the Supervisory Authorities' Committee will end up leaving a decisive mark on the substance of the law on supervision, and that this means that what Parliament wants becomes less important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The people who have good reason to worry are the employees who have already been made redundant or are about to be made redundant by the companies concerned, even though they are in no way responsible for the anarchy of your economy, which is as unfair as it is irrational. Confronted with this genuine evil, however, the only solution being proposed is to strengthen prudential rules or to improve supervision, as if the financial conglomerates could be supervised from above by the political authorities responsible for protecting them.</p>
<p class="contents">So as to prevent the mere sound of the word ‘supervision’ from angering the financial conglomerates, the report promises them that the directive will respect the need for confidentiality. And so, those who pretend to believe that a few prudential rules and a few coordinators who have no real power can eradicate speculation, scandals and financial crises from the capitalist economy will be those who therefore vote in favour of this report. Even a vote by the European Parliament cannot turn an insipid recommendation into a magic potion to ward off the evils of capitalism.</p>
<p class="contents">Your economy based on the quest for private profits and on competition is even more unpredictable than the weather. Although we can predict unsettled weather three days in advance, who can predict the ups and downs of the stock market from one day to the next?</p>

This Directive on the supplementary supervision of credit institutions, insurance undertakings and investment firms in a financial conglomerate has been something that has been of immense interest to companies in the United States too. Enron and similar finance-sector scandals shook the confidence of investors and market operators in the stability of financial conglomerates on both sides of the Atlantic. Events in the past few years have undeniably shown that the financial services sector needs to improve its regulation and supervision.</p>
<p class="contents">The business and financial markets are global markets. European legislation thus also has an obvious impact on how financial conglomerates operate in third countries, and vice versa. For this reason it is absolutely vital that legislators and regulating authorities in the European Union and the United States hold ongoing, intensive talks with one another on how workable the regulations and laws are and the need for change. For example, many of us Members of the European Parliament have taken a critical view of the securities legislation package passed at the end of October by the US Congress, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and in particular the additional obligations it places on companies in the EU. We still have much work to do to make the mutual recognition of systems possible and stop a jungle of multiple regulatory systems from spreading. In return, companies in North America must make their views known with regard to how EU legislation affects them. Many of them opposed this proposal for a directive because they considered it would make things unnecessarily difficult for them in the EU. The final outcome will hardly satisfy all parties, but we can at least be satisfied that the debate on both sides of the Atlantic has been conducted openly. In the future too we must take account of all legitimate points of view in order to ensure that global markets operate seamlessly.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has now arrived at a common position. It is a positive sign that the Council accepted almost all Parliament’s amendments at first reading. I tabled some amendments at second reading that would have brought the legislation on threshold values in the directive closer to the realities of the market. Our rapporteur, Mr Lipietz, however, is proposing that the common position should be approved without amendment so that work on implementation might begin without delay. I am prepared to accept this proposal and I shall support the rapporteur provided that the provisions of the directive can be assessed regularly in terms of their viability and revised if need be. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
