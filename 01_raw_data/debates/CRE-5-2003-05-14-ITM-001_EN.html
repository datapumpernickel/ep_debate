<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I wish to begin by giving an account of my visit to Baghdad a week ago. I travelled there with the overall objective of signalling our continuing humanitarian support and solidarity with the Iraqi people. As a reminder, ECHO has since 1992 and before the current conflict allocated EUR 157 million in humanitarian aid, mainly for health and sanitation. This programme was complementary to the oil-for-food programme and, in fact, made ECHO the largest humanitarian donor in the country. Following the outbreak of the conflict, EUR 100 million was secured overall for humanitarian needs, of which an amount of EUR 22.5 million has now been committed and is being implemented, mainly for activities concerning health and water.</p>
<p class="contents">I wanted to get a first-hand impression of the humanitarian situation in the country through discussions with our partners - the UN, Red Cross and NGOs, the US-led Office for Reconstruction and Humanitarian Aid (ORHA) - and Member States, and through project visits. To that effect, I met with ICRC President Kellenberger, Ambassador Ward, who is heading the humanitarian aid pillar of ORHA, the UN Humanitarian Coordinator Mr Lopes da Silva, a large number of NGOs and the Member States present in Baghdad. I visited the Abu Nawas raw water pumping station and the big Al Yarmouk hospital.</p>
<p class="contents">Another objective was to evaluate possibilities for the opening of an ECHO office in Baghdad. Premises have now been identified and following the administrative procedures the office should open by the end of May. ECHO staff have been present in Baghdad for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">My assessment of the humanitarian situation in Iraq is that it cannot be characterised as a humanitarian catastrophe. The direct humanitarian impact of the war has fortunately been smaller than was expected by most humanitarian agencies. No massive population movements have occurred and direct casualties as a result of the conflict have also, fortunately, been far less numerous than some of the initial estimations had predicted.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there are very real humanitarian needs and the situation remains <span class="italic">very </span>fragile, notably in the main urban centres - there are more than two or three cities of importance in this respect - where the problem is still very much the availability of safe water and similar problems. There could easily be a humanitarian disaster if the occupying powers fail to enforce law and order and institutions are not reactivated and put back in charge.</p>
<p class="contents">Safety is still a very real problem for people trying to go to work or return to work in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Geneva Conventions, it is the obligation of the occupying powers not only to restore and maintain law and order in all places under their control, but also to ensure that people have full and secure access to vital goods and services, and to make it possible for people to return to their work.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of this, the international community, as such, has a duty to assist the victims of the situation, and the Commission has up to now approved humanitarian aid operations, as I have already mentioned, amounting to EUR 22.5 million. These include emergency relief, emergency supplies of drugs and medical equipment, water supply and basic, very immediate rehabilitation of health, water and sanitation infrastructures. ECHO is also supporting OCHA - the UN coordinator - and is making it possible for it to work efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">The remaining EUR 77.5 million of the 100 million secured will be programmed, and decisions made, as further needs are assessed and identified. The current priorities for ECHO are to support the rapid restoration of social services, especially health care, including the resumption of vaccination campaigns, the effective coordination of humanitarian assistance, mine awareness and de-mining activities. It also envisages support for the World Food Programme to help cover the gaps in the food distribution programme. I hope this will be a transitional challenge. Under the oil-for-food programme the system was well organised: 44 000 local outlets running year-in-year-out provided 60% of the population's food requirements. This was a huge operation, with the Iraqi authorities themselves responsible for the two southern parts of the country, and the UN for the north. We must ensure the whole thing works, because leaving it to some miracle of the market economy to solve all this from one week to another is a recipe for turmoil and disaster. This is quite well understood by all the different players involved in the situation. However, it is a complicated operation.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the wider political framework, the discussion at the UN Security Council of a draft UN Security Council resolution constitutes a positive step in bringing the debate over Iraq’s future back to the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We make a very clear distinction – for many good reasons – between the immediate response to humanitarian needs and the whole discussion concerning reconstruction. They are very different. Everything relating to reconstruction brings us immediately into the centre of political discussions about the structure and structuring of power in the new Iraq. In the case of humanitarian aid, however, the immediate response can and should be handled as a much more focused activity.</p>
<p class="contents">This Security Council draft resolution has been tabled, as everybody knows, by the US and the UK to clarify how the occupying powers would like things to be organised. The Iraqi Assistance Fund is the cornerstone for handling all the decisions and financial management of the country and its resources. The decisions concerning this Iraqi Assistance Fund and also covering decisions on licensing in the oil industry are to be taken by the occupying powers, and the Iraqi side and the UN are given a consultative role in those decisions on the basis of the draft resolution. The draft resolution would also provide for immunity for those making these decisions, and the remaining money - the unspent balance from the oil-for-food programme - should also be put into this fund and administered like the rest of it. It is supposed to run for 12 months, but then to continue unchanged - with all the provisions unchanged - if no new decisions are made to that effect by the Security Council, of which these two main occupying powers are permanent members.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s involvement in the reconstruction phase will naturally depend on the outcome of these discussions in the Security Council – this is self-evident.</p>
<p class="contents">At the informal ministerial meeting in Rhodes, the Council invited the Commission to undertake some concrete steps to start identifying possibilities for EU involvement in the reconstruction in Iraq. We have therefore increased our working contacts with the relevant international organisations (World Bank, IMF and UN) with a view to taking forward jointly our analysis of the situation in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has developed specific expertise in various aspects of reconstruction and rehabilitation from other crisis situations, such as Kosovo, East Timor, Afghanistan and Ivory Coast. But, in any case, concrete decisions will need to be taken on the basis of an appropriate political framework and a solid needs assessment, and through a participatory process with the international community and the Iraqis themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">A final comment on the regional dimension: the Union is very well placed to offer a regional approach to stabilisation, which will be extremely important in the case of Iraq. Our ties with the region are already very important. The Barcelona process, the comprehensive dialogue, the human rights and on-going political and cooperation negotiations with Iran, the on-going negotiations for a free trade area with the Gulf Cooperation Council, the ministerial meetings and our very tight political links with Turkey - all these constitute a solid basis on which to build an active and constructive EU policy in the wake of the Iraqi conflict. We need to continually assess how best to reinforce our political dialogue and role in the region.</p>

Again a few days ago, a similar terrorist attack in Chechnya gave rise to a significant number of victims. The presence of violence is strong everywhere. In my capacity as President-in-Office of the European Union, I should like to roundly condemn these disgusting actions, to express my profound sorrow for the victims and their families, to express the wish for ways to be found to break this tragic form of political intervention and dispense justice and to emphasise the urgent need for us to achieve conditions of stability, security and confidence; for us to impose the policy against blind violence and fanaticism.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to move on to the item on the agenda relating to Iraq. Today, we face a new situation in Iraq. From a military point of view, the operations have essentially been completed. From a political point of view, a series of questions is being raised to which I shall refer in a moment. From a practical point of view, the predominant issues are humanitarian aid and the safeguarding of security, order and the restoration of normalcy in the area. Although the overall situation appears to be improving, the rate of progress is slow and it is obvious that considerable difficulties and problems need to be resolved. At the present stage, the allied forces are responsible for consolidating security and providing humanitarian aid with the presence of Member States of the European Union; however, the assistance and support of the international community as a whole are needed for there to be a fast, efficient and operational return to normalcy.</p>
<p class="contents">The first priority, of course, is the channelling of humanitarian aid and the full restoration of order and security. Significant sums have been amassed within the framework of the United Nations – approximately USD 1.7 billion – without, however, there being a clear picture of the record of damage and the reconstruction requirements of the country. The European Commission and, from what I heard, Commissioner Nielson obviously referred to this, has already earmarked EUR 100 million, part of which has already been channelled to the area and an important contribution is being made at bilateral level by the European countries. There are plans on the part of the European Union for a grant of EUR 250 million for 2003. I would point out that, as long as the sanctions regime continues to apply, the United Nations oil for food programme, which was recently extended to 3 June 2003, continues to operate.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add at this point that, in order to deal with the humanitarian crisis, cooperation between all the agencies involved is particularly important, so as to safeguard access to the country, as is independent and impartial action on all sides. There is no need for me to stress that, in addition to the provision of humanitarian aid, the need to protect the cultural heritage of Iraq from a repeat of incidents such as those that took place recently is extremely important.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my disgust at the looting and destruction of archaeological treasures, museums and monuments and stress that our immediate objective must be to find the priceless exhibits that have disappeared and seize and return them to the country as and when they appear. We expect the planning and the administrative work of the military forces occupying Iraq to have tangible results in this sector shortly and we also see coordinated action on the part of the international community on this matter as a top priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union, on the basis of its previous experience with regard to the reconstruction of states and areas – I refer to Kosovo, Afghanistan and East Timor – must and can contribute efficiently to the reconstruction of Iraq. Its active participation can focus on numerous sectors, not just on the humanitarian aid I referred to, but also on replacing infrastructures, on support and the provision of know-how with the democratisation and restructuring of institutions, so-called institutional building<span class="italic">,</span> on cooperation within the framework of international financial organisations in order to find a solution to the question of Iraq's debt and, of course, on the political reconstruction of the country. It is precisely the joint objective of contributing to the more general reconstruction of the country which is yet another point of convergence and reason for putting the differences which recently split the Member States on the question of Iraq behind us.</p>
<p class="contents">At the European summit in Athens on 16 and 17 April, the European Union confirmed its commitment to playing an important role in this direction and asked the High Representative and the Commission to examine this question. I would point out that this question was also discussed during the course of the informal Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Greece two weeks ago and we are examining how and what we can contribute. In fact, important questions still remain open, such as, in particular, how oil revenues are to be controlled, what the future of the oil for food programme will be, what will happen to the contracts signed by the previous regime, how the weapons of mass destruction will be located, what will happen when UNMOVIC returns and others.</p>
<p class="contents">The basic principles governing our action to manage the situation in Iraq, however, remain unchanged. The territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country, the vital role of the United Nations and the right of the Iraqi people to determine their future. Equally important, of course, is the establishment of a government which is representative of the entire population and the use of the natural wealth of the country for its own benefit. We believe that the United Nations, and the Security Council in particular, with its special institutional and organisational infrastructure and its political experience from similar situations, have a fundamental role. The appointment by the Secretary-General of the United Nations of a special representative to Iraq is a positive step in this direction.</p>
<p class="contents">A smooth transition to a democratic and stable situation will also contribute towards regional peace and stability. Within this framework, we have repeatedly pointed out to neighbouring countries the need to demonstrate sangfroid and self-control and to contribute to the reconstruction of Iraq and to combating the humanitarian problem, with the objective of stability in the region. Both Turkey and Iran are taking a positive approach to the overall question. Similarly today, attention has also been turned to the question of the road map for peace in the Middle East. It is clear, as has been said many times, that the promotion of the peace process in the Middle East will have highly positive repercussions overall. The meeting of the Quartet at ministerial level on 21 May is particularly important within this framework, given that the establishment of positive prospects take precedence and we urgently need to restore a climate of trust with the Arab world. Regional stability and security will also help substantially to combat the problems linked with Iraq, and will also facilitate the reintegration of the country into the international community after 12 years of sanctions and essential isolation.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of disarming the country must be settled definitively in accordance with the resolutions of the Security Council of the United Nations and must be linked to the adoption at broader regional level of an overall and efficient policy for preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is often easy to agree on general principles, but it is proving to be particularly difficult to agree on specific solutions and decisions, especially when questions are raised of institutions, of international legitimacy, of arrangements which emerge after a war, of situations which have arisen objectively and need to be dealt with. This naturally has repercussions both on the extent to which and the method by which questions are dealt with.</p>
<p class="contents">From the Presidency's point of view, however, I believe that we can summarise the priorities as follows: first we need to develop a pragmatic, global, cohesive European policy for post-war Iraq, taking account of the long-term aspects of developments in the Middle East as a whole; to clarify how we, the European Union, see the role of the United Nations in post-war Iraq; to help Iraq get over the problems it has been through and to set up conditions of peace, security, acceptance, dignity and prosperity for the Iraqi people; to implement the principles we accepted in our joint decisions at recent Councils; and to promote regional stability and cooperation by supporting the peace process in the Middle East.</p>
<p class="contents">These priorities do not mean that we do not face problems and dangers. I shall refer specifically to just some of these dangers. One such danger is that discussions on Iraq will turn from being fruitful dialogue on dealing with the central problems affecting the country to secondary conflicts. A second issue is the difficulty in agreeing on subsequent measures and subsequent decisions by the Security Council. A third issue relates to developments in trans-Atlantic relations. Fourthly, the differences between the European states, although I believe that, on the issues of the post-war phase, these phenomena will be far less acute. Fifthly, the inability to determine the role we wish to play in Iraq and, finally, any obstacles that might lead us into inertia. I think that we must bear these dangers in mind so that we deal with them efficiently, so that we arrive at an approach and action which will enable us to deal with the Iraqi question and its repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">In the final analysis, it is the stability, security, normalcy and economic development not only of the country but also of the wider area which are put into doubt or which are linked to these developments. The whole issue is also connected to the credibility of everyone involved in the Iraqi crisis and, consequently, of Europe also.</p>
<p class="contents">In closing, however, I should like to confirm that the Council, as I mentioned, is demonstrating a constructive approach to the formulation of joint answers to the issues of Iraq. There is close contact between all sides without exception, which is helping us, on the one hand, to prevent splits in contacts between the Member States and, on the other hand – and these intentions are indicative – to reach agreements despite any differences, to have open lines, to see as a matter of priority where there are bridges and how we can make use of them. It is this constructive stance that also appeared in our discussions in Gimnich and which, I believe, can make us more optimistic about the ability of the European Union to finally play a positive and active role at this stage in Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   –<span class="italic"> (DE)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, on Tuesday night some 90 people died in a brutal terrorist attack in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. The victims included both Saudis and Europeans – as far as we know, French, British, German, one Swiss – and Australians. This shows once again that the challenges posed by terrorism do not just affect the Americans, they affect us all, and the lesson we should learn from this appalling terrorist attack in Riyadh should be that we need to join together to fight terrorism resolutely throughout the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office was right to refer to Chechnya. The European Parliament – well my group at least, but I think this also applies to the other groups – will be considering very carefully what further progress can be made towards a peaceful solution in Chechnya.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Iraq war, we Europeans need to decide what lessons we can learn from experiences which have been painful for Europe as well, and we must make it clear that there is no cause for defeatism. During this unhappy period of lack of European unity I have often heard it said this makes nonsense of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. No, we must treat this crisis as an opportunity to be seized and make sure that in future we do better than with the Iraq crisis and the Iraq war. Above all, we need to make sure that before one Member State or a number of Member States adopt a national position and then go public, we should discuss our respective standpoints within the European Union so that we can arrive at a common position.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">This demand is also aimed at the two European members of the United Nations Security Council. The Maastricht Treaty already stipulates that before Member States who are members of the Security Council vote, they should first consult with their partners in the European Union, and that is the lesson we should learn from the past few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to add – and this concerns our relations with the United States – that those people who think that a united Europe should be created in opposition to the United States are on shaky ground, because if we build up Europe in opposition to the United States, then at least half, if not more, of all Europeans would turn their back on a united Europe, so there is in fact no alternative to creating a Europe that does not oppose the United States, but is an equal partner of the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add a further point. One voice in America suggested that Europe could be divided into New Europe and Old Europe. On a recent visit to Warsaw I realised that they are not happy with that suggestion there. Warsaw – Poland – is part of the Old Europe and shares our roots, and we should not allow anyone to divide Europe into two halves. No, it is up to us to act in unison.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me turn to Iraq. We are bound to have a strong interest in civil order being swiftly re-established, and when we are talking about the relationship between the European Union and the Arab Islamic states we often say that there cannot and must not be any clash of civilisation, and the same of course applies to order in Iraq. Iraq’s population includes Shiites, Sunnis and Christians, Arabs and Kurds, and I believe that one area where we really may be able to help – and if we can help, then we should – is to ensure that peace and order prevail in Iraq, and that there is no conflict between the various religious or ethnic groups.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the European Union has an important role to play here, and on behalf of my group I welcome the fact that you have been to Iraq, Commissioner Nielson. It is of course very difficult to say at this point here in the European Parliament whether the United Nations is to be given an exclusive role, and what role we as the European Union and others are to play – NATO perhaps, and the United States and the United Kingdom as the two powers that intervened there. That is hard to say, but what we can say is that we call on everyone involved there – and particularly the Europeans, including our Polish partners and friends – for we Europeans to take whatever action we take in concert, once we have agreed on a common position. There are enormous humanitarian challenges in Iraq, and I believe that we can make a contribution to security there, to the establishment of a police force, to water supply, to healthcare and to a new political order in general.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me say this: we do of course have questions for our American friends and partners. So far, no weapons of mass destruction have been found. I recommend that the search for them should be continued, as that was the basis for intervention, and its political credibility is dependent on that, which is why we need to take that question very seriously indeed.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">What we need to achieve now is a peaceful solution in the Middle East between Israel and Palestine, and that was indeed our great hope following the Kuwait crisis in 1991, when I was very much in favour of the liberation of Kuwait and the firm action against Saddam Hussein that it involved. We must seize this opportunity now. The credibility of our policy will also depend on our success in achieving a peaceful solution there, and I call on all of us to make a united and decisive contribution as Europeans.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by joining – on behalf of the Socialist Group – in the condemnation of the massive attacks in Saudi Arabia and Chechnya, and Parliament should also send its condolences to the families of all the victims of this war, particularly the civil population, and stress that we profoundly regret the fact that 14 journalists have died during the conflict, two have disappeared and American troops have bombed media organisations such as Al-Jazeera and also the Palestine hotel, which was occupied by journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard Mr Poettering, I would like to say, on behalf of my group, that we regret even more than you that it has not been considered appropriate to produce a resolution, because we could have agreed on many points and because it is important that the European Parliament’s voice is heard. We are giving the impression that we are indifferent to what is happening and we have a shared responsibility with the other institutions of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the emergency situation, I would like to welcome the efforts the Commission is making – the Commissioner has been in Baghdad. EUR 100 million is being provided, and I would ask you please to include women in the peace negotiations and in aid, because this is a very important element if peace is to be achieved in Iraq. Furthermore, I believe we must support the restoration of basic services.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has raised a point which I believe to be important: we must not confuse humanitarian aid with reconstruction and, above all, humanitarian aid must not be a political bargaining chip. You have the support of the Socialist Group in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the reconstruction process and the debate under way in the Security Council, I would like firstly to point out that, according to international law, we are in a <span class="italic">de facto </span>situation, in which there is a coalition which is acting as an occupying power in occupied territory. In accordance with the Geneva Convention and the Hague Regulations, the coalition has clear responsibilities and limits to its authority, and this must be incorporated into the current framework, because otherwise everything will depend on the power games in Washington. I remind you that the first team of American governors in Iraq has already come to an end. The confusion is increasing all the time and it is therefore important to reaffirm the role of the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans have responsibilities here. It is the case that, according to Articles 11, 12 and 13 of the Treaty, we are obliged to coordinate our positions. But it is odd that we are able to coordinate them amongst Europeans and with others, in the Middle East Quartet and even with the Arab League, but the same principle is not applied in the Security Council. Public opinion cannot understand this and furthermore Europe has serious responsibilities here.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore very important that the agreement reached in Athens on 16 April is now applied, but within the framework of international law. Why? In order to establish a government belonging to the Iraqi people, which respects territorial integrity and also provides the Iraqi people with an opportunity, having finally been liberated from a despotic tyranny. We are beginning to see the disappearance of political and religious repression and the Iraqi people are being allowed to express themselves. This is an absolutely essential issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The lifting of the embargo – as expressed in several United Nations Resolutions – must be carried out under the authority of those Resolutions. The inspectors must also return, because paradoxically the only people who have found any traces of weapons of mass destruction have been the teams of Mr Blix and Mr ElBaradei rather than the American inspectors, who are acting illegally, and it is therefore also important to intervene in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate, on behalf of my group, that Iraqi oil and its exploitation belongs to the Iraqi people. Oil – as we have seen too often – is a poisoned gift and there must be genuine respect for its use and the right to access to resources for the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, please allow me to refer to the situation in the Middle East. We cannot say that action had to be taken because 12 years had passed during which the regime of Saddam Hussein had not respected the United Nations resolutions when we have been waiting three decades for Resolution 242 to be complied with. We must support the roadmap, Mr Sharon cannot cold-shoulder the Union’s High Representative for Foreign Policy, Mr Solana, because he has met President Arafat. We must show goodwill, and above all we must defuse the most dangerous time bomb in the Middle East. And all this requires that we Europeans re-establish our unity and act together.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Watson (ELDR).</span></span>   – Mr President, although many of us opposed the basis for the recent war with Iraq, we can unite in rejoicing at the fall of the brutal dictator Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people can now rebuild their country as a free democracy, at peace with its neighbours and using its immense natural resources to raise the standard of living.</p>
<p class="contents">The question for Europe today is how to unite in rebuilding Iraq so that we can overcome our previous division. We must project Europe's voice with the unity of a choir singing from the same hymn sheet, rather than the dissonance of an unruly cacophony.</p>
<p class="contents">The informal meeting of foreign ministers leaves me cautiously optimistic. I welcome the proposals from the Commission and the Greek Presidency to guide our action in post-war Iraq. While we may not yet have the capacity to wage war in defence of our values, we have long experience at winning the peace. My group favours an active role for Europe in rebuilding Iraq, but for that we need the legitimacy which can come only from another UN resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We were promised a 'vital' role for the UN by President Bush. Our foreign ministers have demanded a 'central' role for the United Nations. Yet the draft resolution of the US, the UK and Spain falls far short of either. You cannot give a vital role to the UN simply by proclaiming it in a recital to a Security Council resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">A vital role means that rebuilding Iraq would not be not possible without the UN; it entails not endorsing for a 12-month period the authority of the self-declared occupying powers, with the right to direct the disbursement of funds from Iraqi oil revenues.</p>
<p class="contents">A vital role for the UN means its involvement in setting up, as soon as possible, a legitimate and representative government of Iraqis, in lifting sanctions and in providing urgent humanitarian aid. Why have running water and electricity not yet been restored? How many must die before we get medical supplies into hospitals and clean up the unexploded ordnance? Where are the police that the UN could send to help restore law and order? We need to give the people of Iraq a better life or their hardship will become anger towards the occupying powers.</p>
<p class="contents">A vital or central role for the UN also means readmitting Hans Blix and his weapons inspectors to verify what has happened to the weapons of mass destruction which remain unaccounted for. Their existence and the claim that they could be used within 45 minutes were central to the case for war. The weapons inspectors have the international legitimacy and credibility to complete the job they were asked to do, in cooperation with American and British forces on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">The tragic events of Monday night in Saudi Arabia remind us of the continuing instability in the region. That is why my group welcomes the visit of Colin Powell, marking the re-engagement of the United States in the peace process. For lasting peace in the region and a successful rebuilding of Iraq, we must simultaneously take forward the Quartet's roadmap for peace in Israel and Palestine.</p>

At that time, we stated that none of the reasons put forward at that time justified a war and that ‘any further steps must be taken by the Security Council after a full assessment of the situation’.</p>
<p class="contents">Have we nothing to say about the extremely serious events that have taken place since then, which have been in total conflict with this line? That is what seems to be indicated by the majority decision of this House not to conclude this debate with the adoption of a resolution. This petty decision would be rather trivial if it did not reflect a much deeper, serious defect of the European Union, namely its inability to define its identity and defend it with vigour. This failure to take political responsibility has been spectacular since George Bush first implemented his new strategic doctrine.</p>
<p class="contents">To those who, like my group, feel that it is essential to react, in particular by looking towards what the New York Times calls ‘the other superpower’, in other words the general public who are actively opposed to the idea of war, I propose three closely linked priorities. The first is to refuse to accept a <span class="italic">fait accompli</span> in Iraq. The Iraqi people have been both freed from a dictatorship and plunged into chaos. Having spoken to long-time opponents of Saddam Hussein, I can tell you that, on 9 April 2003, many hearts and minds experienced a mixture of joy and suffering, relief and humiliation. As the days passed, exasperation took over as a result of the blood spilt, the extent of the damage, vandalism and looting, the military occupation and the US civil proconsul. All this, while the supposed motive for the war – the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction, of which George Bush, Tony Blair and José Maria Aznar all have irrefutable proof, of course – is running out of credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second priority must therefore be to make an active commitment to ensuring the effective implementation of the Middle East roadmap. The Union is co-initiator of this roadmap and therefore cannot rest on its laurels in the fact of the daily attempts by Sharon’s Government to destroy this slim chance of peace, in the belief that the current host in the White House will always understand its reasons. Finally, we must all help to determine where the mad venture of pre-emptive war will lead us if Europe does not manage to muster the political will to do all in its power to nip it in the bud. The fight against terrorism and against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction is vital. This dangerous imperial shift, however, is a completely different matter.</p>
<p class="contents">I reiterate today, Mr President, for the third time, the request by my group for Parliament’s first major, in-depth debate on the new strategic doctrine published by George Bush on 20 September. This cynical homage to the law of the most powerful seeks solely to debase all of the principles of the United Nations Charter, as demonstrated once again even now by the US draft resolution to the Security Council. It is time for Europe to raise the alarm and to take up its responsibilities. That is what the majority of our citizens, from Strasbourg to Warsaw, expect of us. Our own roadmap could consist of seeking to meet this expectation. In any event, my group is ready. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is even worse is to be wrong and to see ever more clearly how wrong you were. Very specifically, we all know that the so-called existence of large quantities of weapons of mass destruction was the main official reason for starting this war. We all recall the presentations by Tony Blair and Colin Powell in the United Nations, where they produced hard evidence of the existence of these weapons of mass destruction. Now, after weeks of searching by hundreds of American and British soldiers, it seems this evidence does not exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Might this perhaps be the reason why the authorities, for which read the Americans and the British, are refusing to let Hans Blix and his UN inspection team in? The UN weapons inspectors are the only ones who can demonstrate that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction, but they are also the only ones who will very probably demonstrate that Bush and Blair were wrong when they started this war because there were supposed to be weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">This refusal is part of a much broader pattern, one of keeping the United Nations at arm’s length. It is not right and nor is it smart. Let me give two examples of where the role of the United Nations is crucial. UNEP, the United Nations environmental organisation, has, rightly in my view, pressed for an investigation as soon as possible into the environmental effects, the environmental consequences of the use of cluster bombs and depleted uranium for example. The establishment of a tribunal, sorely needed for processing the criminal past, is only possible with the help of the United Nations. But let us also be clear: the European Union itself can only function at full power whether we are talking of humanitarian aid or of reconstruction within a framework that has been legitimised by the United Nations and as an equal partner of the US and not as a subcontractor.</p>
<p class="contents">My fear is that Europe, without that UN mandate, will nonetheless, half-heartedly and probably even grudgingly, assist with the reconstruction of Iraq. The EU from a sense of duty, some Member States because they have no wish for a second conflict with the United States and because they want their share. That is not the Common Foreign Policy that my group has in mind. The road to a European Union common foreign policy runs via New York, via the United Nations. Only with a UN mandate will the EU be able to put its – not insignificant – capabilities to use in building up Iraq and returning the government to the Iraqi people. That is also in the interest of the United States and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to call on the British, the Spanish, but also the Polish governments and our colleagues in the government parties in those countries to break with the logic of war according to which the winner takes all. The winner does not take all; it must not want to, nor must it be able to. Look at what is happening in Iraq at the moment. It is a chaos in which one military governor succeeds another because the Americans and the British do not really know exactly what to do. Iraq has no need of triumphalist victors who do not know what to do. The war has been won by the few, but the peace can only be won by the many. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The US Government has avowed its intention to hand over the sovereignty of Iraq to a representative Iraqi Government at a very early date. Two meetings of Iraqi political leaders have now taken place. The most recent, in Baghdad on 25 April, ended with an agreement to work to put together a transitional administration by 3 June 2003. This administration will then work to promulgate a new constitution for the people of Iraq and deal with other long-term government issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the fact that a draft resolution has been tabled at the United Nations on the subject of how to deal with the post-conflict situation in Iraq. I believe that there are a number of guiding yardsticks which must be adhered to in the context of addressing the future role of the United Nations in Iraq. The United Nations must play a central role in the reconstruction of Iraq. This must begin from a clear understanding that it is not the purpose of any United Nations involvement to legitimise the recent military conflict. The United Nations must be an equal partner, and not have a subordinate position limited to acquiescing to decisions made by the coalition in Iraq. It would be very unfair to the civilian population of Iraq to allow questions of principle to prevent effective United Nations engagement with immediate needs.</p>
<p class="contents">We should recall the comments of the Secretary-General of the United Nations when he said that we must find: 'unity of purpose in the post-war phase in Iraq'. The overriding aim must be to set aside past divisions and focus on what must and can be done to help the Iraqi people at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">From the perspective of the European Union we must set out exactly the likely future role for the European Union in Iraq. There was some general agreement at the last meeting of EU foreign ministers, held in Rhodes on 3 May, that the EU must play a stronger role in the post-conflict situation in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has already dispatched a needs-assessment mission to Iraq. There is also agreement that the Chargés d'Affaires could return to Iraq from the Member States of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">There has been no agreement to date on whether or not the European Union should appoint a special representative for Iraq. This latter issue is one very important matter which must be given urgent political consideration. The European Union should engage in the reconstruction of Iraq and in a situation where the United Nations is at the centre of this effort. EU resources would then be made available to fund key reconstruction activities, such as the rebuilding of basic social infrastructure, including health, education, water and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right and proper that sanctions against Iraq be lifted. They serve no purpose whatsoever at this juncture, as they were originally designed to target a regime which now no longer exists. UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency should return to Iraq at the earliest opportunity and complete their mission. The use of Iraq's oil revenues must also play a key part in the actual reconstruction of Iraq, but any use of such monies must be undertaken in the best interests of the Iraqi people, who must play a role in any such decisions as fully and as early as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A central role for the United Nations would confer real legitimacy on whatever interim arrangements are put in place in Iraq. It would also contribute to lessening political tensions in the Middle East region and to reducing the political instability that is so sadly but evidently there at this particular time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we had had qualified majority voting on the Iraq issue, neither the British nor the French policy would have obtained majority support. The solution is not to create a superstate, but for us to stick together in Europe in order to strengthen the UN.</p>
<p class="contents">If the UN decides that a dictator is to be disarmed, it must also have the power to implement the decision. The UN should have its own rapid reaction force, and the EU’s rapid reaction force should be made available to the UN. The right of veto in the UN Security Council must be limited so that the UN can also take action, even if a small minority is opposed to its doing so. Otherwise, superpowers will act independently and so create justifications for anyone being able to act off their own bat using military assaults and terror tactics. War criminals should be tracked down and brought before the International Criminal Court. Pressure should be exerted on all countries to accept the International Criminal Court and the UN Pact.</p>
<p class="contents">The lesson is that we must uphold the international rule of law if we do not wish to end up as victims of the laws of the jungle and of the strongest and ourselves become targets for new generations of terrorists. Only through the rule of law can terrorism and dictatorship be brought effectively to an end. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My fear is that, like all the others, this debate will reveal once again the irrelevance of our institutions; indeed, they proved to be irrelevant in the period leading up to military action and they are in danger of being so during the construction or reconstruction phase too.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, ladies and gentlemen, I do not know whether Europe will ever decide to match its words with actions and adopt a common policy, because it is simply not moving in that direction at all. It is not moving in that direction in that it was impossible to infer from Council’s statements what Europe as such intends to do. Did you hear anything in that line? I did not. With the exception of a few expressed hopes, which one would expect anyway, I could glean nothing else, and, quite frankly, I feel it is right that we admit it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner did say one important thing, however, with which I fully agree. It must be understood once and for all that there is a great need for humanitarian aid in Iraq, as there was before, but that we are not faced with a humanitarian disaster. We must realise this if nothing else, for there are other problems in Iraq which are much more difficult to resolve than a humanitarian emergency which the Commission is quite capable of managing. In this connection, if Europe ever finds the will to express a view and to adopt a policy, I agree with what Mr Barón Crespo said.</p>
<p class="contents">It is intolerable that there are no women present at any of the debates, conferences or meetings even on Iraq – just as they were absent from discussions on Afghanistan, Kosovo and East Timor – not even to serve coffee or interpret. This is not an Islamic country, it is not a question of tradition; it is a secular country where women, for better or worse – ‘Mrs Anthrax’ being a prime example – used to play leading roles. I do not know whether Europe will ever be called upon to give an opinion, but if, by chance, after the great debates, it should wish to say something, I would like it to remember this, so that we Radicals are not forced, as we were in the case of Afghanistan, to launch a worldwide campaign just to bring about the appointment of one or two women ministers, while everyone else completely ignored the issue.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today certainly, my colleagues and I salute what they and all the coalition forces did to ensure that Iraq could be free.</p>
<p class="contents">Throughout the debates that we have had on the Iraq crisis, I have made it clear that for us war was always a last resort. If only the nations of the world had united in a determined way, then Saddam, in my view, could have been dealt with without the need for war.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that the conflict is over, the emphasis is rightly on the stabilisation of Iraq, on the building of civil society, on creating the conditions for a democratic state that can live in peace with its neighbours and also on restoring the Iraqi economy in the interests of the Iraqi people. Of course there are great hurdles to overcome. That is not in dispute. However we should be in no doubt that only the removal of Saddam Hussein has made any of these things possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The second great task that can now be taken forward is progress towards a durable settlement between Israel and the Palestinians. The road map to peace sponsored by the Quartet offers a solid basis for a resolution of this most difficult of issues in the Middle East: the parties in the wider region, the blueprint for a lasting peace, a secure Israel whose right to exist is recognised by the Arab world, and a Palestinian state living side by side with Israel in harmony and peace.</p>
<p class="contents">There is much work to be done on both of these projects, but the opportunity is there now for a real and lasting peace to be forged in this vitally important region of the world. As for the wider world, the crisis has created real questions about the United Nations and its ability to implement its own declared intentions. NATO has suffered internal divisions of a kind never before experienced. The European Union has demonstrated that it is incapable of speaking with a single voice, whilst some Member States have shown more interest in creating a counterweight to the United States, than in building a genuine transatlantic partnership based on common values.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time for some straight talking. The actions of the gang of four at the Brussels summit last month clearly show the strategic error they are making in trying to divide the transatlantic alliance. Whatever soft words they say, this summit was a calculated attempt to foment division between Europe and the USA, and if we have learned anything from the events of recent months it is surely that Europe and America must stand together to deal with threats to our collective security. New structures and new military headquarters in competition with the United States would fracture an alliance that has served us well in Europe. I am glad that the majority of European nations understand this and have had the courage to say so.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, if Europe is serious about defence and security, it needs to provide the financial resources. New and divisive structures are not needed. What we need is increased capability. I hope that Europe has learned a lesson from this crisis. NATO and the transatlantic alliance must remain the bedrock of European defence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Acting without a UN mandate, the United States began a war of aggression in a flagrant breach of international law. To be precise, it was not the USA alone that initiated the war: a whole string of allies, some of whom acted openly, but others secretly, also joined together in the ‘coalition of the willing’, or perhaps we should say ‘coalition of the compliant’. In addition to the self-appointed occupying powers – the United States, United Kingdom and Poland – the ranks of the coalition of the willing also included such major military powers as Palau, the Marshall Islands, Micronesia and the Kingdom of Tonga.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of this war of aggression was, acting in accordance with the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions, to remove weapons of mass destruction from Iraq. There is no legal basis in international law for the attacking forces' additional objective of overthrowing the regime of the dictator Saddam Hussein, nor is there any such provision in the Charter of the United Nations. Nor do I believe that it should be the role of the international community to remove dictators throughout the world by means of warfare. It also leaves a rather unpleasant aftertaste to consider that Britain's Foreign Secretary Jack Straw was willing to send umpteen thousand British soldiers into Iraq to hunt down one dictator, while the same Jack Straw, when he was Britain's Home Secretary, decided to release another dictator, Augusto Pinochet, and thereby thus allow him to escape from the clutches of British justice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The USA's unilateral war against Iraq achieved its objective of removing Saddam Hussein's regime. However, the war also resulted in appalling collateral damage: the first immediate victim was the United Nations Organisation and international law, the second was the unity of the European Union and the Common Foreign and Security Policy, and the third was NATO, which also received its share of ideological cluster bombs. The new doctrine of preventive war, launched by the chief ideologist, Richard Perle, the Lord of Darkness, has also shaken the foundations of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the questions that remain to be answered, Mr President and Mr President-in-Office of the Council, are when this war will end and when the end of the war will be declared. So, firstly, what is the European Union doing to ensure that end to the war is declared? Secondly, where are the weapons of mass destruction on account of which the war was declared? If the Americans are not prepared to tell us what the position on weapons of mass destruction is, then we in Europe should at least tackle them and demand a statement.</p>

I spent 8 days in the south, reviewing the public health situation in my capacity as the World Health Organisation's Special Envoy. I listened to the people. I met with 50 tribal leaders, upwards of 20 000 Marsh Arabs, and I reviewed and inspected extensively hospitals and primary health clinics in Basra, Al-Amara and other smaller towns and villages. I re-opened the World Health Organisation Office and I set up a clinic now dealing with 15 000 medical consultations a month.</p>
<p class="contents">The people are relishing their freedom. Their joyfulness is tempered only by the continuation of the bitter legacy of Saddam. Their lives were malignly regulated down to the smallest detail. Saddam modelled his total control on Stalin, whom he emulated. The ordinary Iraqi family's purchase, even of one bar of soap, was politically directed and controlled. When sentenced to ear amputation, the prisoner had to seek out and pay the surgeon to perform the mutilation. The more money the prisoner was able to offer, the more ear the surgeon permitted to remain intact. A trade in human flesh, a cruel bargain with Saddam Hussein - for Saddam owned the Iraqi people's every movement from tear-sodden cradle to early and unquiet grave. These systems are still intact and throttling the Iraqi people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is early days. The coalition forces are doing fine work, particularly in the south and in delivering public health to the people of Iraq. The United Nations - especially the World Health Organisation - is now fully engaged and is using its specialist skills to excellent effect. However, the UN can only do so much in such a complex and difficult political situation. Patience is needed, as is the continuing security provided by the coalition forces, to give the Iraqi people the time and space they need to unravel the evil web Saddam wove so skilfully around them.</p>
<p class="contents">The task now is to help the people to enjoy their freedom and to entrench it constitutionally and politically for future generations.</p>

We MEPs who were in Baghdad and Basra witnessed this in particular. The inspectors there told us – as did Mr Blix in the United Nations – that there were no weapons of mass destruction. I do not know what we are surprised about. But we were not aware of the immense irresponsibility of the occupiers. Chaos and the law of the jungle reign in Iraq and the citizens lack protection. And I would draw attention to the fact that the majority of the future occupiers are members of the European Union: the United Kingdom, Poland, Italy, the Spanish State, while the European Union is absent.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, Mr President, it seems to me ludicrous that Mr Poettering is still saying that we cannot create a European Union in opposition to the United States. Quite the contrary: the United States – the extreme right governing there – is working against the European Union as a body with a presence in the world. We are witnessing an unacceptable situation which this Parliament must condemn on behalf of the citizens of Europe who demonstrated against it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we must call for the full restoration of United Nations law and we must point out once again that the ‘oil for food’ programme and the inspections are the sole responsibility of the United Nations. Otherwise, the established law will be broken, even with resolutions which the occupiers originally approved.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, I would like to say in particular today that I reject the position of the Spanish Prime Minister, Mr Aznar, who has become a servant of the extreme right currently governing the United States.

It is to be hoped that we will not have too long to wait for the fallen absolute ruler of Mesopotamia and his two sons to be arrested, if they are still alive. Precisely because of this Iraqi opposition circles are finally expecting clarification about the country’s arsenal of weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p class="contents">With these same newcomers to the Iraqi political stage we are seriously concerned about the continuing lack of public safety in the capital Baghdad. Saddam’s hand in this – his amnesty for almost 100 000 criminals just before the start of the military intervention by the Americans and the British – does not discharge the Americans in particular of their responsibility to provide for law and order in the administrative centre of the country. In this they can also count on the expertise and assistance of Iraq’s burgeoning democratic forces.</p>
<p class="contents">The huge task of reconstructing Iraq makes a substantial humanitarian contribution from the European Union equally welcome. The food stocks of Iraqi families are totally exhausted. A willingness to make sacrifices on our part will strengthen the transatlantic partnership. It will at the same time cultivate goodwill amongst the Iraqi civilian population.</p>

<p class="contents">Following 11 September, a relentless war was launched against Islamic terrorism by a coalition that consisted of almost the entire international community. Close cooperation, in particular between the United States and the countries of Europe, where the 11 September attack had been planned, began to produce results, with significant blows to the Al Qaeda network.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States replaced this clear and virtually uncontested strategic approach with a much more hazardous project by borrowing the old domino theory, popular in the communist world in the 1970s, and applying it to the export of the democratic model to the Arab-Muslim arena based on a new Iraq democratised by the US. As far as democracy is concerned, what we are currently seeing with the anarchy that has followed the dictatorship is that there are more and more calls for the establishment of Sharia law in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">If there were to be prolonged occupation, together with an ongoing general situation of insecurity, we would be facing a two-fold risk. Firstly, the ongoing military occupation of a country where the Shiite holy sites are located would give considerable fresh impetus to Islamic terrorism and, at a local level, the restoration of order would inevitably have to involve the network of Shiite mosques. Prolonging the current situation is therefore especially dangerous. It could compromise the vital resumption of a firm, global strategy to combat the multinationals of Islamic terrorism. The triple suicide bombing in Riyadh demonstrates that it is just as prevalent as always in spite of the military action in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to gather the international community together again around the urgent need to combat a form of terrorism that threatens us all, our immediate aim must not be to decide who to punish and who to reward, it is to prevent the situation in Iraq from deteriorating and ensuring that the military occupation is replaced as soon as possible with new Iraqi authorities who draw their legitimacy from the recognition accorded to them by the international community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the current situation in Iraq, I think we need to distinguish between what can and cannot wait. Re-establishing food supplies for people who have suffered under a long and cruel dictatorship and 12 years of embargo, Mr President, certainly cannot wait.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the provision of humanitarian aid, the European Commission and many Member States deserve to be thanked for their efforts. Notwithstanding the efforts of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular, I feel it is important to put things into perspective. I will therefore take the liberty of quoting some figures regarding this aid.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States is the principal donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq. Its contribution totals EUR 964 million. Great Britain is in second place with EUR 336 million and Japan is in third place with EUR 192 million. The figure for ECHO is EUR 100 million. Then there are the figures for other countries. Spain has donated EUR 60 million for humanitarian purposes, Australia, EUR 55 million, Canada and Germany EUR 50 million. I am sorry that Mr Wurtz is not present in the House as his country is contributing EUR 10 million in humanitarian aid, according to the figures of 13 May 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, there is clearly a need to re-establish supplies of drinking water and electricity in Iraq, along with health services. It is also clear that given the situation on the ground, the second priority has to be the formation of an interim Iraqi authority. Such an authority must be formed in a democratic manner and Iraqis must play a key role in the process. In my opinion, the authority also needs to be federal in nature. There is one great issue currently hanging in the balance. This is, or should be, the establishment of a multi-ethnic, multi-religious state, based on the principles of inclusion, representation and responsibility. This issue has come to the fore because the media has played up the religious reawakening in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest debates at the United Nations show that past disagreements have been overcome and that there is now space for everyone to adopt constructive attitudes. Mr President, I believe this is the line the European Union should take. We have to help promote stability in the region. We must act and we must use our ability to engage in dialogues with the countries of the region to the full. Lebanon now has an Association Agreement with the European Union. Syria is part of the Euro-Mediterranean Association. We are currently engaged in a critical dialogue with Iran and we should also pursue the objectives of the so-called road-map.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States, Mr President, has proposed an ambitious free trade agreement with the countries of the region. The European Union must use its ability to engage in dialogue to the full. We must work to ensure that the region is stable, peaceful, prosperous and democratic. Minister, the next informal meeting due to be held in Crete on 26 and 27 May should serve as a unique opportunity to develop the role the European Union must play in this difficult situation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the last few days we have seen a reminder of the nature of Saddam's regime with the discovery of yet another mass grave.</p>
<p class="contents">Too much of the debate has been about apportioning blame for what has happened in the past and too little of it has been about looking forward. Ensuring that Iraq is run by Iraqis for Iraqis should be an absolute priority. The wishes and needs of the Iraqi people should be paramount. It is for that reason that I welcome the draft UN Resolution, which addresses the immediate needs of the Iraqi people. It lifts sanctions: how many people in this Chamber have been calling for that over the last few years? It envisages a political process to put the country back into the hands of the Iraqis with the involvement of a UN special coordinator. It sets up a process to wind up the 'Oil for Food' programme while ensuring that oil can only be sold for the benefit of the Iraqi people and it creates a new fund for the reconstruction and humanitarian needs of Iraq which involves the IMF and the World Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">There are of course many problems to be dealt with. We cannot run reconstruction from the top down as if it were a military campaign. We cannot impose systems and procedures dreamed up in Washington and expect them to work. We have to have a bottom-up approach which involves the Iraqi people first and foremost. In order for that to happen, the establishment of security, effective policing and the rule of law should be given absolute priority. My concern is that American troops, unlike British troops, are not equipped for policing action and our priority therefore should be to get police into northern Iraq. We have already seen security established largely in southern Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">My final concern is that there has been no proper discussion on debt reconstruction in Iraq, nor even on who the debt belongs to. Until we resolve these issues there will be no long-term solution for Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does the reconstruction have to remain in the hands of the Americans with a supporting role for the UN or will it be a truly international enterprise? Bush and Blair of course are disinclined to give the members of the anti-war coalition a leading role and to allow them to benefit from juicy reconstruction contracts. But only the UN can end the sanctions and in particular open the door to substantial international contributions and judge with authority whether the new Iraqi Government is truly representative. It is very important that the oil revenues should benefit the Iraqi people rather than ending up in the pockets of the President’s Texan friends. Commissioner Nielson appears to share my fear in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Can he explain his statement that America is well on the way to becoming a member of OPEC? The European Union can and must make a humanitarian contribution, a very important one in fact: special attention to women and children, but also to the construction of a democratic constitutional state. If we keep arguing about the role of the EU and the UN, in the end there will only be one victim and that is the Iraqi people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I feel sorry for the European Parliament. We are living through one of the darkest days of the European Parliament. What shall we say to our citizens during the European elections in a year's time? What did we do doing the war? We did not pass a single decision, a single resolution. What did we do after the war? When we have cholera, when we have dozens dead, when we have the looting of Baghdad museum, when we have the looting of nuclear facilities, we do not pass a decision, we do not pass a resolution, because those who back the war do not want the European Parliament to pass a resolution and stand before European public opinion.

As Mr Sakellariou said, there is no justification in international law for the invasion and occupation of a country to change the regime in that country. It sets a very dangerous precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in relation to weapons of mass destruction, none have been found. That is clear. This was the justification, despite what some people were saying all along about the situation. It is essential that the weapons inspectors return to Iraq, for Hans Blix to be allowed back in. Let them verify whether or not weapons of mass destruction were there. As we all know, that is highly unlikely. It also means that the US, the UK and the others who supported them are pursuing a shoot-to-kill policy - i.e. we believe or suspect the Iraqis have weapons of mass destruction, therefore we go in, we shoot and kill the people and then afterwards we find out there was no justification for this action. This is a war crime in my eyes. I do not believe that there was any justification for what happened in Iraq. It is essential that the weapons inspectors be allowed back in.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the proposal mentioned by several speakers, this UK-, US- and Spanish-backed proposal for a UN resolution would put the administration of Iraq, including decisions on its oil reserves, into the hands of the invaders and occupying forces. This is blatant, modern-day colonialism and we should not allow it.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to Iraq itself, Iraq was one of the countries in the region with the most advanced education system, with education for all - male and female alike. Now that education system has been completely decimated. Some people today have mentioned women's rights within Iraq. One of the ways to ensure that women are liberated, have rights and know their rights, is through a proper education system. What will happen in relation to the education system in Iraq and how will it be reinstated? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The destabilisation, the aggression and the invasion of Iraq caused by the US-UK union – the only union which is at this minute still standing – no more sought to topple the Baath socialist regime than to destroy phantom weapons of mass destruction. Very simply, the aim was the wholesale destruction of Iraq in order to realise the ideological and industrial designs of the small gang of theorists with a portfolio who reign in Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">They really could not care less about peace in the Middle East or the Iraqi people, who they are deliberately – and I mean deliberately – plunging into anarchy, with its terrible trail of unspeakable violence and suffering. They play with people as one plays with marbles, and that is the way of empires, particularly this US empire. Europe has allowed its creation out of cowardice, by eradicating its only roots, its nations, in particular France, which is the only country to implement an independent global policy, and not because Europe is old but simply because, deprived of national vigour, it is politically dead.</p>
<p class="contents">It will therefore only be further hypocrisy to speak today in this ludicrous forum of rebuilding Iraq, when what is really on the agenda is destroying Iraq until not a stone remains standing, except, of course, for the derricks. The question is not how to rebuild, but to what extent we will destroy Iraq, humiliate the Arab people and heighten their anger to play into the hands of the ideologists who want at all costs to provoke a general war between civilisations, which will be a war against civilisations, beginning with what is left of our own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution submitted by the United States to the UN on Friday appears to reduce the Security Council’s involvement to a minor role, regulates the use of the oil reserves rigorously according to a preconceived order and, lastly, fails to set a term to the duration of the US and UK administration, which means it will probably remain in place for quite some time. Lastly, it is said that the interim administration will be managed by the occupying powers, together with the Iraqi people and a UN coordinator. The formula is generic and seems to confine the role of the UN chiefly to the coordination of humanitarian aid or not much more.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is sending a specific request for much greater involvement in the immediate term. Since the European Union is the closest entity in geopolitical terms, it would be truly absurd for it not to be involved in a process which is so important for the future of the region. Moreover, we cannot endorse the US strategy to create a link with the talks with Iran, intended to avert the danger of the large Shiite population having a destabilising effect. This ethno-religious situation must be evaluated with extreme care, but Europe cannot now stand by and do nothing in the face of the terrifying scenes heralded by the Al Qaeda’s resumption of its strategy of terror.</p>
<p class="contents">The stabilisation of Iraq, with measures to ensure religious peace between the different ethic elements, is clearly necessary in a region such as the Gulf where the insidious web of Islamic terrorism is so desperately strong and has penetrated so very deep. This attack, which is reminiscent of the attack in Chechnya, makes the challenge posed to the West by the international web of Islamic fanaticism a matter of great relevance once again. Therefore, over and above its differences with the United States over Iraq, Europe must shoulder all its responsibilities and combat organised terrorism, which, as has now been extensively proven, is finding a home even in the Member States of the European Union, in many mosques and Islamic centres, often funded by Saudi Arabia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a sign that we Europeans wish to shoulder responsibility for the post-war situation in Iraq and look forwards. That is why I think it is a good thing that we have avoided a resolution on the post-war situation in Iraq, because that would have meant us getting embroiled in a debate about guilt and expiation within the European Union, about our inconsistent positions towards the United States and the different roles we envisage for the United Nations. No one would benefit from that, least of all the Iraqis themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say at this point, however, that we do support a central role for the United Nations, for one simple reason: if you are administering a foreign country, you need to have legitimacy under international law. Iraq's chief administrator should therefore have a UN mandate. We must ensure that the money from the Oil-for-Food Programme is used for the benefit of the people of Iraq. All the economic and financial sanctions imposed against Iraq in 1990 should be lifted immediately. Now that Saddam Hussein's regime has been toppled, there can be no further reason to maintain those sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the debate about exactly what is meant by a central United Nations role in the reconstruction of Iraq as being a somewhat artificial one. In a country where civil order has broken down, and where the basic structures of a functioning administration still need to be set up, where the regime has left behind an appalling legacy of hardship and violence and the most basic things are lacking, it is essential to focus on humanitarian assistance and its coordination. This is an area where the European Union has a greater part to play, and I support the ECHO programme already under way.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in any case time that we avoided giving the impression that the United States alone is acting while the 15 Member States of the European Union are still talking, so that once the dust has settled after the Iraq war the European Union should primarily set itself the task of sorting out its relations with the United States. We will soon be welcoming Mr Kwasniewski, the President of Poland, who represents a state that acted alongside the USA in Iraq, but who will nevertheless be telling us that he is interested in a common foreign and security policy. Before we start casting doubt on these countries' European ideals – and those of Member States of the EU – it would be better if we considered viewing all those countries that were the United States' allies in military action as potential bridges between ourselves and Washington. Just as with the ‘Quartet’ in the Middle East, it is only credible for the EU to act in partnership with the US, not in opposition to it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That was also clear from most of the speeches today. Neither the Commissioner nor the Presidency, while condemning the terrorist attack in Riad, had so much as a word, even of disapproval, for the predatory, terrorist, criminal attack by the United States and Great Britain. It is a disgrace! On the contrary, even today they essentially wanted to legalise the crime by unashamedly acknowledging the responsibility of the occupying forces for keeping order and for reconstruction, obviously hoping that the European Union will be given a slice of the pie. It is a disgrace! Neither one nor the other stood up against the position of the United States on a preventive strike, leaving the way clear for the crime to be repeated. Besides, they all, including the European Union, agreed in Prague on the preventive strike. Once again, it is a disgrace, Mr President.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to us to roundly condemn the crime. To call for the immediate withdrawal of the occupying forces from Iraq and for the invaders to pay the cost of restoring the damage they caused. For the invaders and their Iraqi associates to be convicted as war criminals. The UN must decide even at this late stage on strict sanctions against the invaders and must supervise payment of the compensation. And finally, for the Iraqi people to be left free to take its fate in its own hands without conquerors. Consequently, the Iraqi people must organise and develop their national resistance. Only the defeat of the conquerors will bring peace and order. We owe them our solidarity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That has demonstrated to a ridiculous extent what virtually the entire international community condemned as the real driving force behind this unilateral aggression, as my colleagues in the Verts/ALE Group had already pointed out.</p>
<p class="contents">These measures, however, cannot be reduced to mere verbal condemnation. In the fact of this global hegemonic power, the credibility, and even the future, of the UN has received a dangerous blow and we cannot remain indifferent to this. It has had a knock-on effect on the political goals of our Community project too, on its attempt to unite the voices of Europe in both a spirit of consensus and international legitimacy. Twenty-four million souls are abandoned to their sorry fate, without even a guarantee that their daily needs will be met. This is indeed a very, very serious hour and a European initiative is urgently required. We cannot content ourselves with becoming a reconstruction agency, although that task is absolutely necessary and urgent. The jeopardising of a potential historic turning point in the international situation has now become more than just a slick, journalistic phrase. The threat is very real and seems to be being overlooked in this Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore up to this enlarged Parliament, including the observers from the new Member countries, to realise that the European Union must propose a more mature, more long-term alternative in light of the United States’ opportunistic and mercenary calculations. It is up to us to consider, for instance, the legalist voices, such as France, Germany and Belgium, and establish a common, united position. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, the UN must be restored to its place at the centre of the international negotiating mechanism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On 10 April, by a majority of three-quarters, Parliament adopted a resolution on the new European security and defence architecture, desirable at the end of this war. This very broad consensus does not come as a surprise as even the latest Eurobarometer polls indicate that 71% of EU citizens are currently in favour of the development of a common policy in this area. Moreover, this request is also coming from outside the Union, from the many parties who wish the European Union to play its part in managing the affairs of a world whose future must no longer rest solely on the shoulders of the President of the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be said that this long-awaited Europe does not yet exist, and it will not exist until the institutional reforms which are vital for its operation have been implemented. That is the inspiration behind Parliament’s proposals, although we are well aware of the limits to their scope. We are quite aware that it will ultimately be up to the Convention to recommend whether they be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">If three quarters of the Members of Parliament were prepared to take up such a clear and, in certain cases, courageous stance on this issue in a roll-call vote last month, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, it is because, thanks to the Iraqi crisis, they understood that it was essential to give their unreserved support to our colleagues currently working in the working groups on defence, chaired by Commissioner Barnier, and on foreign policy, chaired by Mr Dehaene.</p>
<p class="contents">Having learned the lessons of the Iraqi crisis and appalled by the cacophony that prevailed within the Union during the crisis, all those in favour of building a common house agree that tomorrow’s Europe of 25 members will take its rightful place in the international arena, which it has been unable to retain as a Europe of Fifteen. The main goal must be to enable Europe to speak with a single voice at last. If the Convention succeeds in this, it will be because it has been able to learn from the recent divisions, which I, like you, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, am convinced are more illusory than real. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was in contravention of international law and there was an alternative; I am surprised that so few Members remember that in May 2002 we agreed on an alternative course. It seems that many of us have a very short memory. However, let me peer into the future: the conscience of the world, and that includes the conscience and the views of the Polish Pope, has been assuaged by promises that the United Nations would be involved after the war and that the international community would come into its own then. The draft Security Council resolution is a farce and the British minister Clare Short has acted consistently by resigning.</p>
<p class="contents">Now let me look a little further into the future, and consider the Middle East peace process. In this case too we were told that the Iraq war would make it possible to set the peace process in train, but that nothing had yet been decided. So how do things look now? On the Palestinian side an important step has, thank goodness, been taken in response to pressure from the US and principally from Europe, with the appointment for the first time of a prime minister, Abu Mazen. We wish to give him our full support so that he can do what he has promised and what in my view he would really like to do – to fight violence and terrorism. But the reaction on the Israeli side, or to be precise on the part of Mr Sharon's Israeli government, is not exactly positive. If Mr Sharon refuses to welcome Mr Solana, then that is something the entire European Union should be protesting against. Just as Mr Sharon cannot claim, thank goodness, to speak for the whole of Israel, nor can Abu Mazen – unfortunately – claim at present to represent the whole of Palestine. Arafat is also a force in Palestine that we need to win over to this peace process, and that is why discussions with him are also both necessary and justified.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say, however, that I have heard relatively little from those people who claimed before the war that we would be on the ‘peace front’ after the war, working to achieve peace. I have in mind in particular Spain's Prime Minister Aznar. I am pleased to say that Mr Papandreou, on the other hand, is very active. I also hear a lot from Mr Solana, and I hope that everyone in this House and in Europe will now at least attempt to achieve progress in the peace process in Israel and Palestine, and to implement the road map, even if it leaves a lot to be desired. For there can no longer be any excuse nor the least justification for this war, if we cannot even get the peace process going.</p>

It should be borne in mind however that the war was not fought simply to end the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. The United States tolerates other dictatorships around the world. Wars are not fought about those. We Spaniards lived for over 20 years under a dictatorship directly supported by the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The stated aim of the war was the elimination of weapons of mass destruction. No such weapons have been found, however.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that a conference was held in the Azores prior to the war in Iraq. It was attended by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Prime Minister of Spain. The last group photograph before the attack on Iraq was taken there. Now the war is over, however, control of Iraq has not been divided between those who attended the Azores conference. It has been divided instead between the United States, the United Kingdom and Poland. Spain has been sidelined. Its involvement does not seem to be consistent with its government’s support for the war.</p>
<p class="contents">Much more than the Archaeological Museum has been destroyed in Iraq. There is a great deal of reconstruction work to be done. Let us hope too that the United Nations will once again become the guarantor of world order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this quite surrealistic debate, I should like, moreover, to draw attention to a most outstanding contribution by my fellow countryman and fellow MEP, Mr Andreasen from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, who is closely associated with the Danish Prime Minister. Normally, he speaks in Danish, which is a good idea. As a symbolic act, he gave his speech in English, however, and that of course brilliantly reflects his close relationship with the Danish Prime Minister, who belongs to the same political party as himself and is a close colleague of his. The Danish Prime Minister spent five days in Washington, and the press – the Danish world press, with which my fellow MEPs are probably unfamiliar – described how, during the concluding session, as the Prime Minister paid tribute to President Bush for his honourable conduct, the strains of Mendelsohn’s Wedding March from the famous play were suddenly heard. I should like, moreover, to emphasise – for my fellow MEPs may well not be aware of this – that Mr Andreasen, who gave the Prime Minister his unconditional endorsement, is certainly no slouch when it comes to irony.</p>
<p class="contents">The rhetoric on which the Danish Government’s endorsement of the United States is based is so absurd that only a major ironist could expose it, as my fellow MEP did so brilliantly, it being understood that what is so surreal about this debate is that the EU has no common foreign policy and that this Parliament would in any case have no influence over such a policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Nielson deserves special recognition for his visit to Baghdad to ensure that the EU’s humanitarian activity was getting under way quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">In the debate here today, I agree with Mr Titley that we have a tendency to ignore the fact that the population of Iraq has in actual fact been liberated from a tyrant. Baroness Nicholson, who has just returned from Iraq, testified to the joy felt by large portions of the population at having been liberated following decades of terror. I was among those who were opposed to the war, but I cannot refrain from expressing deep satisfaction at the fact that a people that has lived under oppression for so long is now being given the opportunity to build its own future. Everything depends of course upon how the reconstruction is organised.</p>
<p class="contents">The United States went into Iraq on the basis of arguments concerning Iraq’s alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction and links with Al Qaeda. It was emphasised very often that economic interests had nothing to do with the matter. Nonetheless, an organisation for reconstruction is now emerging that is under the total control of the Americans. The Bush administration has already distributed multi-billion dollar contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq to American companies. As I am well aware, having worked for the UN, tender procedures of this type normally go via the UN or the World Bank, and that is of course what should happen in this case too. Otherwise, there are no guarantees against arbitrariness in the tender procedure itself and in the way in which the income from Iraqi oil is used. Only a UN mandate can give legitimacy to the reconstruction of Iraq. That should of course be obvious, especially to us Europeans. The basis on which we ourselves are entitled to make agreements has been established precisely in order to create stability and predictability in relations between our states.</p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate that it is difficult precisely to define the EU’s role in the reconstruction until UN decisions have made matters clear. The difficulties also have to do, of course, with the division between the Member States before and during the war. I agree with what Mr Poettering said, namely that that there is more that unites our Member States than divides them. I am therefore disappointed that the EU has not succeeded in uniting around a proactive plan for how best to make use of our special experience of reconstruction. I read in Scandinavian newspapers that individual Member States, such as Denmark, are preparing to contribute to the long-term reconstruction. That is naturally commendable, but what would of course be more significant is for the EU, under the leadership of the Commission, to draw up such a plan. Time will not now permit me to define which tasks we are concerned with here, but, clearly, we are talking, above all, about efforts in the legal area and in the areas of education and of medical treatment and health care etc. I would therefore call upon both the Presidency and the Commission immediately to devise such a proposal so that the EU can regain a portion of its reputation and, above all, play that central role in international politics and in this region that the situation demands. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This vision, although legally tenable, is unlikely to get European foreign policy off to a good start again. We will not pick up the pieces and re-establish European unity as a future project by drawing a veil over the causes of the unilateral military operation and the manner in which it was planned and decided.</p>
<p class="contents">We must first expose the falsehood, which I would call the falsehood of the century, the claim that Iraq possesses weapons of mass destruction that could threaten global security. Not a single prohibited weapon has been found. It becomes clearer every day that the people of the world as well as the United Nations have been fooled by those who have wanted for a long time to find a pretext for war at all costs.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also condemn a second falsehood, which claims that the United Nations has failed and that, as a result, the reconstruction of Iraq and its oil – which some call the spoils of war – should be a matter for the victors. The United Nations has not failed. It has been brutally swept aside by those who did not succeed in achieving the qualified majority required by the Security Council. Although international law has been violated, there is now a chance to reestablish it. As far as the European Union is concerned, this means reestablishing the United Nations’ responsibility for crisis management in full. I therefore call on the Council and the Commission to reject the United States’ requests and to remain firm in their desire to entrust the UN, and the UN alone, with a central role in post-war Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first interesting element – a positive element for me – is the revision of the views expressed by the chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, Mr Poettering. The second interesting element is that certain people created a climate in favour of our thanking Mr Rumsfeld, who overturned Saddam, his old friend, because it looks like it means a pure revision of opinions. The third element is the effort and the positions to protect the cultural heritage of Iraq; this too is positive and I hope there will not be some people, in a few years' time, who maintain that the stolen exhibits are in various museums, just as the Acropolis marbles are in the British Museum, and that these antiquities or cultural monuments are better protected than they were in the countries in which they originated. In all events, today we face political premises. The only body that can resolve the problem and restore international relations where they need to be restored is the United Nations Organization. So, under these circumstances, the European Union and its members which are also members of the Security Council must make a contribution in this direction and the fact that the new resolution which is being discussed was again submitted jointly by certain members of the European Union and members of the Security Council is not a positive factor.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the experience and problems will lead us to more positive thoughts, will lead the leadership of Europe to more positive prospects. However, there have to be certain principles. What are they? The Middle East, the wider area, for a number of years recently, if we want to take a brief look at history, has been absolutely tormented by various regimes, one after the other, in a bad era, a colonial era. If certain powers continue to endeavour to give answers to the area with similar variations, be they sultans or maharajas or emirs or puppet political prime ministers, Europe must not allow it. We 25 came here with an understanding of democracy, freedom and rights. We did not come with the intention of reproducing nineteenth century premises with new forms and new compromises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The attack in Riyadh – which is already giving some people, not least in this House, a perverse, ill-concealed sense of satisfaction because they now feel justified in saying ‘We knew there was no point in attacking Iraq’ – is proof that the real war against terrorism is only just starting.</p>
<p class="contents">Now starts the phase of reconstructing the country, which has been destroyed and laid waste, and of mending the alliances compromised by the war. With the help of the 10 countries which we have just welcomed into our midst, the European Union must show that is capable of genuine unity.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, it is exciting to see that, after this war which some people still persist in describing as unnecessary, pamphlets, books and newspapers are being sold on the streets of Baghdad which would have led to a prison sentence and torture under Saddam Hussein – or, elsewhere, under Communism.</p>
<p class="contents">We will soon be listening to the President of Poland, Mr Kwasniewski, speaking in this House. He and I belong to different political wings, but he has shown himself to be a courageous leader, giving his country’s support for the intervention in Iraq, and this has earned him the criticism of those Heads of State and Government which made the wrong political decision and now find it hard to admit their error.</p>
<p class="contents">In his meeting with Mr Chirac and Mr Schröder last week, President Kwasniewski asked for Poland not to be forced to choose between Europe and the United States: it is possible to be the friend of both. We in Parliament must endeavour to be the friends of both as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is obvious from the debate here that we could in fact have constructed a resolution on a wide range of issues on which we agree. We would, of course, have had to leave aside a lot of the self-justification that we all tend to engage in on all sides. I oppose the war and I continue to oppose its outcome and the direction which Iraq is taking at the present time. However, we must seek to reconstruct confidence in a law-based world order. We cannot do that by seeking to justify ourselves in terms of our attitudes to the war. We have to do it by, in the first place, seeking to construct a unity in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to find a middle ground between those who see a need for a unipolar world and those who see the need for a multipolar world. There is no way out of this. The European Union has to address this issue. It could give a lead in trying to do this and I hope that when they meet next week the leaders of our groups will seek to put in place some mechanism to enable Parliament to address this matter. We cannot seriously ask the people to support us in the European elections next year and at the same time pretend we do not have a role and that we have nothing to say about the direction the world is going in. This is of the utmost importance. We are talking about war and peace. Life is still cheap in the Middle East and we will continue to count the cost of the recent war for a very long time.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to get to grips with our different world views. We need to get to grips with the United States and persuade them that a law-based world order is far better than a <span class="italic">Pax Americana</span>.

<p class="contents">Now that the war in Iraq has ended, the emphasis shifts to rebuilding and reconstruction. As well as the physical and political reconstruction of Iraq, we also have to rebuild relationships within the EU itself and our credibility in the field of common foreign and security policy, we have to repair the damage that has been inflicted on the UN and, last but not least, we have to rebuild the transatlantic relationship.</p>
<p class="contents">The attitude of the US in the post-war situation will provide the key as to whether or not we can achieve any or all of these. I value the transatlantic relationship. It is in the interest of both the EU and the United States that the present rift in our relationship be healed. However, it has to be said that it must be a genuine partnership of equals and not simply one in which the EU role is that of a junior partner and in which we are automatically expected to support US foreign policy without question and, if we disagree with aspects of it, are accused of being disloyal and anti-American.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been totally unacceptable is the reported anti-French hysteria, in particular that attributed to the Washington Government establishment. There needs to be a change in the attitude of the current US Administration if the transatlantic relationship is indeed to be restored.</p>
<p class="contents">Giving the United Nations the lead role in post-war Iraq, as EU leaders have requested, would be the clearest demonstration on the part of the United States that it values the transatlantic relationship and it genuinely wants to rebuild it. It should not be forgotten that the United Nations fulfilled a similar role in East Timor in 1999. This experience should now be put to good use in the interests of the people of Iraq. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately, these views have differed, but that is the way things are: the European Union is divided.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate therefore allows us all to reaffirm our principles. Mine have not changed. I wholly condemn Saddam Hussein’s regime, but I fear that the way in which the United States brought it down has created a situation which is, if not equally horrific, at least as unmanageable. I do not endorse wars that are decided upon unilaterally. I believe the role of international organisations must be reaffirmed, particularly the role of the UN, not only in approving the use of force but also in supervising reconstruction.</p>
<p class="contents">Reaffirming principles is a good start but it is not enough. Rebuilding after destroying is a duty, including for those who in no way participated in the destruction. Yet this is still not enough. We must also do everything in our power to understand why and how Europeans as well as Europeans and Americans have become so divided. We must do everything in our power to rebuild our union, not just around a table but in our minds too. This means that we must work flat out to agree on a vision of the world or, at least, to achieve converging visions on major problems such as transatlantic relations, the role and reforms of international organisations, the role of the law and of force, and so on. These are difficult subjects and are sometimes even taboo subjects.</p>
<p class="contents">These efforts to achieve mutual understanding and clarification of ideas by seeking consensus whenever possible, however, are utterly essential for us after the blow we have been dealt. It is absolutely vital to rebuild Iraq and to save human lives. Nonetheless, we must also rebuild, or rather build, a common vision of the world and our responsibilities in the world. The Greek Presidency has endeavoured to begin this work, but we have a long, long way to go. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that over the coming months we have a role to play in this Parliament, along with the Council and the Commission, to rebuild that relationship. When we recognise the great need there will be to rebuild Iraq, we must also recognise the tremendous need to rebuild the relationship between the European Union and the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to face up to the truth. The truth is that we have grown apart. Each of us has focused on different priorities and, in many ways, we have ceased to understand each other's concerns. After the attacks on the Twin Towers on that terrible day in 2001, the United States concentrated on terrorism: where the next attack was coming from, homeland security. In Europe we went on to bring in the euro and concentrate on enlargement. To some extent we have lost track of what we have been trying to do. We have both retreated to hurling insults at each other across the Atlantic. Now is the time for each of us, on both sides of the pond, to take a step back and allow things to calm down.</p>
<p class="contents">We must begin to rebuild that relationship. We have far too great a common bond. We share common values. We must not allow recent events to continue, or ferment or destroy us. Yes, it will take time and no doubt it will be difficult. There will always be disagreements between us and the United States. Let us hope that those disagreements, in the future, will only be in the WTO, over steel or on trade. Those are natural disagreements, which we can have. But let us begin a renewed, an improved, deeper relationship and one that will not crumble as the last one did. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An identity that can offer politics, logic and culture against the violence and the social and cultural barbarity being promoted by the new military doctrine of the United States. The European Union has a duty and an obligation to study in depth the new international situation being created by American expansionism and the untrustworthiness of the neo-conservative American leadership.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a duty to demand answers to questions which still remain open:</p>
<p class="contents">First, about the blatant violation of international law with an aggressive war; secondly, about the attempt to deceive public opinion about alleged weapons of mass destruction, which turned out to be the lie of the century; thirdly, about the barbaric looting of cultural treasures, and I hope that no museum will dare receive the stolen goods; fourthly, about the annihilation of hundreds of civilians, about the destruction of infrastructures, about the bombing of television stations and the murder of journalists and, last but not least, about the war unleashed by the United States against the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, the collapse of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein cannot be used to whitewash the Americans and their allies. Finally, I should like to stress that the worthy women of Iraq can make a decisive contribution to the ending of the chaos in post-war Iraq, to the reconstruction of the country and to the future democratic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency and the Commission must demand the immediate application of unanimous UN resolution 1325 calling for increased participation and representation of women in all decision-making centres at all levels. And finally, we hope that on 21 June the European Union will exert its influence so that decisions are taken that will implement the road map, so that a fair solution can at last be found to the question of the Middle East and a climate of trust can be restored with the Arab world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Would you not agree that the disloyalty shown by Mr Aznar is reprehensible? There is abundant proof that Mr Aznar worked actively against the letter of the Council agreement of 17 February. Clearly, he acted disloyally with regard to the common position he was bound by. He acted disloyally in supporting a unilateral, immoral and illegal attack. What can the European loyalty and mutual solidarity we committed ourselves to in the Treaties mean to Mr Aznar? Where was his loyal cooperation? Do you not agree that such disloyalty is reprehensible?</p>

<p class="contents">We have to deal with three issues that are closely bound up with each other. The main issue, I think, is what we are doing in Iraq immediately, what we are doing in Iraq in relation to the problems that have arisen, with the misery, with the people, with the need to restore normalcy, to combat the phenomena tormenting the people over there. I think that, at this stage of the debate, this is much more important than debating internal divisions and a series of other issues which are of course important, but which are not as pressing or urgent as the situation in Iraq. I think that the European Union, to judge by appearances, has answers to this. It has both practical answers – humanitarian aid, support for cultural issues, support and pressure to find a peace process in the Middle East – and political answers to a series of issues which I shall not repeat, because it is important that the European Union has come out, has supported these principles, has made the efforts it has made during all these months for a different position to be heard on a series of such issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, of course, is what happens with the international system, with the role of the UN, where this war in Iraq has got us in terms of weapons of mass destruction. There are important gaps here which need answers. In fact, the European Union does, I think, have a position here and you here, today, raised a series of issues and it is important that they be raised and answered.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point, the major issue to come out of this entire crisis is the need for a common foreign policy, a common policy on security and defence issues. I think that, within all these procedures, a new momentum has started up in the European Union, from which we need to learn lessons and see what we can do.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, to close by commenting that many who speak of the need for a common foreign policy or common security or defence policy consider that what must of necessity emerge from these procedures are decisions or positions which correspond absolutely to their creed and their positions. This is precisely the problem we have in developing a common foreign policy. This policy will prosper, will become a reality only once we realise that we need to broker compromises between us, understand the positions developed by all of us and find those elements that can unite us, that can act as a common denominator, and not those elements on which we have differences. It was this approach, moreover, that allowed us, I believe, over the last two or three months, to take certain steps in this direction, steps which were welcomed both by public opinion and by you here, by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This discussion in Parliament has shown that the European Parliament is a source of constructive ideas in the EU and a lot of inspiration can be drawn from what has been said this morning. A lot of inspiration is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark is specifically to Mr Titley, who raised the issue of Iraq's debt. This is a core element in clearing the ground so that we can move forward. Success depends on focussing on the issue of handling and clarifying Iraq's debt. To do this an honest broker is needed. It is not conceivable that the occupying power would ever be seen as that. This is one very good illustration, relating to a very practical and crucial point, of the need to have the UN playing exactly that role of honest broker.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to ask all creditors to come forward to present their case. We can use the IMF and the World Bank as the treasurer of this operation, and use the UN as the honest broker. Anything else will not work, but instead create suspicion.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Andreasen, who expressed a strong hope that the UN will have a real role, I would say, please spend the minutes it takes to read the draft resolution now on the table at the Security Council. Having done so, please talk to your Prime Minister. This is what must be done to bring that hope into what looks a little like political talk.</p>
<p class="contents">On the big, broader issue of the role of the Commission and reconstruction, it is not enough for Member States to say that they want the Commission to do something in this area. If we do not organise the basic political conditions properly, it will be difficult for the Commission to play a meaningful, effective role. The reality here is that we are still in a phase where the basic, real, political issues must be addressed first.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, many Members have correctly pointed out that the big problem is the ability to agree a position in Europe. I agree that a qualified majority vote is better than disqualified unanimity. People will say that is not a guarantee that Europe will have one single standpoint. No, but Europe will have a standpoint and that is the one which will have authority. There might be disagreement after a vote, yes, but Europe will have a standpoint. The dynamics of everyone in the Union knowing that a standpoint can emerge after a discussion is a very pedagogical instrument, which will discipline politics in regard to how things are being discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a world of difference between qualified majority and disqualified unanimity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This was my way of condensing the analysis, linguistically speaking, in order to express the concern that if the resolution before the Security Council does not give the United Nations a real role, and if it is adopted, then the occupying powers will<span class="italic"> de facto</span> be the ones to decide on the oil in Iraq. That is self-evident, and is not adding anything of substance to this discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">The ending of all sanctions would also normalise Iraq's situation as a large oil producing and exporting country. It was a member of OPEC.</p>
<p class="contents">In putting it the way I did, I was trying to clarify the discussion. I think, to some extent, I have drawn attention to the reality of who would be in power if the United Nations is not given an authoritative role.</p>

<p class="contents">Indeed, there is no doubt that the period now beginning in Iraq is going to be very dangerous, almost as dangerous as the war itself, although in a different way, and that a highly operational authority that can take firm, quick decisions will be required to manage it. In the light of the experience before the war, it is hard to imagine the UN in this role.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the UN, although not embodying ‘a universal conscience transcending states’, as claimed by Dominique de Villepin (on what basis?), represents a broad range of countries that could be useful in stabilising Iraq. The UN and the European Union should therefore use their influence to help the coalition forces to restore order in the country, quickly establish a credible government and provide humanitarian aid in the form of food, water, electricity and hospitals, which the Iraqis so desperately need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
