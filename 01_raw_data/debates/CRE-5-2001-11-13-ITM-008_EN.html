<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Meijer (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, many private companies have withdrawn from public transport since it became permanently loss-making as a result of the large-scale distribution of the car. Public transport is necessary for access, the environment and for reducing the pressure on public space and cannot survive without extensive government funding. Like education and welfare provisions, public transport is more a core task of the government than it is part of the market. Unfortunately, this Regulation has been preceded for some years now by a rumour in a number of Member States that the EU is committed to privatisation and competition.</p>
<p class="contents">When I was appointed rapporteur a year ago, I was put under pressure to have the report ready for first reading in the first half of 2001 during the Swedish Presidency of the Council. Had I succumbed to that pressure, it would have been impossible to have more than one hundred investigative interviews with organisations, including national associations of municipalities, trade unions and different types of transport companies. I gleaned very opposing interests and views from these conversations.</p>
<p class="contents">Public transport is regulated very differently in each Member State and in each of its regions. Much community funding has gone into buying up old private companies that failed to offer adequate public transport, particularly in densely populated urban areas and for rail connections. This is in contrast to many small bus companies operating a few bus services in thinly populated areas that have now been bought by large, fast-growing bus companies operating in different States. If the European Commission is of the opinion that the award of contracts for transport areas to such companies should not be based on nepotism or judicial verdicts but rather, on objective standards and openness, then this Parliament shares this point of view, and so does the rapporteur. In this way, the Commission helps those areas where the municipal or regional governments would like to contract out their public transport apply useful rules so as to be able to choose between a few large companies, such Arriva, Vivendi or Deutsche Bahn.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, the Commission proposal applies the same obligation to contract out to areas which, based on practical experience, prefer the sustainable existence of one of the country’s own public companies or the continuation of a long-term contract with a small, private company. Precisely this restriction of freedom of choice makes the Commission proposal extremely controversial. It particularly affects countries such as Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Germany and Austria. But also in the Netherlands, which led the way in privatisation and liberalisation, the disadvantages of a disorganised rail company and of delayed growth in public transport in densely populated areas are now emerging.</p>
<p class="contents">The rule that applies to every government is that it is appreciated by the people if it helps solve problems and maligned if it creates unnecessary problems. European legislation can be useful if it makes a vital contribution to solving our joint and cross-border problems. Far-reaching, centralistic intervention in municipal and regional policy certainly forms no part of this. No one will be satisfied if such intervention soon appears to result in fewer public services, higher consumer prices, worse working conditions, fewer new tram lines, the termination of free urban transport, the supremacy of a monopoly and the erosion of democratic participation. The compulsory introduction of competition in this case does not mean the emergence of an ordinary market; instead it means promoting a battle for securing government subsidies for permanently loss-making businesses that want to take over government tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">According to many experts, the introduction of an obligation to tender for passenger transport by rail, road and inland waterways goes beyond the powers of the European Union. On account of this obligation, the importance of providing public services and the well being of the user are being subordinated to attempts to cut down on labour costs. If this proposal for a regulation were to be accepted unamended, it would spell doom for small companies, including virtually all public companies. Although the municipal tram company or the local bus company can also take part in the tender, these companies will go under as soon as they lose the tender at some point in the future. Only large, cash-rich companies with many diverse transport areas can survive such a system in a sustainable manner. It is exactly this crucial aspect of the tender obligation pertaining to all public transport that attracts criticism. On 10 October, it appeared that the majority of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism had accepted the gist of what I had proposed or what Mr Piecyk and others had developed by way of alternatives on the back of my proposal. Tram, underground and short bus services remain outside the obligation, while employment and the environment are better protected. If the plenary follows the same line of thinking, we could save ourselves a great deal of upheaval and bother. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Committee on Legal Affairs considered that the key elements of the proposals were sound, but differed in its opinion on a number of key issues. Firstly, some of the amendments proposed gave exemptions to what are known as integrated transport systems, yet we all know that transport, and particularly integrated transport, is a matter of organisation and not ownership. This would merely be protectionism by the back door.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there was concern that some of the proposals would allow for predatory bidding by exempted sectors for those parts of the transport industry which, in the case of my own country for example, are already liberalised. Thirdly, the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> provisions failed to meet realistic levels to allow competition to take place in the open market. Finally, there was concern that the level of public subsidy taken into account in drawing up contracts would not allow the continuation of socially needed routes nor provide adequate recognition of contribution towards fares, for example for the less fortunate, such as the elderly or disabled.</p>
<p class="contents">The report which finally emerged goes some way to addressing these issues. However, I fear that some of the amendments included in the final report would also introduce extraneous non-commercial considerations into what should be a completely open and transparent competitive system within the EU. For example, the issues already mentioned relating to environment and social policy are not in themselves relevant to the contract tendering process but should be dealt with under separate legislation. That is why I draw your attention to these matters and why this report should be seen as merely the first step towards the liberalisation of the market in this sector and not as an end in itself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In a series of amendments which were passed on to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Commission was careful to extend the length of contracts, for which operators apply in response to calls for tender.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also tabled a number of amendments to increase the content of management contracts set out in the Commission regulation, particularly under the social chapter.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs supports the idea that we must ensure that the objectives of sustainable transport are taken into consideration in the management contracts and this is duly taken into account by the competent authorities, particularly with regard to the integration and interoperability between bus transport, which is precisely the subject of our debate, and other types of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the Committee regrets that this proposal for a regulation was presented before a discussion could be held. With regard to rail issues, the second railway package and also services of general interest, which we discussed this morning, it would clearly have been more logical to first adopt a framework directive on services of general interest before having to discuss the same services of general interest on a sector-by-sector, directive-by-directive basis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must, though, say on this point that I cannot go along with broad areas of your proposal. There is, in principle, nothing new about what we are discussing today.</p>
<p class="contents">When, in the summer of 2000, the regulation at last emerged from the Commission, reached Parliament, and then the first discussions were held with trade unions and the representatives of local transport bodies and voluntary organisations, everything was clear: There was to be controlled competition. This had been the aim for years, and now we only had to deal with the questions of how long future contracts should run for and when the regulation was to enter into force, in other words, when would the first tenders actually be invited and the first contracts awarded? There was the additional question of what exceptions there should be to the obligation to put contracts out to tender. All that had its part to play, as did the recurrently raised issue of social dumping, that is, the danger that tenders would lead to the employment of especially cheap labour.</p>
<p class="contents">We came to a consensus. We wanted controlled competition without privatisation. The two are always confused with one another. Privatisation is not automatically connected with it. All that is involved is that local transport bodies no longer automatically come into the enjoyment of substantial subsidies from regional, national or local funds without having to compete for them, but contracts will now have to be put out to tender. We all know that local transport bodies, who know this themselves, basically offer their product at too high a price. The cause of this is to be found in the fact that it is in the public sector that trade unions have always been very successful in pay negotiations in recent decades. It is a truism, to give just one example, that the personnel costs of private bus companies are some 35-40% lower than in the public sector. Competition also opens up the possibility of us being in a position, in the future, to buy in transport services more cheaply, without a local authority being able to evade its responsibilities in the process. It is not the case that they are being privatised. There will continue to be a State office with responsibility for ensuring that public transport carries on. I can see the opportunity of using the resources saved by buying-in transport at more favourable rates to buy in more transport in the future, thereby making short-distance transport more attractive and achieving all that was said at the outset, namely making transport so attractive, that more people will use it in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me say that, following these lengthy preliminaries, I think there has almost been a catastrophe, because Mr Meijer was evidently unsure which way he should go, and proposed that, in future, the responsible bodies, whether the regional or local government, should be entitled to decide whether or not to invite tenders. I forecast that if this right to choose, which is to be introduced into the bill by means of Amendment No 61 and Article 7a, becomes reality, there will be no competition, because pressure from the transport companies, trade unions, and associations will be so great as to be irresistible, and contracts will continue to be awarded automatically.</p>
<p class="contents">Though we can disagree about many details, I therefore beg you, ladies and gentlemen, to seriously reconsider your decision tomorrow and not to vote in favour of Amendment No 61, so that contracts will continue to have to be put out to tender, exceptions being made for rural areas where only small sums are involved, but let us march in the same direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What is true is that we need a European legal framework for public local transport, as there is legal uncertainty and the market has already been opened up. The question is, though, how closely to the citizens Europe's decisions must be taken on a given subject. Local public transport is, in my view, primarily the responsibility of local authorities and that is how it should stay. Towns and parishes should themselves decide whether they want to run their local public transport by their own enterprise, and then whether they are able to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also clear that those who say they are going to do it themselves must not be allowed to compete elsewhere. I wish to thank Mr Meijer, the rapporteur, for pursuing this basic idea with, if I may say so, a certain stubbornness, as this issue of community decision-making is an important point.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that where there is competition in local public transport provision, it can lead to minimal wages and social dumping. My dear Mr Schmitt, a bus driver working on regular services does not earn a fortune – barely DM 200 above the social security rate in Germany. It is for that reason that social minima must be maintained when there is a change of operator.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that local public transport is run in many Member States' rural areas by small and medium-sized enterprises. These must not be unnecessarily squeezed out of the market, quite the contrary. I believe they must also have a chance in the market when routes or networks are awarded directly. The situation prevails in any case, in many areas of Germany, that up to 90% of local public transport is to and from schools, and here too, the direct awarding of contracts must be given more of a chance. I think we can agree that the Commission's time limits for contracts and handing-over are both too short, and we strove together for their extension. As regards the other things, our opinions simply differ and, unlike Mr Schmitt, I believe that tomorrow will not see a catastrophe, but that we will be very close to the communities in deciding in their favour on public local transport.</p>

The interests of passengers must be borne in mind in the development of public transport. It must be made into such an attractive alternative that more and more people will be happy to opt for public transportation. This is highlighted particularly in towns where it is necessary to find ways of solving environmental problems and the difficulties caused by traffic jams.</p>
<p class="contents">Signing agreements when organising public transport services is the correct procedure in cases where such agreements enjoy public subsidy. With a combination of open and controlled competition it is possible to achieve a higher degree of efficacy and a better level of service. Competition is also really needed in this industry. There should be some room for flexibility in the application to enable Member States to retain any proven procedures that they have applied previously. In my own home country such successful solutions include the fixed route transport licensing system and the town and district ticket systems. This is corroborated by an amendment relating to Article 3, item c. The aim of this is to prevent the formation of local and regional monopolies and to enable competition as far as possible. Another objective is to safeguard public transport systems that function well in countries with sparse populations where distances are great.</p>
<p class="contents">Arguments relating to transport safety and to minimising the number of accidents are also in favour of the public transport option. For these objectives to be achieved, legislative flexibility is called for. It should be possible to opt for solutions that are best suited to various conditions and to each operating environment. Such solutions should be practically oriented and they should be implemented in cooperation with local and regional operators. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Some in this House may well welcome this, but I consider it a fundamental error.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the objectives of transport policy that local public transport must primarily serve. It is also a European issue, how can the local public transport service improve the mobility of all citizens, including those who, not being car-owners, have no alternative to it, schoolchildren, large families, pensioners, disabled people, people on limited incomes? Ensuring sustainable basic mobility in accordance with town and country planning is therefore the prime objective for local public transport. Specific local situations mean that this can be achieved in a wide variety of ways. So, to this day, I cannot understand why the Commission chose to do this by means of a regulation without considering the possibilities afforded by a directive, as this is a typical case where the subsidiarity principle applies.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wonder how it is that the Commission is also choosing the form of the regulation, at the same time as bringing out the White Paper on European governance. According to this White Paper, it wants to reinforce local autonomy, and here it is interfering. Hence the question as to how such a regulation can make real the principle of reinforced local autonomy in European governance?</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally return to the offering of contracts for tender. Of course contracts must be put out to tender. But the process must highlight firstly transport policy, secondly environmental policy and thirdly social policy, which should lead to optimised mobility for our electorate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This fundamental citizens' right was formerly predominantly guaranteed by local public services and their agents. As local public transport is mainly unprofitable, services are subsidised by the local authorities, which of course makes the local transport market interesting for private-sector service providers. The public local transport market in Germany alone is valued at some DM 30 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of the internal market and the rise of international companies offering public transport services has led to a conflict between the previous practice of awarding transport concessions directly to local service providers on the one hand, and the international firms on the other. The Commission has therefore proposed to give competitive rules the edge over public interest and to create a new and binding obligation to put contracts out to tender. The rapporteur is, in my view quite right to question this procedure. He would give local authorities the right to decide for themselves how contracts are to be awarded. That is democracy; that is the subsidiarity principle. There must be no interference by the European Union in the conditions applied at local and regional level. I see this as a fundamental issue, as it is evidence of real subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I appeal to my fellow Members of this House, although I know that there is little point in doing so, to support this position. We had many meetings and discussions with local, regional, national and international operating companies and interest groups, so of course highly detailed proposals were the result. Now, you do not have to agree with all these suggestions, but the basic line taken by the Meijer report corresponds to the demands of local public transport as seen by local authorities and operators, does not, contrary to what you said, Mr Schmitt, exclude the possibility of introducing competition, and safeguards local and regional transport services accessible to all and which citizens can afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also support most of the amendments that he has tabled. However, on the deceptive pretext of seeking to make financial compensation from Member States to service providers compatible with Community legislation and to award public service transport contracts that are already open to private service providers, the Commission is once again attempting to work well outside its area of competence. By encroaching on the Member States’ methods of public management, the Commission is making a direct attack on local authorities’ freedom of management, and it must be said that, in doing so, it is denouncing the direct rule method of management used in France, which has proved its worth for many years. This shows that the aim is not to achieve better service for the benefit of the user, but to actually create, using liberal dogma, the internal market. In other sectors, such as telecommunications, energy and the postal services, it is freedom of choice that is at stake and, therefore, the very concept of public service.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the attack on the constitutional principle of freedom of administrative choice for local authorities, this is, more broadly speaking, an attack on the public sovereignty of Member States. Freedom of choice in public services and in its method of management, freedom of choice in terms of provider, partial freedom in sub-contracting, freedom to set prices and freedom of compensation are freedoms of Member States and their local authorities that have been withdrawn. Beyond the State, it is the citizen/user who will be slain on the altar of Community liberalism, because this proposal is a direct attack on local authority, which is the closest to the citizen and therefore is in the best position to manage the difficulties experienced by citizens on the ground. They already have the least power, in the less affluent areas which are even at risk of having no services at all. The social partners made no mistake, when they warned their MEPs at the vote in the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. This illustrates perfectly the danger that everyone has spotted, and we are not dealing with subsidiarity that has been reintroduced here and there, or the odd possibility of derogating from the procedure that has been put in place, which should be enough to stop us seeing the truth. The citizen will see through this.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I have reason to doubt this European project that, faced with ignorance and, at times, the distrust of our citizens, responds in a technocratic and dogmatic fashion by trying to wrestle power from the States and from local authorities, which efficiently manage the daily lives of citizens. We cannot accept these proposals and that is why we demand this report is rejected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all want the best possible local public transport at the lowest cost to taxpayers and passengers. That is our common objective. We now have to deal with the question of how best to go in that direction. If your proposal is propaganda from the left of this House for the right of communities and regions to exercise free choice, then I can only say that the past fourteen years have demonstrated that free choice is to the citizens' disadvantage. What, then, is the position? In most towns and communities, services by the communities are being reduced and the subsidies are on the up and up. So the reality is that we cannot carry on with the present system if we want a good, efficient, public transport service at local and regional level. So we say we must put them out to tender, so that citizens get the best modern buses at the best price, with the best quality, and arriving as often as possible. That is the objective we have set.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell the gentleman from the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities that, secondly, there is the Community Treaty, the Treaty on the European Community, in which it is stated that everyone shall have the right to provide services. Freedom of services can be restricted only on the basis of a greater good. The free will of a village community is not sufficient to say that one should limit the freedom of services under Community law in village A or village B. You need carefully-controlled legislation to be able to limit the freedom of services by reason of a higher good. That is what we are doing. If, though, you give communities back their free choice, you are suspending the justification for limiting the freedom of services, so, no matter what we agree on, be it journey times or whatever else, we need a proper framework for a controlled competitive order, and the free choice you propose undermines that, as we need sensible Community regulations to limit the freedom of services.</p>

<p class="contents">I feel that it is infinitely less legitimate to seek to withdraw a method of management and to introduce competition within the field of transport and to use case law to extend this to all the other fields in the future, through a regulation which is not transposed by the national parliaments. I have several reasons for this view.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that the private sector has not always performed better and I urge my fellow Members to come and see what is happening in France, in the water industry, which has been largely opened up to the private sector. Cartels have sprung up, which are no longer controlled by the local authorities and which currently supply water at higher prices than the local authorities, which remain under direct management. On the other hand, we must not consider direct management to be a better method, but simply that the two methods of management must co-exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, this goes against the principle of subsidiarity. If subsidiarity means anything at all, then it most certainly means the freedom of administrative choice of local authoridies and the constitutional provisions of most Member States, under which decentralisation now gives freedom of choice to the mayors, regional leaders and heads of local authorities. There is therefore a genuine political problem posed by this regulation. I do not think anyone can deny this.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, we must also be very clear on this question. Whenever a mayor chooses direct management, he cannot turn to external markets. Who knows of a school bus service, in a rural area, managed by the local authority, that has to rely upon external markets? This is not a problem that exists in reality. On the other hand, whenever public services are delegated or an exclusive choice is made by a business, which is, itself, competitive, this company can turn to the external markets. That is why I believe that we must impose the principle of reciprocity. In any case, however, we cannot give up direct rule as a method of management. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But it is open to legal and political challenge to simply cite democratic decision-making as a justification for exemption from EU legal rules for the internal market. I therefore commend the specific amendments from the ELDR Group – Amendments Nos 110 to 112. These would mean that authorities would be justified in not tendering metro and tram services if there were good reasons of cost, safety or risk of creating a permanent private monopoly rather than competition. Any claim for exemption would have to be justified to the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there are provisions for direct award of contracts in the absence of tenders or in emergencies. I appeal in particular to the left of this House. You take a big risk if you rely only on Amendments Nos 61 and 62. They may not survive the course and as an insurance policy we need specific provisions to protect large complex metro systems like London's from being split up for tendering or risking becoming a private monopoly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Too little, too late, not really consistent, those are only some of the features criticised as being characteristic of European Union policy to date and justifications for criticising it. The present Commission is investing a lot of commitment in attempting to counteract this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a regulation on local public transport belongs to the legislative package with which some past errors are, admittedly belatedly, to be repaired. Some of the internal market philosophy is also to acquire significance in the transport sector. Controlled competition, not total liberalisation and certainly not privatisation at any cost, was said to be on the way. One unfortunately has to say 'was' as what the competent Parliamentary Committee has produced as a compromise signals a return to the old and unsatisfactory situation.</p>
<p class="contents">In order that there may be no misunderstanding between us, let me say that there is consensus on all the points concerned with the quality of the transport offered to the consumer, consensus also on demands for high standards of safety, social provision and environmental protection. All that, though, can be, and is to be, required and put into effect by the conditions on the offering of contracts for tender. So we do not need the continuation of monopolies and quasi-monopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I will say something about subsidiarity. It is no help to local autonomy to declare local public transport to be a <span class="italic">res extra commertium</span>, whose watchword is that everyone is to do what they like in the way they like. It is, unfortunately, no help to the citizens either, for it is they who, at the end of the day, have to pay for all that twice over, as consumers and as taxpayers. So, then, controlled competition and high standards for local public transport as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this vote, I am therefore going to support the basic ideas behind the committee’s proposal, which I believe points in the direction of better public transport.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I oppose many of the simplistic statements made about tendering. Our experience from Sweden shows that tendering can be very good. Account can be taken of the environment and of social considerations, safety regulations can be established and a good relationship can be enjoyed with the social partners. As a prerequisite, politicians must have responsibility for the tendering and establish these criteria openly. That is possible, as is shown by experience from Sweden. We should be able to get rid of many of the simplistic statements about tendering.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, I am prepared to support the basic idea that regions and administrative districts should have freedom of choice. I also believe that it will, in practice, emerge that tendering can be used because it saves money that can be used for other purposes within the framework of public expenditure.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say that I do not believe that the rule of reciprocity referred to in the committee’s report should operate at European level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, this liberalisation process should not be forced. It must be carried out in stages.

<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say that it should also be made clear that it certainly cannot be the intention to replace the government monopoly by a private monopoly.

<p class="contents">I would like at this point to again make clear that, for us, it really is not about opening up local transport in such a way that it inevitably ends up in private hands. Nor is it about local transport remaining in public hands unconditionally, and that is the subtle distinction that we want to make clear now.</p>
<p class="contents">National, regional and also local government are to be obliged to put local transport out to tender, a process to which conditions must be attached, conditions which we have clearly described in numerous proposed amendments. For us, it is about safety. It is also about certain exceptions, small markets in rural areas, for example. We, of course, view these exceptions with sympathy, as we do the special aspects associated with rail transport. As has just been said, though, our misgiving cannot be dispelled that many are more interested in the service provider than in the service itself, for the word 'voter' was just used rather than 'citizen', something that we find symptomatic of the whole discussion we have been having.</p>
<p class="contents">We have brought in numerous amendments and can, I believe, say quite unambiguously that these amendments prevent social dumping and also guarantee social security, safety in general, and, I believe, can give local transport a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">One final observation, with which I know the Commission has difficulty. Protected markets make it impossible, in our view, for businesses profiting from them to take part in tendering processes in other markets without, at least, some problematic aspects being created. As we see it, that is, and cannot be other than, unfair competition, which must be combated by all means available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is difficult to understand that competition is seen as the only way to achieve this goal. Competition is a good servant but a poor master, and one should always consider separately in each individual case whether competition is the only way to increase cost-effectiveness and to improve services and make them more efficient. Just like Mr Meijer who presented the report stated earlier, many municipalities, unfortunately, have already anticipated the EU’s forthcoming resolutions and allowed for competition in this field, and not always with very good consequences. In addition, I am of the opinion that the proven methods that various Member States have used in the past in connection with public transport should be taken into consideration in this context: it must be possible to retain the licensing procedure that has been found to be so good and cost-effective in Finland. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For we are not going to get away from the fact, as we see at this very moment in the case of an airline, that even in local public transport, profitability is making an entrance. We cannot therefore have the situation in which – I am involved in local politics myself – year after year, questions about the losses sustained by local public transport are simply shrugged off without further ado and with the taxpayer being left to foot the bill, without the money actually being able to be invested in making local public transport more attractive.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to ask ourselves: why was local public transport created? It was not created in order to employ as many bus drivers as possible; on the contrary, it was created so that attractive facilities can be offered in rural and more densely populated areas to ensure the mobility of all. That is the task that is incumbent on local public transport. I think that Mr Grosch's point that we need a level playing field in a European single market is decisive. We cannot have the situation in which we introduce freedom of choice that makes it possible for certain districts, because they are under financial pressure or because they want to invest their taxpayers' money properly, to invite tenders, and then these are submitted by firms from protected monopolies. It is therefore so important that this Amendment be voted down tomorrow, so that there may be a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has laid down very tight deadlines for the duration of licences and for transitional regulations. I think we, as a committee, reached a fair compromise between the various interested parties. I would, in fact, like us to make a start on introducing time limits and licensing systems throughout Europe. Commissioner, we will be able to talk about this at future stages, in order to make it even more competition-friendly.</p>

The other thing that could happen in areas such as London and other large cities is that the system could be broken up, which could lead to quite severe chaos.

The scheme would offer free bus passes and free travel on local buses and would theoretically enable pensioners to travel throughout Wales if they wanted to without paying a penny. Whilst I appreciate the importance of ensuring that groups such as disabled people, schoolchildren and trainees are also eligible for reduced cost public transport, it would be ridiculous to undo the good work the National Assembly has done for pensioners in Wales by preventing pensioners enjoying concessionary travel under this regulation.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Meijer, for the work he has done; it has been complex and complicated work on a proposal which has given rise to many amendments and positions. The good work by Mr Meijer, and by all of you, has led to an important debate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">In many ways, this debate has helped to generate another broad public debate. The analyses of this subject, both inside and outside the institutions, help the Commission to improve on its own ideas. The debate has demonstrated the controversy surrounding these issues, although there have been times when feelings have obscured the real background to the proposal we are dealing with.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, at the moment there is legal uncertainty in this sector and our intention through this proposal, ladies and gentlemen – we must make this very clear – is to resolve a situation of legal uncertainty which may create serious problems in public transport. The first intention of this initiative, as Mr Jarzembowski has said, is to promote public transport; we all agree that the European Union must promote high-quality public transport at the best possible price.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that many current contracts and agreements, which grant exclusive rights and financial compensation, may be questionable under the Treaty’s competition rules. This is the risk we are dealing with and which this proposal is intended to resolve.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, while the problem of legal uncertainty is serious enough in itself, it is also clear that regulated competition in public transport must benefit both users and society in general. The facts have demonstrated that systems open to competition controlled and regulated by the public sector have experienced a quicker increase in the number of passengers, during the 90s, than systems which have not been subject to any type of competitive pressure. The reality is that we do not want private monopolies either.</p>
<p class="contents">You will understand that it would take hours to present the Commission’s position on each and every one of the 130 amendments which have been tabled on this subject. I am therefore going to comment on the fundamental issues you have raised and, with regard to the specific amendment numbers, the services are at your disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what we can accept, firstly we are in favour of the proposals intended to reinforce the quality criteria which the authorities must take into account on assessing transport needs and awarding contracts. When the markets open up, the authorities must deal with all issues relating to employment, the environment and consumers, and possibly even more so if the services remain closed to competitive pressures. We must therefore promote the opening up of the market in order to guarantee these levels and standards in terms of employment, the environment and consumers which we all want to see.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission can also accept a longer maximum duration for contracts. The periods proposed in Amendments Nos 15 and 54 seem to us acceptable (8 years for buses and 15 years for railways).</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, with regard to the exceptions to the principle of competition, we can only accept those amendments which do not contradict our initial proposal, and not those which intend to further limit the scope of the regulation. We can also accept those amendments which increase the <span class="italic">de minimis </span>thresholds applicable to direct awarding of contracts.</p>
<p class="contents">Having heard the debate, we accept that emergency situations may arise where it is impossible to organise competition on time and in a manner which allows the service to be maintained. The amendments which deal with this issue are therefore acceptable in principle, although they may require some rewording. We believe that they should be combined in a single emergency clause which also covers other similar circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission could also accept those amendments which contribute to ensuring that the authorities responsible for compensation have greater flexibility with regard to the general rules laid down for all operators, such as those which establish maximum charges, and which, in some cases, must be applied as appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission can accept the idea of a transitional period which lasts eight years, as proposed in Amendment No 90. However, instead of a ‘big bang’ on that date, we believe that the regulation should lay down a gradual opening up of the market by the authorities, with a first step after four years. It is also acceptable that existing contracts, awarded in accordance with competition, may continue their natural course, provided that their duration is fixed (that is, that they are not indefinite contracts) and reasonable.</p>
<p class="contents">However, ladies and gentlemen, there are things which we cannot accept, because they would undermine the aim of the Commission’s proposal. For example, we cannot support the exclusion of complete sectors from the scope of the regulation; we cannot accept Amendments Nos 23, 28 and 128, which would exclude all long-distance services.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that Parliament is in favour of increasing competition in long-distance passenger rail transport, but I would prefer this issue to be dealt with under the second package of rail measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft report raises legal problems in certain cases. Amendment No 24 would give priority to the regulation over the directives on public contracts. Ladies and gentlemen, the Commission believes that this could lead to the European Union failing to comply with its commitments contained in the World Trade Organisation agreement on public contracts. We cannot therefore accept this amendment either.</p>
<p class="contents">The second legal problem relates to reciprocity. The permanent and structural reciprocity clauses are contrary to the non-discrimination requirements laid down in the Treaties. We cannot therefore accept those amendments which simply propose structural reciprocity clauses. However, we believe that, until certain exceptions are incorporated, it is necessary, in a transitional and exceptional fashion, to accept certain types of clause which limit access to a market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important that transition towards controlled competition be accompanied by adequate safeguards, also in the field of social protection, an issue which some of you have mentioned. We cannot therefore accept amendments which would leave the competent authorities without room for manoeuvre in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I have presented the Commission’s opinion on the majority of the most important issues dealt with in Mr Meijer’s report, but – I am sure you will have noticed – certain crucial issues still remain. For example, the report includes a group of amendments (Amendments Nos 3, 12, 14, 61, 100, 126 and 129) which intend to safeguard the capacity of public operators to continue to exist without their ability to compete and provide services adequately and to the benefit of the citizens being questioned periodically, by means of public tenders.</p>
<p class="contents">In legal terms, there is no fundamental problem in relation to the principle that public authorities should decide to provide the transport service themselves. The initiative states that. The main legal problem arises when the public authority continues to deny all the other companies the opportunity to provide those services in the same area, in a situation of transparent and honest competition. We are talking about a certain level of transport, not small-scale transport between two towns, which is excluded from the scope of this directive as a result of the <span class="italic">de minimis </span>stipulations, as is stated clearly. We are talking about significant transport markets. We cannot therefore accept those amendments as they are worded. We do not believe that they benefit the citizens, because they go too far, isolating operators from market pressures to maintain and improve the situation. However, we believe that the option of self-production laid down in those amendments could be maintained, with certain strict and clearly established conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that this approach should be accompanied by provisions which guarantee that all operators preserve standards of quality and integration, and which ensure that the authorities remain capable of controlling competitions to the benefit of the users of the services.</p>
<p class="contents">The final part of Amendment No 112, which proposes the direct allocation of up to 10% of public services to a private sector operator, is also acceptable, provided that the authority cannot invoke this or other exceptions in simultaneous tendering for a single mode of transport.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, ladies and gentlemen, if Parliament votes for this report in its current form, I fear that the text, the spirit and the objective of the Commission’s proposal will be seriously affected. In this respect, we would have to re-examine the real overall contribution of this modification to Community legislation. The Commission still believes that we must modernise the current regulation (which has existed for several decades), that we must bring things up to date so that public transport may enjoy sufficient legal certainty to guarantee that it is of the highest quality, as competitive as possible, with the best prices and with the legal certainty which will allow public authorities to subsidise and economically support certain routes and certain requirements, such as those of pensioners and other groups, without having to argue this before the courts.</p>
<p class="contents">We need efficient public transport, at the service of the citizens, which contributes to rebalancing the transport systems and preventing a future situation of gridlock within the European transport system, which would damage our productive, economic and competitive capacity, job creation and above all the quality of life of our citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
