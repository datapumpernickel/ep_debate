In a world that is becoming ever smaller and better connected by sophisticated methods of communication, a world in which islands of wealth, peace and well-being are surrounded by poverty, war and destitution, considerable migratory pressures from the less-favoured regions are inevitably brought to bear on wealthier parts of the world. This vast migratory mass, which is mainly driven by economic motives, is jeopardising the asylum system, as many economic migrants, without any other legal means of entering rich countries, try to take the asylum route to gain access to EU territory.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the Commission’s two communications. We must establish the asylum system called for at the Tampere European Council. New policies, however, must be drawn up to take account of new realities, such as the mixed flows of refugees and economic migrants, substantially greater now than at the time of the Tampere Council. Asylum seekers will, of course, continue to arrive in numbers at the EU’s external borders and it is for them that much of the current Tampere system is designed. It is, accordingly, essential to maintain what is already in the <span class="italic">acquis</span> and to adopt directives still awaiting the Council’s assent, in order to finalise the first part laid down by Tampere on the status of refugees and on asylum procedures, and, in so doing, to move on to the second stage of development.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council must, therefore, be urged to adopt at the earliest opportunity the directives to which I have just alluded, which were repeatedly requested at the Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki Councils. The current system clearly has its shortcomings. Many asylum seekers do not actually need asylum. In fact, most of those in genuine need remain in their regions of origin or in border areas, where they are subjected to persecution, distress, indignity, hunger and death.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore endorse the Commission’s position that we must look into new methods of asylum that are better suited to the reality of the situation. A new policy must be established to process asylum seekers at the point of arrival in the EU, by means of a Community-wide resettlement scheme and by means of protected entry procedures. Asylum and immigration are two distinct, yet intrinsically linked phenomena, which must be addressed together.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to reiterate our call for economic aid to be increased, with no provisos attached, for the regions of origin of migratory flows, with the aim of reducing those flows and of promoting solidarity with the poorest countries and with the people who are most in need. I therefore call on the EU to establish a policy of legal immigration, in which the only means of entering EU territory legally for economic migrants is to ask for asylum, as this is jeopardising the very survival of the system. Europe, Mr President, is the land of asylum and the system must be protected if we are to keep up this humanitarian tradition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As you know, in application of the previous communication, the Thessalonica European Council gave the Commission another mandate to explore all the parameters guaranteeing the ordered and managed entry into the European Union of persons needing international protection by means of asylum, and the means and resources for increasing the capacity for protection in the regions of origin, and to present a report to the Council before June 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">There are naturally clear links between the two communications – in relation to asylum, that of 2003, and the next Commission communication – and your report and today's debates will greatly enhance the work we are carrying out within the Commission and which we will present shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to begin by saying that I am pleased that the report approves the analysis of the deficiencies of the current protection regime of the asylum system, which undermine the credibility and integrity of the institution of asylum and public support for it. Within this context, it is essential to reach an agreement on the directive on asylum procedures, which in reality is the only extraordinary measure still outstanding.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to take this opportunity to stress that the new approach we are exploring in the communication, the subject of your report, indicates a change of focus: to move away from what we can do to reduce numbers of applications but rather to make progress towards what we can do to improve our work, that is to say, in order to better protect a number of refugees – which we suspect will be greater at global level – trying to find new ways to improve accessibility, fairness and management of the international protection system. It is also therefore a question of a better use of funds and of the budgets available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Within this context, I would like to take this opportunity to sincerely thank the rapporteur and the European Parliament for the very constructive role they have played in order to move forward the Aeneas programme, which will contribute to helping third receiving countries, providing them with financial and technical assistance so that they can deal with the pressures they are under when dealing with refugees over long periods of time.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, financial and technical assistance alone is not enough. It is necessary to share burdens and responsibility if the European Union wants to demonstrate that its desire for international protection to become more equitable is a genuine one. Within this context, we could offer to relieve some of the pressure on receiving countries, offering places for resettling refugees within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The next communication will go into more detail on the reasoned analysis and the parameters for a possible resettlement plan within the European Union, and it is clear that such considerations must be contained within a global context in which the UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) will obviously play an important role, given the links with the current global debates on the strategic use of resettlement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for the report produced by Parliament and of course – and I address this in particular to the rapporteur – it will be taken into account in the next Commission communication. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And it is essential that the institution of the right to asylum is not affected by the crisis currently facing the asylum system, possibly as a result of abuses of its use.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the institutions because, finally, five years after the Tampere European Council, we are tackling the creation of a European asylum system which must involve common standards for reception, the processing of applications and assistance for asylum seekers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union should, firstly, adapt the conditions in which asylum seekers are currently received to Europe's own standards in terms of individual rights and guarantees, hygiene and welfare. Secondly, we should take this opportunity to adapt to the current reality and include amongst cases granted asylum those of women and children threatened with genital mutilation, child soldiers and the victims of new forms of slavery.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the opinion for the Committee on Development and Cooperation, I am pleased that the improvement of asylum systems and the possible establishment of a common European system is not being carried out from a policing point of view, but also by taking account of political aspects and the development and human rights problems which are at the root of both asylum applications and the mass economic migration which is sometimes disguised as asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's approach should include measures for creating systems of freedoms which respect human rights in the countries of origin, and the establishment of the essential security conditions in neighbouring countries. This would reduce the pressure from genuine asylum seekers at European borders.</p>
<p class="contents">For bogus asylum seekers, the tendency for economic migrants to use the institution of asylum can only be stopped if we fund cooperation projects in the countries of origin which offer prospects for development. For a long time the Socialist Group has supported co-development measures, in other words, specific development of the places of origin of migration in order to facilitate return and discourage immigration or the abuse of asylum.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the next Parliament will have the opportunity to give its opinion on the definitive establishment of a common asylum system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In accordance with the Treaties of Amsterdam and Nice, and in line with the outcome of the Tampere Summit, we have adopted various legal measures and instruments concerning the three categories, namely, asylum seekers, temporarily displaced persons and economic migrants. Member States, as the rapporteur has stated, are currently facing a crisis in the asylum system caused by abuses of the various procedures with the increase in mixed flows, a problem that is often exacerbated by the operations of trafficking networks. This phenomenon has had terrible consequences, which have been reflected in public unease.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, it is essential that we establish a policy that encompasses three key elements: firstly, the application of the Geneva Convention; secondly, the legitimate aspirations of citizens of third countries to seek better living conditions; and thirdly, the capacity of each Member State, and that of the EU as a whole, to welcome refugees. At the root of this balanced policy must always be a joint framework of related measures established following detailed examination at Tampere. We must also adopt harmonised, transparent, efficient and swift procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has drafted proposals and obtained Parliament’s opinion in all the areas of asylum policy referred to in the Tampere conclusions. The Council, on the other hand, has missed the deadlines set by the Tampere, Laeken, Seville and Thessaloniki European Councils and, five years on, we still await its decisions. The Thessaloniki European Council reminded the Council of the need to ensure that the still-outstanding proposals for directives on minimum standards for asylum and immigration were adopted at the earliest opportunity. The Commission was called on to explore all parameters in order to ensure more orderly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection, and to examine how the regions of origin may better ensure the safety of those persons.</p>
<p class="contents">Today’s debate concerns the report by Mr Marinho, whom I should like to congratulate on the quality of his work. The report is based on two Commission communications, which, although they are prompted by different considerations, are, nonetheless, both concerned with the premises and the basics aims of a possible new approach to more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems, and they explore new paths which will complement the progressive approach established at Tampere.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, Mr President, for a coherent overall approach to be sustained as regards the establishment of a common EU policy on asylum and immigration, the following key elements must be present: the existence of paths of legal immigration, a policy on integration, joint management of migratory flows, more rigorous controls of external borders, a European asylum system, negotiations on readmission agreements and common policy on return, the need to combat human trafficking and illegal immigration effectively and to support the victims of such crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What in fact was the question asked? It was first and foremost a matter of what response should be given to the report presented by the British Government to the European Council in spring last year entitled ‘New international approaches to asylum processing and protection’. This report, which made a good deal of sense, posed the huge question as to the need to regain control of asylum systems which are currently creaking under the pressure of immense migratory flows. It was followed by a communication from the Commission making simple questions complex and confusing the issue with the title ‘Towards more accessible, equitable and managed asylum systems’, which utterly twists the meaning of the British report. It is remarkable that the European Parliament report being examined today makes frequent reference to the Commission communication, but does not even mention the British Government’s report in its citations. Such disdain for a Member State strikes me as scarcely tolerable. I shall, therefore, base my remarks on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">It makes four points: one, financial aid to refugees is poorly distributed; two, the current asylum system is of no benefit to the great majority of refugees, the most vulnerable, who are still in place with little protection; three, the very great majority of asylum seekers in the European Union do not meet the criteria needed to obtain the status of refugee or additional protection; four, those denied the right of asylum usually stay here illegally without being sent back to their countries of origin.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with these challenges, the British report asks in particular for the creation of protection zones in the regions of origin in order to provide accessible refuges and the establishment of transit processing centres outside the EU, where the refugees admitted could be offered access to the participating countries and the others would be sent back to their countries of origin. The report submitted to us today is no more than evasive in its response to these questions and proposals. In particular, in its paragraph 16, it rejects the idea of protection zones or transit centres outside the EU as not offering sufficient protection, and, in paragraph 8, it proposes, as a response to the multiplication of false applications for asylum, expanding the possibilities for legal immigration, which – as Mr Marinho has just pointed out – would in actual fact be an even worse remedy.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, Mr President, this report does not seem to have taken account of either the dramatic problem faced by our societies, whose survival is now at stake, or the need for in-depth revision of our asylum procedures and for our efforts to be directed, as a matter of priority, towards the political stabilisation and economic development of the countries from which these people are driven, in their despair, to emigrate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
