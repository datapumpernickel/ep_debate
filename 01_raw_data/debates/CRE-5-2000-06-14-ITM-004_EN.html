<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Brok (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I welcome the fact that we are already able to discuss this issue here today and I should like to start by saying that I consider this, to all intents and purposes, to be the first reading of the Lalumière report, because Mrs Lalumière has invested a great deal of expertise and work in this project.</p>
<p class="contents">We must stress that, after Amsterdam, Cologne and Helsinki, a great deal of progress has been made in developing the foreign, security and defence policy and we would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making this progress possible in these areas. It is the result of our understanding that a disaster such as we have witnessed in the Balkans must never happen again. We must guarantee that Europe has the authority to act in the area of foreign, security and defence policy, the authority which allows us to safeguard our interests jointly; however, at the same time, we must make it clear that this is not an alternative to the transatlantic alliance. This development complements NATO, which will continue to remain responsible for collective security in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">We as the European Parliament have already come to this conclusion by intensifying and institutionalising collaboration with the NATO parliamentary assembly. We must realise that Amsterdam transferred the Petersberg tasks of the WEU to the European Union and that, as a result, practically all areas of the Western European Union now come under the responsibility of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains is Article 5. I think this Intergovernmental Conference should consider whether Article 5 can be adopted in the form of a protocol to the EU Treaty and whether we should leave it to each Member State to take a sovereign decision as to whether or not it subscribes to this protocol. This is surely a way for non-allied, neutral countries to find their own way as members of the European Union while, at the same time, allowing collaboration in practically all circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In the long run, this must be credibly sustained by the European Union. We are a Union with our own legislation, which has resulted in our own legal system, and with our own interests based on the internal market and monetary union, which is why areas with different standards of security within the European Union must be a thing of the past. This will surely help to develop a coherent foreign, security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see, precisely in Community matters, that the European Union has a plethora of instruments which are important for foreign and security policy, especially for civil crisis management, and that we are therefore able to provide more foreign aid than the United States Congress, that trade policy is the responsibility of the Commission and therefore that the nucleus of our potential to act is a Community remit and that we should not assign the development of a foreign, security and defence policy to intergovernmental collaboration.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament will advocate bringing the Community position, the Community part to the fore. We are of course delighted that we have a highly qualified High Representative in the person of Mr Solana, but it has always been the aim of the European Parliament in the long run to have a European foreign secretary incorporated into the Community area as part of the Commission. This is unattainable at present for certain reasons, but we should strive towards it. It is still our aim.</p>
<p class="contents">We can see that the Commission has a large stake and that foreign and security policy is being formulated in the European Council. Defence is still a matter for national governments when it comes to equipment and similar questions. This must be merged, including practically, so that such absurdities never occur again. If we just think that today the foreign secretary of Kazakhstan will be received by fifteen foreign secretaries, the Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs and the High Representative, then I think this makes for wonderful Council meetings, but it is not a sign of any particular authority to act on the part of the European Union. I think that we must speak up with one voice more loudly here and the Troika of Council President, High Representative and Commissioner for Foreign Affairs introduced in the Treaty of Amsterdam should first establish the Union’s authority to act; we should not have any other definitions in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also ensure that this Treaty improves our decision-making mechanisms and we should not forget the huge shortcomings brought to light in the organisational disaster in Kosovo, which are the reason for the lack of an arms export policy and which have so far forestalled unity in the EU Treaty. We must recognise the fact that we are squandering money in national budgets. We spend more on defence than America, but with far fewer results. This also applies to transport, satellites and such like.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the Treaty, this European Parliament is responsible for parliamentary control, including and especially of the Petersberg tasks, which is why the control function of the European Parliament must also be strengthened. We shall also endeavour to bring about cooperation as well as collaboration with the foreign and defence policy committees of national parliaments in order to close gaps and cooperate with the parliaments of candidate and other countries. But this European Parliament is named in the Treaty as the parliamentary controller of foreign, security and defence policy to the exclusion of all others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report to be submitted to the European Council in Santa Maria da Feira will detail the progress made on the various mandates received in Helsinki. In particular it will cover the development of the European military capability, the headline goal, the institutional development of the permanent political and military bodies, the relations between the European Union and third countries in this area, the relations between the European Union and NATO, an indication of whether or not the EU Treaty needs to be revised and the problem of non-military crisis management mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In the area of foreign policy and the Common European Security and Defence Policy, the EU has decided to develop the military and non-military dimensions in parallel. We clearly must coordinate these two dimensions and particularly the military and non-military crisis management actions which the EU may decide to undertake. This coordination will be carried out by the new structures of the Common Foreign and Security Policy, in particular by the Political and Security Committee, the future Military Committee and the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management. I must point out that the interim bodies started work in March 2000 and that the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management was formally created during the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">As will be evident from the Presidency’s report to the Feira European Council, an effort is being made to simultaneously develop the military and non-military crisis management capabilities. The Member States have already been working to develop the headline goal. For example this was discussed yesterday at a meeting of the General Affairs Council attended by the Defence Ministers. The Feira European Council will also see the Member States make a commitment to develop their civil police capability by 2003, with up to 5 000 officers, for crisis management operations. This represents a major effort by the Member States to ensure sustained and uniform development of these two dimensions which are fundamental for security and stability.</p>
<p class="contents">On another issue raised in Mr Brok’s question, I must say that strengthening the Common Foreign and Security Policy by developing a common European security and defence policy, thus allowing the EU to establish a military capability and also to reinforce the efficacy of its civilian crisis management mechanisms, does not necessarily require an increase in the defence budgets of the Member States. Rather, the basic objective will be to improve the use and rationalisation of the military assets and capabilities of the Member States. In this context it must be said that the European Union will use, in order to develop the headline goal, the NATO defence planning, the planning and review process for countries which are not members of NATO and the defence capabilities initiative which is ongoing within the Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">Every effort is being made to ensure effective use of all the assets and capabilities and to avoid the duplication which could lead to additional defence costs. No increase in the Community budget is planned as these efforts are to be implemented by the Member States in a context of voluntary cooperation. A final answer on the budgetary impact of this policy may only be given, however, after the Commitment Capability Conference<span class="italic"> </span>to be held in the autumn. This will analyse the national military contributions to this joint effort and the shortfalls which it may be considered necessary to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the involvement of the European Parliament in this process, it should be recalled that the Common European Security and Defence Policy is a component of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The EU intends to make its foreign dimension more effective and credible by developing military and civilian crisis management capabilities. Under Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union, Parliament shall be consulted by the Presidency on the main aspects and the basic choices of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The views of Parliament shall be taken into consideration by the Council. The European Parliament shall also be kept regularly informed of the development of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and may ask the Council about aspects which it considers are important and may make recommendations which it deems appropriate. The need to avoid unnecessary duplication and to make the best use of all the existing assets and capabilities also underlies the development of the Common European Security and Defence Policy. It is therefore natural that the Member States have from the beginning advocated the transfer of WEU powers which could prove useful in the process now under way in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Portugal, which holds the Presidency of the WEU, has tried to advance the process for transferring powers from the WEU to the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Portuguese Presidency has therefore prepared a set of political and military concepts and procedures which, following the WEU Council of Ministers meeting in Oporto, will be transferred to the European Union. This constitutes a fundamental part of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>which must be preserved.</p>
<p class="contents">During our Presidency of the WEU, preparations for the process of transferring the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre of the WEU have also been started. This will occur during the next presidency. The WEU has already taken the decision to allow the EU direct access to these structures. Therefore, in accordance with the desire expressed by the Member States, the transfer of the Institute for Security Studies and the Satellite Centre will take place. The transfer of powers from the WEU to the EU does not imply the end of the WEU; at least this is not the current aim of the Member States. The amended Treaty of Brussels will remain in force without any further changes. This is why the collective defence mechanism specified in Article 5 will also remain in operation for the States which have signed this Treaty, as will the Parliamentary Assembly, which will continue to operate fully.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the whole organisational structure will be slimmed down. This will then simply provide support to a permanent council which will meet when necessary and to other structures which will continue to operate, in particular the Western Europe Armaments Group. The budget for this organisation will also be substantially reduced.</p>
<p class="contents">The Common European Security and Defence Policy requires a close, intense and transparent relationship between the European Union and NATO. The Portuguese Presidency has paid particular attention to developing ways of establishing this relationship, which must be based on cooperation, dialogue and transparency. However, it must not threaten the autonomy of these two organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">The report to be presented to the Feira European Council includes a document establishing the principles and terms of this relationship during this interim period. Four ad hoc working groups involving the EU and NATO will be created on the following issues: security, European military capability, development of processes for transferring NATO assets and capabilities to operations led by the European Union and, finally, definition of the permanent terms of the relationship between the European Union and NATO. If necessary, other working groups on specific issues may be created.</p>
<p class="contents">In its effort to develop the European military capability, the EU must take into account the need to maintain a relationship of cooperation, dialogue and consultation with European allies who are not members of the European Union and with the applicant countries. It must be stressed that the headline goal defined in Helsinki is open to participation by these countries which may therefore contribute to the European force. According to the document agreed by the European Union which will form an integral part of the Feira European Council report, a single and inclusive structure will be created in which the fifteen Member States of the European Union and the fifteen third countries will participate. This structure will be responsible for dialogue, cooperation and consultation between these countries. In view of the fundamental role of the six European allies who are not members of the European Union and also bearing in mind that NATO may provide assets and capabilities for operations led by the EU, meetings will take place within this single structure between the Fifteen and these six countries to discuss issues involving the development of the European military capability.</p>
<p class="contents">In the pre-crisis phase or rather at the start of a crisis, dialogue, cooperation and consultation will clearly be reinforced and, if the EU were to consider using NATO assets and capabilities, particular attention would be given to the dialogue, cooperation and consultation with the six European allies who are not members of the EU. It must be stressed that, under the terms agreed in Helsinki, EU operations will in principle be open to participation by these countries. Russia, Ukraine and other European countries may also participate in operations led by the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The French Presidency will be responsible for presenting the Nice European Council with proposals on the terms for the consultation and participation of these countries. At the Feira European Council, the European Union will record the interest expressed by Canada in participating in this joint European effort.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in Helsinki the Portuguese Presidency was given the task of presenting the Feira European Council with an indication of whether or not the Treaty of Amsterdam needs to be revised. From the debate conducted and the opinions expressed, it has been possible to conclude that the implementation of the EU decisions on the Common European Security and Defence Policy does not require the Treaty to be revised as this policy falls legally within the provisions currently in force. However, as this is a process that is open to developments, the Member States have agreed on the need to keep an eye on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I welcome this timely and useful debate, which was introduced characteristically and forcefully by my honourable friend, Mr Brok, in a thoughtful and useful speech. I welcome the report by Mrs Lalumière. It is an exceptionally helpful document. What it says about non-military crisis management provides us with a checklist, an action list of things we should be making sure are put in place over the next few years. It is a very good report, and I would like to congratulate the honourable lady, without reservation, on what she has said.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has actively contributed to non-military crisis management since long before the Cologne and Helsinki Summits. These summits have reminded us that there is an urgent need for our policies to become more ambitious, coherent and effective. We need to improve our capacity for rapid and targeted action. We need to step up our efforts of coordination. We need to improve the availability of analysis and information exchange, and we need to radically enhance our capacities for pursuing preventive policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The creation of additional instruments, or the mobilisation of additional funding, does not, in my judgement, stand in the centre of current deliberations; nor are far-reaching Treaty changes required. Instead, our focus lies on using existing instruments and financial resources considerably more efficiently. Parliament knows the priority which the Commission and I attach to discharging our existing competencies a great deal more energetically and a great deal more competently than we have in the past. That gives us a considerable agenda for the next few years. I hope that we will have the support of Parliament in working through it.</p>
<p class="contents">We should build on existing competencies. We should bring them to bear more effectively on the twin goals of conflict prevention and crisis management. Saying ‘no’ to institutional revolution does not mean turning our backs on innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission recently tabled a proposal for the creation of a rapid reaction facility. The limited funds we think are required for that facility will be found by redeployment within our existing budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that the idea to set up a European civil police corps merits careful examination through a feasibility study by the Council, as proposed in the relevant European Parliament resolution. It is also plain that the Commission's lack of human resources for both conflict prevention and crisis management greatly impinges upon our capacity to make more rapid progress in this field, though that is something we are attempting at present to address.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me be clear about the Commission's role. We are plainly not responsible for coordination of the military and civil components in crisis management. What the Commission is trying to do is to ensure an effective and coherent Community input into the overall coordinated effort of the Union in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I have spoken before about the impossibility of making a clear distinction, in preventing a crisis or in managing a crisis, between the military and the civil components. The important thing is to recognise the relationship between the two. Look at what the Commission is doing around the world: we are paying for the training of police in anti-terrorism tasks in Palestine. We are helping to create border services in the Balkans. We are spending money on de-mining in virtually every continent. Those are the sorts of ways in which the Commission is contributing to preventative diplomacy and I hope that in future Europe will manage those tasks in a more coherent way.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not our first effort to create as it were a common foreign and security policy. We had the Pleven plan. We had de Gasperi. We had Fouchet. We had years of European political cooperation, during which there were lots of ringing declarations, perhaps slightly too many of them, some weeks after they could actually have any effect on events. The decision taken at Maastricht, the decision taken at Amsterdam, the decision taken at Helsinki – they all mark a signal move forward, a recognition that we have not done enough in the past to ensure that Europe's voice is heard adequately around the world and that Europe's capacities to prevent and manage crises are brought to bear with sufficient competence and vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">This time we have to make a difference. This time we have to ensure that a common foreign and security policy ensures that Europe discharges its responsibilities at the level which events require, at the level which our citizens now in my judgement demand. We in the Commission want to play our full part in ensuring that this time a common foreign and security policy is a resounding success.</p>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you that during the tragedy in Bosnia it was said that Europe died in Sarajevo. It is my opinion that, in political and military terms, it had not even been born when that tragedy erupted. Europe awoke when the crisis in Kosovo arose. Europe spoke with one voice, as you have just said, Commissioner Patten. It made its voice heard, it stated the limits of what was tolerable and in the end took military action, all other political, economic and diplomatic pressure having failed. If, however, our American friends had not then joined the combat on our side, Europe would not have been able to act effectively.</p>
<p class="contents">It is this awareness of our dependence on the Americans – and that is not to blame the Americans in any way – which has brought about this sea change in European public opinion. This is not to blame the Americans for having gone into Kosovo with us, because I must remind you that, until they became involved in Bosnia-Herzegovina, people said that it was because there was no oil in Bosnia, whereas there was oil in Kuwait. Well, our American friends did join us in that war, but without them we would not have been able to perform that task as efficiently as we did.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Let us not harbour any illusions. The determination created as a result of that crisis, shared by more than two-thirds of public opinion in the Fifteen Member States of the Union, will not achieve results straightaway. It will take time – time and money. It will take time because, as you all know, it takes at least ten to fifteen years to develop an arms programme. In the meantime, it is quite clear that everything that has been done and all the decisions that have been taken, particularly in the area of our relationship with NATO, are quite satisfactory. It will require money, and I welcome the courage of our rapporteur, Mrs Lalumière, and join her in saying that we cannot achieve any more with the money that we have spent to date. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lalumière (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, as you can see, the European Parliament takes a very close interest in this new policy, which will become the common European security and defence policy, and we will have occasion to discuss it often in the future.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Today, knowing that this issue is to be discussed at the Feira Summit, we would like to ask you about the intentions of the Council and the Commission, and also to share our views and hopes with you. We shall be expressing these in the resolution which we are to vote on, I hope, tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I should first of all like to thank you for the opening statements you have just made, including your words on the pointlessness of a possible revision of the Treaties. I am now speaking in my capacity as rapporteur for the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, but in more general terms, I think I can say that the great majority of the European Parliament, which does not mean unanimously, approves, as I do, of the new impetus that the Cologne and Helsinki Summits have given to this policy since the Treaty of Amsterdam.</p>
<p class="contents">Bosnia and Kosovo, as Mr Brok reminded us a few minutes ago, demonstrated – if proof were necessary – Europe’s shortcomings, both in terms of prevention and of how we manage crises and extricate ourselves from them. We also observed that we were still too dependent on the United States for our security. In short, we are satisfied with the guidelines and with the decisions that have been adopted over the last year but we expect the Feira Summit and then the French Presidency to continue and expedite their actual implementation. In fact, we currently have what could be called a ‘window of opportunity’ following the shock that has been felt across the Balkans. Unless we take advantage today of these favourable circumstances, we fear that this new policy may become bogged down in various procedures that will, in fact, paralyse it.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, the European Parliament must draw a clear distinction between civilian and military crisis management. The former is obviously the approach we favour. In this area, the Commission has an essential role to play and we welcome the efforts that have been made recently, Commissioner, but I must stress a few specific points. How can we further improve our swift decision-making and rapid action capabilities? By the same token, how can we guarantee effective coordination, which is a continual problem, between the Council, the Council’s High Representative, the Commission, and in some cases, Member States, NGOs etc? In order to achieve this, we strongly urge the Council and the Commission to set the major common objectives known as ‘Headline Goals’ in advance so that everyone knows in advance what they can or must do, when confronted with a sudden crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would remind you of our commitment to creating a European civilian peace corps, with the same rationale: speed and efficiency. What do you intend to do, Commissioner? Whatever course of action we may prefer for dealing with crises through civilian means, we know perfectly well that we also need military means, if only to deter certain parties from committing barbarous acts.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still much to be done to ensure that the European Union has adequate military resources, which is why we are putting these questions to you. We are questioning you about the establishment of a rapid reaction force, which must be operational within three years, and on the creation of political and military decision-making structures, as has been provided for a few months now. What is the state of play? We are asking you about restructuring the armed forces in order to improve their training, equipment and ability to work together, regardless of their country of origin. We also wish to question you as to the state of play with regard to the necessary restructuring of the armament and military hardware industries and the budgetary resources that might prove necessary.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our relations with NATO, I paid great attention to what you said, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. This is a very important and sensitive point, especially as it relates to the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I shall in turn stress a matter to which the European Parliament understandably attaches great importance: the parliamentary dimension of security and defence policy. Even if the executive must always have overall responsibility for this matter, we must stress the role of parliaments, both national parliaments and the European Parliament. So far, you have kept rather quiet on this point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many aligned countries believe that the formation of a common military force would mean the start of a common defence arrangement. Their plans are clear. Under the treaties, the aim of a common foreign and security policy for the Union is to safeguard its independence and integrity, as well as strengthen its security in all its forms. The military force to be established is, in their view, a tool to realise these aims: a common army for a Union that is becoming a federation. In the opinion of the non-aligned Member States, only the creation of a system for crisis management has been decided upon. They stress that each country should decide separately on its involvement. They believe that they have no obligation to become involved in enforcing peace. Non-aligned Member States do not want the Union to become a military alliance or military superpower. These differences of opinion and interpretation must be taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also wise in security policy to establish differentiated integration. Combined troops of the European Union should only be used for crisis management. Countries which are part of the federal core, as proposed by Messrs Delors, Giscard d’Estaing, Schmidt and Fischer, could create a defence community, to form a strong European pillar within the context of NATO. The understandable and commendable aim by the European NATO countries to develop a European defence identity should thus be realised within the context of NATO itself. Decisions relating to security and defence policy are immensely important, and should therefore be made with the emphasis on openness and democracy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that we have imposed a few restrictions on ourselves. We are very much focusing on the Summit, the European Council of Feira, which is fine, but that means that we will not be covering a number of other issues which are vital to European security.</p>
<p class="contents">One such issue which we are not discussing today is the criteria for the deployment of this rapid reaction force. I am sure that we will be discussing this issue following a further report by Mrs Lalumière in due course, but in the meantime, we are subject to a few restrictions. Despite these restrictions, we are able to pass a sound verdict now, in my opinion. Let me start by making a positive comment. A large part of the resolution is taken up by non-military crisis management, and this is very much how it should be, in my opinion. The Commissioner spent quite a long time talking about this and I think he had every reason to. According to my group, the EU has unique opportunities in this respect which, so far, have remained for the most part untapped. Fortunately, there are also examples of how things can be done, for example, the Stability Pact, which is a mixture of economic reconstruction, promotion of human rights and the development of a civil society. This is a good example of how, also in future, the Union will be able to use its nearly unlimited options in the field of non-military crisis management. But military resources also form part of this package and, this may surprise some delegates, this is also largely backed by my group, albeit subject to a number of conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to specify two. One is the EU’s say. In my opinion, it should be crystal clear, and this is not included in the present texts, that the EU has autonomous power of decision and that the EU countries must be able to decide for themselves on their level of commitment, without needing permission from NATO – or should that be the US?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make one final point. It cannot be the case that the new military resources which are required will be over and above the ones we have at the moment and that, as such, a new arms race would be created for military resources. What is important is that the analysis and security policy are new. This does not necessarily include more resources.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You, Mrs Lalumière, have obtained the backing of a large majority in committee and you will no doubt maintain this majority in plenary. This majority confirms the quality of your work and the care which has gone into it. But it also confirms how weak the critical voices have become. I do not see this is a cause for celebration. Even official threat analyses confirm that there is no military threat to the countries of western Europe. Instead, scenarios such as the war in Kosovo or imaginary crises in the future, Islamic fundamentalism or, as in the German defence guidelines, even possible ecological threats are wheeled out in order to justify huge military spending. It marks the capitulation of politics and of the intellect, when such problems are met with a military response.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me pick up on just one issue, an issue which figured at the centre of all the positions taken here today: the war in Kosovo. I think that the Council, the Commission and we ourselves are drawing the wrong conclusions in principle from a war which was wrong in principle. First, the violation of international law, as practised by NATO, and which, for the rest, still forms part of the official NATO military strategy, should not shape future security policy. Secondly, I am convinced that the war against Yugoslavia could and should have been avoided with a consistent, preventive, long-term policy, especially as events over the last few days have again shown dramatically that its alleged or actual aim of safeguarding human and minority rights failed disastrously. War, if anything, is the most unsuitable and most counter-productive method in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, when it is again argued that the war in Kosovo demonstrated that the EU needs major military independence from the USA then, to my mind, this begs the conclusion that militarising international relations and security policy will increase, not reduce dependency on the USA. Military is what the USA does best. My group takes an opposing view in principle to the present prevalent European security policy on at least three counts.</p>
<p class="contents">First: the security policy template is a military, not a political, civil or cooperative one and the section on preventive and civil security policy cannot hide that fact. It is interesting that military resolutions have been coming thick and fast since the Helsinki Summit while, to all intents and purposes, nothing has been done about a civil, cause-orientated security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly: we reject a European military block formation. The only viable approach, in our view, is to restore the central role of the UNO for international security, reinforce the OSCE, design cooperative security concepts and radically disarm.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: we are deeply concerned at how automatically demands are rejected which, until just recently, formed part of a broad political consensus, at least between Mrs Lalumière and, for example, the positions represented in my group. In all events, demands for an unequivocal declaration on the UN charter, defence of the ABM treaty, respect for the policy of neutrality of certain EU Member States or an increase in funds for peace education and peace studies failed to muster a majority in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Germany has earmarked DM 17.5 million for civil conflict management projects this year. I think it is a fairly typical figure. It represents – and let me say this very slowly – 0.00029% of military spending. I fear that this policy first creates crises which it then endeavours to control. Which is why there is nothing left for us but to say a firm No. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is an important issue, because, following the very serious crises that have struck the Balkans, the European Council, especially in its Cologne and Helsinki declarations of June and December 1999 and the Presidency, particularly in the two reports it has drawn up on the Union’s military and civilian resources for dealing with crisis situations, have demonstrated their intention to see the Union become more closely involved in the management of crises that threaten European security, interests and values.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of European Union Member States, but also non-members, may perceive such threats as common threats. The issue of concern to us, then, is how we envisage establishing an intergovernmental process which deals with each country individually and which would allow all the States that wish to commit themselves, to actually do so and combine forces, while not forcing any State that does not so desire to take part against their will in a course of action of which it may not approve.</p>
<p class="contents">The organisation of this kind of intervention capability must not, however, be designed in ideological terms, as a factor to make political integration binding. Such an approach would lead to failure. It must be seen in terms of specific crisis situations which are likely to occur, whilst respecting the freedom and the will of each of our States. Treating each case individually will enable us to do this and to establish a type of reaction that is appropriate to the type of crisis and in line with the will of the people.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the question of the financial resources allocated to the establishment of civilian and military capabilities which are likely to be united is obviously a crucial one. It requires significant budgetary input and therefore a radical reversal of the trend that has been seen in most Member States, unlike the United States, since the end of the cold war. It would be useful to know whether the Council feels that the upturn in growth in Europe is such as to favour this essential turnaround and how the Council intends to promote it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For, unfortunately, we already know what the results of the Feira Summit will be. Europe’s common foreign and security policy will be brought into line with the desires of the Washington Government, through the good offices of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">NATO, which was created in 1949 to defend Western Europe against Soviet imperialism, ought to have disappeared at the same time as the Soviet Union did, in 1991. By some extraordinary paradox, the opposite has come about. France, which left NATO thirty years ago, has now rejoined. The 50 000 soldiers of Eurocorps have been under NATO command since 1993, and above all, whilst NATO had done nothing for the people of Berlin, Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Poland, it engaged in a brutal and massive intervention specifically to destroy Serbia’s civil infrastructures, yet without thereby solving the problems of Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that today NATO is, more than anything, an instrument for American domination of our countries. Here too, the means that were put in place a while ago are now being used against Europe: the 100 000 NSA agents, who spy on telephone and computer communications, and the relaunch of the Star Wars programme which will put an end to the balance of deterrence.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">This desire to ensure the continuity of American domination in the field of defence, expressed by Vice-President Al Gore, is not in itself reprehensible from his point of view. What is serious, however, is the subservience of European defence to Washington’s policy, with the backing and the active participation of Europe’s political leaders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Its lack of transparency is characterised by a multitude of initiatives and ever changing coalitions. I would nonetheless like to try to make a few observations. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I wonder whether the creation of a European identity is backed by sound motives. I would like to stress that we should not be guided by power motives. If we only focus on a strong role for Europe on the world stage, then we have got it all wrong. It is not about power, but about taking responsibility. This cannot be done without joining forces with NATO as the latter has all the necessary resources available.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to warn against all too unrealistic expectations as far as cooperation between the Member States in this respect is concerned. A realistic view of the current developments in Europe shows that paper declarations from St. Malo, Cologne and Helsinki have so far not been accompanied by real security guarantees. The required “firm political commitment on the part of all Member States” of Paragraph 19 of the resolution is lacking.</p>
<p class="contents">These brief comments do not detract from the fact that it is important to include this subject on the IGC agenda. We need plain agreements on competencies in this field. And as far as we are concerned, these are still mainly within the national state. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the many and complex problems involved in the development of this policy, which necessarily requires greater involvement by Finance Ministers and Defence Ministers, is the role and influence of the institutions. At this initial stage, Mr President, Parliament should be more involved in the development of this policy.</p>
<p class="contents">We should be thinking about a parliamentary dimension for the common security and defence policy which includes the establishment of mechanisms necessary for Parliament to participate, with its corresponding institutional role, in the definition and the objectives of that policy. Furthermore, the appropriate measures should be taken for the Parliament to exercise control over the security and defence policy and so that it is constantly and adequately informed of its tasks and of the provisional bodies which currently work in the service of the Council of Ministers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have just said with regard to Parliament, Mr President, is equally valid for the Commission. The balance between the institutions should not be altered in the case of such an important question. We should clarify the competencies of the Commission and the Council, since there is an unresolved tension between intergovernmental and Community powers.</p>
<p class="contents">The ambiguity with regard to the limits of the Commission’s role is particularly evident in the field of security and should be clarified once and for all, since we must not forget that the harmonious partnership between Parliament and the Commission has given rise to the successes of the European integration project, and we should work and fight for its restoration.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Mr President, this European Union project is not just a matter of a political, economic and military union. Our project is based, or should be based, fundamentally on a community of values. We in the European Union do not simply define ourselves as consumers in a big market place, but as citizens of the Union. The citizens of the Union, represented by Parliament, increasingly want to be involved in this area which concerns them and affects them directly, namely the common security and defence policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Central to this was Robert Schuman’s speech of 9 May 1950. A lot has changed since then, but Robert Schuman’s and Jean Monnet’s basic axiom to the effect that a lasting peace is created by weaving peoples and nations together in mutually enriching dependence is still valid. Security is created through cooperation pure and simple, as well as through integration and enlargement. </p>
<p class="contents">Schuman began his speech with these words: ‘World peace cannot be preserved without constructive efforts to combat impending dangers’. This far-sighted approach permeates the Socialist Group’s vision of Europe’s foreign and security policy and is also a persistent theme in Mrs Lalumière’s report on the eve of Feira, a report which our Group supports wholeheartedly. </p>
<p class="contents">For Social Democrats like ourselves, there are two complementary dimensions to the challenge of security policy in the twenty-first century. The first is the global dimension, and the second is the purely European dimension. Seen in a global perspective, security is clearly indivisible. We share the same planet and the same fate. In today’s globalised world following the end of the cold war, poverty and exclusion stand out as the main enemies of peace and democracy. No military arsenals and no new nuclear arms race can provide security against the resentment of the poor. Generous, fair and far-sighted aid, together with a trade policy which attacks the causes of poverty and insecurity must therefore be an integral part of our foreign and security policy. In the same way, we must look at conflict prevention and crisis management in the context of our new European security policy. </p>
<p class="contents">We are, of course, loyal to the decisions taken in Helsinki. We should constructively develop the military capacity which the war in Kosovo, in particular, has necessarily brought about. The headline goals which have been established are important and must be implemented in full, without delay and without exception. At the same time, we must, however, oppose those who wish to exaggerate our military capacity and role. We should accept increased responsibility for security on our own continent, but we should not take the place of NATO or create an embryonic form of permanent and independent European defence. Such ambitions are pure fantasy and mere tilting at windmills.</p>
<p class="contents">A policy on conflict prevention is missing from our arsenal. We must therefore actively support the proposals tabled by Commissioner Patten and also by the Council, together with the proposals in Mrs Lalumière’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The EU did not manage to stop the catastrophe in the Balkans in time, and we shall forever be accountable to our children for this failure. </p>
<p class="contents">As Liberals, we consider it absolutely crucial for the EU to be able in future to intervene with personnel and resources in countries in its immediate vicinity, to be able to engage in civil crisis management, humanitarian efforts and peace-keeping exercises based on European values and human rights. The EU must adopt a credible and independent policy in this area, but it is important to retain the commitment of the United States and the transatlantic link. NATO is at present the most important organisation for peace and security in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">The EU’s Member States must nonetheless soon come to some definite decisions about the common security policy. There are three main questions which must be answered at Feira and which I want to submit to the Council. What is the distribution of labour between the EU and NATO to look like? We must develop complementary, and not duplicate, structures. How will it be possible to guarantee the influence of the non-aligned States upon expanding security policy? Thirdly, a question in connection with which there are many good proposals in Mrs Lalumière’s excellent report: how will it be possible for the European Parliament and the national parliaments to be guaranteed influence upon, and participation in, the decisions so that the latter are made openly and democratically in the interests of our European citizens? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That means, as far as weighting instruments is concerned, that the financial and material focus must be on an effective conflict prevention policy. The main lines of conflict today are to be found in domestic conflicts and this proves that the rich countries lack the will to do enough to foster sustainable and socially-balanced development in the crisis regions.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity was missed in Helsinki to give concrete expression to an active prevention policy and efficient and prompt crisis management and we urgently need to make up lost ground here. I congratulate Mr Patten on his activities in this direction, which I should like to support and help develop further. In building up conflict prevention and after-care instruments, the focus needs to be on combining a reduction in the production and sale of arms and stricter controls.</p>
<p class="contents">One more point: the importance of Parliament. There is a risk in the numerous informal circles of totally inadequate democratic control of a European security policy, which is why the European Parliament needs to take the lead. Its position must be strengthened and this point needs to be entered on the agenda for Feira. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This might therefore be the time for extensive military disarmament in Europe but, in reality, rearmament is taking place. Nor is this new military force of 50 000 to 60 000 men to be used within the EU’s own territories. There is, in fact, no common defence commitment. Rather, it is a question of operating outside the EU’s borders. It is about intervention. Some might even go so far as to say that attacks may actually be mounted one of these days. </p>
<p class="contents">I am concerned about statements to the effect that the EU should be able to intervene anywhere in the world where there are threats to the Union’s security, interests and values.

It has been discussed at length in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy and has put us on the right track.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, a European Union which cannot play a clearly defined role in terms of security and defence creates uncertainty on the world stage. In tandem with the Commission and Council, Parliament would like to contribute to a transparent and convincing policy. After all, the European Union cannot escape its responsibility which is commensurate with its economic and cultural stature. The Christian Democrats hope that the transfer of tasks and competencies from the Western European Union to the European Union can contribute to this clarity. As the President-in-Office of the Council pointed out, this naturally means that the budget of what may be left of the WEU will be drastically reduced but, to our great amazement, he is at the same time quite negative about the idea that the European Union’s budget should increase accordingly in this respect. This seems extremely illogical to me and leads me to believe that this development is not taken altogether seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we have emphasised the civil and military aspects of this policy in our resolutions. Both play a major role and the military component should explicitly be embedded in the wider context of the civil component. These are not just pious words, they also have an immediate implication for the way in which this policy is supervised. This is why it is essential that this European Parliament, in which we discuss all kinds of civil affairs with each other all the time, be the place where the military components form part of a wider context in parliamentary supervision too. We know that the civil components will always take priority and the military components will in the first instance be used as a big stick and a last resort. It would therefore be dangerous if this policy were not entirely supervised by us. I also have to say that the nature of the tasks which we have in mind, the Petersberg tasks, is such that here is the ideal place where they can be dealt with. As champions of a Community policy, we are particularly keen for the European Commission’s input, as Mr Patten described it a moment ago, to be at its best. This means therefore that the Council must make this possible and that the personnel and budget required for this should be adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we do not want to disconnect these tasks from cooperation with North America. Obviously not. In fact, we are very keen for our security to be undivided. This is why it was with some hesitation that, in another resolution, we in the meantime urged that a position be adopted on America’s inclination to determine its own security unilaterally via the ABM system. We do not want this. We want to cooperate with North America in these matters too, but also – and particularly – with sound backing from the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

She has succeeded in describing a really accurate and balanced position with which a large majority of the political forces here in Parliament can identify. Thank you, Catherine Lalumière.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in and about Kosovo has made Europeans realise three important things. First, that we need to give ourselves conflict prevention capabilities. So far, we have had neither the political mechanisms nor the instruments to prevent or settle conflicts. If we want to avoid war, we need to give ourselves this capability. I am delighted that you, Commissioner Patten, take this same view and look forward to hearing your proposals, the Commission’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we have learned that we are unable to intervene independently on our own continent and in our own neighbourhood, even in the case of very limited military action.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly: we have learned that we need to be independent from our American friends if we want to control the means to be deployed in a military conflict. In other words: if we are dependent on others when it comes to reconnaissance, transport, attacking capacity and other such aspects, then we are fighting their war, not ours. These realisations have resulted in the European Union’s at long last tackling and stepping up its efforts to define, organise and restructure a common security and defence policy.</p>

But all too often the Council puts to one side what has been decided within the European Parliament, by consensus or not, as the case may be. European unification is born from a desire for sustainable peace. This is a leading concept which recurs in many interventions. The Common Foreign and Security Policy should therefore forge a unity between political decision-making, conflict prevention, crisis management, possibly military action – only if need be, and ideally not – plus a plan to return to peace afterwards and to keep this peace. I am not only thinking of Kosovo, which has been so important to us as an eye-opener.

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, this philosophy, as can be seen from the debate, prevails not only in the Council and the Commission, but also in the European Parliament which, instead of expressing the feelings and interests of the citizens, is about to ratify an extremely dangerous policy for Europe and mankind as a whole. Not only are we ignoring the blatant crimes committed and being committed in Yugoslavia, we are also being called upon to support the need to repeat them with more efficient means and procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">The following questions must inevitably be asked: who gives us the right, on any pretext, to bomb, kill and trample the fundamental principles of international law underfoot? How should we describe someone who stirs up tension and conflict between peoples inside countries and then uses that tension and conflict to control and plunder the countries in question?</p>
<p class="contents">But, even if international alliances are still prepared to commit such crimes today, the people will soon form their own peaceful front against these criminal policies.

I congratulate the Commissioner on the lead he is setting for greater efficiency not only in aid, but also in this area. I thank him particularly for his undertaking to examine my proposal for a European public security force, because there are several organisations across Europe which could offer experience, not least the Royal Ulster Constabulary in Northern Ireland.</p>

To London I say: you cannot do that; be realistic! You could possibly end the UK's involvement, but you cannot stop what the European Union is doing. Please face reality. This is a valuable new development in which we are involved and which we are debating. We must try to shape it positively.</p>

<p class="contents">Cologne and Helsinki have added substance to the common European security and defence policy. With unusual drive, the European Council has taken a number of important decisions, of which we have taken note and for which we have given due credit. The aim is to develop our own capacity in order to be able to implement the so-called Petersberg tasks. A decision has been made on the extent of the troops required in this respect. A draft of the necessary decision-making mechanisms is in place. A small-scale NATO is emerging. </p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I would like to emphasise two incisive questions, which are a small selection from a long series of matters which are being discussed here today.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must be able to act autonomously. This may sound obvious, but this statement also touches upon an enormous problem. What does autonomous mean in relation to NATO? There is some confusion surrounding this on both sides of the Atlantic and this should be resolved soon. Autonomy should certainly not culminate in a political exchange between the common European security and defence policy and the national missile defence, as was suggested recently by an American senator during the NATO Assembly in Budapest. In summary, the question which I would like to put to the Council is: what is autonomy in this context? Is action within a NATO context always the first option, as the Americans claim? Should NATO be given first refusal before the European Union can act autonomously or will the European Union allow itself more room for manoeuvre? I have the impression that this question is being avoided on both sides of the Atlantic, which will compromise future cooperation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is about democratic control. In the Netherlands, there has been a lot of discussion recently about who was involved in what decisions in Bosnia and Kosovo. This mainly relates to the government. But if some kind of policy of faits accomplis is already mentioned sometimes at this level, then what about parliamentary control? Will the common European security and defence policy turn into a cosy intergovernmental get-together or will national parliaments and the European Parliament be truly involved? Here too, the pertinent question arises as to whether the Council pays any attention to this at all? Operating at an informal level has its advantages but not if issues of war or peace are involved. The support base required for using the EU military instrument needs to be more extensive than that required for creating it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Lalumière’s resolution contains a relevant proposal for tackling the threat of a democratic deficit in this connection. The government conference can benefit from this. The least the European Parliament could ask for is to be considered a fully-fledged partner in this very important debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The last speaker said that a small-scale NATO is emerging. Many Members, especially citizens in neutral countries, have no say on whether this is what they want. In my own country the vast majority of people are against the militarisation of Europe, especially a Europe that will have nuclear weapons at its disposal, a Europe where the arms industries are exporting arms to places around the world where there are mass and gross abuses of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at the track record of the European Union on its involvement in many conflict areas around the world, we see that the arms industries have been part of that problem. We need to address that. With respect to the neutral countries, some of the wording in this resolution is extremely ambiguous in relation to collective defence. We in the neutral countries are being told that collective defence is not going to be part of it, but of course when we get in so far then there will be no going out.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I was quite amazed to hear Mr Newton Dunn cite the RUC as a good example of policing. If you look at the human rights organisations around the world that have amassed damning reports on that organisation, it is incredible to put it up as an example. I am sure there are good examples, but the RUC is not one of them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to confine myself to the question of democratic and parliamentary control of this policy. Peace and security are not suitable subjects for Council meetings <span class="italic">in camera</span>. They must be subject to parliamentary control. It is important for decisions on military intervention to remain the responsibility of national parliaments. It is also important for budgetary questions and national defence budgets to continue to be decided in national parliaments. But everything over and above that, all questions of civil policy, come under the jurisdiction of the European Parliament. This European security and defence policy must be subject to parliamentary monitoring in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The President-in-Office has said that transparency and clarity are needed. It was clever to pretend that the aim is to integrate the Western European Union in the European Union, which is why the debates currently being held within the Western European Union are so absurd, trying as they are to invent a new identity for the parliamentary assembly of the Western European Union. Every iota of strength is being used at the moment to define new remits, even going so far as a European assembly for security and defence, yet another committee to add to the confusion, rather than to increase transparency. I am reminded of the policy of the Christmas goose trying to postpone Christmas. It would be good if more transparency were to reign here and if we were to come to accept that the European Parliament is the right forum.</p>
<p class="contents">We attended the NATO assembly a few days ago, where the president of the North Atlantic assembly stated that the Western European Union was merging into the European Union, that the EU had a parliament, that NATO had a parliament and that the WEU assembly therefore had no further <span class="italic">raison d’être</span>. I think that is also our position and account should be taken of it at this Summit.</p>

It is a remarkable achievement. I also wish to congratulate the Council on being able to establish at the last summit the principle of the headline goals. It is important to realise the significance of these headline goals because for once, instead of spending years discussing institutions, the European Union has put results before means. That, as we are already seeing, will drive forward the agenda very rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">If we are to succeed in our ambitions at a price we can afford, we have to ensure that we get better value for money out of defence and, in particular, defence industries. We need a strong, competitive European defence industry. Notwithstanding the takeovers and mergers in the private sector, there is still far too much fragmentation in this area. We still rely heavily on intergovernmental activity. The Western European Union Armaments Group, for example, moves very slowly on the basis of consensus. Even the six EU Member States which two years ago signed a letter of intent on cooperation have still not agreed a framework agreement to implement that letter of intent. We clearly need more urgency in this area and we need a single, coherent framework within which the defence industry can cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I am disappointed to hear what the presidency said about the intention to continue with the work of the Western European Armaments Group. I believe the pillar structure of the EU provides us with the best opportunity for a framework within which industry can operate. Pillar II can provide the common positions on things like arms exports, and we could be working towards a European armaments agency which brings together OCCAR and the Western European Armaments Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has a crucial role in this. The last Commission drove forward the agenda on restructuring the defence industries: there were two communications. This Commission has been completely silent on this issue. It is as if it is running scared from confronting the implications of its role as the guardian of the Treaties. We have to ensure that the single market applies to defence industries as far as possible, and that Article 296 only applies in those areas specified in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">I would urge Commissioner Patten to follow in the footsteps of Commissioners Bangemann and van den Broek to drive forward the Commission's responsibility in delivering an effective and competitive European armaments industry in order to back up the measures we are taking in the political field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon Councils have all made significant contributions in that regard. However, in all truth it must be said that decisions taken at these summits and any that may be taken at Feira will remain little more than aspirational until the Union has the necessary resources to implement such a policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the recent comments of Commissioner Patten when he criticised EU governments for making ringing declarations which they are reluctant to underwrite with money and staff. If Member States are indeed serious about establishing a real security and defence policy then they must put their money where their mouth is.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime we have to be realistic about what we can achieve and at the moment we cannot talk about operational autonomy for any European force. This will always be relative to our dependence and reliance on NATO which still owns the essential military hardware and which enabled EU governments to deploy their troops in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Unless and until we have a sufficient intelligence capability matching that of the US and the transport capabilities to put EU military personnel into world trouble spots quickly, we will continue to need a close working relationship with NATO underpinned by a structured EU-NATO dialogue which is not simply a replication of the WEU/NATO acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">These realities must temper our discussions at Feira and elsewhere as must also the need to keep in mind the status and role of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me conclude by saying I welcome the speculation that the Feira Council will endorse the concept of a rapid reaction police force which would swing into action after completion of military tasks. The experience of Kosovo has underlined the need for such an initiative and I welcome the fact that it may happen at Feira.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has come about because two main groups of members in the European Union have shifted their position: those who believed that NATO alone was responsible for security and defence, and those who believed that security and defence were not a Community affair and should be dealt with by individual states either neutrally or within a pact.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that what is happening today is a positive sign of community and solidarity. I also think that, in the final analysis, Article 5, which has been quoted several times today, should represent the common basis for all members of the European Union, even if this can only be achieved gradually. Kosovo has been mentioned several times today. I think that too one-sided a view is sometimes taken of the lessons to come out of Kosovo and the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, four issues are at stake. First, prevention, of which there was practically none whatsoever in the case of Kosovo. Secondly, deterrence, of which there was certainly too little in the case of Kosovo, because no common will was visible. Thirdly, the facility for rapid, targeted intervention. This functioned perhaps to a certain extent, although the fight about what constitutes the optimum form of intervention blocked a great deal. And fourthly, the restoration and stabilisation of peace, including after military intervention. Developments over the past few days show that it is not as easy as you might think. I am particularly thankful that the question of the police and security forces in Kosovo has been raised several times today, because it is essential to establish security by strengthening the presence of police troops.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the question of developing a system of regional responsibility in Europe which does not fly in the face of the United Nations system, as has been maintained time and again, but which, on the contrary, can be incorporated into the United Nations system and into the ideas of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner Patten has said that we do not necessarily need institutional revolution, perhaps just reforms. But we should try for institutional revolution. As far as the institutions to be set up in the near future referred to today are concerned, I am afraid that we will paint ourselves into a corner. We should not allow too many institutions to exist and the integration of the WEU and the EU forms part of this philosophy.</p>

This is somewhat disingenuous. If this was the intention there would be no need to set up the separate structures which largely exclude the Americans and Canadians and marginalise reliable European allies such as Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past five years NATO has already restructured for the specific purpose of facilitating European action should the alliance as a whole not wish to be engaged. But this apparently is not enough. The real desire is to create something separate from NATO. Of course we want to see the Europeans reforming and enhancing their military capabilities but I fail to see how the continued reductions that we are seeing in European defence budgets, most notably by Germany, demonstrate resolve to make a greater contribution to Western defence efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The amendments we have put forward to the Lalumière resolution are intended to stress the importance of the continued commitment of our North American allies to the security of Europe as a foremost priority, to make it clear that the European Union should only opt to act militarily in agreement with the alliance and when NATO as a whole has chosen not to be engaged, to insist that any rapid reaction force should also be assigned to NATO and in any case should not impact adversely on the capacity of NATO allies to meet their alliance obligations. We want EU decisions relating to the use of military assets, including decisions taken on the basis of a common strategy or when implementing a joint action, to be taken unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">There should not be attempts to create a European armed police force behind the cloak of the common European security and defence policy. The Royal Ulster Constabulary is a fine force with a proud record in fighting terrorism but this is not at all relevant to this particular debate. Our overall concern is that the common European security and defence policy is indeed a further step towards European political integration and that is our fundamental objection.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Events in Kosovo and the whole tragic break up of the former Yugoslavia are proof most painful of Europe’s failings within NATO. One might even say that Europe has entrusted the task of a military presence to the NATO leadership and, at the same time, relaxed its efforts over the years, to the point at which it is now more or less incapable of properly honouring its obligations within NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a psychological explanation for this. If someone, be it a person, a country or a group of countries, considers that it has no initiative to act, it loses interest, neglects its duties or goes through the motions of performing its duties, but there is no substance to them and they are performed perfunctorily. Perhaps the most important outcome of the resolutions of the Cologne, Helsinki and Lisbon summits is precisely the fact that they have restored Europe’s sense of initiative, giving it the motivation needed in order to accept responsibility, make an effort and honour its obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">From this point of view, the draft which we are debating does not constitute a threat to the cohesion of ΝΑΤΟ. On the contrary, a Europe with its own military initiative will take its NATO obligations more seriously. It is the only way in which it can take its NATO obligations seriously and reassure the political forces in the United States which object to American armed forces and American resources being tied up in the defence of Europe. Consequently, Mr President, we must ensure that our immediate decisions are geared towards European unity and the defence of a common border and, sooner or later, that is the point we must reach. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">First, a declaration of an independent role for the European Union in both civil and military security policy within a clearly defined remit, as in the Petersberg tasks for maintaining peace and peace-making.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, a signal to take account of and strengthen the role of the European Parliament in fashioning a common European security and defence policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs to make up lost ground when it comes to a common security and defence policy if you think that its defence spending does not even equal 60% of comparable spending in the USA and only achieves 10% of the operational efficiency of the USA. The specific undertaking to create a European strike force no more than 60 000 strong in order to complete the Petersberg tasks calls for solidarity between all the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The lack of any real common foreign and security policy has been exacerbated by the Balkan crisis, which highlighted the weakness of the European Union in this area. We cannot double the functions of NATO in the area of global security. We cannot build up an expensive parallel structure. But completion of the Petersberg tasks must be guaranteed and the principle that security is indivisible must be applied, which is why mutual support, as anchored in Article 5 of the WEU Treaty, must be open to all sides in a revised EU Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of attaching Article 5 in an additional protocol to a revised Treaty, to which the individual Member States may accede if necessary, therefore represents a reasonable attempt to find a solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After all, crises all over the planet are the predominant issue at the dawn of the twenty-first century. Of course, the current state of the world and the intricacies of the international system also raise other issues and questions which, in my view, form an integral part of the issues and problems which need to inform a specific proposal on European foreign policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to congratulate Mrs Lalumière because she has taken a huge step forward in her report. Not only has she made specific proposals, she has also highlighted the need to find a modus operandi and a modus vivendi for all the means proposed in order to implement European foreign policy. The problem with a European foreign policy is not quantitative. There is no problem with the figures. It is qualitative. The problem lies in the content. Having said this, may I suggest, Minister, that we act with the greatest caution when it comes to questions such as the integration of the Western European Union or relations with ΝΑΤΟ.</p>
<p class="contents">I, fellow members, shall insist above all on the need to find a system, a modus operandi for all the proposals tabled in the House. Because foreign policy nowadays cannot and must not merely be the product of simple intergovernmental cooperation. On the contrary, it must be derived by operating a multi-dimensional structure and system within which the parliamentary aspect plays an important part. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An enormous amount of valuable property has been destroyed. To avoid similar disasters in the future, we are now taking new steps to establish a common European defence and security policy. We are doing this in order to join together in creating tools to safeguard the lynchpin of security, namely freedom and peace in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">I am extremely pleased that this process is going on. Within the framework of the EU’s mandate, this joint commitment is now being carried out and intensified. I think it is important that the EU should concentrate on what it is good at, namely engaging in trade, developing contacts and taking measures to prevent conflicts. It is also important, however, to create credibility through ‘more muscle’ and increased ability to intervene in time. </p>
<p class="contents">If (as it wishes, and is endeavouring, to be) the EU is to be taken seriously in the world, it must also demonstrably be able to take more responsibility in its own area. It is therefore important that we should create structures which cooperate with NATO, for it is there that the competence, capacity, leadership ability and credibility are to be found. The EU has a complementary role, and that is why Mrs Lalumière’s report is so commendable. </p>
<p class="contents">This concept is based upon individual Member States’ fulfilling the commitments they have made. Our main role in the European Parliament is therefore to exercise supervision. I have previously discussed the shrinking defence budgets of the Member States. These defence budgets are shrinking at the same time as we require investment in restructuring and new hardware. </p>
<p class="contents">Since we last discussed this subject, Germany’s supreme commander has resigned in protest, which is as good a sign as any. If our heads of State and government are to have any credibility in the year 2003, they should not only talk in Feira, but must also then return home and review the responsibilities of each country and the commitments they have undertaken to fulfil. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having achieved economic and monetary union, other plans are now being drawn up. We cannot take 50 years to implement these, however. This is the case with the establishment of an effective common European security and defence policy. The Member States must address this issue from a European perspective which can be fully reconciled with NATO commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this was clearly not our desire, the fall of the Berlin wall has obviously not helped with security and defence in Europe. We are therefore now faced with the complex situation in the Balkans, which throws up new problems on a daily basis. The lessons of Kosovo show us how not to act and the challenges in the Mediterranean basin are keeping us alert. After decades of a bipolar world, the situation of unipolarity must be transitory and in this the European Union’s contribution will be decisive. Peace must continue to be the grand plan of European construction but this will not happen by itself. We must therefore have effective mechanisms for managing crises using non-military means, for developing and ensuring the compatibility of the military capabilities of the Member States, for mobilising adequate financial resources in the national and Community budgets and for establishing effective decision-making structures. The choices seem clear, the objective is challenging and its achievement will be decisive. Reforms must be implemented, major financial resources and means must be identified, made compatible and mobilised. The commitment of the Member States is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">The current challenges cannot be deferred or hesitated over. The Feira European Council must be more than an occasion to reaffirm our desires. It must be a turning point characterised by the identification of the necessary financial resources and by the inclusion on the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference of the institutional aspects of the Common European Security and Defence Policy.

Mrs Lalumière’s report is excellent, particularly in its balance and the relevance of many of its observations. The report to be presented by the Portuguese Presidency to the Feira European Council next week will dispel many of the doubts and clarify many of the aspects which we have addressed here. This report is the result of our commitment to carry out in full the mandate established in Helsinki. Regardless of certain differences which are evident here in terms of security and defence cultures, and more so in the defence culture than in the security culture, we believe that we all agree on the need for the European Union to rapidly acquire a crisis management capability at either military or non-military level. We must determine the extent of these mechanisms and the appropriateness of these various dimensions in terms which express the different sensitivities indicated here.</p>
<p class="contents">I must mention one specific point which was raised with regard to amending the Treaty on European Union and other possible amendments to this Treaty at this stage in order possibly to enshrine in law the EU’s current military mechanisms. The Portuguese Presidency’s and the Council’s reading of this issue is that there is no need for an immediate amendment of the Treaty and that the provisions of Article 17 are sufficient to cover the current mechanisms. In any case, the way is clear for future discussion of this issue bearing in mind future developments and what will be enshrined in terms of the definitive structures.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the EU-NATO link, all the concerns expressed about how the creation of a common European security and defence policy may reflect negatively on the relationship with NATO are unfounded. On the contrary, we believe that this mechanism will allow us to independently reinforce a particular dimension without creating any type of barrier in our relationship with NATO. Moreover, the mechanisms which we are implementing to link Member States who are in NATO with those who are not and, at the same time, the formulas which we are using to link the European Union in terms of security and defence with NATO partners outside the EU seem to have found the right balance. We hope that the Feira European Council will enshrine these as the definitive model in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of parliamentary representation, we obviously appreciate the sensitivity of this House with regard to its greater involvement in these matters. However, we believe that this issue of representation precedes that of security and defence and in fact lies at the level of the Common Foreign and Security Policy and the well-known claims made by Parliament with regard to its involvement in this wider policy. This point has been and is being discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference and we will see to what extent these claims are accepted. In any case, it is essential, particularly with regard to the national parliaments, to guarantee their association with any future development in this area. We too share these concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">Civilian crisis management has been one of the aspects highlighted by the Portuguese Presidency, particularly bearing in mind the concerns felt within the Council and also expressed in this House about this dimension. The day after tomorrow the first meeting of the Committee for Civilian Crisis Management will take place. This Committee was specifically created during the Portuguese Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the last issue of the Armaments Group, this group is continuing its work and will remain active within the WEU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have heard plenty of good sense in the course of it, as one would anticipate. I shall be mercifully brief. I do not want to come between Parliament and its preprandial democratic duty. However, there are a couple of points I should like to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there was some discussion about the sort of institutional arrangements that we need to make, not least in the Commission, to cope with the responsibilities of adequately implementing a common foreign and security policy and, in particular, to ensure that we can play our own role in the non-military aspects of conflict prevention and crisis management. We need our own crisis units in the Commission, but we should keep that small. I want to make it absolutely clear that I have no intention of duplicating within the Commission the sort of structures which are necessarily going to be created in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mrs Lalumière spoke very pointedly about the importance of taking decisions much more quickly. I am bound to say that is one of my obsessions. It is one of my obsessions in relation to, for instance, MEDA regulation and in relation to the Balkans. We brought forward a new regulation for speeding up our delivery of assistance to the Balkans. We have made proposals about asymmetric trade measures for the Balkans, which are now being considered by the Council and, in due course, will be considered by Parliament. We have made proposals for cleaning up the Danube. Those are all areas where we have brought forward proposals. I hope we can get quick decisions. Unless we can take decisions more quickly, before crises happen, then the question of how quickly we take decisions when crises have actually broken will come up a great deal more frequently. So in my judgement the importance of taking decisions more quickly is one which is relevant at every stage of our activities. The sooner we face up to that the better, not least for the credibility of a common foreign and security policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again I thank the honourable Member for her superb report. I can only imagine the amount of work that went into it. All of us know the amount of wisdom that went into it as well.</p>
