<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 11 and 12 December 2008, the European Council approved the European Economic Recovery Plan submitted by the Commission in November. The Plan includes immediate budgetary measures amounting to EUR 200 billion, which comprise on the one hand measures at Community level amounting to EUR 30 billion and on the other hand national measures worth EUR 170 billion. Besides these measures there are also a number of priority actions which the EU should undertake within the framework of the Lisbon Strategy, the aim of which is to adapt the EU economy to long-term challenges, to boost potential growth and to carry out structural reforms.</p>
<p>The ECOFIN Council has always put a strong emphasis on close coordination of the steps taken by Member States in response to the current economic situation, including steps in support of the financial sector, where it has been necessary to take account of possible cross-border effects of such measures (see the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 7 November 2008), or in the case of fiscal stimulus measures (see for example the conclusions of the ECOFIN Council of 2 December 2008), the coordination of which is essential for ensuring a greater impact on the EU economy and a greater boost to confidence on the markets.</p>
<p>At its meeting on 19 and 20 March 2009, the European Council evaluated the method for implementing the Recovery Plan: the overall level of budget support, including the discretionary measures of governments and the effects of the automatic economic stabilisers, amounted to 3.3% of EU GDP (more than EUR 400 billion), which will help to boost investments, support demand, create new jobs and steer the EU towards a low-carbon economy. However, there will be a certain delay before the actual effects of these measures on the economy become apparent.</p>
<p>As far as measures at Community level are concerned, the December meeting of the European Council supported the idea of rapid measures by the European Social Fund for supporting employment, directed especially towards the groups of citizens most under threat. These measures should include more advance payments and the simplification of procedures. The European Council also called for the simplification of procedures and faster implementation of programmes financed from the structural funds, with the aim of boosting infrastructure investments in the energy sector.</p>
<p>In accordance with this, several amendments to existing legislation have been drafted. Firstly, there is draft Council Regulation (EC) No 284/2009 of 7 April 2009 amending Regulation (EC) No 1083/2006 laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund concerning certain provisions relating to financial management. This draft should speed up access to financial resources.</p>
<p>Secondly, the draft regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1080/2006 on the European Regional Development Fund, concerning the eligibility of investments in energy projects and renewable energy in the housing sector, should enable all Member States to boost investment in this sector. Finally, there is the draft Regulation of the European Parliament and the Council amending Regulation (EC) No 1081/2006 on the European Social Fund, which aims to extend the types of expenditure eligible for contributions from the ESF. The objective is to simplify administrative procedures and expand the range of funded projects.</p>
<p>At their informal meeting on 1 March 2009, the Heads of State or Government also emphasised the importance of measures based on the use of existing instruments such as the ESF in respect of mitigating the negative impact of the financial crisis on employment.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 19 and 20 March 2009, the European Council expressed confidence in the ability of the EU to solve the financial and economic crisis. It reviewed the important fiscal stimulus measures currently being implemented in the EU economy (in excess of EUR 400 billion), and emphasised that joint action and coordination was a fundamental component of the European strategy for economic recovery and that Europe was doing everything necessary to restore growth.</p>
<p>The Council also emphasised its role in the efforts to shorten and mitigate the recession in the European single market. It emphasised the need to restore credit flows to companies and households and agreed on accelerated agreements concerning legislative proposals negotiated to date in relation to the financial sector. In June the Council will adopt the first decision on strengthening regulation and supervision of the EU financial sector. The decision will be based on the Commission proposals together with a detailed discussion of the report from the group headed by Jacques de Larosière in the Council.</p>
<p>Based on the EU’s own experiences and its wish to make a significant contribution to the creation of future international regulation of the financial sector, the European Council has set out the position of the Union in relation to the G20 summit which took place in London on 2 April.</p>
<p>The Council has also welcomed progress achieved particularly over the question of advance payments from the structural funds and the Cohesion Fund, the agreement over a voluntary application of reduced VAT rates and the European Investment Bank measures aimed at stimulating funding options for small and medium-sized enterprises. It has called for agreement to be reached more quickly on changes to the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund.</p>
<p>The Presidency agrees that it is essential to maintain general confidence in EU measures for combating the economic crisis and it will continue to monitor the situation. The institutions of the EU are determined to solve the current problems, particularly concerning the provision of sufficient volumes of credit to companies and households and restoring general confidence on the markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0151"></a>

<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s opinion that the energy performance of buildings is important for the achievement of Community objectives on increased energy efficiency and for other areas such as reducing greenhouse gas emissions and increasing the security of supplies, since buildings account for about 40% of energy consumption in the Community. In its conclusions of 2 March this year the Council particularly mentioned measures aimed at increasing the energy performance of buildings, such as support for green technologies, the development of energy efficient production systems and materials, market instruments for energy efficiency, changes to the operating programmes of structural funds and innovative models of financing.</p>
<p>The measures currently implemented for boosting the energy performance of buildings were established on the basis of existing Community laws, particularly Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 16 December 2002 on the energy performance of buildings<a href="#defann_2_1" name="refann_2_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. On 17 November 2008 the Commission submitted to the Council the draft of a reworked version of this Directive; the honourable Member is the rapporteur of this draft. The Council is devoting considerable attention to the draft, which forms part of the package on energy efficiency. A progress report on the four legislative proposals in the area of energy efficiency will be submitted to the Council in June.</p>
<p>As far as the details set out in the second part of the question are concerned, the Council’s conclusions of 19 February 2009 mentioned and reaffirmed commitments in the area of greenhouse gas emission cuts and energy efficiency set out at the meeting of the European Council in March 2007, and also mentioned and confirmed the agreement reached in December 2008 concerning the package of measures on climate change and energy. The Council stressed the need for short-term and long-term priority measures. In this context it stated that the development of low-carbon energy­efficient systems should be an important element of the energy policy action plan for Europe after 2010.</p>
<p>The Council has therefore invited the Commission to identify essential legislative and non-legislative measures and the appropriate financial resources and to draw up an initiative for financially sustainable energy; the aim of this initiative, which will be a joint project of the Commission and the European Investment Bank, will be to mobilise extensive financial investment resources from capital markets, in relation to which it will be necessary to take into account expert assessments from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international financial institutions.</p>
<p>As concerns the question of increasing the proportion of the EFRD targeted at investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in residential buildings from 3% to 15%, it is important to note that the total volume of potential investments in energy efficiency and renewable energy sources in residential buildings was increased from 3% to 4% of total allocations from the EFRD as a result of an agreement in the Council<a href="#defann_2_2" name="refann_2_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Following difficult negotiations, this limit was approved by all of the Member States at the level of COREPER (in December 2008) as a compromise and subsequently approved by the European Parliament at first reading (in April 2009). According to the statements of the experts from the area of structural measures, this ceiling represents a sufficient level of funding for effectively boosting energy efficiency across part of the existing housing stock with the objective of supporting social cohesion. It should be added that Member States which acceded to the EU on or after 1 May 2004 are able to use the EFRD for other options amounting to up to 2% of total allocations from this fund, which include improving the environment in areas where the physical decay of buildings and social exclusion are taking place or may take place. The recognised costs also include energy saving investments in existing housing stock in these localities.</p>
<p>As far as the limits are concerned the new measures enabling EU support for housing are entirely relevant, sufficient and welcome. We would like to say in conclusion that this part of the recovery plan will probably be adopted in the coming weeks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council would like to point out to the honourable Member that under Article 211(1) of the EC Treaty the Commission has a duty to ensure the application of Community law in all of the Member States. The honourable Member may therefore consult the latest annual report on monitoring the application of Community law (2007), which the Commission submitted to Parliament on 18 November 2008<a href="#defann_3_1" name="refann_3_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>The Council would also like to draw the honourable Member’s attention to Articles 220, 226, 227 and 234 of the EC Treaty relating to the powers of the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>It is not therefore a direct task of the Council to deal with the enforcement and application of existing laws.</p>
<p>With regard to the foregoing, the Commission informs the Council regularly about the current situation regarding the application of internal market directives in national law and about ongoing proceedings over non-fulfilment of this obligation. The Council received this information (known as the Internal Market Scoreboard) on 25 February and 25 September 2008 and also recently on 5 March 2009<a href="#defann_3_2" name="refann_3_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As far as the specific topic of the common fisheries policy is concerned, I can also inform the honourable Member that the topic was discussed by the relevant ministers on 18 February 2008, within the context of an informal meeting on the issue of monitoring and enforcing rules in this area in connection with Special Report No 7 of the Court of Auditors on the control, inspection and sanction systems relating to the rules on conservation of Community fisheries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>On 10 March 2009 it will be 50 years since the Dalai Lama was forced to flee his country.</p>
<p>Under international public law a state may continue to exist for decades in spite of being annexed by an occupying power. Non-recognition of this illegal situation by third countries is very important in this connection. For example, most Western countries never formally recognised the illegal annexation of the Baltic States by the Soviet Union. In 1991 these republics stated that they were the same states as the ones which had existed in the inter-war period (principle of legal continuity) and that they were therefore not new states. This was recognised by the EC (as then constituted) in its declaration of 27 August 1991.</p>
<p>Does the Council consider that the occupation and annexation of Tibet is in conflict with international law? Does it not consider the 50<span class="sup">th</span> anniversary of the flight of the Dalai Lama an appropriate moment to affirm the principle of the legal continuity of Tibet, in order to prevent the disappearance of the Tibetan state?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The question of recognising third countries is a matter for each Member State. Therefore the Council does not take any position over this question.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Council addresses the question of Tibet mainly within the framework of human rights policies. The EU is pursuing a human rights dialogue (the aims of which were set out in the conclusions of the Council on China in 2001 and 2004) within the framework of the comprehensive partnership with China, where the question of human rights in connection with Tibet is tabled regularly. The issue of human rights also arises at meetings within the framework of political dialogue and at other high-level meetings, and this will continue to be the case.</p>
<p>On 19 March 2008 the Presidency published on behalf of the EU a public declaration in which the EU called for restraint and appealed to the Chinese Government to solve the problems of Tibetans in relation to human rights issues and called on the Chinese authorities and the Dalai Lama and his representatives to begin a businesslike and constructive dialogue aimed at achieving a sustainable solution which would be acceptable to all parties while fully respecting Tibetan culture, religion and identity. At the meeting of the UN Commission on Human Rights in Geneva on 17 March 2009, the Presidency made a declaration on behalf of the EU in which it again emphasised that in China, including Tibet, it should be possible for everyone who so desires to express their views peacefully without fear of reprisal. Within the framework of a general regular review several EU Member States formulated recommendations on Tibet which were handed over to representatives of the Chinese Government.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0162"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The global recession is having a particularly severe impact in the countries of South-East Europe. All of these countries are having to cope with higher costs of refinancing, lower fiscal revenues, weaker flows of direct foreign investment and reduced remittances from abroad. However, some countries are more affected than others. One of the important factors in this context is the extent to which households and enterprises have taken on loans in currencies other than the national currency where such loans must however be serviced in the national currency. As a number of currencies of South-East European countries have weakened it is increasingly difficult for borrowers to keep up with their obligations and in some cases they have even had to stop paying back their loans.</p>
<p>The Presidency is well aware of this problem and within the framework of the last meeting of foreign ministers (Gymnich) held on 27 and 28 March 2009 in Hluboka nad Vltavou, a working breakfast of the Deputy Prime Minister for European Affairs Alexandr Vondra and the foreign ministers of the West Balkan states was devoted to the economic situation in the region.</p>
<p>The EU has adopted a series of measures for supporting economic and social consolidation in South-East Europe and for mitigating the negative impacts of the global economic and financial crisis. Specific measures include a major increase in levels of lending to all sectors, continuing efforts to boost liquidity in the banking sector, increased support through the ‘crisis response’ package within the framework of the instrument for pre-accession assistance and increased efforts on coordination between the European Commission and international financial institutions in connection with the investment framework for the Western Balkans.</p>
<p>The Commission has created a ‘crisis response’ package worth EUR 120 million enabling the mobilisation of EUR 500 million in loans from international financial institutions. The measures are aimed at energy efficiency and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. Implementation should start in September this year.</p>
<p>Besides this the European Investment Bank has supported the efforts of the World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development in connection with the refinancing of the banking sector in Central and Eastern Europe, including facilitating coordination between the host and the domestic bodies for supervision and regulation.</p>
<p>During 2009 international financial institutions will make available to the Western Balkan countries and Turkey credit facilities of EUR 5.5 billion for the purposes of refinancing the banking sector. The European Investment Bank will provide EUR 2 billion of this total amount and the rest will come from international financial institutions.</p>
<p>Increased loans to banks in the EU within the framework of the European economic recovery plan should also contribute to greater volumes of loans to subsidiary companies in South-East Europe.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at its March sitting the European Council welcomed the intention of the Commission to propose doubling the limit of the EU’s support system for assisting in balance of payment problems to EUR 50 billion.</p>
<p>The Council repeatedly expressed its full support for a European perspective in respect of the Western Balkan states, the final aim of which would be EU membership, provided these countries fulfil the essential conditions and requirements. The current global economic and financial crisis must not be allowed to affect this perspective.</p>
<p>The Council is of the opinion that the existing instruments, systems and procedures are adequate, but it will continue to monitor the situation constantly and to ensure that all countries that experience a temporary economic imbalance receive the appropriate assistance. In the interests of achieving maximum levels of complementarity and the mutual cohesion of the measures it is of absolutely fundamental importance for all of the available instruments and resources to be properly coordinated.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0166"></a>

<p>.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concern over the need to develop coordinated response policies capable of addressing the direct social impact of the crisis, especially on the most threatened groups of citizens.</p>
<p>These priorities were set out in the joint report on social protection and social inclusion and in the document on key questions which the Council adopted on 9 March 2009 and submitted to the spring part-session of the European Council. As we approach the Lisbon strategy target year approved in 2000, and bearing in mind the current economic crisis, it is all the more necessary to adopt a strong political commitment aimed at achieving the common goals of social protection and social inclusion while at the same time respecting the powers of Member States.</p>
<p>The joint report emphasised the need to encourage Member States in their efforts to implement comprehensive strategies in the fight against poverty and the social exclusion of children, including accessible and affordable high quality child care. We must continue to strive for a solution to homelessness and very serious forms of exclusion and to support the social inclusion of migrants. We must give special attention in particular to the fact that new risk groups may appear, e.g. young workers and persons entering the labour market, and also new risks.</p>

<p>The Special Court for Sierra Leone is financed through voluntary contributions from the international community. On 11 March 2009 the relevant preparatory body of the Council was informed by a representative of the head of the court office of the Special Court for Sierra Leone about the current situation of the court. The preparatory body noted an immediate request for USD 6 million and a shortfall of USD 31 million which the court needs in order to complete its mandate. The activities to date of the Special Court for Sierra Leone were evaluated as positive.</p>
<p>Individual EU Member States will decide on possible contributions to the further financing of the Special Court.</p>
<p>Since the activities of the Special Court began, EU Member States have contributed a total sum in excess of USD 78 million. The European Commission has contributed an additional EUR 2.5 million and has also decided to contribute a further EUR 1 million through the 10th European Development Fund. In total the Special Court has received contributions of almost USD 160 million from the international community (including the EU).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0176"></a>

<p>Jerusalem City Council has decided to demolish 88 housing units, including 114 houses inhabited by some 1 500 Palestinian residents in the Al-Bustan district in Silwan – East Jerusalem. Other Palestinian families in the Abbasieh district and in the Shu’fat refugee camp have received new demolition and eviction notices, raising to 179 the total number of Palestinian houses that are to be demolished.</p>
<p>According to B'Tselem, the Israeli authorities have demolished approximately 350 houses in East Jerusalem since 2004. Peace Now says that at least 73 300 new Israeli housing units will be built along the West Bank. Twenty Israeli writers and researchers, amongst them Amos Oz and David Grossman, called on him to cancel the orders because policies like this violate ‘the most basic human rights’. Even a confidential EU report says that ‘Israel's actions in and around Jerusalem constitute one of the most acute challenges to Israeli-Palestinian peace-making’.</p>
<p>Does the Council not feel that it should act to stop these policies, using all the means at its disposal, including suspension of the Euro-Mediterranean association agreement with Israel in accordance with Article 2 thereof?

<p>The Council is deeply concerned about the threat to demolish 90 houses in the neighbourhood of Al-Bustan/Silwan, close to the Old Town in East Jerusalem, and about the publication of a notice regarding the forced removal of several Palestinian families. The Presidency communicated these concerns to the Israeli authorities on behalf of the EU and reminded them of their obligations arising from the road map and international law. It also called on Israel to stop issuing these notices immediately. The Presidency also made these concerns public through a declaration on both issues.</p>
<p>The EU and Israel have developed mutual relations over several years in many areas. It is clear that a further deepening of relations will depend on shared interests and objectives, which particularly include resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict through a sensible solution based on the existence of two states living side by side in peace and security.</p>
<p>The Presidency has made it clear to the Israelis on several occasions that the continuing Israeli activities in East Jerusalem and the surrounding area constitute a significant barrier to the achievement of progress in the peace process and threaten the outlook for a viable Palestinian state.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0178"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 9 December 2008, after initial operational capability was successfully achieved throughout the territory of Kosovo in numbers corresponding to those of the UNMIK mission, the deployment of EULEX mission personnel continued and on 6 April 2009 full operational capability was declared.</p>
<p>The mission currently numbers around 1 700 deployed international staff, while the full complement should be almost 2 500 personnel. There are 25 Member States represented and the mission also includes contributions from six other countries (the US, Norway, Turkey, Croatia, Switzerland and Canada).</p>
<p>In accordance with the planning documents, members of the mission are deployed with all of their local opposite numbers in the relevant ministries, police stations, courts, government offices, penal institutions and other selected administrative bodies, for example the finance and customs authorities.</p>
<p>The deployment of the mission will enable effective fulfilment of its mandate from December, not only through the implementation of tasks in the area of monitoring and providing expert guidance and consultancy, but also through fulfilment of the mission’s executive mandate. Within the framework of the mandate the mission is successfully fulfilling tasks relating to security, for example through the deployment of the formed police units and integrated police units (FPU/IPU) as the second element in the security response, all of it on time and in numbers corresponding to the immediate threat which was present in the period around New Year.</p>
<p>From day one the mission has also ensured an effective presence at police stations in the northern section, at gates 1 and 31 and at the court in Mitrovica. It has taken over from UNMIK supervision of all operational activities carried out in the northern section relating to the legal state. There are 120 EULEX personnel deployed in the north every day, including:</p>
<p>– a permanent presence of customs advisers at gates 1 and 31 (collecting commercial data which is forwarded to the authorities in Belgrade and Pristina);</p>
<p>– in addition to the presence of customs advisers at these gates there is also a permanent presence of advisers from the border units monitoring the situation and also members of the special police units (IPU);</p>
<p>– around 15 police advisers in four police stations in the northern section;</p>
<p>– visible police presence is achieved through the special police guards (IPU) in Mitrovica and in the court there; these guards have the role of escorting and protecting the seven judges and state representatives belonging to the EULEX mission who are active in the court in Mitrovica, together with a number of lawyers. These judges and state representatives belonging to the EULEX mission have begun to mount criminal proceedings and to make rulings in the court, particularly in connection with recent events.</p>
<p>There have been no reports of significant security events directly targeted against the mission and a consolidation and stabilisation of the mission’s presence is under way, in connection with the full implementation of its mandate.</p>
<p>As far as the legal framework is concerned, the details are currently being worked out, particularly in respect of the northern section, so that the mission can function on the basis of a single legal and customs framework founded on the consolidation and development of valid laws applied by the local bodies.</p>
<p>The mission has some important tasks ahead of it, especially concerning the reintegration of local staff at the court in Mitrovica, and the reintegration of around 300 Kosovo Serb police officers south of the River Ibar, who have not been on duty since 17 February, but based on the current situation concerning the mission it can be assumed that a successful implementation of its mandate within the territory of Kosovo will be possible.</p>
<p>The preparations for the EULEX mission would not have succeeded without the establishment of an EU planning team with its own budget, through which it was possible to finance the deployment of a significant number of the personnel required for the planning phase as well as the initial deployment of the mission itself. In view of the delayed deployment it will not be necessary in the first year of the mission to spend all of the financial resources of EUR 205 million which were allocated to the joint operation from February 2008; the current EULEX budget of EUR 120 million will suffice to cover the costs of the mission up to the summer of 2009.</p>
<p>As far as the administrative side is concerned, the development of the EULEX mission has faced significant problems over uncertainties relating to the takeover of equipment and buildings of the UNMIK mission, as well as delays with the supply of armoured vehicles on the part of the framework contractor. Fulfilment of the logistical needs of the mission has also been made more difficult by the fact that EULEX is the first civilian mission within the ESDP framework to be given an executive mandate, as well as the sensitive political situation in Northern Kosovo. However, we have now managed to overcome most of these problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0182"></a>

<p>The Council agrees that the issues raised by the honourable Member are significant, and it emphasises once again that it is important for the European Community and the Member States to achieve greater coordination of their activities in the area of research and technological development and to ensure that Member States’ policies and Community policies are interlinked.</p>
<p>In this context the Council, in the conclusions from its sittings on 1 and 2 December 2008 on joint research planning in Europe, emphasised in response to significant social changes the important role of the Community’s framework programme for research and technological development and related instruments, such as ERA-NET, ERA-NET+ and relevant initiatives pursuant to Article 169 of the EC Treaty, in the mobilisation of scientific and financial resources of the Member States in order to implement initiatives of common interest in the area of research and development. Apart from this the Council acknowledges the importance of existing activities aimed at coordinating programmes implemented by national agencies and research organisations in more Member States and at regional level, through international organisations and also through cross-border and inter-governmental initiatives in this area (EUREKA, COST). The Council also calls on Member States to consider making their internal programmes more open, where appropriate.</p>
<p>The sitting on 1 and 2 December 2008 adopted conclusions on joint planning in which it called on Member States to establish a high level joint planning group, the aim of which would be to identify topics which should be the subject of joint planning in response to major social challenges.</p>
<p>In the document on key issues in the area of competitiveness and innovation, which the Council adopted on 5 March and submitted to the spring session of the European Council, Member States were invited to cooperate with this high level group in order to make it possible to identify the main social challenges and solve them within the framework of joint planning. Topics should be developed actively in consultation with all of the relevant interested parties so that the Council will be able to adopt the initiatives by 2010 at the latest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0185"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU and Niger are conducting a general political dialogue through a forum, on the basis of Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. The first session of the dialogue took place on 17 March 2009 at the Niger Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation. The key points of the dialogue on which both parties agreed included the economy and the social situation (including the process of poverty reduction and social development, economic growth, food and the fight against corruption), the proper administration of public affairs and fundamental rights, democratisation, and regional and sub-regional integration (including economic development and infrastructure).</p>
<p>The dialogue continues and other sessions are planned before the end of the Czech Presidency, particularly in relation to preparations for the forthcoming elections. However, the dialogue under Article 8 is also a suitable forum for solving questions raised by MEPs, including the application of the principles of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in the mining industry, which Niger signed up to in 2005.</p>
<p>In the strategic document for Niger (the 10th EDF) it is stated that before the end of 2006 the Niger government had confirmed its intention to establish – through a revision of the mining law – that 10% of mining royalties would be allocated to local development in the regions affected by mining.</p>
<p>Through its Sysmin programme, the EU is providing within the framework of the 9th EDF a contribution of EUR 35 million which is targeted, among other things, at improving work conditions and safety at work in the mining sector.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU is at present negotiating a general plan with special emphasis on security and development aspects, the aim of which is to solve - together with Niger and other countries of the region - the serious problems facing these countries. In this context the socio-economic conditions of the inhabitants of the north of the country will be studied in greater detail.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0187"></a>

<p>(CS) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding either on the Council or on its members, was not delivered orally in the time allotted to questions to the Council at the 2009 April part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council shares the honourable Member’s concerns relating to the difficult situation on the milk market. After an unprecedented period of record prices for milk and dairy products in 2007 and early 2008, European producers now face weak and uncertain markets characterised by a sharp drop in global dairy product prices.</p>
<p>At the Council sitting of 23 March, there was an extensive exchange of views on the difficult situation facing the milk market and account was taken of a memorandum that was supported by a number of delegates.</p>
<p>In this context it can be said that the legal framework regulating the market in milk and dairy products has changed considerably over the past two years after the Council adopted the ‘mini-milk package’ in September 2007. From 1 April 2008 the national quotas for milk have increased by 2% and in January 2009 a package was adopted under the title of ‘Health Check’.</p>
<p>The new legal framework was established with a view to the long-term competitiveness of European producers. The effects of market competition must be counterbalanced by existing instruments within the framework of market support measures.</p>
<p>In this regard the honourable Member is surely aware of the fact that the Commission has already adopted market support measures, including the introduction of support for private storage facilities for butter and interventions for butter and skimmed milk powder as well as the reintroduction of export subsidies for all dairy products. The Commission informs the Council regularly about the situation on the milk market.</p>
<p>The Commission must submit further proposals on this matter to the Council. In this regard the Commission has expressed its readiness to assess the possibility of expanding the range of dairy products for which it is possible to provide support within the framework of the regime for distributing milk to schools. However, it stated that it is not ready to restart discussions on the ‘Health Check’ package.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0195"></a>

These events included a meeting of the European Disability Forum, which took place in Prague on 28 February to 1 March 2009.</p>
<p>A forthcoming international conference called ‘Europe without Barriers’, which has been organised at the end of April by the Czech National Council of Persons with Disabilities, will take place under the sponsorship of Czech Minister of Labour and Social Affairs Petr Nečas. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is sure to be on the conference agenda.</p>
<p>Close cooperation with representatives of European organisations of persons with disabilities has already started with the preparation of a draft of the said treaty and it will definitely receive a fresh impulse once the treaty has been ratified and implementation has begun.</p>
<p>The second report of the high level working group for the area of disabilities, which deals with the implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, will be presented to the Council meeting on employment, social policy, health and consumer protection in June 2009.

<p>(EN) The Commission adopted an Evaluation Report on the motor vehicle block exemption Regulation<a href="#defann_18_2" name="refann_18_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> in May 2008. In this report, the Commission underlined that access to technical information and alternative sources of spare parts are essential for independent repairers to compete with authorised dealer networks. We believe competition in the automotive aftermarket is essential for ensuring consumer choice and reliable repair services at affordable prices.</p>
<p>The Commission is currently reviewing several options, and is taking into account views expressed in a public consultation we have conducted, and we are ready to ensure an appropriate regime for motor vehicle distribution and servicing remains in place once the current Block Exemption expires in May 2010.</p>
<p>No decision about the Commission's preferred policy has been taken yet. However, any future framework should safeguard repairers' access to technical information and to alternative sources of spare parts.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that notwithstanding the future policy in the competition framework, detailed provisions on access to information for independent operators are introduced by Regulations 715/2007 and 692/2008 on the type-approval of Euro 5 and Euro 6 light-duty vehicles. Euro VI legislation on the type-approval of heavy-duty vehicles, currently in the final stage of adoption by the Council, imposes similar requirements, for which the Commission is preparing implementing legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Adult stem cell research is an active field, which is advancing in a dynamic way as new knowledge becomes available, and where Europe has a strong presence. Adult stem cells form the basis for some treatments already in the clinic, such as bone marrow transplantation for leukaemia and repair treatments for bone injury; and recently, European scientists implanted the first tissue engineered trachea, which had been made with the use of the patient's own stem cells.</p>
<p>The EU has funded adult stem cell research in successive Research Framework Programmes, including in the current Seventh Framework Programme of the European Community for research, technological development and demonstration activities (2007-2013) (FP7). Following the first two calls for proposals under the Health priority of FP7, the EU is funding 8 projects involving therapeutic use of adult stem cells (table attached). Together, these projects represent an EU contribution of around €41 million; further projects cannot be excluded in the future.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the scientific community indicates human embryonic stem cells as a potential source for regenerative medicine and tissue replacement after injury or disease, particularly when adult cells are unsuitable or unavailable. Human embryonic stem cells are a reference standard for judging quality and usefulness of other types of cells. Research on human embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells needs to continue in parallel and many EU projects compare cells from different sources. All sources of stem cells are part of a research effort to expand our knowledge of how cells function, what fails in disease, and how the first stages of human development occur. It is this combined knowledge that will ultimately generate safe and effective therapies.</p>
<p>Following its institutional remit, the Commission manages FP7 as adopted in co-decision by the Parliament and the Council, where research involving the use of human embryonic stem cells is eligible for EU funding under strict ethics conditions.</p>
<p>All EU research proposals involving human embryonic stem cells are subject to double ethical review, at national (or local) level as well as at European level, and are submitted to a Member State Regulatory Committee, guaranteeing that projects that come through the system are sound ethically and scientifically. The European Group on Ethics of science and new technologies has issued an Opinion on the ethics review of FP7 human embryonic stem cell projects following President Barroso's request<a href="#defann_19_1" name="refann_19_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>Currently, 85% of European public research funding is spent nationally without any transnational collaboration between programmes or competition between researchers from different Member States. National programmes often unnecessarily duplicate each other or lack the scope and depth required to make a significant impact on these major challenges. National research on major societal challenges such as renewable energies, climate change or brain diseases will have more impact if efforts are combined at the European level.</p>
<p>Does the Commission agree that combining the national programmes into a joint research agenda could provide the critical mass needed to achieve just that, to the benefit of European citizens?</p>

<p>(EN) The EU is facing challenges today that no single state or region can address alone. Think about the need to tackle food shortages, and climate and energy crises. No Member State can address these challenges efficiently alone - we need joint and coordinated action at European, if not global, level.</p>
<p>Yet today barely 15 % of European publicly financed civil R&amp;D is financed in partnership and coordinated between Member States, either in the Community Framework Programme or in inter-governmental partnerships such as ESA, CERN or EUREKA - the remaining 85% of the European public research funding is defined and spent at national level. The share of research activities which is jointly defined or implemented remains insufficient lacks strategic focus as well as the scale and scope to address effectively the common challenges of our time.</p>
<p>That is why there is a need to work more closely together and why the Commission presented the Communication on Joint Programming in research<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. Joint Programming is about making research in Europe more strategic, more focused and more effective.</p>
<p>Joint Programming is not about the Commission taking control of national research programmes and budgets. It is about setting up partnerships between Member States and about making the best use of resources - money and brains. It is based on Member States getting together to develop common visions how to address major societal challenges and to define and implement Strategic Research Agendas.</p>
<p>Regarding the second question on avoiding duplication of research efforts, it needs to be said that some duplication of efforts can be good, if different research teams compete for the same objective. However, in certain areas, hundreds of similar projects are funded and reviewed independently by several countries. The aim of Joint Programming is about creating a process which brings more strategy and coordination in the panoply of available instruments. It is about more efficient and more effective use of national money. Member States have nominated representatives to a high level group on Joint Programming, to jointly identify priority topics for future Joint Programming activities. The Commission expects this process to be finalised before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>Joint Programming is a Member-States-led process, but of course, the Commission is there to support and identify possible value-added vis-à-vis its own instruments, notably 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme, to maximise the effects of any joint investment of national resources.</p>
<p>On the relation between Joint Programming and Article 169 initiatives it has to be understood that Joint Programming is a process which lies upstream of any decision with regard to the choice and combination of appropriate instruments and resources (either national or at Community level) that are necessary for implementation. The shared vision, the common research agenda and the proportionate commitment of competent authorities are the heart of this process, which may lead to Joint Programming Initiatives that are very different in nature. While Joint Programming builds on the experience of ERA-NETs (cooperation between similar R&amp;D programmes of Member States) and on Article 169 initiatives (a common programme on specific topic), it goes beyond these by adding an element of foresight, of strategic programme planning and of aligning various national and regional resources to achieve common objectives. Of course an Article 169 initiative or a European Research Infrastructure or any other instrument of FP7 could be part of implementation of a Joint Programming, but it is mainly about aligning and putting together national resources.</p>
<p>Joint Programming has an enormous potential in the European research landscape and can change the way in which research is thought about and carried out. In that sense, it is a test case for the ERA 2020 vision.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission supports and complements the communication efforts of the Parliament and national authorities by carrying out thematic, awareness-raising activities of various kinds at both European and local levels. Significant communication work is being organised jointly, but there is also scope for each party's own actions.</p>
<p>Messages by the Commission focus on the EU as a whole and demonstrate what exactly the EU has achieved in policy areas of direct relevance to the life of citizens. They highlight the real added value of collective action at the European level, and demonstrate that there are issues that cannot be tackled by a Member State alone (climate change and environment, consumer safety and health, immigration policy, terrorism threats, safe supply of energy etc).</p>
<p>The awareness-raising activities address all Member States and all voting age citizens. Whilst respecting the overall uniformity of the activities, the identification of the themes and the messages has been tailored to the specific situation of each Member State. Nevertheless, most people would like to see the focus on economic issues affecting everyday life (unemployment, growth, purchasing power). There is also considerable interest in security and climate change related issues.</p>
<p>However, according to the latest Eurobarometer (carried out in October/November 2008) 26% of the electorate was aware of the timing of the European Parliament (EP) elections, and only 30% indicated an intention to vote. Therefore, targeted action is needed to reach social groups with low level of interest and willingness to participate. These groups vary somewhat from country to country but generally include young people, women, and people with lower level of education.</p>
<p>The Commission deploys communication tools favoured by citizens, including the AV media (radio and TV), and the internet. TV and radio clips will illustrate the priority topics of the EP elections. A multimedia action targeting young people will aim at getting young people to cast their vote. In addition, the Commission (in cooperation with the European Centre for Journalism) supports a blogging project involving 81 young journalists from EU-27 on EP elections issues<a href="#defann_22_1" name="refann_22_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>

<p>(EN) Eurobarometer polls have shown that, compared to other EU Member States, the level of knowledge in Ireland of the EU is below the EU-27 average (for example, behind that of France, Denmark and the Netherlands that have also held a referendum on EU issues). Therefore, the Commission is continuing working to contribute to improve communication and information on European issues in Ireland.</p>
<p>The Commission communication activities in Ireland are a response to the conclusions of the Oireachtas sub-committee's report of November 2008, which identified serious lacunae in communication on Europe in Ireland, as well as to requests from the Irish authorities also responding to the Oireachtas report. These activities are planned for a period of several years and aim to tackle the long-term problem of lack of knowledge about the EU in Ireland.</p>
<p>It is worth underlining once more that responsibility for the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty and therefore for the referendum campaign lies with the Irish government.</p>
<p>A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Communicating Europe in Partnership was signed on 29 January 2009 between the Irish Government, the Parliament and the Commission. It formalizes into a partnership Ireland's existing cooperation with the Parliament and the Commission to promote better public understanding of the EU. The MoU is similar to arrangements in other Member States.</p>
<p>The main aim of this partnership is to build understanding of the European Union in Ireland. The three parties will seek to do this through dissemination of information to boost public awareness of the European Union's objectives. The main target audiences, apart from the general population, will be women, young people and those socio-economic groups that have a weaker association with the EU. These groups have been singled out in several surveys as being particularly poorly informed of EU matters.</p>
<p>The partnership will not prevent the partners from carrying out their own independent information activities. The participants will maximize mutual support for communication activities and actions, also working together with all relevant institutions and bodies (European Direct Relays, other networks of the European Union, regional and local governance structures and groups, Non-Governmental Organisations, etc.).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0128"></a>

<p>(EN) 1. In order to restore stable and reliable financial markets for the future, the Commission Communication for the Spring European Council published on 4 March 2009<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> has presented an ambitious agenda for change, starting from providing the EU with a supervisory framework that detects potential risks early, deals with them effectively before they have an impact, and meets the challenge of complex international markets. Other elements of the programme included:</p>
<p>filling the gaps of incomplete or insufficient national or European regulation with a "safety first" approach,</p>
<p>reinforcing the protection of consumers and small companies;</p>
<p>sorting out pay and incentives;</p>
<p>making sanctions more deterrent.</p>
<p>On supervision, building on the conclusions of the de Larosière report<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission will present a Communication on a strengthened European financial supervision framework before the end of May, for discussion at the June European Council. Legislative proposals will follow in the autumn. This framework will include:</p>
<p>on the macro-prudential side, measures to establish a European Systemic Risk Council (ESRC), and</p>
<p>on the micro-prudential side, proposals to establish a European System of Financial Supervisors (ESFS).</p>
<p>The ESRC could be, in particular, responsible for:</p>
<p>pooling and analysing all information relevant for financial stability;</p>
<p>identifying and prioritising risks;</p>
<p>issuing risk warnings and advice on the appropriate measures to be taken in reaction to the risks identified (for which there would need to be some kind of mechanism to ensure effective follow-up).</p>
<p>2. On micro-prudential supervision, the Commission has recently adopted measures with the aim of strengthening the functioning of the existing European Committees for banking, securities and insurance/occupational pensions: i) by setting up a clearer framework for the activities of the Committees and reinforcing financial stability arrangements. ii) by proposing the establishment of a Community programme, providing direct funding from the Community budget to the Committees. In order to improve the decision-making process of the Committees, the Decisions introduce Qualified Majority Voting when consensus cannot be reached.</p>
<p>Despite these improvements, the Commission is of the view that the limits of what can be done with the present status of the current committees have been reached. Indeed, the Commission thinks EU financial markets need much more effective mechanisms to ensure that supervisors cooperate in a way which is consistent with the reality of an integrated market.</p>
<p>The Commission is obviously interested to have a debate as wide and comprehensive as possible on the composition and powers of the ESFS and the ESRC, and to this end it launched on 10 March 2009 a consultation on the suggested improvements to supervision, with a deadline set for 10 April 2009<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. It will also organise a High Level Conference on the follow-up to the de Larosiere report in Brussels on the 7 May 2009.</p>
<p>In the last European Council conclusions of 19 and 20 March 2009, EU Heads of States and Governments have stressed the need to improve regulation and supervision, and that the de Larosière report is the basis for action.</p>
<p>3. Concerning the G20, the results achieved by the G20 process are really unprecedented. For the first time, leaders have been able to agree on comprehensive, detailed coordination of international financial policies and regulations. The Commission has made a real and substantive first step toward the global regulatory convergence it has been calling for long. The EU has been in the lead in this process, and the Commission closely coordinated its position inside the EU.</p>
<p>Concerning the content, the Commission is satisfied that it has managed to secure a comprehensive and ambitious agenda for reform:</p>
<p>a commitment to improve requirements concerning bank capital and liquidity buffers, as well as measures to limit the build-up of leverage;</p>
<p>the establishment of colleges of supervisors for large cross border banks;</p>
<p>a more ambitious stance to regulate credit rating agencies, including compliance with the substance of the IOSCO code of conduct;</p>
<p>an agreement to endorse tough common principles on pay and compensation in financial institutions;</p>
<p>an agreement about improving accounting standards, in particular on valuation and provisioning – two key issues in order to mitigate procyclicality;</p>
<p>an agreement to enhance the resilience of credit derivative markets by promoting standardisation and multilateral clearing arrangements, subject to effective regulation and supervision;</p>
<p>regulation of hedge funds.</p>
<p>On non cooperative jurisdictions, important results were achieved by widening the scope of the review to anti-money laundering, terrorist financing and prudential issues. The Commission also stands ready to deploy sanctions, if needed. It is a good first step to get rid of free riders in the global financial system.</p>
<p>Finally, the work is not over, it is only beginning. The Commission is now entering a new crucial phase where the regulatory commitments must be translated into concrete action. The Commission will continue to play an active role, as it has done until now, to attain this objective.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>An agreement between the EU and El Salvador has been in place since 1993, and since then the Union has been that country's most important source of aid funding. Until the end of the civil war, cooperation was essentially a matter of tackling the situation of national emergency, and was thus concentrated on food aid and refugee support. Today, the EU's aid extends to a broader field, including human rights, economic cooperation, demobilisation and integration of ex-combatants and rural development. Meanwhile, new problems have now arisen in the shape of unemployment, violence in society, underinvestment in human capital and the need to promote younger workers.

<p>(EN) The current cooperation with El Salvador is based on the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) 2007-2011 with two focal sectors: 1. Fostering social cohesion and human security, 2. Economic growth, regional integration and trade. These sectors are covering well the challenges El Salvador is facing currently.</p>
<p>Fighting violence and investment in human capital especially are important focuses of these two priority sectors and have been targeted by several actions of our cooperation.</p>
<p>Job generation has been already a priority of the focal sector „support for equitable and balanced growth of the economy and employment” in the CSP 2002-2006. The project FOMYPE, with a budget of 24 million euros, focused on strengthening small and medium size enterprises. The current CSP in the framework of the Priority sector „Economic growth, regional integration and trade” foresees an action aiming at strengthening the quality system so that especially small and medium size enterprises can better use the benefits of the current GSP+ system and the opportunities offered by regional integration and the currently negotiated association agreement. It is widely recognised that SMSs play an important role in generating employment and they can contribute to lessen the negative affects of the present crisis.</p>
<p>There is a large programme of over € 20m (“Projovenes"), targeting particularly the Youth and focusing on the security problems affecting the country. It works at the same time on crime prevention, social integration of young people and support the institutions in the implementation of new educational and social work. This project is complemented by the project PROEDUCA that strengthen the creation work opportunities of young people, and thus crime prevention through reinforcing technical education.</p>
<p>The priorities of the current CSP are likely to remain valid, although, the current Mid-Term Review of the 2007-2013 El Salvador Country Strategy might modify them to reflect better the necessities of the country. The findings of this review will be available early 2010 and the Parliament will be consulted in this process.</p>
<p>Also, the Commission has launched a independent Country level evaluation of the EC's cooperation with El Salvador 1998-2008. This exercise, which is ongoing, will identify key lessons in order to improve the current and future strategies and programmes of the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0133"></a>

<p>The long-standing preference of the Commission is to reach an agreement that would cover all pending issues: compliance with this WTO dispute settlement report; consequences of the EU enlargement to 27 Member States; and tariff negotiations resulting from a new round of WTO negotiations. In order to do so, the Commission is negotiating with a number of Latin American banana supplying countries on modification of the EC scheduled tariff commitments on bananas, taking into account other interests involved, including those of the ACP countries. Despite the lack of agreement to date, the Commission continues to be fully committed to reaching such an agreement on the basis of an outcome acceptable to all stakeholders involved.</p>
<p>Ideally, this agreement should be found in the shorter term within the ambit of the Doha Round.

<p>(EN) It is unfortunately true that around 60,000 people commit suicide in the EU each year. And it is also true that most of those people, who commit suicide, experienced a history of mental health problems. These people did not find the help which they needed.</p>
<p>In the EU, more people die as a result of suicide than because of road accidents. While the number of road accidents decreased by more than 15% since 2000, the number of suicides remained relatively stable. With the current economic crisis, there is even a risk that the number of short and long-term mental health problems will increase, with a clear impact on suicide rate.</p>
<p>As a European Union committed to improving health and the well-being of its citizens, we should not tolerate this high suicide toll. However, it is important to stress that prevention of suicide is primarily a Member State responsibility.</p>
<p>At EU level, we can nevertheless support exchanges of information and good practices. This is why we made "Prevention of Depression and Suicide" the first priority theme of the European Pact for Mental Health and Well-being launched in June 2008.</p>
<p>In the context of the implementation of the Pact, the Commission and the Ministry of Health of Hungary will organise, on 10/11 December 2009, a thematic conference on "Prevention of Depression and Suicide". This conference will involve policy makers from Member States, practitioners and research experts. It will highlight the most successful approaches in preventing suicide. It will encourage Member States to take the action which best suits their needs.</p>
<p>The conference can build on many European-level project activities during the past 10 years, such as the successful European Alliance Against Depression.</p>
<p>The present economic situation really increases the need to redouble our efforts to protect our citizens’ health, in particular in areas like depression and suicide. The Commission expects that the conference will be a useful step for Member States to contribute to that aim.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0139"></a>

<p>(EN) The current financial and economic crisis has resulted in higher spreads for long-term government bonds within the euro area, which can make it more costly for some Member States to service their debt.</p>
<p>However, it needs to be pointed out that if these spreads (measured against the yield on German bonds) usually have risen, the overall level of long-term interest rates in the euro area is not particularly high by historical standards.

<p>The most effective way to counter the "perception of default risk" remains a credible commitment to restoring sound fiscal positions in the medium term: the euro area and EU Member States with large budgetary imbalances including Ireland have put forward plans to ensure sound public finances in the medium term.

<p>(EN) The Commission fully agrees with the Honourable Member that discards are a problem in European fisheries that needs to be tackled vigorously. This problem is very complex, since discards take place for a variety of reasons. Therefore, the solution is to take individual specificities into account therefore requiring several initiatives being taken instead of only one.</p>
<p>Already in 2007, the Commission indicated in its Communication "A policy to reduce unwanted by-catches and eliminate discards in European Fisheries"<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> its intention to address the problem of discards. Some first but significant steps were taken in 2008 by further limiting fishing effort in various fisheries and by putting in place a high-grading ban in the North Sea and the Skagerrak.</p>
<p>These measures entered into effect in 2009 although a lot still needs to be done and a new impetus is needed in order to eradicate discards. The Commission does not therefore want to wait until the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and it envisages to tackle this issue by means of a gradual approach, as from now. This stepwise approach will focus in the short term on regulated and other major commercial species. It will include measures such as incentivising pilot studies to test discard reductions in practise, new control and technical measures, promoting more selective gears and improved mesh sizes and the provision of incentives to favour initiatives from the fishing industry itself which are geared to less by-catch and discards. The Commission is also envisaging to propose a ban on high grading in all Community waters with effect from the beginning of 2010. Member States must do their part as well and should manage fishing permits at national level in a way that ensures that only vessels having appropriate quotas have the opportunity to fish for regulated species.</p>
<p>Beyond these immediate measures, the Commission will also use the upcoming debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) to help bring about the necessary change. The current system of Total Allowable Catches and quotas is a contributor to discarding because it is based on national quotas for individual species. Solving the discards problem may require significant changes in this system. While it is premature to establish clear positions on such changes at this early stage, it is essential that in the context of the discussions on the Green Paper and further negotiations leading to the reform of the CFP in 2012, solving the issue of discards should occur centre stage and has to be tackled forcefully. The final objective should be to eradicate this practice.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Code of Conduct for Commissioners recognises that Commissioners are politicians who may be active members of political parties provided that this does not compromise their availability for service in the Commission. In this context, they may express personal opinions but they must take responsibility for them and must respect their obligations to the principle of collective responsibility, to confidentiality and to discretion that arise from the Treaty.</p>
<p>The participation of a Commissioner in an election campaign, as a candidate or endorsing an electoral list, is governed by the obligation to be independent and to defend the common interest as laid down in Article 213 of the Treaty and again in the Code of Conduct for Commissioners.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the forthcoming European elections, which mark an important moment for the European Union. It encourages its Members to participate in activities such as giving information and creating awareness of common European values that aim to encourage European citizens to vote. In this context, Commissioners must ensure that they remain impartial with regard to the political groups’ programmes, although they may challenge them when they call into question the work of the Commission or of the other institutions.</p>
<p>With regard to a Commissioner’s participation in the forthcoming European election campaign and endorsement of a particular electoral list, it is the Commissioner’s responsibility to inform the President of the intended level of participation.</p>
<p>Commissioners who intend to play an active role in the electoral campaign will have to take special unpaid leave.</p>
<p>On the other hand, slight participation does not entail having to take leave of absence during the election, provided that the major part of their time is still devoted to their role as Commissioners and that they avoid stating views that could be perceived as compromising a policy or decision adopted by the Commission or as being in conflict with the pursuit of the general interest of the Community. Furthermore, if Commissioners do speak publicly in the context of the European election campaign, they must make it absolutely clear whether they are speaking as Members of the Commission, providing information in their official capacity, or personally.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0150"></a>

<p>(EN) Aquaculture is of high economic and social significance for several coastal and inland regions of the European Union. It has also a tangible environmental dimension.</p>
<p>On 8 April 2009, the Commission adopted a Communication on building a sustainable future for aquaculture (<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/smartapi/cgi/sga_doc?smartapi!celexplus!prod!DocNumber&amp;lg=EN&amp;type_doc=COMfinal&amp;an_doc=2009&amp;nu_doc=0162">COM (2009) 162</a>). This initiative gives a new impetus to the sustainable development of EU aquaculture. This strategy identifies a number of measures that are aimed at addressing the challenges faced by the EU aquaculture industry, in particular with the objective of promoting its competitiveness.</p>
<p>As regards traceability, the provisions for aquaculture products are already quite well developed. Under Commission Regulation 2065/2001 provisions are laid down so that consumers have information on the Member State or Third Country of production at each stage of marketing of the species. Provision has been made for organic aquaculture production in the revision of the organic production rules completed in 2007 through Council Regulation (EC) No 834/2007. While the control and labelling provisions already apply, detailed production rules are currently under development and the draft Commission Regulation is expected to be adopted in the course of 2009. In the meantime, national rules or private standards recognised by Member States continue to apply.</p>
<p>The Commission also intends to develop a market observatory in order to improve the knowledge of the EU fishery and aquaculture sector on market trends and price formation. A survey will be carried out on volumes and value for fisheries and aquaculture products at different levels of the supply chain from first sale to retail. This project should help the aquaculture industry to adapt its marketing to the evolution of demand and to get better value for their products. Furthermore, the review of the market policy for fisheries and aquaculture products foreseen in 2009 will allow to assess and to address particular needs of the aquaculture sector, such as those regarding producer organisations, inter-professions or consumer information.</p>
<p>The Commission is also fully aware that the economic crisis has compounded the difficulties that some enterprises, notably in the sea bream farming industry, were already facing. The Commission adopted a number of measures at horizontal level, which are meant to benefit operators across all the sectors. Among others, measures on finance and credit have been adopted. Furthermore, the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) provides tools and measures that can help the aquaculture industry address today's difficulties.</p>
<p>Finally, most measures identified in the Communication for a renewed impetus for the sustainable development of European aquaculture, are of a non-legislative nature and should be delivered over a few years. The future of EU aquaculture and the role that the Community should adopt in the longer term in this regard will have to be assessed and further discussed in the process that begins now on the preparation of the future reform of the Common Fisheries Policy and the review of EU financing instruments after 2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0160"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission has constantly reiterated the need for a common vision on the role and place of agencies in EU governance. The ad hoc establishment of agencies over the years has not been accompanied by an overall vision of their position in the Union, which has made it more difficult for them to work effectively and has nourished a range of critics as the ones quoted by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>This is why in March 2008 the Commission addressed a Communication to the Council and the Parliament, "European Agencies-the way forward"<a href="#defann_34_1" name="refann_34_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, inviting the two institutions to an inter-institutional debate with the objective of arriving at a common approach vis-à-vis the role of agencies. To this end an Inter-institutional Working Group was created, composed of members coming from the Commission, Parliament and Council with the mandate to debate on several key issues concerning the agency system – funding, budget, supervision and management. The first meeting of this Working Group, at political level, took place on 10 March 2009 on the margins of the Parliament's plenary session in Strasbourg. The Commission believes that the group offers the opportunity to examine whether the criticisms levelled at agencies are, indeed, justified and, if so, what should be the appropriate responses. Conclusions can be drawn only against the background of the results of this inter-institutional dialogue.</p>
<p>With regard to the alleged overlapping of competences of existing agencies with other actors acting in the same area, the Commission points out that this matter will be addressed within the ongoing evaluation of the system of the EU decentralised agencies. This evaluation was announced in the above mentioned Communication and was commissioned to an external contractor. Its findings will be available in November 2009 and they will feed into the inter-institutional debate. Once the evaluation is completed the Commission will report to the Parliament as soon as possible. Meanwhile, the Parliament, as well as the Council, is closely associated to the evaluation process via their participation in the so called Reference Group, which comments on relevant deliverables, including the draft final report.</p>
<p>Concerning the creation of new agencies, the Commission recalls existing proposals in the fields of energy and telecoms, as well as planned agencies in the field of justice and home affairs which are already in inter-institutional discussions.</p>
<p>The Commission is committed to shape together with the Parliament and the Council a new overall approach to agencies with a view to making them a more effective tool by improving their coherence, effectiveness, accountability and transparency.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is deeply concerned about the sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of children in its different forms. This includes child prostitution, child sex tourism and child pornography. They are particularly serious forms of crime directed against children, who have the right to special protection and care. These crimes produce long-term physical, psychological and social harm to victims. When the abuse is committed abroad, as in the case of child sex tourism, it is particularly worrying that the application of certain national rules on criminal jurisdiction often results in child sex offenders enjoying impunity in practice.</p>
<p>On 25 March 2009, the Commission put forward a proposal for a new Council Framework Decision on combating the sexual abuse, sexual exploitation of children and child pornography repealing the Framework decision 2004/68/JHA. It includes an extensive set of vigorous measures on the three fronts of prosecuting the offenders, protecting the victims and preventing the phenomenon.</p>
<p>More specifically to combat child sex tourism, the proposal provides for amending rules on jurisdiction to ensure that child sexual abusers or exploiters from the EU face prosecution even if they commit their crimes in a third country. For that, the existing rules on criminal jurisdiction must be amended to cover extraterritorial cases and to eliminate requirements of intervention by authorities in the third country, which may not be able or willing to take a firm stand against child sexual exploitation. In this way, offenders abusing children abroad will face penalties when they come back. In addition, the proposal envisages criminalising the dissemination of materials advertising the opportunity to commit any sexual abuse, and also the organisation of travel arrangements with that purpose.</p>
<p>In the context of the United Nations World Tourism Organisation a Task force for the protection of children in tourism has been set up. The Task Force is a global action platform of tourism-related key-players from the government and the tourism industry sectors, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and media associations. It operates as an open-ended network. Its mission consists of supporting efforts to protect children from all forms of exploitation in tourism, under the guiding principles of the Global Code of Ethics for Tourism. Although its main focus is the protection against sexual exploitation of minors, it also includes child labour and the trafficking in children and young people.</p>
<p>The Task Force's on-line service, the Child Protection in Tourism Watch, was launched by WTO to support the international community and tourism industry organizations in their fight against the commercial sexual exploitation of children in tourism networks. The Child Prostitution and Tourism Watch is a constantly up-dated public information server on past and present activities, partners’ tourism policy documents, related facts &amp; figures and other measures.</p>
<p>Under the Development Cooperation Instrument (DCI), more specifically the Investing in People thematic programme, the Commission addresses sexual violence, exploitation and abuse by supporting actions and dissemination of good practices aimed at fighting child trafficking and rehabilitating victims. The programme focuses on civil society's capacity building to promote policy dialogue and effective programming on child trafficking and related issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0164"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission can only make again the point that it has received no complaint on State aid to ferry companies in Greece nor on the violation of the transparency obligation to be respected on the occasion of the conclusion of public service contracts under Regulation 3577/92 on maritime cabotage<a href="#defann_36_1" name="refann_36_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>An infringement procedure on Greece for the incorrect implementation of the mentioned regulation is still open, but with respect to matters which are irrelevant for the purpose of the questions raised by the Honourable Member.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the reply given by the Commission to Question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-5029_EN.html">E-5029/08</a>, Member States are not under an obligation to notify the Commission public service contracts for maritime cabotage and the relevant compensation. The Commission is therefore not aware of the amounts paid by the Member States for the provision of public service.</p>
<p>Should the Honourable Member consider that the Regulation on maritime cabotage has been infringed or that illegal State aid has been given to shipping companies, he can lodge, as any citizen, a formal complaint and provide the details and circumstances of the alleged infringement which will allow the Commission's Services to start an assessment of his complaint.</p>
<p>The Commission has no specific information as to the existence today of any dominant position held by one ferry company in the Cyclades. It should be noted in any event that Article 82 of the EC Treaty only prohibits the abuse of a dominant position, not the existence of the dominant position as such. Any abuse of a dominant position which has an effect on trade between Member States could be investigated by the national competition authority or by the Commission. In addition, subject to the relevant conditions being met, the national authorities can take the appropriate measures according to Regulation (CEE) No. 3577/92 of the Council of 7 December 1992 on maritime cabotage<a href="#defann_36_2" name="refann_36_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) In September 2008, the Irish authorities sought to underpin the stability of the domestic financial system by providing a state guarantee to the current and future liabilities of certain banks operating on the Irish market. At that time, the Commission sought a number of clarifications and modifications from the Irish Government in relation to the guarantee scheme with the view to stabilising financial markets, while avoiding unnecessary distortions of competition with other banks, and negative spillovers in other Member States.</p>
<p>Following a series of constructive and positive exchanges, the Irish Government submitted a finalised scheme for approval by the Commission on 12 October 2008, which responded to the Commission's concerns. More specifically, the finalised scheme ensured:</p>
<p>non-discriminatory coverage of banks with systemic relevance to the Irish economy, regardless of origin;</p>
<p>a pricing mechanism that covers the funding costs of the scheme and ensures a fair contribution over time by the beneficiary banks;</p>
<p>appropriate safeguards against abuse of the scheme, including restrictions on commercial conduct and limits to balance-sheet growth;</p>
<p>accompanying measures to address structural shortcomings of certain banks, in particular if the guarantee has to be called upon;</p>
<p>safeguards on the use of guaranteed subordinated debt (lower tier-2 capital), in particular regarding the solvency ratios of the beneficiary banks;</p>

<p>According to the Regulation on roaming of June 2007 concerning roaming costs for mobile telephony, the cost of outgoing roaming calls per minute may not exceed 0.49 euro (and should have fallen to 0.43 euro by 2009). Incoming roaming calls may cost a maximum of 0.24 euro per minute (0.19 euro by 2009). Currently, there are various contracts which levy a connection charge, which means that the price ceiling is exceeded. The connection charge is part of a voluntary agreement which results in lower costs per minute but, in the case of short calls, the cost exceeds the price ceiling.</p>
<p>Is this situation consistent with the Regulation on roaming? If not, what does the Commission intend to do to ensure compliance with the price ceiling rules?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Under Article 4 of the current Roaming Regulation<a href="#defann_38_1" name="refann_38_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> mobile operators are required to offer a Eurotariff to all their roaming customers. The Eurotariff cannot entail any associated subscription or other fixed or recurring charges and may be combined with any other retail tariff. Operators may also offer other roaming tariffs apart from the Eurotariff which may be structured differently to a Eurotariff and could therefore contain a connection charge. However, for the Eurotariff, the per minute charge cannot exceed the ceilings imposed in the Regulation.</p>
<p>On a related point, the Honourable Member may be aware that the Commission's review of the Roaming Regulation revealed that per minute billing for roaming calls is the most common practice in the majority of Member States. This means that operators charge on a minimum per minute basis even where calls are less than one minute duration. The European Regulators Group estimated that consumers pay around 19% and 24% more for calls received and calls made, respectively, as a result of this practice and stated that urgent action was needed to address this 'hidden charge'.</p>
<p>Per minute billing practices represent a dilution of the intended effects of the Regulation. The Eurotariff is a maximum cap and is intended to provide consumers with assurance as to what they will pay. Divergent billing practices for the Eurotariff by mobile operators undermine the original aim of the Regulation which is to provide a common price ceiling across the Community.</p>
<p>In its proposals for extension of the Roaming Regulation<a href="#defann_38_2" name="refann_38_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission proposed a move to per second billing for retail and wholesale roaming calls. The Commission believes that this is an essential step to address the dilution and lack of effective harmonisation of the Eurotariff price ceiling. In relation to making a roaming call, the Commission considers that it is reasonable to allow a minimum initial charging period of up to 30 seconds at retail level so that operators are able to recover minimum fixed retail costs involved in setting up a call.</p>
<p>The Commission is hopeful that its proposals to extend the Roaming Regulation, including the new measures for billing unitisation, will be adopted by the Parliament and Council in time for customers to benefit this summer.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission does not have quantitative data on the percentage of EU citizens using weight loss products since such products can be either centrally or nationally authorised medicinal products, with or without prescription or food suplements or even medical devices.</p>
<p>If weight loss products are medicinal products, they need according to EU legislation (Directive 2001/83/EC and Regulation (EC) 726/2004), like any medicinal product, a marketing authorisation before being placed on the market in the EU. It may be authorised at the Community level by the Commission following an evaluation by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) or nationally by the Member State.</p>
<p>Assessments conducted before the marketing authorisation is granted, are based on scientific criteria to determine whether or not the products concerned meet the necessary quality, safety and efficacy requirements set out in the EU legislation. The Commission considers that the requirements in the EU legislation are adequate to assure a positive risk-benefit balance in favour of patients of these products once they reach the marketplace.</p>
<p>The testing of these medicinal products is defined in the scientific “Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products used in weight control” adopted by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) in 2006. This Guideline is intended to provide guidance for the clinical evaluation of medicinal products used to promote weight loss in obese adult patients. The efficacy testing of these medicinal products is clearly provided for and defined in this Guideline. Therefore, there are no plans to review the scope and tighten up the EU legislative framework regarding medicinal products against obesity.</p>
<p>Weight loss medicinal products are marketed as prescription as well as non- prescription medicinal products. Rules on the advertising of medicinal products for human use are harmonised under the Articles 86 to 100 of Directive 2001/83/EC. EU legislation forbids direct advertising to consumer of prescription medicines. It allows for advertising only of non-prescription medicines. This situation has not been changed by the current proposal (COM/2008/663).</p>
<p>As regards medical devices, in some rare cases, weight-loss products may fall under the medical devices legislation. The medical devices legislation sets requirements to ensure that devices do not compromise the clinical condition or the safety of patients, of users or, where applicable, of other persons. As part of these requirements, the medical device must achieve the performances intended by the manufacturer. Moreover, it is required that conformity with the legal requirements must be demonstrated by means of clinical evaluation in accordance with Annex X of Directive 93/42/EEC.</p>
<p>Foods intended for use in energy restricted diets for weight-reduction are specially formulated foods which, when used as instructed by the manufacturer, may replace the whole or part of the total daily diet. They are part of the group of foodstuffs for particular nutritional uses (dietetic foods) for which specific provisions regarding the composition and labelling have been laid down by a specific Directive (Directive 96/8/EC on foods intended for use in energy restricted diets for weight-reduction<a href="#defann_40_1" name="refann_40_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>); specifications as regards the amount of energy provided by these foods as well as their content in protein, fat, fibre, vitamins, minerals and amino acids have been established after consultation of the Scientific Committee for Food. As regards the labelling, advertising and presentation of these products no reference in particular shall be made to the rate or amount of weight loss which may result from their use.</p>
<p>Without prejudice to Directive 96/8/EC, health claims referring to 'slimming or weight-control or a reduction in the sense of hunger or an increase in the sense of satiety or to the reduction of the available energy from the diet' are subject to the rules laid down in Regulation (EC) N°1924/2006 on nutrition and health claims made on foods<a href="#defann_40_2" name="refann_40_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> and are to be based on and substantiated by generally accepted scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Consequently, the Commission considers that the prevailing legal framework as such should ensure the safe placing on the market and use of weight loss products. The Commission therefore does not intend to take further action concerning these products. It should be stressed however, that it is of paramount importance that there is correct implementation in the Member States and subsequent follow-up by the competent authorities of the relevant EU legislation. If the Honourable Member is aware of any relevant information regarding lack of proper implementation, the Commission will analyse it and, if appropriate, take the necessary action.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>European companies are exploiting uranium in Northern Niger. Niger is one of the least developed countries. However, its people derive no benefit from these activities. On the contrary, exploitation of uranium is leading to an environmental and health disaster: the mines have high levels of radioactivity and the mining waste presents a health risk to the people who live alongside the mines. Moreover, groundwater has been drained for exploitation of the deposits. The EU must ensure that European companies established in Africa assume their responsibilities.</p>
<p>What is the Commission’s approach for ensuring that European uranium mining companies in Niger respect the local people’s right to good health and the need to preserve groundwater? Can the Commission make sure that the local people share the economic benefits of the mining, particularly by means of the trade agreements between the EU and Niger?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The Commission is following closely the situation in Niger, where the exploitation of uranium affects several aspects of life in that country. First of all we must remember that this resource is essential for the budget of a state that is one of the least developed countries. Like the other mineral resources in the country, its contribution to the budget is significant on account of the activities of a number of European, Asian and American international companies.</p>
<p>The environmental impact of this exploitation is considerable and takes place in a context where the challenges to be tackled are multiple and often significant. One has only to mention desertification, deforestation and the problem of water. Environmental legislation in Niger to deal with these issues is considered completely acceptable. Implementing regulations, however, are all too often lacking and the civil service staff, both centrally and in the interior of the country, is often very inadequate, with the result that strategies and regulations can very rarely be implemented. That is why it is important to have adequate budgetary resources available. The Commission helps Niger to respond to these challenges through cooperation. Considerable resources from the 10th European Development Fund (EDF) for rural development and budgetary support are contributing to this effort, as well as specific projects from the 8th EDF that are still in progress, such as support for the Ministry of Mines, or sanitation and waste-water treatment at Arlit.</p>
<p>The exploitation of mineral resources, especially uranium, is also a source of internal conflict, particularly in the north of the country. The Commission has begun discussions with the Council about the problems linked with the issues of development and security in the region and it sees the participation of local people in resource management as essential for peacemaking, particularly through decentralisation, which it strongly supports and which is beginning to be translated into action. Major improvements in the management of local natural resources are anticipated on these bases, although local skills are still very weak.</p>
<p>With regard to transparency in the management of public funds and mineral resources, the Commission supports establishing commitments from Niger in connection with the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), of which Niger is a signatory country. Under the Cotonou Agreement these issues will, on the one hand, be followed up in the context of implementation of the EDF, given the importance attached to issues of governance in the 10th EDF, and, on the other hand, these issues may be raised within the framework of political dialogue under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement.</p>
<p>With regard to any possible action against European companies or in the context of trade agreements between these companies and the authorities in Niger, the Commission has no actual competence in this area nor any right of sanction, but it supports adherence to codes of conduct such as the EITI, as mentioned above.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0188"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council's Directives for the negotiation by the Commission of a plurilateral anti-counterfeiting trade agreement (ACTA) do not provide for the creation of an "intellectual property group" to follow the ACTA negotitions (nor for any other expert or consultative groups of a non-governmental nature attached to the negotiations). However, in line with the negotiating mandate, the Commission will conduct the negotiations in consultation with relevant regular committees of the Council of Ministers of the EU, in particular the Article 133 Committee, but also the Council's Working Party on Intellectual Property. The latter is a regular body within the Council, consisting of representatives of the governments of the 27 EU Member States, which meets regularly to discuss intellectual property rights (IPR) related issues.</p>
<p>In order to involve civil society in the process of negotiation of ACTA, the Commission is also organising Stake-holders' Consultation meetings. A first one was held in June 2008, and a second one has taken place on 21 April 2009. These meetings were open to the public (individuals, companies, associations, press, NGOs, etc.) and are widely advertised. Additionally, the Commission has invited interested parties which were unable to attend the meetings to provide written submissions.</p>
<p>A different question is the possibility of providing ACTA with some kind of mechanism to involve stakeholders after the Agreement has been signed and entered into force. Since IPR are, by nature, private rights, the Commission considers that it could be valuable to foresee the possibility for interested parties to be associated to the functioning of ACTA. But this question, as well as any other aspects about the future institutional structure of ACTA, are still being negotiated and no final decisions have been taken.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0189"></a>

<p>(EN) The current Community rules on individual identification and traceability of sheep and goats were prompted by the foot and mouth disease crisis of 2001 in the United Kingdom (UK), and the subsequent reports of the Parliament, the Court of Auditors and the so-called "Anderson report" to the UK House of Commons that indicated that the existing "batch" traceability system was unreliable.</p>
<p>Electronic identification is the most cost-effective way to achieve individual traceability in particular when animals are frequently moved through markets and fattening farms. It is now ready to be used under practical farming conditions, even the most difficult ones.</p>

<p>(FR) In general, the Youth in Action Programme is implemented with the intention of reaching the greatest possible number of organisations, whatever their size, even small, informal groups of young people in some cases. It does not therefore particularly target larger organisations.</p>
<p>With regard to Action 4.1 in particular (2% of the programme’s budget), it should be noted that it aims to support organisations likely to have a major impact on young people. It is true that the criteria for awarding these operating grants include the number of activities planned by the grant applicant. The number of activities, however, is not the only criterion taken into account in making an award. In accordance with the decision whereby the programme was established, only organisations whose structure covers at least eight countries that participate in the programme are considered eligible for grants. That means we can be sure of their impact, despite a relatively small budget.</p>
<p>Since 2007 Action 4.1 has made it possible to support medium-sized or even small organisations. The grants paid out in 2009 to certain organisations do not exceed EUR 45 000, but may nonetheless represent up to 80% of their annual budgets.</p>

The recent scientific draft produced by the US Department of Health and Human Services (Agency for Toxic and Disease Registry) entitled ‘Toxicological Profile for Chromium’ of September 2008 (Chapter 3.2.2. ‘Oral Exposure’) indicates that the systematic ingestion of substances containing hexavalent chromium produced serious cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, haematological, hepatic and renal disorders, together with cancer, in human subjects and in animals used as guinea pigs. On the other hand, this was not observed following the ingestion of trivalent chromium, even where the dosages were up to 100 times higher than those of hexavalent chromium.</p>
<p>Does the Commission persist in its view that the risk levels attached to hexavalent chromium are of the same order of magnitude as those attached to trivalent chromium?

<p>(EN) The Commission is currently assessing the toxicological profile for chromium presented by the US Department of Health and Human Services (ATSDR<a href="#defann_48_6" name="refann_48_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>). This draft report develops the toxicological differences between trivalent (III) and hexavalent chromium (VI).</p>
<p>In its reply to oral question <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2007-0775_EN.html">H-0775/07</a> the Commission already stated that hexavalent chromium was recognised as the most toxic of the three valences in which chromium occurs, which is confirmed and substantiated by the draft report in the case of inhalatory exposure. However, for oral and chronic exposure (which applies to drinking water), there is no solid evidence in the report for quantitative comparison of risks related to exposure to hexa- and trivalent chromium.</p>
<p>The Commission acknowledges the findings published in the draft report, which indicate that oral intake of hexavalent chromium can be carcinogenic for rats<a href="#defann_48_7" name="refann_48_7"><sup>(7)</sup></a>, and that for accidentally very high intake by humans (higher than 100mg/person/day), cardiovascular and renal effects have been reported. The Commission takes also into account that the EU risk assessment on chromium (VI) substances<a href="#defann_48_8" name="refann_48_8"><sup>(8)</sup></a> concluded that for mutagenicity and carcinogenicity no threshold below which there would be no risk to human health can be identified.</p>
<p>The Commission is very concerned about the risks caused by the intake of chromium and will remain focussed on the evolution of health standards as published by inter alia the World Health Organisation both for chromium (III) and for chromium (VI). It will take toxicological and scientific evolution into account for the revision of the Drinking Water Directive<a href="#defann_48_9" name="refann_48_9"><sup>(9)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, it must be repeated that the Drinking Water Directive's limit values apply to drinking water as it is delivered and not to river- and ground water in the Voiotia and Evvia area</p>
<p>Referring to the Commission's reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2008-5250_EN.html">E-5250/08</a>, the Commission confirms that the Greek authorities have forwarded updated information to the Commission on the authorisation regime of the industrial units of the wider region (Voiotia and Eastern Attiki) and carried out continued inspections of the industrial units.</p>
<p>The results of the controls carried out by the national authorities demonstrate the lack of adequate planning and management of hazardous waste. The Commission has already brought a horizontal infringement case on the latter issue against Greece before the Court (C-286/08). The example of Asopos has been used in the framework of this infringement procedure, which is currently pending before the European Court of Justice.</p>
<p>In addition, it appears that the Greek authorities have taken adequate measures to comply with the requirements of the Directive on Drinking Water (i.e. no further exceedances of the limit values for chromium were observed).</p>
<p>As regards the obligations resulting from Directive 2006/11/EC<a href="#defann_48_10" name="refann_48_10"><sup>(10)</sup></a> on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community and Directive 80/68/EEC<a href="#defann_48_11" name="refann_48_11"><sup>(11)</sup></a> on the protection of groundwater against pollution caused by certain dangerous substances, the information available has not allowed the Commission to identify and adequately substantiate any possible breaches. The Commission will continue the assessment of the information available and will take all necessary measures, including, if required, the initiation of an infringement procedure, to ensure that EC environmental legislation is complied with.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The dairy industries in Greece are ruthlessly eliminating small dairy farmers - who are responding with demonstrations - by constantly lowering producer prices for cow's milk in order to increase their profits. One of the major companies has announced that, as of 1 May 2009, the milk cartel is to stop buying milk from 120 small producers and will limit the distribution of fresh milk in favour of long-life milk, increasing imports. Another dairy industry has announced a reduction in milk prices and an extension of the payment period by one month. The number of milk producers in Greece has fallen by 80% over the last 15 years and production, which is no more than 800 000 tonnes, covers less than one half of consumption.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's position on the disappearance of small and medium-sized dairy farmers in a country with a milk production deficit, the reduction in producer prices with a simultaneous increase in consumer prices, the abrupt change in consumer habits and the reduction in nutritious substances in milk through limiting the consumption of fresh milk caused by the CAP and the relentless pursuit of profit?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Subsequent reforms have changed the Common Agricultural Policy into a policy with lower guaranteed prices coupled with direct income support to allow farmers to better react to market signals.</p>
<p>The more targeted rural development measures give the Member State the possibility to address specific problems or priorities in the respective Member States, for example support for small farms. Small farmers, receiving less than € 5000 direct income support are not subject to reductions under modulation.</p>
<p>In the Health Check it was decided to allow the redistribution of funds via the so called Article 68 and modulation.</p>
<p>Article 68 provides for the possibility to use funds to address specific disadvantages affecting, amongst others, dairy farmers.</p>
<p>Modulation provides additional funds for the so called new challenges, including restructuring of the dairy sector.</p>
<p>This clearly shows the importance the Commission gives to milk farmers.</p>
<p>While Greek raw milk prices are among the highest in the EU-27, the Commission does agree that it is unusual that farm gate milk prices are decreasing while retail prices are increasing, especially if a large share of Greek milk is sold via the Greek retail channel.</p>
<p>The Commission will implement in 2009 the roadmap proposed in its Communication "Food Prices in Europe" through a joint Task Force involving relevant Directorates General (including DG AGRI). This work will feed into a wider analysis of the retail sector in Europe, currently conducted by the Commission. The final reports for both undertakings are expected at the end of 2009.</p>
<p>As regards the roadmap mentioned above, the Commission therefore intends to conduct a review of the main potential anti-competitive practices in the food supply chain, including an analysis of the distribution of bargaining power within the chain. It also plans to review regulations impacting the food supply chain in order to identify potential simplification of regulations at Community, national and local levels. Another objective of the Commission's roadmap will be to design and set-up a permanent tool to monitor the functioning of the whole food supply chain and to provide increased transparency on consumer prices and pass-through mechanisms.</p>
<p>Therefore you can be assured that competitiveness in the food supply chain remains high on the Commission's agenda.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0198"></a>

<p>(FR) Short sea shipping often offers advantages in terms of economics, energy, security and infrastructure costs compared with overland transport operating between the same geographical areas. That is why the European Commission supports short sea shipping through its programmes and legislation and in international negotiations.</p>
<p>The trend towards an increase in congestion, the desire to reduce pressure on the environment, and economic constraints will further enhance the advantages of this mode of transport in the medium term. For short sea shipping to play its full part, however, its intrinsic qualities must also be improved and in particular there must be a further reduction in conventional and greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to propose, in the appropriate international forums as well as at European level, proactive but balanced legislative and support measures for short sea shipping. To this end it will continue to prepare intiatives applying the rules of good governance and, in particular, analysing as thoroughly as possible the advantages and disadvantages that they bring for operators in general.</p>
<p>With regard to the specific question of the development by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) of a CO2 index for the design of new ships (Energy Efficiency Design Index, EEDI), the Commission supports the work of the IMO in aiming to develop an index appropriate for most ships. Nonetheless, it has to be said that there is much still to be done and issues regarding the application of this index have yet to be addressed in the IMO. The Commission will pay particular attention to the arrangements for any potential application of the index to ships operating on short sea shipping lines. Furthermore, the index is one of several instruments that would apply to new ships. There are measures being prepared for existing ships, in particular the development of a CO2 index for the operation of ships, voluntary measures in relation to the ship’s operation and the development of a financial instrument such as a mechanism for trading emission rights or a fund fed by a tax on marine fuels.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0200"></a>

The judgment paves the way for the privatisation of social security in the public and private sectors, while making employment relations more flexible, reducing the social security rights of men and women and exacerbating in the extreme the problems faced by working-class families.</p>
<p>What is the Commission's response to the storm of protests which have erupted among women, and among workers more generally, in the public and private sectors alike?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) In its judgment in the case of the Commission v. Greece made on 26 March 2009, the European Court of Justice condemned Greece for having failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 141 of the EC Treaty, which lays down the principle of equal pay for men and women.</p>
<p>According to the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Communities, retirement pensions constitute pay for the purposes of Article 141 of the EC Treaty when they are paid to workers because of the working relationship linking them to their former employers. In the matter in question, the Court held that pensions paid under Greek law met the criteria laid down by the Court’s case law and could therefore be treated as pay for the purposes of the Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission emphasises that the Court considered that the disputed provisions of the pension scheme in question in this matter did not remedy the problems that female workers might encounter during their professional careers but that, on the contrary, by being limited to granting female workers more favourable conditions than those applicable to male workers with respect to retirement age and minimum service required at the point of retirement, these provisions were discriminatory.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be pointed out that the Court’s judgment concerns solely the problem of the age difference on retirement for men and women. It does not in any way affect the organisation of the system, whether it be public or private, the number of years of contribution necessary before taking retirement or the amount of benefits.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2009-0204"></a>

<p>Can the Commission explain why Commissioner Louis Michel systematically ignores Cuban dissidents during his visits to Cuba, including his latest visit in March 2009, and meets only the Cuban authorities, which is in clear breach of the mandate given in the Council's conclusions of June 2008, according to which European authorities visiting Cuba should pursue a dialogue with the democratic opposition in Cuba and address, in their discussions with the Cuban authorities, the issue of respect for human rights, the transition to a pluralist democracy on the island and the demand for the immediate release of all political prisoners, including those detained during the 'Black Spring' of 2003?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) The European Council’s Conclusions of 2005 state that during high-level visits contact with dissident groups must be decided on a case by case basis. It is also specified that during these visits the human rights situation must be addressed with the Cuban authorities in a transparent manner. The same principles apply in the text of the Council Conclusions of 23 June last year.</p>
<p>It is in that way that the Commission maintains direct and open dialogue with the government about human rights, including the issue of political prisoners. That approach was also followed during the last high-level visits by ministers from the Member States of the European Union.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that normalising relations between the European Union and Cuba is the way that will allow us to have greater impact on human rights issues.</p>
<p>The Commission maintains regular direct contact with civil society in all countries in the world, including Cuba. The Commission’s role in that country is very much appreciated and supported by civil society and by opposition groups. The Commission’s delegation to Cuba regularly receives representatives from civil society and opposition groups and the Commission services in Brussels have an open door policy for anyone or any organisation wishing to have a constructive discussion about Cuba or any other country.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
