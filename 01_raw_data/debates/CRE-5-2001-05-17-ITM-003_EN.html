<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schleicher (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is regrettable that a number of meetings are taking place at the same time as this debate, despite the fact that this is an issue which actually concerns the whole Parliament. Parties are the foundation stone of democracies. Without parties, which ideally fight to establish a model which maximises the welfare of state and society, democracy is inconceivable. Today, all 15 Member States of the European Union are ruled by democratic forms of state, and therefore by governments composed of varying combinations of political parties. As citizens of democratically governed Member States we are right to attach importance to them; as Europeans we can rightly be proud of them.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people ask whether we need a statute for European parties. The European Parliament is the only institution of the European Union which is legitimated by direct, free elections. The European Parliament is also regarded as the cradle of European parties. Cooperation in the groups required there to be increasingly close contacts between their constituent parties and with the national parties. In this way, new international party structures and European parties gradually developed. I should simply like to refer to the fact that the European People's Party has been in existence since 1976, the Party of European Socialists since 1992, the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party since 1993 and finally the European Federation of Green Parties also since 1993.</p>
<p class="contents">If my information is correct, two more European parties have apparently been founded since then, which means that we already have at least six European parties now. The party political landscape is hardly uncomplicated. The number of parties represented in national parliaments varies considerably across the Member States. Our 626 Members of the European Parliament, at any rate, hail from 130 different national parties. Italy, with 21 parties in the European Parliament, is represented by the greatest number of parties. These different national parties have combined in the European Parliament to form eight groups, alongside the 14 non-attached Members.</p>
<p class="contents">In response to these various developments, Parliament has been calling for a legal base for European parties since the eighties. The adoption of the Treaty of Maastricht ten years ago brought a breakthrough for the European Parliament in the shape of Article 191, which was adopted unanimously by the governments of the Member States. This article reads: "Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union."</p>
<p class="contents">In the Treaty of Nice, Article 191 is amplified to turn that article, on its own, into a legal base. "The Council, acting in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 251, shall lay down the regulations governing political parties at European level and in particular the rules regarding their funding." European parties therefore make a valuable contribution to European integration, which should not be underestimated. This work cannot be done by a national party. To continue this work, European parties need, for example, office space and employees, which means, in other words, money. Up until now the European parties have been supported by their groups in the European Parliament. However, it is precisely this indirect funding by the groups which the European Court of Auditors has criticised on the grounds of lack of transparency and the improper use of parliamentary funds, and it will not tolerate this any longer.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union budget already provides funds for the current financial year in line B3-500: EUR 7 million for all parties. This is certainly no cornucopia, as we hear from resentful quarters. How the funds are to be distributed is also laid down in the Regulation. The Commission generously tabled a proposal for a regulation in February to establish the conditions which would need to be met. One of these is for statutes to be submitted, providing evidence that a European party is committed to the principles of democracy, respect for fundamental rights and control of income and expenditure, which are enshrined in the Treaty on European Union. This goes further than existing national legislation on parties.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, a European party has to prove, amongst other things, that it has been successful in elections in at least five Member States or that it is represented in the European Parliament by Members from at least five Member States. There are also precise rules on how the Regulation is to be implemented and on control. The European parties are not permitted to use their funds to finance national parties. This ban also applies to the funding of election campaigns. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has added several points in its opinion, including the reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, a definition of the party as having legal personality so that it can conduct legal transactions, and further-reaching proposals on controls, including on revenue from donations.</p>
<p class="contents">Thanks are also due here to the Committee on Budgets and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market for their good proposals. In addition there are now a further 40 amendments, which I should like to classify under three headings: those which make the text of the Regulation more precise, those which propose detailed rules and those which reject the proposal. You will understand that, as rapporteur, I cannot support the proposal's rejection because, after all, it is Parliament itself which has been calling for a regulation for a long time. There is another reason why rejection is also incomprehensible to me. It arouses suspicion that we want to prevent party financing being made transparent at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot recommend detailed rules at present. This Regulation is a temporary solution until the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice, when we will be in a position to draft comprehensive legislation with the Council. Today we are taking the first step and until the Council makes a unanimous decision we can unfortunately only deliver an opinion. It is in the interests of the European Parliament for a neat solution to be found which will enable the criticisms of the European Court of Auditors to be taken into account as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to address one more point: the Council was present yesterday, and I received the speech of the President-in-Office on behalf of the Council Presidency. I should very much like to hand it over to the President of Parliament. In it the Council says that it is interested in our completing our work as early as today if possible. The Council is full of good intentions to do all it can to bring this dossier to a conclusion, possibly even under the Swedish Presidency. I should therefore like to thank the Swedish Presidency for showing such commitment in its efforts to allow the European parties to stand on their own two feet, by conferring legal status on them and making their funding transparent. This is a very difficult task which, in the interests of democracy, will hopefully be crowned with success. I hereby hand this speech over to the President of Parliament.</p>

Until the Nice decision is ratified, it is appropriate that a set of rules should be defined that apply to the creation and financing of the parties to ensure immediate effectiveness and transparency in this field from this moment on. This is the purpose of the timely proposal by the European Commission, to which can be added the proposals set out in the report by Mrs Schleicher, whom I congratulate on the quality of her work. The opinion of the Committee on Budgets seeks to strengthen the guarantees of transparency in the financing of parties, particularly through the express identification of the origin and destination of all funds. At the same time, the clear distinction between political groups in the European Parliament and European political parties is maintained for the next legislature, particularly as regards their buildings and staff. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is, we are getting closer to the citizens and strengthening democracy. Secondly, we are clarifying the nature of the resources of these parties by ensuring the transparency of their Community public funding, subject to the usual controls by means of audits and the Court of Auditors, while separating it from any mixing with national parties. Thirdly we are enhancing Parliament's status by giving it responsibility for the legal recognition of the European parties and the initial political decision on the degree to which each conforms to the common democratic values on which the existence of the Union is based.</p>
<p class="contents">This Regulation, which comes in the wake of the Tsatsos report and incorporates the essence of the philosophy behind it, is the first great achievement of the Institutional Arch on which European democracy is founded. It opens the door for the speedy conclusion of the statute of Members and assistants and also for the much needed uniform electoral law for the European Parliament. I would say we have taken the first steps in the agreements for structuring Community democracy on the basis of European citizenship.</p>
<p class="contents">As draftsman of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, I must express my sincere admiration for the work contained in the report and for Mrs Schleicher's endeavours. She maintained great openness, receiving contributions from the other committees, including the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. She worked with an open mind and, through her approach, enhanced the European Parliament's contribution, giving us the confidence that, as we have already seen, the Council will understand us and we shall soon have a definitive statute for the European political parties, at least in the framework of this legal base. I would therefore like to thank Mrs Schleicher very much for her work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We think that a party statute, in the truest sense of the word, is important for the unification of Europe and for democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">How then is the will of the European people to be expressed, if not through parties? As varied as our views may be, it is after all the parties who, in the end, give expression to our political will, even if this is often only after a very tough process of debate. That is why the significance of this party statute for the unification of our continent and for democracy in our continent cannot be overestimated, even if it is criticised here and there in the media or in extreme quarters of this House.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time that we debated this initiative – I myself was astonished that it is already nearly a year ago – was on 14 June 2000. Yesterday we had certain events here in this House and I would also say, Mr President, that we need to consider how we can prevent an anti-European minority from stopping progress in the future. That is why we need to amend our Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">I should particularly like to express my appreciation – and for me as a democrat this was a cheering sight yesterday – of the fact that after yesterday's tumult four conscientious groups immediately realised their responsibility for Europe – the Christian Democrats, the EPP, the Socialists, the Liberals and the Greens – and sought a way out of the situation. That was a test of democracy here in the European Parliament and I would expressly thank the other groups who took that step with us.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express my heartfelt thanks to Ursula Schleicher, who by working unbelievably hard in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs under the Chairmanship of our esteemed colleague, Mr Napolitano, managed to forge agreement on majority positions. My dear Mrs Schleicher, you have done an excellent job here and people will always remember your name with gratitude when this party statute is adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also, however, like to thank the Commission, in particular Commissioner Barnier and the President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, for responding to the initiative taken by the four aforementioned groups in this Parliament and tabling this proposal. Even though it is still based on the old law – we are being heard – it is nevertheless a prerequisite for the Swedish Presidency to be able to decide. I should also like to acknowledge explicitly the very great effort that the Swedish Presidency is putting into this. Of course Mr Danielsson is not able to be here today. He was here yesterday, however, and we only have ourselves to blame for the fact that we are not able to debate this with him today. I regret this, and in the future we need to find a means of cooperating with the Council of Ministers to ensure that the Council is represented here in the European Parliament – and this is not to criticise the Swedish Presidency – throughout the week that we are in session.</p>
<p class="contents">We want more transparency. We want straightforward financial control, Commissioner Schreyer. That is why I was astonished – I must mention this now – to see a statement by Messrs Kuhne and Van Hulten in Euronews. They had not secured a majority in the Committee on Budgetary Control and were attacking us. That is completely inappropriate! If a rapporteur in a committee does not succeed in securing a majority in favour of his report then that is due to the rapporteur's own incompetence, and he should not defame others who are full of good intentions and wish to contribute to the overall result.</p>
<p class="contents">We want transparency and we also need this party statute so that we can integrate the parties from Central Europe. There, where democracy is only just being established, it is even more important than it is here for democratic structures to gain stability. I should like to refer to one further point: legal personality for the parties. Parliament's Bureau will, as you know, after consulting a committee of eminent persons, advise on the basis on which it will be decided which organisations are genuinely European parties which comply with the criteria. Obviously there will also always be the temptation of political opportunism to say yes or no to a political party. That is why the parties need to be endowed with legal personality, so that they are able to appeal against a decision if they believe that the rules have been violated and the right decisions have not been made. Legal certainty is actually the most important thing in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I should like to say that whenever there are conflicts between us it is important for those conflicts to be resolved peacefully. This peaceful conflict resolution is only possible on the basis of the law. That is why it is important for there also to be recourse to the ECJ. I hope that a large majority of this House will vote in favour of this proposal tabled by Ursula Schleicher.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today is an important day for European democracy, because we always talk about the institutions of the European structure, but we never talk about the protagonists and we need protagonists on the European stage. They are the political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the awful things that I heard in this House yesterday, allow me, Mr President, to say something that is based on my own experience, which is shared by you, in your country, and by Mr Poettering, which is that those who are against political parties are against democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Parties will have their flaws, but there is no pluralist democracy in the world without political parties that represent the will of the people. We therefore need to be very careful with demagoguery on this very important issue. I have to say that I feel particularly proud, because almost ten years ago to the day, with the help and support of President Martens, President De Clercq, who is still our colleague, and President Spitaels, as President of Parliament, I made the first proposal that was given form in Article 138 of the Treaty, now Article 191, in which, in agreement with President Lubbers, we succeeded in having the political parties incorporated into the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not now simply content ourselves with proclaiming principles. What we have to do is develop and give personality to the European political parties, and ensure that they do not continue to be some sort of annex to our groups. This is the reason why, although we debate and disagree on many other things, we are in agreement on these matters, which are essential for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the debate and the report drawn up by Mrs Schleicher, whose work I welcome, I would say to my fellow Member, Mr Poettering, that we disagree on many things, but I would ask him not to get angry with Mr Kuhne, who raised a request made to us by the Court of Auditors in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I would ask him, before twelve o’clock, to reconsider his anger and support these amendments, which I think could be positive for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect that we think is essential, and here I would also ask for the support of your group, is that we should take a step forward on an essential issue for European democracy, which is the funding of the parties, in terms of who can contribute funds. This is an open debate. In the United States we have just seen the McCain initiative on soft money and hard money. In many European countries we have had bitter experiences in this area. We have not taken drastic action. We have worked instead on the basis of experiences that have occurred in the various European countries... what we say is that legal entities, basically commercial companies, should not be able to give money to parties. We are in favour of a ban in this area, because we believe that this is good for democracy and for transparency, because what we are talking about here are not acts of philanthropy. Something is always asked for in return – you only have to look at what President Bush is proposing for the energy sector.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, allow me to point out the happy coincidence that today the majority of this House and the groups that have a European dimension, and we should not forget that we have a European dimension, have members from all the countries in the Union. We want order, regulation, transparency and responsibility to the citizens and we therefore ask that our positions be respected in this debate and above all that there should be a shared democratic will at this decisive moment for European integration. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maaten (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, in line with our Rules of Procedure, I believe that I should first of all indicate that there is a conflict of interest in my case, as I am also treasurer of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. This is not a financial interest, since the position is unsalaried – exceptionally so, I may say – but nevertheless, this is in any event probably a case of conflict of political interests. However, I am speaking here on behalf of the liberal group, and not on behalf of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party.</p>
<p class="contents">The thing that should, of course, stand out in this entire discussion, is the fact that the situation as it is now is really not acceptable. The situation in which the groups are keeping the parties afloat. There was no other way until now. There was no other way around this, but I believe that we all have understood by now, even intuitively speaking, that this situation is untenable. The Court of Auditors has highlighted this, which is to be applauded. Needless to say, nothing has happened in secret. Everything was above board, everyone was able to see that things were done in this way, but it cannot continue like this. As it happens, our groups cannot live on air, and if they do not receive support from general resources, where <span class="italic">does</span> that support originate from? Do we want the European political parties to become a plaything of whatever pressure group, be it trade union, businesses or other non-governmental organisations, rich individuals or whoever? It is patently clear that political parties must be able to lead an independent life. If we do not, we will have American-styled practices on our hands, and I would not simply refer to President Bush, but also to the practice of candidates actually only accruing funds instead of pursuing politics. We must never end up in a situation of that kind. We need effectively functioning parties, as Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo already stated very eloquently. Indeed, that is where representative democracy comes into its own. That is the case nationally and even much more so at European level. We need stability in our democracy with a view to enlargement. The new countries which are about to join us are also politically active. They too have political parties which need to feel at home in the existing European political families. Only in that way can we in this Parliament help democracy develop in the future. That is of key importance. Furthermore, we need stability with a view to democratic development in the European Union. We do not know how this will develop, but we cannot rule out that there will come a time when there will be European electoral lists. Someone will then need to put forward these candidates. We cannot rule out that a system can be set up whereby it is possible to become individual members of European political parties. For that too, a proper system will need to be developed to accommodate this.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, it is necessary for those parties to be independent. It is, of course, too crazy for words that the political parties must be financially independent from those elected on behalf of that political party. It should be the other way round. Those who are elected, should be checked out by their political parties. That is how democracy works most effectively, and in that respect, I believe that even the present system can be improved on.</p>
<p class="contents">There is more to say on this subject. We very much share the view, of course, that this cannot mean support for national parties. We also agree that the system does not mean that pro-European campaigns are funded with this. We believe that a number of issues still need to be examined, including legal status.</p>
<p class="contents">We should examine these aspects further. For example, the aspect of support for political campaigns should be addressed. We can come back to this during the amendment procedure, which will take place in due course, and then we will be able to put the finishing touches to the system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Whoever claims, however, that parties are needed should also be aware that they take care of their financial resources and so far, this has been done in an unorthodox fashion. It had to be done in the twilight zone. We need a solid basis, transparency and control.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why our group is principally in favour of no donations from businesses for political parties, so as to vouch for the independence of Parliament as an institution and of the individual MPs. Virtually every country has had its fair share of scandals, and we know that it is necessary to act very strictly and monitor closely. If there are donations, it should be made very clear and transparent where they are from and what they will be spent on.</p>
<p class="contents">It must be possible to form democratic parties without creating too high thresholds. That is why we support the proposal which the Commission presented right from the outset, to take five countries as the norm, so as not to deter any forces – at least if they are democratic.</p>
<p class="contents">There should also be sufficient funding for all recognised parties to be able to function as a party. The overheads – and this can be verified objectively – must be covered before the resources are shared out proportionately.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should be acutely aware of the fact that the citizens keep a watchful eye over the system. We ourselves should ensure that the democratic fundamental rights are observed, for we cannot subsidise parties which subsequently undermine democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The parties represented in our group have differing positions on the political proposal on European political parties. Some colleagues wonder, not without good reason, how meaningful it is and to what extent they actually can represent a European public. The direct link to the people is not actually forged through Europe; it exists at national and regional level. That is where the parties have their grass roots; that is where they have their members and electors.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask Messrs Poettering and Barón Crespo to reconsider their words. Mr Barón Crespo has just said that those who are against parties are against democracy. I do not think that this is the case. Rather I think that parties often tend to take themselves particularly seriously. The public, for example in Germany, are very sceptical – not without reason – about membership of political parties. I think that it is only 3% in the Federal Republic who take an interest in politics by joining a political party. Nevertheless they are still democrats. They get involved in society through other organisations of civil society, such as citizens' action groups and non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say that the European party should not be denied the right to exist. Those political forces which consider mergers of this kind to be right and necessary should also be able to proceed with them. Quite apart from that, I am convinced, personally, that European parties, as it states in Article 191 of the Treaty, do actually constitute an important factor for integration. That is why I support Mrs Schleicher's report and would also thank the Commission for its initiative. Against the background of the criticisms made by the Court of Auditors, I think it is necessary for clear conditions to be established. Legal certainty, financial discipline and transparency are indispensable, and I think that in particular the proposals on the statute, and especially the requirement for complete transparency of finances and any donations, should definitely be included in the Regulation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would come back, however, to questions of principle, which I believe we should examine thoroughly. Firstly, I regret that, in the various stages of the debate in which we have been engaged, the majority, whose strength we have never doubted, has never taken the trouble or care to respond to the legality issues. We should like to know how Article 308 is to be implemented. How can it be brought forward with regard to the Treaty of Nice? How can one jump from the equality of political parties at European level to the creation of restrictive entities: the European political parties? There has never been a reasoned response.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to take the opportunity to reply politely to Mr Poettering and Mr Barón Crespo. We are not against Europe. We are against the bulldozing of rights, especially in the case of fundamental rights in Europe. Neither are we against political parties! On the contrary, we believe that this Regulation is against political parties on a totally illegal basis, because it is not provided for in the Treaties. We are against illegal discrimination against parties. Besides, it has been mentioned that our concern is to respond to the concerns of a court: the Court of Auditors. Given the ups and downs that this Regulation has been going through, it would not surprise me if, when the Court of Auditors first dealt with the matter, it raised the questions of the lack of legal base that have been discussed here itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw your attention to Article 191. The Treaty says this: ‘Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union.’ It does not authorise any discrimination between them. The only discrimination that may exist in this European Parliament is brought about by the power of the electors, the democratic vote, and not by any other kind of instrument that may favour some to the detriment of others. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Treaty of Nice introduces a special legal basis for aid to parties and thereby demonstrates that there is no legal basis in the Treaty of Amsterdam. The Court of Justice has laid down that Article 308 cannot be used instead of Treaty changes. Therefore, the basis of the proposal is clearly unlawful until the Treaty of Nice has been approved in all the Member States. The content will, unfortunately, also be unlawful <span class="italic">following</span> the Treaty of Nice because the latter does not deal with supranational European parties. It deals with political parties at European level and, in a special declaration, rules out discrimination. The Schleicher report would provide some parties with special aid not available to other parties. This is contrary to the principle of equality. In a democracy, it is the electorate alone that decides who is represented in Parliament, and the parties must compete on an equal footing. Particular parties cannot be given advantages according to whether they are organised on a local or supranational basis. It is not for the majority in Parliament to correct the election results by forcing the entire electorate to contribute to the financing of five supranational EU parties. It is incredible, moreover, that the Commission, as the guardian of legality, is able to submit such a clearly unlawful proposal, and it is inconceivable that Parliament should today adopt a proposal which, in accordance with current legal practice, can be declared unlawful by the EC Court of Justice. I would call upon the groups to talk the matter through with Parliament’s own legal service and, at least, to defer the vote until the next session. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have listened with interest to the Members, and without too many surprises. Jules Maaten tells us so many fine things about where the funding for the parties is to come from. However, what are political parties? They are the expression, they should be the expression of civil society, and therefore either civil society, the citizens (nobody has said anything about the citizens) give money to the parties, and so the parties survive because they are the expression of civil society, or they are condemned to die, as quite rightly they should die if they do not represent anyone. Nobody wants to talk about this. That is incredible! It is the bureaucratisation not just of Europe but also of our society. They are parties that live outside society: an expression of this – read last month’s Eurobarometer – is the ever-increasing distance between you, your bureaucracies and the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">You have invented a new tax for the citizens, which forces them to finance your bureaucracies. This is intolerable; it is a measure against the citizens, and we will act with determination and take this to Luxembourg, because all of this is against Europe. Mr Barón thinks that somebody here is against parties! We are for parties that are alive, are expressions of society and not expressions of bureaucracies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He wanted yesterday's majority to prove themselves to be democrats if the tables were turned. I can assure him that we are behaving like democrats. It is precisely democrats, however, who are deeply concerned about the Rules of Procedure being complied with. If, in accordance with Rule 143 of the Rules of Procedure, the inadmissibility – due to legal shortcomings – of a specific item on the agenda is once moved and agreed, then in my view there is no possibility of magically reinstating it on the agenda by means of Rule 111 Paragraph 2 of the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Rule 111 Paragraph 2 provides, you see, that the agenda may not be amended, except in pursuance of Rule 143, amongst others, or on a proposal from the President. That is an exclusive rule. Since here the case in Rule 143 has occurred the second case does not apply.</p>
<p class="contents">This means, in other words, that today's debate, in my view, is at variance with the Rules of Procedure, which is why I do not wish to contribute any further to it. I have one comment on the legal base: in COM document 2000/444 the Commission also proposed adding a legal base for the statute to Article 191. This was in July 2000. I cannot understand the assertion that this cannot have been discussed in the committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He said that it is the people and civil society that should decide whether a party exists or disappears. I was concerned to hear this from Mr Dupuis, because obviously it is a subject that he knows well, as his party has just disappeared from the Italian political map.</p>
<p class="contents">Going back to serious matters and serious speeches, I am the secretary-general of a European political party and moreover, I would like to stress, of a party that does not sit in the European Parliament. It is the only party that has its own headquarters, a small house in Brussels that is separate from the European Parliament, and funding that for the most part (more than 70%) is not dependent on the parliamentary group but on the parties that are members of our political family.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that today is a great day for European construction, but I would go even further: today a big step is being taken in constructing a political Europe. Because those of us who believe in a political Europe, and in my group we do, of course, believe in this, know that the parties are a fundamental part of a political union. Political areas, such as the Member States, have parties that provide cohesion: France, Spain, Italy, Germany... all have national parties.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe needs parties that deal with and work in the whole of the Union, and this is what will give cohesion and coherence to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that this Regulation is a good one and is to be welcomed, for two reasons. Firstly and obviously, because it provides rules and transparency for the functioning and funding of these very important elements for the political future of the European Union. Secondly, because of the role that these parties will play in the future. Because, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, a political union, a Europe of 23, 25, 27 or more Member States is going to be increasingly difficult to manage. It is going to be increasingly difficult to move forward and increasingly difficult to have common opinions.</p>
<p class="contents">The European parties are a new instrument that can provide coherence, which can act as the backbone of this political union that we desire, in order to achieve a consensus where it would otherwise be difficult. I can imagine the different European political families meeting prior to the meetings of the European Council with 27 prime ministers and reaching consensuses that will enable the European Union to move forward with a firm step towards the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think, Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, that we realise the importance of the step that we are taking today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are proposing one amendment that will improve the proposal, which is to grant the political parties legal personality under European Union law. To leave things as they are at present, with 15 competing national jurisdictions, will be a cause of confusion and future problems. We should sort this out now and address the other outstanding issues more seriously and more successfully once the Treaty of Nice comes into force. We also welcome the compromise amendment, which lowers the threshold for the registration of political parties from a third to a quarter, which is in the interest of both fairness and pluralism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group is slightly concerned about procedural squabbles ruining this text, which is important to us. We hope that the fact that there was a sort of forced passage this morning is not going to secure the future of this text because, for us, it is imperative to have transparent financing for these European political parties. We are well aware of what those who reject this financing mechanism are waiting for. They still prefer the system where suitcases of banknotes are handed over in the dark.</p>
<p class="contents">As things stand, it must be flatly stated that the report which has emerged from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs is still not acceptable. It does not really ensure transparency. The democratic threshold for accessing the financing is far too high. As for the type of financing, we are extremely disturbed to see that this text allows private companies to finance parties. Everyone is perfectly well aware of what that means too: when a company finances a party, it is hoping for advantages in return. That is called organised corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore hope – because there are now some very good compromise amendments on the table – that this transparency will be strengthened, and that, as my friend Andrew Duff has said, the democratic threshold will indeed be lowered, five right away, and a quarter of the Member States after Nice. Above all we hope private financing will be totally banned, because it is not our calling in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance to organise corruption, even if done transparently. I hereby announce that if private companies are allowed to use their money to buy political parties at European level, our group will not vote for this report at the end of the day. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is not, of course, about constructing European parties. It is about giving money to European parties, and that is quite a different matter. As I understand it, the problem is that there is now a grey area and that some are opting for corruption and other curious methods of obtaining money for their activities. In that case, however, we must demand that they clean up their acts. We must demand transparency, and we must demand that the existing European parties scrupulously observe rules and laws instead of cheating their way around them. Instead, a system is now being devised in which the parties themselves can put their fingers in the till. Fewer and fewer people are joining political parties. In Germany, the figure is 3%, which is certainly a very good reflection of the situation in my own country. No one joins European parties, and in that situation parties are opting to enrich themselves. It is an enormous problem we are creating. We are hugely deepening the gulf between ourselves and the people. It will be difficult to face the electorate at the next parliamentary election. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have seen how Parliament has voted down the minority groups in contravention of clear legal principles. It stands to reason that Article 111 of the Rules of Procedure cannot be used as this majority has used it. It is shameful that there has not been a single legal challenge arising from the fact that Parliament yesterday voted to throw out the matter and is today saying that it is of no significance. The majority decides; the majority is always right; that is the attitude. Once this Regulation has come into force, the major political parties will subsequently have some very serious problems, however. They will have problems because it stands to reason that this Regulation cannot be implemented with Article 308 as its legal basis. This is completely clear following the Court of Justice’s pronouncement of 28 March 1996. Article 308 cannot be used to alter the Treaty, but that is what in reality is being done because the Treaty of Nice, which contains the necessary legal basis, has not come into force. That is the practical situation, and I can assure all the representatives of parties which vote down the minority groups – those parties that decide here in this Chamber – that we shall do everything to contest this legal basis. We shall take steps to bring the matter before the Court of Justice in Luxembourg, and I can promise that there will be a political storm over the abuse of power of which this Regulation is an expression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is actually based on Article 308 (former Article 235) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, but that cannot be used unless there is a Community power in existence first and no such power to act has been provided for. The Court of Justice clearly established this, in its opinion of 28 March 1996 on the possibility of the Community becoming a signatory to the European Convention of Human Rights using Article 308 as the basis. It declared that the use of Article 308 in such a case was impossible, because no prior general Community power existed to define and modify fundamental rights. Consequently, in Paragraph 30 of its opinion – which I shall quote in full – the Court concludes that ‘That provision (Article 308), being an integral part of an institutional system based on the principle of conferred powers, cannot serve as a basis for widening the scope of Community powers beyond the general framework created by the provisions of the Treaty as a whole and, in particular, by those that define the tasks and the activities of the Community. On any view, Article 235 cannot be used as a basis for the adoption of provisions whose effect would, in substance, be to amend the Treaty without following the procedure which it provides for that purpose.’</p>
<p class="contents">Today we find ourselves in precisely that scenario with the European political parties. Article 191 of the Treaty mentions them, but that only has declaratory value, because it does not entrust any mission to the Community as regards those political parties. Therefore that article can in no case serve as a point of departure for using Article 308, that is clear.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would add in conclusion that the reform planned in the Treaty of Nice, which seeks to create the absent legal basis, has not yet been ratified, and I hope it never will be, because it runs counter to the French constitution and the general principles of a free society, by which political parties must be free. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should therefore like to thank the Commission for helping us, together with the European parties and the groups, to close this gap in European-level legislation in this parliamentary session.</p>
<p class="contents">The provisions being introduced here have been national law and have applied to the national parties in all the Member States for a long time, despite varying rules. To all those who are now talking about parties I do have to say that each of us is sitting here because he was the candidate of a political party at national level. We are after all living in a multi-party democracy. Parties are not an end in themselves. They are an essential part of a functioning democracy and constitute a link between citizens, the groups and the public in the opinion-forming and decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">In approving the Regulation that we are discussing today, we are making a contribution towards strengthening European democracy, intensifying the opinion-forming process and the debate within Europe and making the national parties more European. The Regulation helps to increase transparency in respect of the funding of political work, create greater clarity, and separate group and party work, something which the European People's Party – my friend Alejandro Agag has spoken about this – has been working hard to achieve for some time already, harder than the other parties. In addition it contributes to guaranteeing the right of the European Court of Auditors to monitor the affairs of the European parties.</p>
<p class="contents">This Regulation is, however, also a basic prerequisite for a debate which we need to have on common electoral law and on common rules governing incompatibility for Members of Parliament in the different countries, and a prerequisite for the debate on the possibility of European parties standing in European parliamentary elections. It contributes to making the post-Nice process more democratic. We, the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, want more transparency and we want to strengthen the people's Europe, instead of having more closed doors – read the Council – and secretariats. We are in favour of the right to have recourse to legal action, enshrining the Charter of Fundamental Rights as a qualitative pre-condition for parties, European parties having legal personality and putting an end to cross-financing.</p>

<p class="contents">Mrs Schleicher, good authors would say your text was about teratogenesis, that is, the production of monsters, a discipline in which the good Dr Frankenstein distinguished himself before you. That is what it amounts to when we are presented with a proposal to create European political parties out of nothing, and the very expression is absurd. They are not parties – they are not competing for the expression of universal suffrage which remains national in context – nor is this a matter of politics, because the only reason for this text is to let the large parliamentary groups get round a decision of the European Court of Auditors, and the whole thing is only European in the sense that it is not African or Asian.</p>
<p class="contents">In reality, Mrs Schleicher, the pompous name of European political party disguises a trick as old as the hills, the great lottery for the benefit of the lottery organisers or, if you prefer, a comfortable pension granted to the parliamentary groups most docile towards the institutions this Parliament is actually either responsible for controlling – like the Commission – or supposed to share decision-making power with – the Council: a pension granted by those institutions themselves.

I have to say that my group and my delegation are opposed in principle to the regulation or financing of political parties at a European level.</p>
<p class="contents">We, like others in this Chamber, have deep concerns that the proposed funding for European political parties has no legal base. It follows from this that we cannot favour a legal provision for state funding of political parties at European level. State funding of European political parties is quite different, therefore, to state funding of political groups within the European Parliament. In the UK, short money, as it is known, is provided for the support of opposition parties' leadership in their parliamentary activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Our view also is that the Schleicher report does not follow the principles of the Nice Declaration. Article 191 of the Declaration states: "The provisions on the funding for political parties shall apply on the same basis for all these political forces represented in the European Parliament." The Schleicher report quite clearly discriminates against some of the smaller parties and groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as Commissioner Patten said: "This regulation is mistaken in principle, unworkable in practice and discriminatory in effect."</p>
<p class="contents">However, I wish to thank all the colleagues who understand that, like Europe, our group and our delegation do thrive on its differences. Nevertheless, for the reasons stated, that is why I and my British colleagues will be opposing this premature report.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, my late grandfather, Harold Macmillan, always held the view that Members of Parliament should not be paid, because when they were paid it attracted the wrong sort of chap.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schreyer,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we are firmly convinced that Article 191 of the Treaty establishes an important principle. I quote: “Political parties at European level are important as a factor for integration within the Union. They contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union.”</p>
<p class="contents">If this is the case and if the European parties are also to play the role assigned to them, then they need, in an open and transparent way, to be put on a sound and legitimate footing and to receive the necessary resources to do their work. This, in essence, is the reasoning behind the proposal for a regulation on the financing of European political parties which we are debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, warm thanks go to Mrs Schleicher for her excellent work. In addition, on behalf of the Commission I should also like to thank those involved from the other committees for their proposed amendments, in particular Mr Marinho from the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market and Mr Costa Neves from the Committee on Budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage I should also like briefly once again to address the issue of the legal base for the proposal and, particularly with regard to yesterday's debate, emphasise once more that the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, has obviously checked very carefully what the legal base is and can be. Article 191, as it stands in the Treaty of Maastricht, is merely declarative in nature and does not contain a specific provision which would make it possible to adopt the requisite legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">We understood the urgent appeal which was made to us last year in the wake of the Court of Auditors' report which criticised current practices, namely to find ways and means to establish a sound legal base. As you know, we opted for a twin-track approach. The first track, which led to success in Nice, was to incorporate a specific provision in Article 191 to make it possible in the future for a legal act on the financing of European political parties to be adopted by a qualified majority under the codecision procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we proposed interim rules on the basis of Article 308. This is a sound legal base for this proposal. We received a boost here from the political signal sent out in Nice at the highest political level. We are pleased that this Parliament's Legal Affairs Committee also supports the concept of interim rules on the basis of Article 308.</p>
<p class="contents">In its proposal the Commission tried to adhere to two principles. Firstly, when defining European parties we wanted to leave room for manoeuvre and make it possible for the concept to evolve. At the same time, however, we wanted to put in place minimum democratic standards and minimum requirements for European representativeness and guarantee a maximum degree of transparency in respect of financing. On the definition of European parties, allow me to say quite clearly that European parties in no way have to toe a particular European political line, but the values of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights must be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">As the amendments originally submitted to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs showed, people's views on how precisely the funding principles should be implemented can diverge widely. The Commission has tried to reach a consensus and find a happy medium. I wish to comment on the most important amendments before the House. We share the view that there should be a reference to the Charter of Fundamental Rights. We also share the view that European political parties ought to have legal personality. Furthermore, we welcome the idea of greater transparency and having a high degree of transparency where private donations to parties are concerned, which means disclosure of these donations. We also think that the amendments which would allow Parliament to make facilities available to parties in return for a fee merit discussion.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we do need to guarantee of course that this does not once again lead to covert party financing. The right rules need to be found for this.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of representativeness, that is the question of the number of Member States in which parties need to be represented in parliaments or have achieved a certain degree of success in elections, we believe that our proposed requirements are balanced and we stand by them. Allow me to add that the Commission made a conscious decision to have an absolute figure rather than a relative figure – so not one third or one quarter – after a lengthy discussion, because precisely because of the enlargement process this would obviously raise the question of what happens if you have different figures in one parliamentary term during the enlargement process. Would an adjustment have to be made each time? What does a quarter mean in respect of a figure of 21 or 23 Member States? This would mean that extra rules would constantly have to be dreamt up. For this reason we explicitly propose the figure five.</p>
<p class="contents">We thought that a procedure which was independent of Parliament for settling disputes concerning compliance with the conditions in Article 1, that is compliance with the criteria for European parties, was the most expedient. However, this is an issue for political judgment where we can defer to Parliament's position, and we could therefore accept Amendment No 13.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 22 on the period of validity of the Regulation. We have particular legal or constitutional difficulties with two amendments: firstly with Amendment No 16, which would prohibit donations from publicly owned enterprises. Quite apart from the difficulties of identifying these, in the light of Article 295 we think it is difficult to justify a ban of this kind at European level from a legal point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Commission has considerable difficulties with Amendment No 21 on penalties. We can accept the second sentence, “Monies wrongly received must be refunded.” I would point out, however, that this is simply reiterating normal budget rules.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously we have no objections to the principles mentioned in the first sentence, but the procedure is out of all proportion. Funds are granted by the Commission in accordance with the usual rules. Article 274 offers neither the Council nor Parliament the opportunity to intervene in the budget's penal system. The expression, “appropriate financial penalties”, which is contained in the amendment, is too imprecise and would raise legal problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the amendments adopted in the committee, the Commission can accept the following amendments: Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5 (first sentence), 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17 (in part), 18, 19, 20 and 21 (in part). As far as the amendments tabled directly in Parliament are concerned, the Commission could also accept Amendments Nos 23, 31, 32, 34, 37, 56, 58 and 62. Amendments Nos 33, 46 and 57, which concern the same issue, do – as I have said – merit discussion. However, I would refer once again to the associated risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I could make one brief comment on the period of validity. The Commission has proposed that the Regulation should expire at the end of the second financial year following its entry into force. Why this temporary status? I would once again point out that this is of course also about taking advantage of the experience which we gain over the two years in the next regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Party financing is a politically sensitive issue. It is precisely for this reason that it is important for us to discuss it and legislate on it with transparency and openness. The Commission hopes that we will very soon have transparent legislation of this kind. It is in the democratic interest. It is in the interests of democracy and in the interests of democracy in the Community.</p>
