<p class="contents">Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent. Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened. This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President. These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union. The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip. Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America. Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region. However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki. I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago. Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent. These were essentially of three types which I will describe. The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management. The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union’s relations with third countries and other organisations. This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council. Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union. I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch. You can be satisfied with the progress made. The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration. This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties. In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union. This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces. Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends. We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad. We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent. Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki. In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission. I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility. Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace. It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States. It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year. This is a major operation and an important objective but I can say that we are in a position to meet this challenge which the Heads of State and Government posed in Helsinki. On Monday, just two days ago, in Sintra, a beautiful city very close to Lisbon, the Defence Ministers of the fifteen Member States met and took some important decisions towards implementing this Headline Goal defined in Helsinki. The proposed timetable is tight but essential and will require great determination from all of us, including this House. I will set this out in five points. Firstly, before the next General Affairs Council which will take place this month, we shall be able to define precisely the detailed and specific meaning of the Headline Goal, bearing in mind the views that the military planners may consider appropriate. To say that we will deploy 60 000 soldiers in a peacekeeping operation is not the same thing as organising an operation to achieve peace. We must therefore have considered all possible scenarios so that we can do this job and do it well. Before 24 March we will therefore have established this timetable so that the General Affairs Council can, on this date, do its job and do it well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must look at the capacity which each country has so that this total force of 60 000 soldiers is distributed in an orderly and efficient manner between the fifteen countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must look at the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can provide. We may not have enough between the fifteen countries which will have to make an additional effort to meet the proposed needs. How can we do this? This should be decided by a Conference of the fifteen countries to look at the gap between what we want and what we have and to see how to distribute what we need among the fifteen Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, the timetable must ensure that, by December of this year during the French presidency, the process can be completed with a major conference of forces from all the countries to ensure that the needs and capacities match. We will then be able to say truthfully that we have a plan of what we must do between the end of the year 2000 and the year 2003 which is the date we have set for having this capacity available. This is what we are doing and we are committed to this. We have worked hard in recent months and weeks and will continue to do so for the rest of this year during the Portuguese presidency, which is clearly carrying out excellent work, and during the French presidency which will undoubtedly continue working with the same speed and skill as it has demonstrated on other occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to say that in the meantime there will be at least four European Councils, those in Lisbon and Feira and two during the French presidency. On these four occasions, the Heads of Government will also be ready to continue examining these issues so that we do not lose the momentum and so that, by the year 2003, we are able to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary. Madam President, we are therefore working on this issue with determination, energy and the full support of all the governments and all the Heads of Government.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two further points to make on this process. The European Union must carry out this whole operation in collaboration with the third countries to which I have referred which, although geographically in Europe, are not members of the European Union. We have to work with these countries and involve them so that if such a crisis arises, which I hope will not be the case, all forces and all countries will be more than welcome. Secondly, we have to be able to establish a smooth and transparent relationship with NATO. The operations to be carried out in the future will be of three types. The first type will be operations in which European forces are involved within the framework of NATO. The second will be operations involving European forces and directed by them, but using the means and infrastructure of NATO. The third will be operations in which the European forces act alone. In the first and second types we will need to cooperate with NATO and must therefore establish a transparent, positive and confident relationship between ourselves and NATO, as appropriate, which will be good for both the Alliance and ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I have talked about the military capacity which we are ready to provide, the timetable which we want to apply and what has been achieved in recent months. However, we must not forget that these crisis operations must be tackled from a civilian front as well. As far as possible, we are also providing or trying to provide solutions to any humanitarian crises and public order crises such as those which are currently unfortunately occurring in Kosovo and the Balkans. We are working in this direction with the Commission and Commissioner Patten. On Saturday morning I will meet with all the Ministers for Home Affairs of the fifteen Member States to try and make them see the need to mobilise a police force as well. There are times when a crisis which started out with a military need develops so that, after a few months, a police force is needed rather than a military force. Then, in the final moments of the crisis, it is perhaps courts or bodies to create democratic institutions which a country may need more than police. In this respect we are also working closely and positively with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to say much more on these issues. Many other events have taken place in recent weeks which I should like to mention, such as in Kosovo, the Middle East and Chechnya. There are also many other issues which I should like to discuss with you. However, I would prefer, Madam President, to stop at this point and allow questions to be asked so that I have time to answer them.</p>
<p class="contents">However, before this happens, I must tell you about a telephone conversation which I had a few hours ago with the Council of Europe representative on the subject of Chechnya. Mr Gil-Robles returned this morning from Chechnya where he visited Grozny. When we spoke he gave me his initial impressions which are not good, as you can imagine. The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating. In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations. In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat. Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you. Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible. These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment. I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech. I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning. I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations. Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Madam President, this is the second time we have had occasion to enter into discussion with the High Representative Javier Solana, and I would like to begin by addressing a few words to the Commission’s representative, Chris Patten. The first time we entered into discussion with the High Representative for the CFSP, the Commission, represented by Chris Patten, took the floor, at the request of our Group, and also at my personal request and with the support of all the group chairmen. I freely admit that we omitted to take this into consideration when drawing up the agenda for today.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I would ask you and the group chairmen that, in future, we always ensure that whenever we have discussions with the High Representative, the Commission takes the floor as a matter of form, because the Commission must play its part in the development of European policy….</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">… and that we should all bear this in mind. We are fairly and squarely to blame for not having taken this into consideration. I hope, Commissioner Patten, that you will still have the opportunity to evaluate our discussion.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, you mentioned Sintra. It was a great achievement to have brought the 15 Defence Ministers together. There is talk of the military, troops and soldiers, and rightly so. Things are moving in the right direction, but I want to reinforce the point that the military – troops and soldiers – is not an end in itself; rather it underpins everything we do in the name of human dignity, democracy, the constitutional state, peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts. I had hoped to hear the 15 States of the European Union protest a great deal louder than has proved to be the case in recent weeks, in the face of the murders and crimes perpetrated by the Russian government and the Russian military in Chechnya. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It sometimes seems to me that we are critical of small countries – and sometimes excessively so – but that we knuckle under where large countries are concerned However, our guiding principle must be that wherever crimes are committed, we must respond to this with words and, where possible, with the appropriate measures.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have made great strides in recent years on account of the Treaty of Maastricht, then the Treaty of Amsterdam, and the outcomes of Saint Malo, Cologne, and now Sintra. Of course, we welcome this with open arms. Mr Solana, if we were to start building up this 60 000-strong core of troops now, then it would supposedly be fit for action within 60 days. However, the rhetoric our governments in the countries of the European Union are using must be followed up with deeds. Several governments are cutting back on their budgets and also their defence capability. This goes against all the rhetoric we are hearing these days. Please encourage the governments in the countries of the European Union to put their money where their mouth is, so that we are not left with rhetoric and less security at the end of the day, but rather we have a more secure Europe.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Now our American friends have expressed some concerns, and I emphasise “our American friends” for we do want a North Atlantic Alliance between the USA and Europe that operates in an amicable manner and on the basis of equal rights. So there are concerns, and people talk in terms of the three “D’s”. Decoupling, i.e. the fear that Europe might decouple from America, then there is the fear of duplication, i.e. the duplication of military instruments, as well as competences and military command structures. Lastly, there is discrimination, i.e. the fear that NATO Members that are not members of the EU will be discriminated against. I urge you, after all, you have the experience having been Secretary-General of NATO, and I am convinced that you will endorse what I am about to say, to allay these fears by taking practical action and ensuring, as the incumbent NATO Secretary-General put it, that we make the three “I’s” a reality: i.e. indivisibility, improvement and inclusion. The indivisibility of transatlantic security, the improvement of the European capability and, lastly, the inclusion of those European NATO partners who are not members of the European Union in the process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Military intervention must only ever be a last resort. I commend you for having made that point. The best security policy we can pursue in the non-military sense is the enlargement of the European Union eastwards, so as to achieve greater stability there, and dialogue with the Arab and Islamic states, so as to be able to live in peace with the countries in the Mediterranean region as well.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">A final comment: I heard, to my amazement and wonder, that the Belgian Defence Minister, Flahaut, declared in Sintra that Belgium wished to break off its military and political relations with Austria. Now I do not know what these military and political relations are, but I am bound to say that there is an unacceptable moral arrogance behind such considerations which is unworthy of a government of a country whose capital hosts the European institutions. Let us put an end to this isolationism which creates divisions between countries and peoples by pulling together instead. For only if we pull together within the European Union and live in harmony will we also be able to set an example for peace and the peaceful resolution of conflicts outside the European Union. I urge those of the 14 States who are conducting themselves in the way I have roundly criticised the Belgian government for to work to this end. Let us be peaceable and live in harmony ourselves. That is why we must pull together and not isolate anyone within the European Union.</p>

We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit. We know that you have an important role in this. I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question. </p>
<p class="contents">We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya. My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group. I want to concentrate on Kosovo. It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means. The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term. It has now reached the point where the Pentagon has prohibited American forces from returning to northern Mitrovica. They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops. </p>
<p class="contents">It is easy to despair in the face of the violence and the hatred, but it is important for the sake of Kosovo, the Balkans and Europe that we do not fail. Through the Stability Pact, we have taken major steps which place us under an obligation. This is therefore a test of credibility for the Union’s common foreign and security policy. </p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, there is a huge shortage of suitable personnel in Kosovo. Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force. I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing. I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied. When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament’s and, as I understand it, also the Commission’s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo. </p>
<p class="contents">The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action. Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently. Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity. On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction. I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre. My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind? How have these been organised by Mr Solana’s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Haarder (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders. I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks. But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe. Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights. I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament. You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something. When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged. So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either. You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers. As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo. It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war. Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats. Everything else is wishful thinking. That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra.</p>
<p class="contents">The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny. This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States. No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament. It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army. It will be a force comprised of various national units. What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment. However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament. As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion. Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister. He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much. Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table. We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired. There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all. That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers. It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006. But what about Kosovo in the year 2000? </p>
<p class="contents">You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment. He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina. He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo. A man with three children and he was murdered. We need policemen in Kosovo right now! We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice. I am not a warmonger, but if we do not have soldiers to stop the criminals in Kosovo, then what is the point in having soldiers at all? People may have to risk their lives in Kosovo, but that is the price of freedom at the moment. If we allow what is happening today in Kosovo to continue – border provocation, Serbian provocation, Albanian provocation, etc. – we are heading for war. </p>
<p class="contents">Tell me, what civilian forces are being mobilised, Mr Patten? We need a civilian task force in Kosovo now to monitor what is happening, and to tell the military and the police what they must do, otherwise everything we did in Bosnia and everything we did in Kosovo will be negated by the reality of a country that is sinking deeper and deeper into violence.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Interruption from the extreme right by Mr Martinez)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have a major problem, because we are providing travel warrants for the people, but we are incapable of acting when there is an enormous humanitarian crisis, as in Chechnya. Mr Poettering is right – when he is right you have to tell him so. He is not always right, but in this case he is. I am in favour of a hardline policy against Austria, but we shall then have a responsibility towards Russia. I do not like foreign ministers who say nothing – whether they are German and from my party, whether they are French from the broad left or whether they are Italians from any party! In the current situation, we should say to the Russians “If you want money, if you want us to reduce your debts, you must allow a civilian peacekeeping force into Russia”. If not, we are not prepared to pay for their war, since, by reducing the debt, by giving them money, we are paying their soldiers to carry out the massacres. We are accomplices in the massacres in Chechnya if we continue to give money to the butchers.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is not enough just to say, “You, the murderers, please stop the slaughter!” They know full well that they should not commit these acts. Do you think that Mr Putin does not know that what he is doing in Chechnya is not good? But that is his strategy, he instigated this war. From the beginning, he wanted this war in order to become president.</p>
<p class="contents">So that is the world as it is today. For that reason I say to you: my Group is not entirely in agreement, but I am in favour of European defence. I believe that European defence should be scrutinised by the European Parliament and by the national parliaments. First of all, the European Parliament must give the green light to something and then the national parliaments will decide whether or not to send their soldiers. If a civilian task force can, at the same time, intervene before and during a conflict and if we fail to take that step, we are behaving like children who like to play at sending in soldiers, but who are incapable of sending in civilians. As long as we do not have a balance between the military and the civilian elements, we shall not be credible.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What my Group deplores, however, Mr Solana, is that you seem to wish to fulfil your important responsibilities in far too unilateral a fashion.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, you only deal with the security considerations in their military dimension, by making virtual deadlock with regard to what we believe is essential, that is to say, a major policy of prevention, very much upstream of the risks of conflict, that would in itself deserve a common strategy at Union level. Furthermore, in the autonomous defence capability that you propound, if what you claim as a defence capability to be mobilised is only too clear, as it involves on average the doubling of the expenditure invested in the military field, its autonomy is, on the contrary, much more of a problem, judging by the degree of NATO, and therefore United States’, involvement in European decisions on defence that one part of the Council and, it would seem, you personally, wish for.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally and in particular, we hardly hear you speak at all about the other part of your mission: the foreign policy of the Union. In our view, you cannot be content with a kind of minimum service in this field, as current events remind us at the moment.<br /><br />For example, take the case of Chechnya. For six months now, owing to sordid ambitions of power, the Russian administration has been conducting a dirty colonial war, piling on more dreadful atrocities every day. Beyond the rather general remarks that you have made and that you are no doubt going to reiterate here, what is the Union’s current strategy towards Russia? Forgive me for saying so, but up to now we have only observed lenience and inertia, while this great country is sinking before our eyes into an increasingly uncontrollable and dangerous situation for the peace and security of the whole continent.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the Middle East, the peace process is getting bogged down and tensions are again rising in a very worrying way. What initiatives do the Fifteen envisage to prevent the glimmer of hope that arose at the time with the defeat of Mr Netanyahu from being, in turn, extinguished, opening the way for something worse.</p>
<p class="contents">In the Balkans, a year after the NATO bombings started and in the light of the significant crisis in Mitrovica, are you prepared to carry out a critical evaluation of the whole strategy implemented in this region in order to learn some useful lessons?</p>
<p class="contents">In the South, particularly Africa, the unbearable pictures that we have seen from Mozambique cannot be explained solely by the natural disaster, but reflect the pitiless consequences of under-development. They call into question the ambitions that we set ourselves with regard to this part of the world and, consequently, the changes to be advocated in the current world order, or rather, disorder. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally to the Echelon network: are you, at the very least, going to ask that this incredible affair be tabled on the agenda of the next European Union-United States Summit? My Group would like our dialogue, our cooperation and, where appropriate, our political confrontations, to be included too, and primarily, among these issues. Many people expect that of us, in Europe and throughout the world. I think these meetings are not to be missed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We believe that poor old Europe can only speak with one voice to say nothing or, and this is possibly more serious, that it can only resolve its diplomatic contradictions by simply tagging along with American politics. In the lyrical mode of illusion and evasion that they are so fond of, at Sintra, the Fifteen decided to equip themselves with an action force that is ‘pretentiously’ called autonomous. Now, the Union can certainly call the body an ‘action force’ even though for the moment it is only the mobilisation of a few funds and the mustering – on paper – of men, weapons and logistics. But to believe that this muddle can be autonomous is another matter altogether. What interests will this so-called force defend, in view of the fact that the countries of Europe do not have the same interests?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us just consider for a moment. What is the basis of armed action? It is the defence of a territory, the protection of a country and in general of interests considered to be vital? Just what is an army in the absence of a home country, in the absence of territory – because Europe is incapable of clearly defining its borders – and in the absence of clearly identified vital interests, which the Fifteen have, for good reason, never dared to discuss. In short, what purpose can an armed force have in the absence of any policy?</p>
<p class="contents">We fall back on a kind of ersatz army based on humanitarian rights, a kind of army in the service of vague ideas, of an ideal, the dangers of which have many times been shown in history. A foreign policy presupposes that one has a clear definition of oneself and of one’s own interests. But the CFSP will never be anything else other than a cover for the national interests that already manage to dominate the system. Who cannot see that in this case we are dealing with the twosome formed by London and Berlin, escorted by their respective henchmen, and who have no concept of their own diplomacy as being distinct from that of Washington, seeing themselves at best as bit-part players.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, you yourself are a perfect illustration of this, as it were, structural complicity, passing smoothly from NATO to the CFSP as if they were one and the same. Of course, in reality, they are the same thing. It is still the old imperial service. It is not without some amusement that we have seen you, in your pathetic rivalry with Mr Patten, present this delightful and most charming argument: one day you told a German newspaper, “I am the one that the Americans phone up”. You might have added, Mr Solana, ‘to give me their instructions’, because that is what we see, in fact. In the case of the Balkans, just like everywhere else, one day the United States wants us to destroy the place and the next day they are asking us to rebuild it. Yes, Jean-Claude Martinez was indeed right to interrupt you, Daniel Cohn-Bendit. In every case, it is follow-my-leader syndrome.</p>
<p class="contents">Do you think I am going over the top? Every day the news brings more proof of our subservience. Echelon is one of many examples of this, giving an image of Europe that is quite different to the one we like to envisage here. The experts speak of a cultural problem, I think they might be right!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You say that you are against war, but as Secretary-General of NATO you started a war. A war of aggression, slavishly carrying out American military policy, in a sphere that was not that of the North Atlantic Treaty, against a state that had never been a member, that was not threatening any international borders and in violation of the rules of international law that establish the principle of non-interference as well as those governing the declaration of war.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, even Mr Cohn-Bendit – and that is saying something – can gauge the results of the disastrous policy that he so wished for. We also have several questions to ask you that show our concern, that is the least one can say.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, in your view, does the common foreign and security policy aim to protect the security of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or do you recognise their right to intervene anywhere in the world?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if you do recognise this right, then what standards of international law and political morality are you going to base your decisions on? I can already hear your reply: humanitarian standards. In Kosovo, it was for humanitarian reasons that we systematically destroyed all the civilian infrastructure in Serbia. When the US killed 2 000 people in Panama, it was not to impose their politics, it was to combat drug trafficking. When they landed in Somalia, before having to withdraw in disarray, it was not to guarantee their takeover of the oil route, it was to restore hope. ‘Restore hope’, do you remember? In a nutshell, can you not see that nowadays all these evil deeds are committed for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, you spoke about using the great resources of crisis management. Not to make war, of course, but to protect peace. But these are always the words that those who conduct preventative wars use to justify their actions. Can you assure us that there will not be a preventative war against any State you care to mention, particularly those which, in their elections, do not ratify the policy adopted by the other Member States of the Union?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana, these questions convey our concern. You say that you are against war, but you would not be the first warmonger to swear that. May God spare us the disastrous consequences of the bombastic principles that you have just put forward. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As candidate countries of the European Union, they therefore wish to fully participate in this interesting initiative from the very beginning, that is to say as of now. This request, however, was not honoured by the Council at its Helsinki Summit at the end of last year. In the Finnish capital only vague pledges were made regarding consultation and cooperation. </p>
<p class="contents">This is why I would like to ask the High Representative, Mr Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are, or will be, involved in European military crisis management plans. </p>
<p class="contents">Given Poland’s rather critical stance, this question is all the more pressing. Its reservation is captured in the following, rather blunt wording: avoid American isolationism <span class="italic">and</span> European separatism. As one might expect, the Polish Foreign Affairs Minister, Mr Bronislaw Geremek, has expressed this concern in more diplomatic terms: “The development of a European defence identity should not be at the expense of NATO’s unity. If anything, the European defence identity should serve to strengthen NATO”. We all very much share this opinion. </p>
<p class="contents">Minister Geremek is certainly not the only leader among the new NATO Members from central and eastern Europe who feels excluded from this crucial process today. The Czech Defence Minister, for example, shares this opinion. In the autumn of last year, the latter stated: “Security within Europe is not divisible. It cannot be restricted to a small number of countries, with others only being allowed to observe or execute decisions”. </p>
<p class="contents">These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana. Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us! What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana’s fault. It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members.</p>
<p class="contents">We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union. In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred.</p>
<p class="contents">The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies. In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy. One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about.</p>
<p class="contents">This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union. Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure? I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the ‘Crisex 2000’ exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation?</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You have, Mr Solana, heard the force of the criticisms made by the Members of Parliament who do not accept the appalling situations in Kosovo, Chechnya and elsewhere. For my part, I do not wish to give up hope. And today, as far as you are concerned, I acknowledge your efforts to build a European security and defence policy that is worthy of the name and which has not hitherto existed. Indeed, we are still a long way from having achieved the desired objective, in any case, the objective that I wish to achieve. But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the “what is to be done” variety. The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon. What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings? And finally, what do you most need at these next summits?</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one. It concerns the next IGC. Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established? I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February. Can you tell us your position on this subject? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative. The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent. However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Solana can play an important role in this. He is not stupid. Certainly not! He is a driven man, a competent man. But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even <span class="italic">his</span> level of competence. In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit. One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President. </p>
<p class="contents">From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament. His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact. It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold. This too is unacceptable in my view. </p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power. Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly. We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance. But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies. Some of them are our ACP partners. The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment. </p>
<p class="contents">In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia. We are now unable to guide the peace. This is why Europe is not credible as a Union. I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means. </p>
<p class="contents">As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us. We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs. </p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, Europe does not have a foreign policy to speak of. I can hardly believe that we will ever achieve this at intergovernmental level. In my opinion, it is far too easy to sit down with the military and gather up all the military equipment, which are such nice toys, after all. I am very sceptical about the fact that Commissioner Patten cannot inform us in an equally credible way that he has drafted a prevention plan to stave off further degeneration, underdevelopment and conflicts in Europe and outside.

It is obvious since the NATO bombing stopped eight months ago that the purpose of the bombing was not to stop ethnic cleansing, not to promote peace and order but to drive a wedge even further into Yugoslavia, to change the borders and to promote the New Order.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we are turning a blind eye to the involvement of NATO occupation forces in the savage ethnic cleansing of the Serbs and non-Albanian speaking minorities. All the signs point towards a second round of attacks on Yugoslavia and this is confirmed by the KLA attacks on Serbs in Mitrovica, the attempt to annex three towns in southern Serbia to Kosovo, the promotion of the independence of Kosovo, the fact that two thousand men have been channelled into Kosovo via Greece, despite the objections of the Greek people and, at the same time, intense efforts by NATO and the European Union to overturn the legitimate government of Yugoslavia.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, despite his declarations on humanity and peace, it is clear from what Mr Solana has told us that, according to the Helsinki resolutions, we intend to set up a terrorist army, starting with 60 000 men, in order to strike at anyone who raises their head above the parapet. Mr Solana has confirmed our view that, in a militarised European Union, NATO will have the upper hand. That is why this job went to Mr Solana, the Secretary-General of NATO, who is also guilty of the crimes committed against Yugoslavia; the right man for the right job, against whom charges have been filed, calling for him to be tried as a war criminal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I wonder, and here I do not entirely agree with the positive interpretations of a number of press bodies and fellow Members, about the direction in which we are going. I think that contrary to the great process of Economic and Monetary Union, which was an integrated process within the Community structures, today, unfortunately, the common foreign and security policy is entirely an intergovernmental procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question, Mr Solana and Commissioner, is to establish whether, together, you have framed strategies that will, at least gradually, lead to the creation of a process that integrates the common foreign and security policy within the Community process. We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union. We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries. We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community. Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, with regard to Kosovo – Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point – I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo. Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much. I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example. Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example. So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But I do wonder what his own view is on this.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful. You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks. But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light? I – and I believe many with me in Parliament – would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent. </p>
<p class="contents">Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO. One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course. The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar. We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar. Actually, I hear less and less about this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment. It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well. </p>
<p class="contents">But is there not more to it than that? I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO’s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence. The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks. Is this actually how we want things done? </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg. Will it be omitted? </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets. I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks. I wonder how this will develop. I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future. Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling? </p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy. I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? The fabric of Turkey’s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. That would seem odd to me. Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. Will they also take part in our defence policy? It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further. I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference. A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation. We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management. At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing.</p>

Whilst the three new committees are up and running as of today, the question of parliamentary control remains completely unclear and open. The Portuguese presidency has already conceded this, whereas you, Mr Solana, have not said so much as one word about it. We therefore demand extensive involvement for the European Parliament in matters of security when it comes to widening the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The second way in which the Sintra meeting fell short was that although there are now efficient military decision-making structures, the concept of non-military crisis management is still completely nebulous. However, the ability of the European Union to undertake non-military crisis prevention takes precedence in our view. In other words: it takes precedence in terms of the sequence of events and European intervention, but also in terms of the provision of resources. Hence, this is precisely the area where any increase in funding in the sphere of non-military capabilities must be concentrated. Again, this is something you made no mention of whatsoever today, Mr Solana. If you allocate 0.7% of national budgets for military armaments, then I wonder if it would not make a great deal more sense to earmark 10% of the EU budget for conflict prevention. For then we would be able to save the 0.7% from the national budgets which is allocated for military purposes, and this is, of course, a much more significant amount. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Over the last year, the Member States of the Union have, naturally, decided to implement specific measures designed to strengthen the operational capability of their armed forces and the informal summit in Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main trends.</p>
<p class="contents">I have two questions on this subject to which your knowledge of the subjects concerned and the parties involved should make it possible to provide enlightening replies for our further debates and our work.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns the training of this rapid intervention force of 60 000 men, which, as you have said, is likely to be deployed to perform peace-keeping and peace-building missions and be capable of maintaining them on a long-term basis, if necessary. For the information of our colleagues, I must say here that the corresponding contingents should be divided into three parts: one third to prepare the mission, one third to carry it out and one third for rehabilitation, following often difficult ordeals for personnel and equipment. This explains why the initial figures given in the press, setting the volume of the forces to be built up at around 200 000 men, is close to reality, which has certainly surprised the uninitiated.</p>
<p class="contents">My first question, Mr Solana, will be simple and more direct, perhaps, than those of my colleagues who have spoken before me. You know the French proverb, ‘Nothing for nothing’. Do you really think that the governments of the Union are prepared to pay the corresponding price at a time when many of them, apparently at least, have decided to continue to reap what ten years ago were called the peace dividends.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible. You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee. You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union. In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union? Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee? You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My Group was unanimous in its support for the decision reached in Helsinki to afford Turkey an option for accession with the proviso that this country, like any other candidate, must fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria. My Group attaches great importance to the fact that Turkey is being encouraged to fulfil these criteria.

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Hence my questions, Mr Solana, which could equally well be addressed to Commissioner Patten: how, and according to what timetable, is Turkey to be brought up to EU standards following the Helsinki decision? Is there a list of tasks and a concrete schedule, in accordance with which, little by little, Turkey is to fulfil the Copenhagen Criteria, notably the political criteria?

<p class="contents">However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against. I will give you an example. During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region. Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties? This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt. In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination. Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that we are saddling the High Representative with a huge number of questions on a huge number of topics. This indicates the enormity of the problem which Mr Solana is and will be tackling in future. </p>
<p class="contents">We have talked extensively about the EU’s future security framework and about the need to organise a military force of </p>
<p class="contents">60 000. It is somewhat ironic to be contemplating these issues when we appear unable to locate a sufficiently large police force to deal with the situation in Kosovo. Accordingly, I would like to make a few observations, not about the security framework of tomorrow, but about security in the Balkan region today. </p>
<p class="contents">Coordinator Hombach and Commissioner Patten are working hard to push through the Solidarity Pact. Last week, Mr Hombach stated in this Parliament that there are now plans and projects in the pipeline which are waiting for the Stability Pact and the Danube Conference later this month. Two weeks ago in Strasbourg, we also talked extensively to Commissioner Patten about relations with Macedonia. These are all positive developments from which the Balkans stand to benefit. </p>
<p class="contents">What concrete role does the High Representative see carved out for himself? What will his contribution be towards a smooth transition from the Solidarity Pact to the Danube Conference, for that is where we need to concentrate our efforts? </p>
<p class="contents">We are waiting for the European Union’s Balkan strategy, in other words for the Stability Pact to be given its political packaging. What other political initiatives does the High Representative anticipate on the part of the EU? Also, on a practical level: how does he think he can use the new political situation in Croatia to make political progress in the region? In particular I have in mind the further stabilisation of Bosnia. We really should be able to leave this region at some point in the future. In exchange, I think Croatia is entitled to know where it stands with the EU. I think that the new government can also be of help in the political relations with Belgrade. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to mention the countries which are more on the fringe of our policy: Ukraine, Moldova and Belarus. What can the EU do to counter negative trends in these countries? We all know that we will not be able to retreat safely behind the borders of an enlarged European Union in the long run. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful. </p>
<p class="contents">In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today. War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf. As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. If this happens, the United States’ Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention. A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284. However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war. Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late. I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The debate is interesting in that one of the questions it addresses is: who is a terrorist? The debate is also interesting because it is about the relationship between the Prime Minister and the President. However, I certainly do not intend to become embroiled in this debate. It is just that I wonder, Mr Solana, why no one asks what the European position is? Why does it not actually occur to anyone to ask what stance Europe takes on this issue, for surely that ought to be the all-important question!</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Surely a point of controversy between a Prime Minister and a President about an issue as important as this, at a flash point so close to Europe, ought to be irrelevant in view of the fact that Europe as a whole should have a position in this regard. Therefore, I would also like to ask you in this connection, what you intend to do, for example, when it comes to the Middle East – unfortunately peace will be slower in coming than we would like it to be, particularly a lasting peace – in order to expound and assert a European position, and to make it plain for all to see in this important region. This is partly the task of the Commission, but it is also a task that you must surely take on board. This is also particularly relevant to the very important dialogue with the Arab world and the Islamic world, and to the various centres of conflict around the world, one example being the situation in western Sahara, which is by no means unimportant.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that the European Union – in addition to the military aspects, which I would like to place great emphasis on, particularly when it comes to peace in this region, which is not a million miles away from us – should have a clear and unequivocal position. I hope that, once the other important issues have been dealt with, you will also find the time to see to it that a common European position is enunciated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I acknowledge Mr Patten’s efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States had not devoted as much time to sorting out their capacity for disaster relief and humanitarian assistance as they have in the dangerous business of creating military structures that will ultimately duplicate and undermine those of NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries. These are of long standing, but are being addressed already within NATO.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not yet heard a convincing security-policy explanation of why the European Union needs to establish autonomous, decision-making capabilities for the use of military forces outside of the NATO structures unless it is to create bodies which will rival NATO. After all, the EU Member States are either full members of NATO or sit around the Euro Atlantic Partnership Council table. NATO is largely European.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what point there is in having the much heralded policy planning and early warning cell in the Council Secretariat if still we are taken by surprise by yet another humanitarian catastrophe.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters?</p>
<p class="contents">How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive?</p>
<p class="contents">How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called “cleansing”, that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe? And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres? If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia.</p>
<p class="contents">The war in Chechnya proves, if proof were necessary, that the duty or the right to intervene stops at the borders of the great powers. Let us therefore ensure that in future any euro spent in the Russian Federation is spent to alleviate the suffering of the people who are the victims of war, to the exclusion of any other objective.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">That said, I would like to congratulate the high representative on the progress that has been made so far. But it has to be admitted that much of what he said is the progress in institutional matters, and the real test of the European defence identity will be in its ability to produce capability and capacity, rather than nicely formulated institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">And, to that end, I am not clear as to the extent to which we have progressed on developing heavy lift capacity to be able to get these 60 000 troops into operation, or what progress we have made on autonomous intelligence capacity, particularly given the American statements that they are not giving intelligence to Europeans until they can deal with security. We have all heard some of the tales emanating from the Council of Ministers building in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">To what extent are we going to get some form of convergence on defence expenditure, because some Member States spend considerably more than others. And indeed, some Member States are not geared for mobility. They are very static in their military forces, and unsuitable for this sort of warfare.</p>
<p class="contents">Can I perhaps also turn to Mr Patten as well and ask, in terms of the conflict prevention work we are going to be doing, to what extent will it be possible for us to look at long-term conflict-causing situations such as environmental degradation and shortage of water and then incorporate them into mainstream EU policies, particularly in development, because there is no point trying to rapidly respond to something we have had years to put right.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, can I also endorse Mrs Schroedter’s comments that we do need to have a Parliamentary dimension in this defence development. We cannot leave it simply to governments.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The creation of the interim structures and the plans that are now being put into place to provide the military capacity for achieving EU policy objectives are positive steps in the right direction. The recognition that the 60 000 strong military force will be involved in both peacemaking and peacekeeping is also appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, while all these developments are indeed welcome, I would like to address a matter which I have raised in this House on previous occasions. I am anxious to know how effective the EU’s policy planning and early warning unit has been. While Commissioner Patten’s statement later this evening on the unfolding tragedy in Mozambique will be opportune, I would like to know if the policy planning and early warning unit provided advance information.</p>
<p class="contents">Would the High Representative be prepared to say to what extent this unit, which has been strongly supported by the committee of which I and Mr Titley are members, assisted in providing early information, analysis and an indication of the policy planning options open to yourselves? I would also like to support Mr Titley’s comments on an effective role for the Parliament in this whole area.

<p class="contents">We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with. What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations.</p>
<p class="contents">We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya. We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way – serious diplomatic interventions – to stop the slaughter in Chechnya. We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights. We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya.

I will confine myself to asking more questions, as you suggested we should do. I regard the Stability Pact as the best idea we have ever had. However, it must also actually be made to work in such a way that it does not just serve to create frustrations, hence my questions. Firstly: to what extent are you able to influence the professionalism of the Council’s decisions? Could you at last bring about change in this respect? Let me give you an example: there is an institution in Thessaloniki that does not actually exist at all as yet, but it has been set up, namely the Reconstruction Agency for whatever, for the whole of the Balkan region. </p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Stability Pact was established here in Brussels with a single coordinator. Can you tell me how much synergy is lost here and why the Council allows something like that to happen? This is grossly unprofessional! Can you prevent this from happening in future?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, when you talk to the Ministers for Home Affairs on Saturday it must not just be about the remote possibility of sending police officers. I would ask you quite specifically: the police officers in Kosovo at present number scarcely a third of those promised and who are due to travel there. KFOR could step up its presence in Mitrovica and be stationed in crisis areas of Kosovo if its current tasks were to be taken on by policemen.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, could you convince the Council of the fact that its rhetoric at summit meetings must at last be put into practice, in the form of additional financial resources? We need a special fund for crisis regions, so that we are not always taking funds away from other necessary tasks for which financial provision has already been made from other sources; in other words, so as to avoid having to reallocate this money to implement ideas that the Council has suddenly hit on. We need a crisis fund which can then be used to pay for such eventualities.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, a word on the subject of Chechnya. It is all well and good, and touching, when we wring our hands over the mass graves and the refugees. Only I have to ask myself what have we actually done to try and prevent it? Why did we not send an intervention force there when all this was happening?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Heckling from Mr Cohn-Bendit)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We cannot do that, my dear Daniel. Why have we not stopped sending the money that is financing the army over there? I believe that is what our task ought to have been, and you could play a part in this!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments? Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts. I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper. </p>
<p class="contents">If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany’s defence savings. These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe. In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations. In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending. If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters. I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I tend to think that maybe Mr Van den Bos is right that I would need the capacity of the angels to answer so many questions in such a short period of time, but I will try. I will try to do it and I am going to answer one by one all the questions that have been put to me, even if the Member who has put the question is no longer here or tired because of the long session, because they had more important things to do than to listen. But let me start with the first.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Poettering I would like to say that we are not trying to duplicate anything. That question has been put by many Members of the Parliament. We are not trying to duplicate anything. We are trying to do as much as possible so that the European Union has capabilities to act in case of need and at the same time the global security of the European Union, of the countries that belong to our alliance, will be maintained and will be secure. We are not in the business of creating a European Army. If anybody answered that, he is wrong. We are not in the business of creating a European Army. We are in the business of creating capabilities that, put together in case of need, can avoid tragedies such as those we have recently experienced. It is very important to be talking about prevention. It is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you, and you know, that prevention capabilities exist already in the Union. We do not have to invent them. They exist already. Is ECHO not a preventative agency? Is our capability to act diplomatically not a preventative capability? What we did not have at all was the possibility of acting at the other extreme of the spectrum of crisis management.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is going to be, at the end of the day, the most important group of countries able to face problems related to crisis matters, from the humanitarian crises to force deployment. In Mozambique if it is necessary, or in the countries of Europe if it is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">In a very few days Eurocorps built up by European countries is going to be deployed to Kosovo not to walk around, but to prevent people from killing one another. And I would like to tell my friend Mr Cohn-Bendit that at this very moment, </p>
<p class="contents">45 000 soldiers from our country – not from any other country – the majority from our country – are deployed in Kosovo – to do what? To prevent people from killing one another. Do you think really that because we deploy soldiers, we are going change the minds of people who have been suffering for centuries? Do you imagine for a moment that because we deploy soldiers, the souls and the minds of people are going to change.</p>
<p class="contents">How many centuries will it take to change the mentality of countries which have been fighting against one another morally, psychologically, even physically for years? Do you really think that by deploying troops on the ground, the minds of people are going to change?</p>
<p class="contents">Soldiers can prevent people from killing one another, but they cannot guarantee that people will love each other. It would be fantastic, but really for me the most important gift would be to be able to deploy European forces to make people love each other where they were killing each other. Unfortunately, even with the capacities I have, even with the number of jobs that I supposedly have, even with the little sleep that I get, it is impossible to do that.</p>
<p class="contents">But let me also tell you something. Even if we deployed policemen, as you have demanded, this would not completely solve the problem. Do you honestly think that in Mitrovica policemen from UN countries would solve the problem?</p>
<p class="contents">We need, at this point, still to have a deployment of military personnel and then in other places, of course, we need policemen. But do governments have the capacity to deploy policemen at the rate that is required. We are trying very hard, but it is very difficult to do this.</p>
<p class="contents">Military personnel in our countries are waiting for a crisis. Policemen in our countries are working 24 hours a day, and for governments it is difficult sometimes to find the appropriate police force to be deployed. We do not need unarmed policemen or traffic policemen. We need something very different, to serve as an interface between military and police and that is a very difficult profile which that does not exist in many countries. Those countries that do have this are deploying them and I feel they are doing what they can.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Mr Patten and I are working very, very hard to deploy, or to make or convince countries to deploy as many policemen as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, Mr Haarder asked about the risk of a rift between the European Union and NATO. I do not think there is a risk. I think we can do something which is compatible and would be beneficial for everybody. For us as Europeans, it would represent a link. I do not see why we should become estranged or split or damage the capacity that we have to continue working together. But then again, we are not trying to create a European army.</p>
<p class="contents">To explain to you the whole foreign policy of the European Union in the fifty minutes that you have given me would be an almost impossible task. Instead I wanted to share with you the latest step which I think has been very important in the last three months, and I think I have the obligation to tell you all that.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, do we need a sort of civilian corps to be deployed? The people who are there already with their white uniforms, the white uniforms of the European Union have been deployed in Bosnia for many, many years and are now deployed in Kosovo. The person in charge of the UN is a European and a good man, Mr Bernard Kouchner, who is doing a lot. This is another manner in which Europeans are committed to the peace in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">I have not talked especially about the Middle East, but you know we can spend hours talking about that. Let me say two things only. The Troika visited the Middle East at the beginning of the year. It visited all the countries of the region and got a clear picture of what is going on there. Unfortunately, at this very moment the Syrian track is still not moving although there is some possibility that in the near future it may. As you know, the Palestinian track is in difficulty at this very moment. If there is some light, some progress might be made but at this point I have no good news to report to you. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, the European countries are doing their best to continue cooperating in the peace process and offering to help all parties when it is required in order to implement the agreements that will be reached. That help will be needed. At that time, we will have to come here to argue for help, because probably in the budget that we have now in the European Union, we do not have money to tackle the problems that it may be necessary to tackle if the agreement, a just agreement, is reached in the region.</p>
<p class="contents">Many questions have been asked about what I think about the IGC, security, defence, etc. I do not know how to answer that question. As you know, the IGC has a structure with a limited agenda. I have the impression that as time goes by the agenda will be enlarged, but that is probably an impression that I had, an impression that probably you share with me, but I am not in the position to make an affirmation or to state that. It is something that we will see evolving as time goes by.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me answer the specific questions about the statement that has been made by the Minister for Defence of France about 0.7. He never said 0.7 with reference to expenditure on defence. He was referring, if I understood properly, to research including military research. I think this is an objective that the countries have to decide if they want to do it or not.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the documents of Sintra which are being finalised, the document which the political committee is working on, I do not have the authority to share it with you at this point, but without any doubt it will be shared with you. I will be more than happy to cooperate concerning the political committee in times of crises in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">In reply to the question about Article V, we have two article Vs as you know. One Article V for those countries that belong to the alliance and the other Article V for the countries that belong to the WEU. The WEU is going to transfer its assets to the European Union, or certain parts. It still is not clear what is going to happen to Article V itself. As you know, there are countries in the European Union which are not ready and they will not accept a transfer of Article V, Brussels article, into the European Union framework and therefore we cannot do it. If you want to include defence in the IGC it probably will not be possible to go so far as to incorporate Article V of the Brussels Treaty into the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">How far will foreign policy be brought under the Community framework in the coming years? I do not know. You are asking the question to the wrong person – I do not know. I have various ideas about that, but it will be the Intergovernmental Conference and, by definition, the countries, the governments who take the decisions; and therefore I have my own ideas but I am sure that is not interesting for you to know my own ideas. It is much more important to see what the country has done.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Morillon I would like to answer a few questions. I know that he has been an expert on these questions for the many, many years that he has been dealing with them. I would like to say that as regards the status of those countries which are not members of the European Union but which are members of the alliance and eventually will be members of the European Union, we would like to get them involved. To get them involved upstream before a decision is taken for an operation and downstream when the decision has been taken and if they want to participate in the crisis management operation, then we treat them as equals with the same rights and the same obligations that the other countries have.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Galeote Quecedo asked about the diplomatic corps in the European Union. Well this is something that a lot of people are thinking about. I do not think that it will take place tomorrow. After the conversation we have had with the Commission it is a good idea to move in that direction but we are a long way off from a diplomatic corps as such. Cooperation, helping as much as possible, is possible, but to go in that direction to the end, unfortunately is a distant vision at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">There were several questions about the stability pact. The stability pact is going to figure high on the agenda in late March of the first financial conference in which projects are going to be discussed. It is working well and I very much hope that it will be a great success for the countries of the region and also for the European Union. The European Union is not the only contributor but without any doubt it is a major contributor.</p>
<p class="contents">I fought against dictatorship for many years, I suffered a lot, I have been in jail and I am very, very proud to be here to defend the European Union, the democratic Parliament and to tell you that we are prepared to deploy forces not to make war but to make peace.</p>
<p class="contents">You know very well that Helsinki took a very important decision, a very important decision concerning Chechnya. The Prime Ministers and Heads of Government took an important decision. We were the only group of countries that took a decision like that. We decided not only on words but also on deeds and two important decisions were taken concerning trade and humanitarian aid. That was done and is continuing to be done</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow and the day after Chris Patten and myself will have a meeting with Mr Ivanov and the Presidency of course, in Lisbon. We will have again a meeting with the United States the following day and then we will have a trilateral meeting, the United States and European Union and Russia together in which, as you can imagine, the number one item on the agenda is going to be Chechnya. We are doing what we can. We have not stopped putting all the pressure upon them because we are very much aware of the crisis that will ensue, not only for today but for tomorrow, if, at the end of the day, Russia evolves in a direction that is no good for anybody.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to have a solid bilateral relationship with Russia. It is very important for Europe, but we want to have that with a Russia that understands that certain things cannot be done. That is what we have been saying, that is what has guided our actions from the very beginning and I think as you look at the position that Mr Patten and I have maintained from the very beginning, you can look in the records and see that what we are saying – what I am saying now, is the truth.</p>
<p class="contents">There are probably many more questions that were asked. Let me end – I do not want to take up your time any longer – by saying that I am ready to come here whenever you want but I would prefer, if it is possible, to have sessions in which we concentrate on some topics and develop them to the fullest, because if not, we have so many topics, so many issues that it is very difficult to really treat them in depth. I am prepared to do it – you know that from me and I am really ready to do it whenever is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">At this very moment, I wanted to share with you one important thing. Helsinki was in December and our Prime Ministers and our Heads of State asked us to do something very important for the first time. To have capabilities and make an effort for crisis management even for the military. I am proud to tell you that two months after that we have started and we are moving in the right direction. I think that the Members of the Parliament, as representatives of our citizens should be proud of that.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Patten,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – I am very grateful to have this opportunity of contributing to the debate on the statement made by the High Representative. I will not detain the Parliament for long but perhaps I could make one or two points and begin, which is sometimes rather dangerous in any Parliament, by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality. Mrs Pack did that in her remarks and anywhere that she is prepared to blaze a trail I think the rest of us should be courageous enough to follow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say a word or two myself on that particular subject. I spoke last week at the extremely interesting session that was organised between members of the NATO parliamentary assembly and Members of this Parliament. Many of you were there on that occasion and I think that it is fair to say that you could have cut the scepticism with a knife among many of the NATO parliamentary delegates when we spoke about Europe’s ambitions in the area of CFSP. This was particularly true with some of the American delegates who were there but one or two of the others as well.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said in my remarks, I felt when I was speaking to some of them that they did not know whether to laugh or to cry and it is a reminder to all of us of the tests we have set ourselves and the tests which it is imperative that we meet over the coming months and years and in that context the High Representative’s remarks today were extremely encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">We have come a remarkably long way in a remarkably short time, but there is still a very considerable distance to travel and over the next few months and years we are going to find ourselves, for example, facing up to difficult questions about resources. Many people will argue that of course all that is required in Europe is for us to make better use of our existing resources but I suspect there will be a growing debate in our own countries in the Member States about whether that really is enough, about whether that is going to secure the sort of security policy which we wish to be more responsible for in our own Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to say a word about the non-military aspects of our security policy, of conflict prevention and crisis management. Rightly, the concentration today has been on the military side but we have not forgotten about the non-military side either and Mozambique reminds us of the importance of remembering that. We will be bringing forward to the Council before Lisbon our proposals on a rapid reaction facility so that we can provide assistance where it is required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">We are establishing a Commission crisis centre as the operational interface with the situation centre in the high representative’s policy unit. Additionally, and this is for me the most important area of all, an area where we are breaking new ground, we will, soon after we have put forward our proposals on a rapid reaction facility, be bringing forward proposals as well on non-military headline goals.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, I repeat, breaking new ground but it is very important that we do it for a number of reasons and policing in Kosovo, policing elsewhere, is the most dramatic and obvious example. It is not just the sort of policing that we identify with community policemen on the street corner. I grew up as a kid hoping I would be allowed to stay up on Saturday evenings in order to see a television programme about a community policeman called Dixon of Dock Green. I have just been writing a report before I came to this job, and writing a very good report, just to respond to my honourable friend, on policing in part of my own country.</p>
<p class="contents">I remember talking about community policing to some American police experts and saying ‘What in your view is the ideal community police officer’ and the reply was ‘a black grandmother’. But that sort of approach to policing alas is not what is required in Kosovo. We have armed forces, we have all got experience of training community police officers. What is actually needed in those circumstances is something between the armed forces and community policing. We need somebody who has the ability to detect crime but who also has an enhanced ability to deal with really difficult public order situations as well. That is the sort of thing that we have to develop in the European Union and we have to face up to the fact that there are resource consequences. So again, rhetoric and reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Now Mr Titley referred to conflict prevention in the broadest sense and asked what intellectual contribution we were going to make to this debate. One thing I would advise him to do is to listen to Radio 4 at the end of March to the first Reith lecture where he will hear the Commissioner for External Relations giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on this whole subject.</p>
<p class="contents">But perhaps I could just say one or two things this afternoon. I think there is an umbilical cord between neglecting human rights, between neglecting habeas corpus, between neglecting all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and between environmental degradation. All those things come together. We talk about the complexities of our eco-system but there is an eco-system of values and political institutions which is just as important and absolutely crucial if we are going to make life better for people in countries like Mozambique and make life better for people rather closer to home in the Balkans as well.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in the coming months, we will be producing communications from the Commission, for example, which have a direct bearing on the whole question of preventing conflict or managing crises. We will be producing a communication shortly on an issue which this Parliament feels passionately about, that is, how we can ensure that election observation is conducted as comprehensively and sensibly as possible without diminishing the integrity of the institutions which do it.</p>
<p class="contents">We will be producing a communication on anti-personnel landmines, actually the use of sensor equipment. The work that has been done in dealing with landmines has been a success story in Mozambique. They have managed to clear tracks from the villages to the wells, they have managed to clear tracks from villages to the primary schools. What does one suppose has been the consequence of all that flooding over the last few days, moving those anti-personnel mines around? We are again going to have to go through the same sort of exercise.</p>
<p class="contents">What we have to be looking at is the way an issue like that connects with our policies elsewhere. We have to be looking at what we do with the stocks of anti-personnel landmines in Ukraine, in Moldova, the ecological consequences of dealing with those stocks, the financial consequences of dealing with those stocks, the political consequences of dealing with those stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">So the point I want to make is that all these things are intimately related. We have all the instruments, we have all the instruments that we require but we have to pull them together much more effectively than we have in the past and that is the challenge which the High Representative and I face in the next four or five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, I hope that in facing those challenges we will have support which consists of adequate resources as well as spectacular rhetoric. We all know that there are a number of reasons for the development of a common foreign and security policy and I will tell you three of them – Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy and we will be tested on how successful a common foreign and security policy we develop above all by how we handle things in the Balkans and do not lose sight of the fact that there are quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians, quite a few senators and congressmen who say ‘How can we possibly take you seriously in developing a common foreign and security policy when you cannot even handle problems on your own back doorstep?’. So the big test for us is going to be in the Balkans. I hope that all those heads of government, all those prominent politicians in our Member States who promised the earth in the Balkans, who promised Marshall plans and who make all the other promises in the Balkans will be around when the budgetary authority decides how much we have got to spend in the Balkans.</p>
<p class="contents">I would very much hope that we can all live on a planet which is also inhabited by the European Council, the General Affairs Council and Ecofin. All on the same political planet together and making sure that there is some harmony between what we promised the world and what we can actually deliver.</p>
<p class="contents">In the last few months in this job I have heard promises that we will do more in Latin America, I have heard promises that if there is a Middle East peace settlement, we will be there to pay for it. I have heard promises that we will establish a stability pact in the southern Caucuses. I have heard promises that we will secure democracy in Indonesia by giving more assistance to Indonesia</p>
<p class="contents">Where is the beef? And that is not a contribution to any recent political controversy. That is the question that we have to address again and again in the coming weeks and months in my view. One reason why I am so passionately keen on carrying through an effective reform of our external assistance programmes is that I do not want to continue to be put in the situation where whenever one puts a question like that about the gulf between rhetoric and reality, the response is ‘Oh but we know you are not running things efficiently, we know that you have not spent all your commitments, we know there is some money in your back pocket’. I want us to be in a position in which we can say: ‘It is not like that any more. We are running things as efficiently and competently as we can’. So, Member States, we think that it is time that common foreign and security policy had a bridge between Council conclusions, between yards of communiqués and what we can actually deliver on the ground and I think that if we can achieve that the job of the High Representative will have been made a lot easier and the conditions of life for an awful lot of people around the world will have been made a lot better.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
