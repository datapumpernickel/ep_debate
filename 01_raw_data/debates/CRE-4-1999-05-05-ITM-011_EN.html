<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">De Giovanni </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">deputising for the rapporteur. – (IT)</span> Mr President, as you mentioned, I am deputising for Mrs Aglietta who cannot be with us tonight, and the first thing I want to do in starting my report on comitology is thank Adelaide Aglietta and acknowledge the serious and important nature of her work. She has produced a very competent, subtle, acute and effective report, ably assisted by the entire secretariat of the Committee on Institutional Affairs, in particular Patrizia Prode, and with constant back‐up from Monica Frassoni. I wanted to mention that for one very simple reason: as we all know, comitology is hell. It seems like a technical problem but in reality it is a profoundly political problem, because then there is the problem of responsibility for monitoring implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">This has always been a very serious problem and the European Parliament has tended to be diffident about it, partly because it has not always been clear who is responsible or how the European Parliament could carry out any monitoring or get any information. It has to be said that the absence of a monitoring and information system has become increasingly less acceptable as codecision has progressed. In my opinion we must always bear in mind the close relationship between codecision and comitology and now, after Amsterdam, with the power of codecision extended, it is all the more necessary for implementation to be monitored closely and effectively. That is why the European Parliament has sometimes had to take a firm stand, even to the point of blocking the decision‐making process for financing committees from the Community budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I must point out, especially as I went along with Jean‐Louis Bourlanges, that it all had to do with the <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> , and the <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> is also an interesting point sometimes. It has helped us make progress, but actually it has rarely been applied, and then badly. What it has clearly demonstrated is that there is no way of resolving the comitology problem merely through more information, exchanges of letters, and documents from the Commission. They are important, but they are not enough! We are at a different stage now. We have before us a Commission decision and this report – hence its importance – sets out the opinion of the European Parliament after many months of negotiation with the Commission and with the Council. At the end of these negotiations we can feel partially satisfied, but I would say very partially, because there is still a great deal to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">So I want to clarify the European Parliament"s real priorities, because I realise – and I want to stress this – that those priorities will have to be made increasingly clear, otherwise there will still be the risk of an interinstitutional conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has four priorities. The first relates to information, and on this point the European Parliament has obtained a great deal, in fact almost everything it asked for. Of course, we will need to make sure this agreement in principle is satisfactorily transferred into the final text of the decision. We need to prevent any legislative act being adopted by the Commission and the committees assisting it outside the regular codecision procedure, and to guarantee the European Parliament the right to intervene within a limited time‐frame to challenge the legitimacy and content of an implementing measure, a point on which the negotiations produced partial satisfaction. And we need genuine simplification which goes further than merely abolishing the committee variants arising from the 1987 decision. Of course, I am referring, as everyone knows, to the great question of the regulatory committee, a question which remains open even after these initial negotiations. We are naturally hoping for greater satisfaction on this point in the future, because the European Parliament"s attitude to the issue of monitoring is sure to become increasingly radical and clear‐cut.</p>

Our aim was to make sense of what is really a labyrinth of delegated powers and create something that in fact concerns all of us, namely transparency, clear separation of legislative and executive powers, and democratic control.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not at all my intention to dispute the fact that committees which stand by the side of the Commission are helpful in principle. However, I must make a serious point of criticism here. Community trade policy is one of the European Union"s most important projects, but in this area Parliament is given hardly any opportunity for involvement in decision‐making.</p>
<p class="contents">During the present parliamentary term, we were not included once in codecision. The main committee active in this area, the 113 Committee, is completely outside our control. This is in fact not compatible with a genuine democratic institutional structure. There is therefore an urgent need for reform.</p>
<p class="contents">Our aim was also to prevent the powers from being slowly renationalised. Surely there can be no question of civil servants from the Member States evading decisions that have been taken a long time ago – for instance, PHARE, TACIS or MED – by having to give their approval once again for major funding projects within a regulatory committee, or by being able to set them aside. This gives them quasi‐legislative functions, and the regulatory committee as an institution should therefore be done away with altogether.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the subject of information, we do not think much of the vagueness of the wording which states that the EP shall be kept informed on a regular basis. We need to have precise and full information, agendas, the composition of committees and calendars. In terms of keeping the general public informed, this should not be a problem in this day and age with e‐mail. I hope that the proposals of the Committee on Legal Affairs and Citizens" Rights find sympathetic listeners within the Commission as well.</p>

They do not immerse themselves in too much detail. But what is peculiar about the European Union's system is that during all those years when the Council alone acted as the legislative authority, it was willing to delegate implementing measures to the Commission only on condition that a committee of national civil servants would work with the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We had three objections to such a system. Firstly, there were so many committees set up with so many different procedures with nobody quite sure who sat on which that there was a major problem of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, these committees set up by the Council or the Member States had the right to block an implementing measure from the Commission and refer them back, but Parliament had no such right. This was only possible for Council committees, not Parliament's.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, if a measure was blocked and referred back to the legislative authority, it was referred to Council alone, not Parliament and Council jointly, even though they jointly constitute the legislative authority. That we have found unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">With codecision, though, it is now Parliament and Council jointly and equally which will decide on what measures to confer upon the Commission and what procedures will be adopted. We will use that power, Mr President – and I warn the Council that we are determined to use that power – to ensure firstly that there is openness and transparency (and I welcome the progress that has been made in that respect in the Council working group), but secondly to ensure that there is equality between Parliament and Council. In other words, if Council committees have the right to block the Commission and refer a measure back then Parliament should also have that right. And if a measure is referred back to the legislative authority it should be referred to both branches of the legislative authority, not just to one branch.</p>
<p class="contents">There are some who claim that Parliament wishes to immerse itself in the detail of implementing measures. That is far from being the case: this is in the nature of a safeguard, the right to blow the whistle occasionally where you think that things may be going wrong. That is a right that exists in many national parliaments, ‐ not in all of them, national systems differ on this, but it is one that should apply at the European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">If you look at the way we have used this power in the informal procedures that already exist, it is actually very unusual for parliaments to intervene and to blow the whistle. We have done it occasionally – infant formulae milk is a notable example. We blew the whistle, the Commission entered into a dialogue with us, changed its proposal and that was ultimately what was adopted. It worked. But it is very unusual. We do not want to do it very often, but we want the right to intervene when necessary. If we have that right then we will be much more willing to delegate more measures, knowing that we have that safeguard in place. But if we do not have that right, then we will be very reticent to adopt far‐going implementing provisions. We will want to hold it back in the legislative procedures. We will not want to delegate. I warn the Council that although it has made progress on transparency, if the working group continues to be so restrictive on Parliament's rights to intervene, then there will be no agreement and we will continue in legislative procedure after legislative procedure to block the comitology measures and resist the adoption of such restrictive measures and we will be very restrictive on voting the budgets and the credits to allow comitology‐type committees to continue to meet.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not seeking to take powers to ourselves to intervene in the detail but we are seeking to have the safeguard. That safeguard is very important. It is the principle on which we will insist and unless agreement is reached in this matter I can tell Council that codecision procedure after codecision procedure will have to go all the way to conciliation and time after time there will be difficulty on this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I invite Council to take the last few steps to reach an agreement with us on this.</p>

Indeed, it goes even further: it serves as a screen against public opinion, because the complexity of this comitology mechanism has succeeded in making the opaque fog around decision‐making even thicker in the eyes of the public. It is therefore a public service to clarify this obscure process and make it slightly more transparent.</p>
<p class="contents">When the European Parliament was granted the power of codecision, it might have been assumed that the two arms of the legislature were going to be treated equally. But this was far from the case. Was it treachery, bad faith, incompetence, negligence or ignorance? I have no idea and I am not going to guess. Article 145 of the Treaty on the delegation of implementing powers has still not been amended whereas lawyers generally consider that it should have been. Because it has not been amended, these powers remain with the Council alone, while it ought to be shared equally by the two arms of the legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">When the case came before the Court of Justice, it departed from its traditional integrationist case‐law – which lasted until the number of members increased beyond nine – and kept to a strictly formal interpretation of the texts, against all logic and against the fundamental principles of consistent legal interpretation. In fact, it is not normal for the body – a binary one, in this case – that decides on the law to be different from the one taking decisions on the delegation of its implementation. There is an error of logic in that situation which has only been possible because the lawyers were negligent when they drafted or amended the Treaties.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter could have been corrected in the Maastricht Treaty. It was not, and that is because, yet again, neither Parliament nor the Commission made much effort to clarify the situation. The Commission was extremely timid, not to say cowardly, about it. So now we are trying to repair this mistake through an institutional agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">We might have expected the Commission and the Council to acknowledge, finally, in this agreement that Parliament"s claims were well‐founded. But this was far from the case. Concessions have been made, and there has been a little progress. It is a little less complex, a little more transparent, but that is about all. Of course, we are going to take what is on offer. We accept any progress, but at the same time we must express our dissatisfaction, and also our hope that next time the Treaty is amended, this error will not be repeated.</p>

The committees have a vital role to play, for example, in the preparation of TACs and quotas, and in the implementation of the Multiannual Guidance Programme for the Community Fishing Fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">The relations between the Committee on Fisheries and the comitology committees just mentioned have two main aspects: firstly, the reception by the Committee on Fisheries of information on the activities of the committees and, secondly, the possibility for members of the Committee on Fisheries to participate in meetings of the relevant committees as observers. However, the information sent is insufficient and often arrives late. The current procedure for sending observers is also very unsatisfactory and is in fact even inappropriate. Unfortunately, any amendments proposed to date have been rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Aglietta describes three objectives, or three good reasons why there should be a new comitology decision; these are simplification, democratisation and transparency. The Committee on Fisheries shares the view that improvements in these areas are urgent and absolutely necessary.</p>

I think it is quite important to mention this, in case Mr Kinnock has been informed otherwise. Apparently, it was translated differently in Italian. So it is the regulatory committee that I should like to be abolished.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span> <span class="italic"> Commission. ‐</span> I am grateful for Mr Kreissl‐Dörfler's contribution. It was not so long ago that there were people in this House who wanted to abolish the Commission, so I am much relieved by his news.</p>
<p class="contents">I begin by offering my warmest thanks to Mrs Aglietta, the rapporteur, who has done an excellent job in clarifying the so‐called comitology issue which, in terms of the procedures of the European Union really is rocket science. I admire, on a personal basis, the honourable Member's tenacity in pursuing this dossier over difficult months. I regret that other obligations prevent her from being with us in order to discuss her report tonight. We did, however, have a distinguished replacement, Mr De Giovanni, who showed his customary fluency and, above all, his very considerable technical insight when he described comitology as pure hell.</p>
<p class="contents">Five years ago I thought comitology might be an inflammation of the bowel or a trapping of the sciatic nerve. Now I know much better and I share that in common with this House. It really has been an advance in my general knowledge.</p>
<p class="contents">The system, obviously, as has been said in the debate, facilitates an important link between the Commission and the representatives of the national authorities who sit on the committees and assist the Commission in its executive role. But as we have also heard, the number and complexity of both the functions and the types of committees raise concern about the transparency of the whole system. I am sometimes amused by popular descriptions of Parliament, and indeed of the Commission, as being institutions which clog the progress of the European Union. If only the general reporting press knew about comitology and the accumulating habits of Member States, it might bring them a revelation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, with the introduction into force of the Maastricht Treaty and the codecision procedure, this Parliament naturally and, in my view rightly, insisted that all implementing decisions should be subject to some form of control by the legislature. The resulting <span class="italic">modus vivendi</span> that was adopted in December 1994 went some way towards achieving that objective. But as we heard from Mr De Giovanni, it was clear even then that the issue had not been definitively resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">In June 1998, therefore, in accordance with the Declaration annexed to the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission presented a proposal to revise the 1987 comitology decision and we did so with the aim of making the procedure less complex, less opaque and more open to Parliamentary control.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members will, I know, be familiar with the major elements so I will not detain the House with a description. Suffice it to say that as a result of the discussions under the Austrian presidency and the German presidency which has made strong and commendable efforts to get an agreement in the Council before the end of June, and with significant parliamentary input in last September's resolution and now in the Aglietta report, we have reached a stage of negotiations which is likely, hopefully, to be conclusive. Naturally Parliament's requests have been at the centre of the discussion. I would like to make just a few responses to the more salient issues raised.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the right of scrutiny is concerned, Article 7(a) as proposed in Mrs Aglietta's amendment goes in the direction that the Commission wanted. It takes on full legal value and it makes a political dialogue with the Commission possible on the occasions when Parliament believes that a proposed measure would provide excessive implementing powers at the expense of the legislature, a point forcibly made by Mr Corbett. An interinstitutional agreement could subsequently be concluded to clarify how this provision would actually operate in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the informing of Parliament, the Commission is confident that the requests made in the report we are discussing for extensive transmission will be agreed in Council. In order to achieve that the Commission is willing to establish the most modern means of communication so that Parliament will be able to exercise its scrutiny continually and through up‐to‐date facilities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree with the idea of having greater clarity about the scope of executive measures set out in the basic legislation itself. In that context it is clear that for us, as in the jurisprudence of the Court of Justice, any adapting or updating of legal acts cannot entail modifications of essential elements of the original legal act.</p>
<p class="contents">Last, but not least, on the regulatory procedure, it is unfortunate, in our view, that the discussions within the Council have ruled out the Commission's proposal of a return to the legislature and often to the co‐legislators when the committee does not give a favourable opinion. However the current formulas devised by the negotiators would be acceptable to the Commission provided that there is no double safety net or <span class="italic">contrefilet</span> which would give the Council the means of rejecting a proposed executive measure. The reason for such a stipulation is very obvious. If there was some form of double safety net it would quickly become impenetrable and the Community would be prevented from taking any decision at all. In the interests of the Union, the Member States and indeed the institutions therefore, we think it essential to support the relevant amendments to the legislative solution submitted by Mrs Aglietta.</p>
<p class="contents">We have now reached a significant point in the process of simplifying the system of comitology and making it more democratic. After thorough examination and many informal contacts at all levels Parliament should now be in a position to give its opinion on the proposal so that the Council can pursue its work with a crystal clear view of the wishes of this House. Naturally the Commission will continue to contribute actively to this work in the hope that by the end of the German Presidency we can reach an agreement that will satisfy all three institutions and consequently benefit the interests of the citizens of the Union whom we exist to serve and millions of whom are doubtlessly still awake tonight, awaiting the outcome of this debate.</p>
