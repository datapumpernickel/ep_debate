<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Dupuis.</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great honour and also a little impertinent to speak before the Chairperson of my delegation, Mrs Schleicher, whom I would have preferred to follow. However I thank Mrs Schleicher, Mr Posselt and my other colleagues who have contributed to raising, and now, debating a subject that is forgotten, that of the Southern Caucasus.</p>
<p class="contents">I dare to hope that following the tragedy in New York and Washington, some of us have been made more aware of the importance of this area of the world, of the importance of a region that is in fact the doorway to central Asia, now a hostage of the Russian Federation, as is, to a large extent, not only the Southern Caucasus but also the Northern Caucasus, which is in an even more tragic situation, whether Commissioner Nielson likes it or not. The Northern Caucasus, as we all know, is experiencing the tragedy of Chechnya, a tragedy that is continuing and that sees opposition from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before you contains a number of very specific proposals. Most importantly, the Commission and the Council have been asked to draw up an overall strategy for this region of the world, a strategy that could reverse the current constant tendency towards the deterioration of the situation. The reason that living conditions in Armenia, Georgia and Azerbaijan are so difficult, particularly Armenia and Georgia, is the constant, daily work of the Russian Federation, which the European Union is not acting against in any specific way.</p>
<p class="contents">This is so true that even an apparently harmless issue such as the opening of delegations in Bakou and Armenia has not yet been resolved by the Commission. The problem has been raised on numerous occasions by this House, by Mrs Schleicher as Chairperson of the delegation with those countries. During our meetings in Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia, we have been asked to speak many times. We have done so and we still have not had an answer. This is a case that has been open not only for a few months, but for a few years.</p>
<p class="contents">Either the European Union must understand that this region is strategically important, particularly for its energy supply, and start to discuss and propose a policy, or in a few months’ or a few years’ time we will witness the birth of the new Balkans, a little further away from us and therefore perhaps a little less uncomfortable than the Balkans of the 1990s. I think, nevertheless, that it is up to the European Union to give a response.</p>
<p class="contents">These countries are part of Europe, they are already members of the Council of Europe, they feel European and in their heart of hearts – they do not dare to ask openly because the Commission and the Council have made it understood that it would not be very appropriate – their ruling classes want to belong to the European Union. We need to respond with action, with investment, we need to re-establish confidence, we need to take our entrepreneurs, investors and companies there. It is quite a small market but, and I repeat this especially for the benefit of the Commission, it is the gateway to central Asia, a strategic region which, as we have seen over the last few weeks, is particularly unstable. I therefore think that the European Union urgently needs to strongly intervene in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of the events in the Middle East and America, it is easy to forget that the situation in the Caucasus is just as explosive. The problems faced by Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan – including the relations between these three states – still give cause for concern. Political instability repeatedly threatens the still incomplete independence process. As a result, violent conflict within these countries is often the focus of public attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet the history of Europe – especially the history of the European Union – shows that despite the differences and conflicts of interest between states, it is possible to form alliances and thus transcend borders. Where war once dominated the scenario, we now have peaceful and democratic co-existence. It is based on the establishment of democratic structures and an emphasis on commonalities, which helped the Western European states to overcome their differences.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the global coalition against terrorism in all its forms which has emerged since the dreadful attacks on the USA on 11 September 2001, there is thus a need to support the states of the Southern Caucasus in their efforts to combat terror and violence which, sadly, are still a feature of daily life in these countries and threaten many people's lives every day. The region's democratic structures are still quite new and fragile. The situation is further exacerbated by the fact that disunity is incited from outside, and the neighbouring states in this region could try to impede or halt the democratisation process for their own interests.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, one of the European Union's key tasks must be to give more support to the democratisation process in Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Democracy is the only basis for lasting internal stability which in future will also transcend borders. However, the European Union and the present Belgian Presidency should focus solely on providing assistance and support; under no circumstances should they intervene in these countries' internal affairs. In specific terms, this means promoting these states' cooperation and cohesion, also as regards the possibility of a free trade area which must be set up without external influence. The initial elements of trilateral cooperation are already in place; however, they must be expanded and supported in order to counter existing external influences successfully.</p>
<p class="contents">If these countries' shared rich cultural heritage is integrated into this process, I am confident that in the medium and long term, important results and successes can be achieved. As Chairman of the European Parliament's Southern Caucasus delegation, I regard the EU Ministerial Troika's visit under the Swedish Presidency last February as the basis for necessary initiatives. The joint motion for a resolution tabled by seven parliamentary groups signals the broad agreement between Members of the European Parliament on this issue. I hope that the Commission, too, will make our concern its own. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This historical moment is pushing us towards regional cooperation even in destabilised areas and towards perhaps unforeseen alliances in the interests of greater stability.</p>
<p class="contents">If I wished to make a point about the resolution, it would be this: the three countries – Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia – perhaps should not always be treated like Siamese triplets: their recent histories differ, their problems differ and their efforts to build a genuinely democratic system differ. It would be unfair if any of the three had to wait until the others caught up in the democratisation process. In this context it would, of course, also be necessary to analyse what the West and the major countries have done in such regions and to analyse, for instance, whether the ethnic revolts in Georgia are local or led from outside, and if so by whom. I would then like to know why we hear so little about the Minsk Group, founded to seek a compromise between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Is it still meeting? Even that is not clear. The European Union should develop a political role that is more obviously adventurous and daring in the region, as the document states – this is the main message – beyond the conference of the three Southern Caucasus states and the European Union. Given the situation, however, a discrete presence of Russia and America might be considered somewhat useful for a proper balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe needs to provide enough funds to support its policies, and that is far from being the case for the Caucasian regions. A few months ago in this House, members of the delegation for relations with Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia urged the European Union to become involved and to commit to a firm and determined policy for the region, where geo-strategic interests are at stake that are both significant and varied.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot continue to say one thing and mean another. Our commitments need to be followed by specific actions. Implementing a Commission delegation in each of the countries would send out a strong political signal. It would be irresponsible to make these countries, who are struggling to affirm their identity, complete their transition process and establish a real democracy, believe that they can count on the political support of the European Union when the reality is that nothing is actually taking place and secretly it is only the oil and gas in the Caspian sea that are of interest. That would be unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Swedish presidency took an initial step by visiting the countries concerned, what has actually been achieved? And has the report by Mr Gahrton, not been put back to a later date in the schedule? Moreover, as my fellow Members have said, this is a matter of urgency: does the OSCE not describe the situation as a state of no war? Let us not forget the powder keg of the impassioned claims on Nagorno Karabakh and the desire for independence of some regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and South Ossetia.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, Mr President, yes Commissioner, the European Union has an essential role to play in this region. It should take the initiative of a Europe/Caucasus conference with the various States in order to establish, through a non-violent solution to the conflicts, lasting peace and sustainable development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Hardly anyone has shown any interest in this region; among the heads of government, only the Pope seems to have shown any concern, and what the Pope is among the heads of state, Ursula Schleicher is here in the European Parliament. She has shown exemplary commitment to this often forgotten region.</p>
<p class="contents">My fear is that the events of 11 September will be misused in order to create new spheres of influence, with entire nations and ethnic problems being forgotten or sacrificed to energy supply interests. After President Putin's speech in the Reichstag, many people have forgotten that he was the person who reignited the war in Chechnya, and that as the head of the secret service under Mr Yeltsin, he incited and manipulated the conflicts in Migrelia and Nagorno-Karabakh. This is why these European regions are entitled to our solidarity, and we must ensure that we have a presence there.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore appeal to you, Commissioner, to put President Putin's words to the test. If he is genuinely interested in improving the situation, tell him you are going to Chechnya, that you want to test the water for more openness and a greater presence for the European Union. As regards the three states of the Southern Caucasus, we need Commission delegations at last, not only in Georgia but also in the other two states. This is a region which affects Europe's vital interests, not only in strategic and energy supply terms, but also as regards human rights and our cultural links with this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Since the EU Ministerial Troika's visit to the Southern Caucasus last February the EU has been looking for further ways to support efforts to prevent or resolve conflicts, as well as contributing to rehabilitation. A Political Directors Troika visit followed in September. The EU is also stepping up its dialogue with the relevant interlocutors, including Russia, Turkey and Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that what could be called "frozen conflicts" are a serious impediment to the development of the region. The EU is keen to see further and rapid progress made by the OSCE Minsk Group for Nagorno-Karabakh, the OSCE Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia and the UN Group of Friends of the Secretary-General for Abkhazia. The Commission has participated in the Joint Control Commission for South Ossetia since April 2001 and provides funds for rehabilitation projects.</p>
<p class="contents">External actors such as Russia, Iran and Turkey play a key role in the region. Any effort to stabilise the Caucasus will have to take their interests into account. In particular, the role of Russia is paramount. The EU has raised the issue of developments in the Caucasus in its political dialogue with Russia, supporting all efforts to defuse tensions and resolve conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we have encouraged Turkey to explore any opportunity for normalising its relations with Armenia.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Dupuis mentioned the issue of our delegations. I agree that this is a problem but, unfortunately, not one which the Commission can do anything about. We are a victim of the decisions made in this House on this matter. It was not the Commission that wanted to limit the number of our delegations to 120. Our view is that it is normal for the EU to have delegations everywhere. We are told to open a delegation in one place or another, and at the same time we are asked to stick to that limit. This is an impossible job. Please make up your minds and help the Commission to expand the coverage of delegations. That is my response to the comment made by Mr Dupuis.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the impact of the work of the support group, we had our last meeting in Russia on 2 August. I am sorry to inform you that no progress was made there, and so the outlook is not very encouraging.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to Mr Posselt's comment on the risk to this region of negative fallout from the events of 11 September and thereafter, this is something we will include in the analysis. We will try to release more money for ECHO this year from the emergency reserve. We are including this region because we fear and predict that humanitarian aid requirements will increase as a foreseeable, indirect consequence of the said events. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
