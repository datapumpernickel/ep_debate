<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cercas (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, this House will tomorrow put forward its position, ideas, hopes and also its concerns regarding the future evolution of pensions from a long-term point of view on our continent. The Commission communication on the future development of social protection, pursuant to the mandate granted by the Lisbon European Council, has provided us with the opportunity of doing so.</p>
<p class="contents">I should therefore like to begin by welcoming that communication. It has brought the problem out into the open, provided Parliament with an opportunity to discuss it and presented a broadly-based study of the phenomenon of ageing in Europe. The debate has been taken beyond mere financial considerations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is only right to congratulate Commissioner Diamantopoulou on having involved Members of the European Parliament as representatives of the citizens of Europe, in a debate of this nature, crucial to the future of the Union. I would like to take this opportunity to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">At the outset, I would also like to thank my colleagues on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. This is not just a form of words, I am genuinely grateful to them. Not only have they been kind enough to adopt this report by an overwhelming majority, but they have also many useful contributions in the course of discussions. In addition, they tabled a broad range of amendments. For the most part, I was able to incorporate these into my report, because they embodied useful approaches.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no wish to appear boastful but it does seem to me that in the Committee on Employment we have revived a broad consensus across all groups in this House. Clearly, this has proved possible because instead of each group seeking to impose every last detail of its own plan on this issue, we have sought consensus on its most important aspects. We are all aware that the ultimate responsibility rests with our States. Nonetheless we realise that in the Europe we hope to build, there is scope for establishing criteria, objectives, values and principles which will be common to all Europeans. We are also conscious that it is our right and our duty not to remain silent in the face of this major problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to state, in this initial overview, that I am firmly convinced this is a problem which demands a broad debate and social and political consensus. When it was created, the European social model was founded on broad social and political consensus. It will not be possible to reform this European social model under the auspices of new forms of enlightened despotism as advocated by those who believe that select groups of experts, high-ranking bureaucrats or certain Finance Ministers should rule the world.</p>
<p class="contents">The social and political consequences of modernising the European social model are such that the matter cannot be entrusted to those who only appreciate the financial perspective and neglect the social dimension of the problem. It would be irresponsible of us to ignore the data on economic requirements. However, we would be making an even greater mistake if we focused entirely on the economic consequences, and failed to take the impact on human beings into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is ageing. Unless there is a dramatic upswing in the birth rate, this will have serious repercussions. It will impact on the financial capacity of the system, on the balancing of public accounts and also on individuals. If we fail to resolve the problem or do so in an unsympathetic manner, we run the risk of unleashing a wave of poverty and social fragmentation across our continent. Consequently, the first message I should like to send out, or rather that I feel Parliament should send out, as our committee has already done, is that all the challenges posed by ageing must be taken into account in a balanced way. I could mention in particular the challenge to public finances and also the challenge to the methods adopted by previous generations for the building Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In our committee we noted that the demographic dependence ratio is a very important factor, but not the only one involved. There is another even more significant factor, namely the economic dependence ratio. This means that our main problem will not be the number of pensioners we are confronted with, but the rate of employment. The crux of the issue is that if Europe grows, it will create employment, it will create firms capable of ensuring that that rate of economic dependence does not deteriorate. Europe has a long way to go, because our rates of employment are inadequate. They could become adequate however, if we achieved economic growth and if that growth were directed at creating the jobs needed on our continent. The figures are far below those of our main competitors, the United States and Japan.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, if we attained the objectives set at the Lisbon Summit, the objective could be perceived as far less daunting that the data available indicates. Furthermore, this data, although certainly significant, amounts to long-term predictions and is therefore subject to revision. No Biblical curse is about to befall us. We could yet find a way out of our predicament because there is still time to deal with a number of factors currently causing concern. Constant monitoring of that data will be called for, and increasingly rigorous criteria must be applied, to ensure that it does not become grist to the mill for those who are intent of benefiting from the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I should like to make one final point. If we are to create the jobs Europe needs, the jobs the social protection system needs, we need to include women and older workers. They are the reserves we have to mobilise. We must activate all the Union’s social and economic potential. In the Committee on Employment we believe that is the best way of tackling the problem of ageing on our continent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Ideally there would be no need for the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities to make any particular comments from a gender perspective on the design of pension systems – if only we were living in an ideal world where equal opportunities were guaranteed.</p>
<p class="contents">That is not how things stand, however. The injustices which women suffer throughout their lives continue when they get older. I am pleased to say that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has taken on board the majority of the comments made by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">Someone once said that if it had been men who consistently fell foul of the pension systems, the basic principles would have been fundamentally overhauled long ago. The committee recalls the goals of the Lisbon Process, as does Mr Cercas. Women’s right to their own income and so to financial independence is extremely important. Today the employment rate for women ranges from 38 to 71 percent in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Generally speaking, women must have the opportunity to take on paid employment. Women and men should also be able to choose freely between paid employment and a career break to take care of family members. Joint taxation in many Member States and a lack of childcare and care for the elderly are a couple of reasons why many women are unable to enter or stay in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">One important principle is that care of children and dependants should be compensated for in the pension system. A more equal Europe is a fairer Europe, a Europe which manages both employment and future pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Better equality can only be achieved through a change in fundamental attitudes and in partnership between men and women. A more even division of responsibility for the home and family could lay the foundation for more equality in the workplace and a labour market of equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work. In the end this will also produce a fairer pension system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Smet (PPE-DE). </span></span>  – <span class="italic">(NL) </span>Mr President, for years the European Parliament has been arguing for Community initiatives on pensions and consequently we are pleased with the principles agreed in the Council and the work prepared by the Commission. The task now is to use the texts in front of us in order to promote the convergence of the systems through cooperation and coordination between Member States. There are two ways of approaching this. On the one hand, there are a series of common challenges, the ageing of the population and the dearth of younger people or the relation between younger and older people, the changing degree of dependence or the ratio of active to inactive people, etc., limited budgetary resources, technical potential in health care, and so on. On the other hand, there are number of cross-border complications: the mobility of individuals or the option of working in another Member State and drawing a pension, the mobility of capital or the option of saving in another Member State and drawing a pension, the supplementary pension funds, which unlike the compulsory pension schemes appeal to people in various Member States and even in other countries. For all those reasons, the systems must be made sustainable so that they can withstand common challenges and cross-border complications.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs indicates current thinking in the European Parliament and also in the European People’s Party on the convergence of pension systems. It is not for the European Union to prescribe to Member States how pensions should be organised and financed. The Member States themselves choose the appropriate ratio of compulsory scheme to supplementary schemes, between an apportionment method and capitalisation, between contributions and payments or between social security or index-linked prosperity. But, on the one hand, solutions must be found for difficulties that hamper the free movement of pensions and pensioners and on the other efforts must be made to monitor the effectiveness and efficiency of systems with budgetary resources in the service of social aims and not the other way round.</p>
<p class="contents">For the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and for the PPE-DE Group too the combination of cooperation between Member States and coordination between the systems seems the appropriate way of safeguarding pensions and reassuring pensioners and consequently this point must be clarified at the European Council in Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that years ago the Luxembourg Summit on employment, where the open coordination method was effectively introduced, showed us an excellent way but of course a link must be made between pensions and employment. For as long as Europe and the various Member States do not succeed in solving the difficulties surrounding the employment of the over-55s and for as long as the case is not pressed more urgently, more opportunities are not created and more things are not made virtually compulsory, the pensions problem will not be solved. It is essential to link the two. This should be one of the guidelines in the framework of the coordination and indicators which is about to be drawn up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that our recommendation, on which we shall vote tomorrow, can prove an inspiration to the Gothenburg Summit and particularly will move the Council to involve the European Parliament in a more structural way in future in the discussion on the open coordination method on pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">For that matter I am also grateful to the Swedish Presidency for the work that already been carried out in this field. I hope with all my heart that Gothenburg will be able to give a clear mandate to the Belgian Presidency to formulate common social goals in the context of European cooperation on pensions. As Mr Smet said just now it is, of course, the Member States who decide what pension system they want, how they organise it, and how they underwrite its financial robustness. However, the fundamental aim, namely to maintain and improve the quality of pension systems in Europe, is surely an aim that we must all share.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, of course, clear that because of the dynamics of economic and monetary union, the pension dossier is already on the European agenda, although very one-sidedly, as part of the debate on the financeability of pension schemes. We believe that in the discussion we must never lose sight of the essential component, namely modernisation of pension systems so that we can guarantee today’s and future generations of pensioners a reasonable pension and a participation in social life. That debate is also about solidarity and also the equality of men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">For us a number of principles are essential in this. I should like to mention four. Firstly, pension systems must be able combat poverty in an efficient way. It is unacceptable that in the European Union there should still be pensions, especially those of women, that fall below the poverty line. I should therefore like to be so bold as to ask the Commission, on the basis of the recommendation of 1992 to retable this pensions dossier on minimum payments.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, reasonable pensions are of course more than the minimum necessary for survival. It is a matter of guaranteeing a certain standard of living. It is therefore important to retain the link between the general rise in prosperity and pensions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the second pillar of pensions must never replace the first because it is the first that gives the fundamental guarantee that everyone has access to an adequate pension. For my group it has long since ceased to be a question whether one is for or against the second pension pillar. Rather, it is a question of how we are to ensure that, even in that second pension pillar, solidarity is organised so that supplementary pensions do not remain the privilege of a small group.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, Mr President, I could also continue the discussion on the necessary raising of the pensionable age, but I shall not do so. One thing should be clear: for my group, this does not mean a general compulsory rise in pensionable age, does mean measures to encourage people to continue working longer and to prevent companies from jettisoning older staff.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, that Gothenburg will be able to translate these principles into common objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My group thinks it important that the Member States should organise the pensions systems in such a way that more account is taken of the fact that there will be more elderly people in the future. Money must be found for pensions, without exhausting Treasury funds and without there being astronomical tax rises.</p>
<p class="contents">Economists talk a lot, of course, about the burden of the elderly, and that makes many old people feel they are being held in contempt. ‘Why must we be portrayed as a burden,’ they say, ‘when we have made our contribution to the development of society?’ Others see the whole debate about future pension systems as concealing a real desire to undermine security and solidarity, but the intention is, of course, the very opposite, namely to ensure that there are good pensions in the future, too, and to remedy deficiencies and absurdities in the present systems. I therefore think it good that the agenda should have been enlarged and that it should not only deal with healthy public finances, the internal market for supplementary pensions and increased growth and employment, but also with security in old age, the need to combat problems of poverty among the elderly and the removal of that discrimination against women which is often built into pensions systems.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe and hope that the broader agenda will promote grassroots support for the reforms of the pensions system. Pensions based on savings must be an important part of pensions systems in the future. It is only right and proper that we should each of us take responsibility for our own old age. This cannot, of course, come as some sort of surprise. A side benefit is that pensions savings through active investments can help secure the prosperity that is the basis for pensions of the future. Finally, I want to emphasise that systems and problems differ greatly from one country to another and that pensions are – and must be – a matter over which individual nations have jurisdiction. For that reason, we do not want an unduly restrictive framework to be imposed upon the coordination of countries’ reforms, and this will be reflected in the way in which the Liberal Group votes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do not think, however, that the Group of the Greens is suggesting that we entrust the future of pensions to the Ministers of Finance.</p>
<p class="contents">We support those in the Commission, in some Member States and in Parliament, who see the future of pensions and of social protection primarily as social issues, as key elements of the model, which must be strengthened, and which cannot be reduced to its financial dimension. To hear some people talk, we might wonder if the prospect of living increasingly longer, and by ‘living longer’ I mean in good health as well, is not the greatest disaster threatening the citizens of the twenty-first century.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mr Cercas Alonso has the merit of not skirting the crux of the issue and of the debate. A certain increase in spending on pensions in the GDP is certainly unavoidable because of greater life expectancy, but the rapporteur quite rightly emphasises that changes in the rate of employment is a decisive factor. In this context, he recommends taking account of the rate of economic dependence and not only of demographic changes. Given the prospect of full employment, this takes us away from alarmist rates, which clearly seek to legitimise new forms of finance, raised individually and through capitalisation. The report also emphasises the invaluable role of guaranteed pension systems in combating the insecurity and social exclusion of the elderly, particularly women and workers who have had long periods of atypical work and who should be guaranteed a sufficient level of income to lead a decent life.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the report warns against any attempt to undermine public pay-as-you-go pension systems. These systems guarantee intergenerational solidarity, which is essential to social cohesion and they enable real-time adjustments to be made to contributions, regardless of the fluctuations of the stock market situation.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why our group recommends that we adopt this report, without undermining its current balance.</p>

<p class="contents">Much has been said about solidarity and security. This is exactly what should be addressed with regard to pensions. There is still great anxiety about the discussion on pensions. My colleagues have expressed unease over certain crucial points. In my home country, Sweden, we have already started to adapt to this type of change, and a considerable part of our future pension system will be linked to a supplementary pension based on what happens on the financial markets. In Sweden, most people have started buying and selling shares and in the past few years many of them have experienced just how risky buying shares can be. Many have lost a great deal of their savings and are now wondering whether the same thing could happen to a pension system which is so heavily dependent on what happens on the financial market.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a worry that the system will be unfair. Most of all, perhaps, there is a worry that it will be unreliable. Our group has tabled an amendment to tomorrow’s vote, in which we ask that the effects of the new system are at least assessed and the impact on solidarity on society studied. What will happen to security? How will it affect women?</p>
<p class="contents">Several speakers, including Mrs Jensen and Mrs Van Lancker, have pointed out that women are a particularly vulnerable group, and in many countries I believe that women could lose out in the system now being introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to mention our Amendment No 13 in which we address a general raising of the retirement age as a way of solving future pension problems. It is tempting to use such a solution to try not only to increase levels and ratios of employment, but also to reduce the pressure on the pension systems. However, this presupposes that people will manage to keep working up to the raised retirement age.</p>
<p class="contents">This may work in certain countries as they currently have a relatively low retirement age, at least for certain categories of pensioner. However, in my country and other Scandinavian countries, where we already have a relatively high retirement age of 65 – 67, there is currently talk of raising the age threshold to 70.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this is unrealistic. Most people are worn out from a long working life long before they reach retirement age. In this situation it is foolish and inhuman to try to force people to remain in the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that I believe it is regrettable that neither the Commission nor the report we are now discussing mentions anything about the candidate countries. It could be said that this is a problem for the future, but when talking about pensions we are talking about the future. It is clear that there should have been a discussion on what a system of the type we now want to introduce will mean for poor candidate countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that a prospective cause for alarm in the field of pensions is the ageing of the population. But it should be noted above all that some Member States have already undertaken reforms of their systems without trauma, with significant contributions from social actors. These reforms have, over the course of time, also had positive effects on the health of public accounts. The problem should therefore, perhaps, be split in two: on the one hand, States that may still have some imbalance in public spending but in the context of a stable economy, and on the other, those that have deficient social security systems and an economy in transition.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first case a gradual approach is essential. Almost all public pension schemes, in fact, are still run completely or partly on a pay-as-you-go basis, and without a gradual changeover to a fully funded system, accompanied by harmonious taxation systems and effective family policies, there would be serious social repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">For the second hypothetical scenario, and in the general case, we agree with the rapporteur in hoping that a convergent basis of parameters for maintaining the dignity of pensioners can be put in place at Community level. This will also prevent a widening of social gaps which supplementary schemes, although useful, cannot fully remedy. In the meantime, in fact, the only path open is to increase the contributor base, while noting that the current rise in the employment rate seems rather insecure.</p>
<p class="contents">I fully agree with the rapporteur that what is avoided in all cases is anticipating even for the sake of intergenerational solidarity – paradoxical here – a reduction in the current levels of public protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has received widespread approbation in the committee and I hope that when it is voted on tomorrow it will receive similarly widespread support throughout the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The matter of pensions is a hugely important issue, and I say that not just because I have a vested interest in this matter, being close to pensionable age myself: it is an issue of increasing importance to the people, for example, sitting up at the top in the gallery there. Today's youngsters will need a pension in the future. We must remember that these generations deserve the same sort of pension security and safety and sustainability as that which we are talking about for ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">I really just wanted to make a couple of points: there are two amendments that we have put in for the vote tomorrow which very nearly got in through the committee and were only just defeated, and I hope that when they are re-submitted tomorrow in the name of the EPP-ED Group, the whole House will be able to support them. They are to do with recognising that pay-as-you-go schemes can no longer be exclusively relied upon to keep people's pension expectations fulfilled and also exhort Member States to sort out their tax and spending policies. It is all very well for us to wish that people should have a safe and secure pension, but for this to happen, pensions have to be sustainable, the funding has to be put in place. Anything less than that and we would be betraying the generations which are looking to us for support and we must not let them down. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur, Mr Cercas, had to cope with pressure to liberalise and privatise the insurance system, alongside other maximalist positions wanting to undermine a whole series of new data. He has managed to find the common ground, giving us a report which, it seems, Parliament will adopt by a large majority. Of course, congratulations also go to the Commissioner, Mrs Diamantopoulou, who has courageously speeded up the insurance initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three messages or conclusions which could come out of this report. Τhe first is that we continue to believe that the state insurance system should take priority or, if you like, we believe in the political option of not undermining it.</p>
<p class="contents">The second results from the fact that, in the end, the progressive line has prevailed. This means that the cost of funding the insurance system is not seen as a negative factor in the economy and it is accepted that social protection forms part of sustainable economic development and that there will inevitably be a relative increase in the ratio of pension costs to gross national product.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings us to a third and particularly useful conclusion, which is that there is no such thing as insurance policy per se or insurance policy as an isolated problem and that, within the framework of a horizontal approach, it is a necessary aspect of other policies, especially tax policy, employment policy and policies to combat discrimination and exclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">If these are basic political choices rather than academic declarations, we need to accept that it will not be easy in the future to adopt proposals which may increase inequality, reduce the income of senior citizens and compromise the quality of services provided by the central insurance system. I would point out that part of the report constitutes an acceptance of the need for immediate support for the care of the ill and elderly at home in the form of fiscal, social and employment measures, the need to safeguard not just any pension, but a pension which can support a dignified life and the need for a package of proposals so that new insurance legislation can properly assess all the special aspects of women's work. In short, without denying the funding aspect of the problem, we have cut it free so that it no longer depends solely on that aspect. The people of Europe need to be convinced that we shall pursue our options consistently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As we have seen, this is an issue which we are all itching to get our hands on: safe and sustainable pensions, a truly hot potato which gets hotter rather than cooler the longer we leave it. That is why both the Member States and the European Union need to act here. We need a satisfactory pension system, which is why the reference to the 1992 recommendation is, I think, particularly important. But we also need a flexible pension system which has one eye on social change and the need to adjust to the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">The idea of an active old age has, basically, been accepted. You only have to think of the employment policy guidelines for 2000, i.e. maintaining employability and lifelong learning. I should also like to mention the contribution by the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities to the report. It refers to the numerous women on widow's pensions with no source of income of their own. We must reverse the trend whereby these widows' pensions are being whittled away. This is one very important matter addressed in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the future is concerned, the concept of open coordination is on the table. We must also ensure that this has real meaning as far as pensions are concerned. We should not simply use it as an open sesame; we have to understand that the employment policy guidelines cannot simply be applied line by line. On the contrary, we need new forms of coordination and these need to be created. For the rest, I really do welcome the fact that the second and third pillars are dealt with as well as the first. I would also mention the idea of capital formation by employees. We must ensure that capital formation and old-age pensions complement rather than contradict each other.</p>

The issues put to the recently-established committee are extremely wide-ranging and require practical responses under the terms quite rightly laid down by the Commission and by the particularly excellent report that we are now assessing. I therefore call on the Council to reformulate its mandate for this committee. It is not enough to calculate the financial contribution needed to meet the requirements of the various systems. This should already have been done under the Stability Pact since, like employment, social protection is conditioned by macroeconomic policy decisions and by the increased dependence of the elderly and the unforeseeable increase in changes in the labour market, with periods of training alternating with periods of activity and inactivity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is absolutely crucial that we consider the cost to our societies of failing to transfer our citizens’ pension systems, in terms of loss of political confidence in Europe, social upheaval, greater insecurity and poverty, a fall in consumption, economic recession and greater inequalities. This is the key political question to which we must respond and which the Council must soon answer. Capitalisation must have clearly-defined borders and must be part of the solution, not part of the problem. It cannot be an obstacle to mobility, because it does not solve demographic problems and does not involve solidarity. It involves benefits and risks and stimulates the financial markets, factors which must be considered. It is not, however, and cannot be part of the problem, and would contribute to greater risks for social protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As far as early retirement is concerned, we must ensure that the retirement age can be brought up to the statutory retirement age in all countries. A variety of measures is needed for this.</p>
<p class="contents">Without doubt, the question of life expectancy has repercussions on the actual retirement age as well as on the statutory retirement age in many countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I trust that we can help to strengthen the second and third pillars as well as the first pillar in Europe. We have countries today in which 80% of people in employment have a company pension. In my country it is just 9%, while the European average is 25%. We are currently debating a directive here in Parliament, and I call on the Council to stop blocking a European regulation on company pensions at long last. I call on the Commission to set up a European pension forum to discuss the different fiscal and employment and social regulations and to help harmonise these issues throughout Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(EL) </span>I should like to start by congratulating Mr Cercas, who worked very closely with the Committee on Economic Affairs and the Committee on Women's Rights, resulting in the impressive consensus in today's debate.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of pensions is a key political, economic and social question which every government has to address. Some reforms are under way, others are being discussed and others were completed a mere year or two ago. So it is a European problem and the sustainability of pensions is the wager for the next generation. There is a set of policies which, if they are successful at European level, will support and strengthen the sustainability of pensions. The aim of these policies is to increase the rate of growth and employment and they include policies to provide efficient support for parents, so that they can combine work and family, and immigration policies.</p>
<p class="contents">However, over and above these general policies, every country needs to reform the system itself, which has been inherited from a previous era of industrial development. This reform is social and economic in nature. I think that it is particularly important, as numerous speakers have stressed, that pensions are no longer the exclusive preserve of Ecofin and budgetary discipline and have been discussed by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs as well as by the ministers. Pensions are, first and foremost, a social issue, but with huge, serious economic implications.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, under the Treaty, insurance system reforms and policy are national responsibilities. But do not forget that we are also required, that it is a specific objective of the Treaty to safeguard a high level of social protection and sustainable, non-inflationary economic growth. It is therefore important, post Lisbon, that the heads of state have agreed for the first time that they need to work together on pension issues. It is a very important change of direction towards European policies, which illustrates the extent of the problem. With cooperation between the Member States, the reforms will no doubt be more efficient in all the countries.</p>
<p class="contents">An initial Commission communication was ordered following Lisbon and has been issued. The subject of pensions has been discussed at all the Councils – in Feira, Nice and Stockholm – and the study to be presented in Göteborg is being prepared by the newly formed Committee on Social Protection. This study will analyse all the problems Member State by Member State and will table proposals on basic principles for sustainable systems. I would just point out that one basic guideline given to this committee concerns the gender dimension. Numerous members mentioned that it is impossible to take a neutral approach to the question of pensions because women face more serious problems and poverty in Europe is closely bound up with the pension system and the economic and social position of women.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important is that it was decided post Stockholm to examine the method of open coordination on the question of pensions, taking account, of course, of the question of subsidiarity and the specific problems of each Member States. We are preparing a Commission communication, which will be presented before the summer, in which we try to approach the question of the open coordination on pensions in a more analytical manner.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that this resolution by the European Parliament, assuming that it is approved tomorrow as it stands today, will provide strong support for this coordinated effort to reform pensions in the European Union. I think that this new chapter which is being opened at European level, the chapter of collaboration on pensions, will allow for new forms of cooperation between the Commission, the Council and Parliament. And may I remind you that the Commission specifically supported the need for the European Parliament to collaborate with the High Level Committee on the subject of social protection and that this collaboration is now under way.</p>
<p class="contents">Honourable Members, I think that the fact that we have opened up this chapter and given a European dimension to the question of pensions will give the governments in all the Member States the support and backing they need in order to bring about sustainable reform, taking account of the economic and, more importantly, the social dimension. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
