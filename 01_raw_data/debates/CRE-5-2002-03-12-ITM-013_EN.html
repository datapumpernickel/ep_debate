<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Paulsen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you all for excellent teamwork for the almost a year and a half during which I have been dealing with these two reports. It has gone incredibly well. In the common position, the Council and the Commission have accepted the majority of the just under a hundred amendments we submitted on the first reading. I am very pleased to see that the Council and the Commission are now in agreement with the European Parliament on the fundamental principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The first and most important principle is that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used in feed, cosmetics and medicinal products. I say this with a slight reference to the preceding debate. We will thus obtain a ban on intra-species recycling, that is, animal cannibalism. The new regulation will in fact be sufficiently flexible to be adapted to technological developments and new scientific findings. The common position has in fact been welcomed by the industry concerned in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Please consider that the final vote tomorrow puts 200 000 jobs across Europe at risk. Do not forget that this industry is not located in densely populated areas. Instead, we are looking at companies in rural areas. Every day that passes without clear ground rules, more and more small and medium-sized companies are in danger of being forced to shut down. To be blunt, I could say that Europe’s producers, and consumers too, are standing and stamping their feet while we here, at the very last stages, are engaging in trivial disputes.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me first talk about Amendment No 25, which is a compromise. As is always the case with compromises, this means that no one has got exactly what they want. We have all had to give in quite a bit, and I am a little uncertain as to what the end result of this compromise will be. However, the amendment does give the Member States which currently permit the use of catering waste under extremely carefully controlled conditions a transitional period of four years.</p>
<p class="contents">Towards the end of the debate on the matter, a number of details concerning sludge and waste water came up. Amendments Nos 2, 4 and 14 should in fact be set aside in favour of Amendment No 21, which is intended to promote the safe handling of these materials so as to avoid serious environmental consequences. This is therefore a practical way of dealing with this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself would really like to see Amendments Nos 3 and 5 put into effect. Unfortunately, this is more or less impossible for technical reasons. These amendments concern the marking of category 1 material. The already adopted Regulation on TSEs contains clear requirements that direct risk material be marked. Amendment No 5 is about the marking of category 2 material. I think this would be desirable, but that the amendment should be rejected because it would have unreasonable consequences. If the amendment were to be adopted, all fertiliser – natural fertiliser – within the EU would have to be marked, and this would affect approximately 1 200 000 000 tonnes a year. This means that we would be able to choose whether the fields were to be blue, green or purple each spring, and it would all look a bit peculiar.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 16 must in actual fact be adopted. Otherwise, the report’s main principle that only raw materials which have been approved for human consumption may be used in animal feed would be undermined. The amendments do not in fact involve any changes to the requirements which currently apply to sampling and/or <span class="italic">post ante mortem</span> inspections of slaughtered animals. It is only the final assessment based on existing rules which is affected by this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 8 concern the handling of catering waste. In this case, I recommend voting in favour of Amendments Nos 22 and 23 whereby catering waste generated from means of transport operating internationally should, with all its risks, be treated in accordance with the most stringent requirements of the regulation, in category 1. On the other hand, catering waste in category 3 should be handled under existing structures and systems for collection, transport and disposal in line with the EU’s waste directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position contains a somewhat strange proposal regarding endangered species of necrophagous birds, namely lammergeiers in Spain. Amendment No 24 states that it is permitted to use category 1 material to feed this specific small group of birds. I have checked this very carefully. These birds have to have this special food. It sounds a little odd, but sometimes nature is, by nature, odd.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 12 on the permanent marking of imported pet food is particularly controversial for the United States. Regarding dyeing the raw materials which are to be included under categories 1 and 2, it is laid down that products in categories 1 and 2 are to be marked once they have turned into fat and processed proteins. Such processed material must then be permanently marked when it comes to imported pet feed, as exactly the same requirements must be set for imported products as for our own products.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 15 concerns the separation of facilities. Right from the start, the European Parliament demanded completely separate sites. I can accept separate buildings if they really are separate – and not just separate parts of one building under the same roof.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also a number of amendments which were rejected by the committee and which, for various reasons, should be rejected once more. We are concerned here with deleting references to biogas and composting. This regulation does not regulate biogas plants and composting systems. On the contrary, Article 6.2 says that national legislation in this area should apply until new EU environmental legislation is passed. The only point of the reference in Article 1.2 is to give the Commission legal justification for requesting scientific statements on biogas and composting.</p>
<p class="contents">If we delete household waste, that is, from private kitchens, from the definition of catering waste, we are doing ourselves a disservice. We know that catering waste is a very serious channel of infection for both swine fever and foot and mouth disease. I personally think it is quite difficult to ban household waste being used as feed. It has been a tradition in our European culture for thousands of years but we are now living in a new world and in another time, in which food, feed and ingredients are moved from place to place in a completely different way from 50 years ago, for example, when feed and food circulated in relatively small and recognisable cycles.</p>
<p class="contents">Once more I would like to thank my colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission and the Council for excellent teamwork over the past year and a half. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Goodwill (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, could I first of all thank Mrs Paulsen for the constructive way in which she has conducted the dialogue between the groups to come up with some compromise amendments? I am pleased that my group has been able to sign all the compromise amendments, with the exception of Compromise Amendment No 25. We very much support the ban on the use of catering waste in animal feed, not least because the likely cause of the foot and mouth disease outbreak in the United Kingdom was the use of pigswill as feed. I am also pleased to see that catering waste from abroad, such as may come from aeroplanes landing in our country, has been upgraded to category 1.</p>
<p class="contents">However, two problems emerge from this situation. The first is the use of used cooking oil in the United Kingdom as animal feed. Unfortunately, we will not be able to hide this oil behind the piles of fridges currently found in my own country and I am afraid that much of this oil will find its way into the drains of the country, causing environmental damage and also, I suggest, public health problems as it congeals and solidifies in the sewers of our major cities.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have a problem in Germany, where there are centralised plants for treating catering waste, unlike the on-farm situation in the UK, which was not very satisfactory. Many of these installations are brand new and run according to the highest standards with typical German efficiency. We should recognise the situation in Germany and Austria and allow an extension on the use of some of these brand new plants. That is why I am pleased to support Amendment No 10, which was proposed in committee by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf and calls for the Commission to come up with a legislative proposal by June 2002 requiring Member States to supply proof that these plants can operate safely.</p>
<p class="contents">Compromise Amendment No 25 contradicts this because it calls for a four-year extension on the use of these plants. If, as I have been advised, the authors of the original amendment were to propose an oral amendment stating that this new legislative proposal could come forward in four years' time, then this would avoid such a contradiction. That would be a good way forward and my group would be prepared to support such a move.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of sludge, could I ask the Commissioner to clarify the situation? We have many slaughterhouses and meat processing plants that discharge effluent into domestic sewage systems in our major towns. Although this process involves some initial filtration, there is no way that one could describe this discharge as sterile: it contains pathogens of all sorts. Determining that the sludge from the sewage treatment plants in these large cities had to be incinerated under this directive would place unacceptable costs on slaughterhouses. The European Union has already been responsible for the closure of many slaughterhouses and, in fact, in many cases, there would be no space for separate sewage treatment facilities. Therefore, could I ask the Commissioner to make it quite clear on the record that the primary filtration products of these plants would be covered, but that the sludge from sewage treatment would not have to be incinerated and could be spread on the land as before? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are speaking about a second reading, which the rapporteur has prepared brilliantly, and I admire the way in which Mrs Paulsen has tried to navigate a course between Scylla and Charybdis, Scylla being the thirteen Member States that have accepted the common position, and Charybdis being the two that have not, namely Austria and Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria and Germany did not approve the common position for clear reasons. Austria has been undertaking schemes involving the composting of biomass and the use of biogases for energy production, schemes which would no longer be possible under the common position. Germany would be prevented from sterilising and reusing catering waste.</p>
<p class="contents">When I listen to this debate today, and when I look back on the past few days, it surprises me that the United Kingdom, France and other countries accepted the common position. I have just heard Mr Goodwill saying that he and his group did not sign Compromise Amendment No 25, which I signed along with all the other compromise amendments. I signed them because they are compromises. The ideal world is different. I have a different conception of the ideal solution too. But among the sources of the compromise amendment are not only Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf’s Amendments Nos 10 and 1 but also Mr Whitehead’s amendment, which provided for a four-year transitional period.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Goodwill referred to fears in his country that foot and mouth disease had been caused by the use of pigswill as feed. To my knowledge, this has not been proved. Swine fever, yes, but as a cause of foot and mouth disease it is new to me. I had certainly heard this being mooted in the past, but that is only one aspect of the issue. Another point – and this is part of the compromise, Mr Goodwill – is that if I go back to my own Member State and say that there is a disposal problem with reheated cooking oil, they will tell me in Germany that this poses a dioxin problem which they refuse to contemplate.</p>
<p class="contents">We must be very careful. This is a very fine line we are treading today, and we must avoid the mistakes of the past, when cost issues and disposal problems were often invoked to the detriment of animal health, and hence of human health too. If I say today that I can support our proposed compromise on catering waste, I must explain part of the background against which I make that statement. Nobody has been able to tell me what happens with catering waste in the other Member States. In Germany, there are modern high-performance facilities which undertake state-of-the-art sterilisation of catering waste then recycle it into animal feed. That is a fact. In other Member States no one can tell me what happens to it. Some say it is burned. Nobody really knows. No one knows the standards, and in private conversation any Member will admit that some of it ends up in landfill sites. That is precisely what we do not want. I should like to have a clear set of rules.</p>
<p class="contents">In five years’ time, if we have legislation banning the recycling of catering waste for any purpose other than the production of biodiesel, so be it; that is what we shall do. But it must then apply to all Member States. At the moment, Germany, Austria and other countries are being penalised for their high standards. If I appeal tomorrow for us to support all the compromise amendments, I shall be doing so because they are compromises. I must then ask you to be fair and support the compromises too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For that reason, I wish to thank the rapporteur: we are grateful to you for your excellent work. In the main this report can be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to draw attention to one point, and that is Amendment No 15. There are Member States where processing is on a very small scale. The requirement, therefore, that different categories of activity should have a separate building is unreasonable as far as these countries are concerned. For example, in my own country we have two plants, both of which already have clearly separate and properly supervised production lines. If we were to find ourselves in a situation where we had to construct separate buildings for one more separate production line that would be unreasonable considering the small volumes being processed. In my opinion the issues mentioned previously in the Council’s formulation have been taken proper account of, and I would hope the Council’s and the Commission’s position will enter into force with regard to this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I also know that Mr Staes is pleased with the cooperation and the way in which we have been able to reach compromises as well as with Mrs Paulsen’s work with the shadow rapporteur. Thank you for that.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a very technical and complicated matter which can be difficult to get to grips with. At the same time, it goes without saying of course that we must guarantee safe food for the citizens of the EU and, that being the case, we must do so throughout the entire chain. Therefore, how we treat animals and what we feed them on is naturally important.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased about the principles which the European Parliament and the Council have agreed on, in other words that only by-products from animals approved for human consumption may be used as animal feed. The most important thing is possibly also the ban on re-use within the same species, that is, the fact that we are rejecting cannibalism.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the Council’s position in seeking to prohibit catering waste in animal feed. It is difficult to guarantee safe and risk-free handling of catering waste. How can we know what mixed household waste actually consists of?</p>
<p class="contents">Now we have tabled a compromise amendment, Amendment 22, where exceptions are made for catering waste in category 3, and we submit Amendment 25 in which some Member States are permitted to feed catering waste for a transitional period of a maximum of four years.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not entirely happy about this amendment but I am still willing to accept it so that we can get the report through.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, there is a kind of moratorium on the use of meat and bone meal in animal feed. This means that the Council could at any time decide to permit the use of meat and bone meal once more.</p>
<p class="contents">The Verts/ALE Group has therefore submitted Amendment No 20. I ask my colleagues to vote in favour of it as it does provide a kind of assurance that the Council must bring the issue up again before any decisions in that direction can be made. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It forces us to face a genuine problem for society and to take into account two realities that are not easy to reconcile. Firstly, the legitimate concern of consumers with regard to the BSE epidemic and the terrifying human form of BSE, namely Kreutzfeld-Jacob’s disease. And secondly, the necessary concern for farmers and all employees of the meat industry, whose work is being jeopardised by the frightening – and mounting – burden of restrictions that are being heaped upon them in the name of the precautionary principle. Despite the fact that, several years ago, the fifth quarter or meat by-products were re-processed and sold, which met slaughterhouses’ overheads. We now send these by-products – and quite rightly, I am sure – to be destroyed at great expense. As a result, meat is constantly becoming more expensive for consumers whilst farmers are no longer paid a fair price for their animals.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position, on which we are due to vote, is creating a number of technical bottlenecks, since it is based on an extreme concept of the precautionary principle. For example, is it a good idea to ban spreading sludge, manure and stercoral matter from slaughterhouses on land and to send 20 million tonnes of this waste to incineration, when we do not yet know how to process the two million tonnes of animal feed that we have? Is it a good idea to involve several thousand local and regional slaughterhouses in building hundreds of sewage treatment plants and incinerators when BSE detection tests are making swift progress?</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore reserve judgment, Mr President, on this extremely pernickety and excessively cautious text which will place such harsh restrictions on slaughterhouses, that many will be at risk of closing down, with all the consequences that these closures will have on the transportation of animals and the spread of epidemics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unquestionable that the prevention of epizootic diseases which lead to food crises is of great importance, not only to the future of European farming but also to the entire population of Europe. The crucial task now is to find a suitable means of meeting the needs of a multifunctional agricultural system as well as those of consumers. In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, I therefore call for the preservation of the tried and tested national systems for the disposal and recycling of organic waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The collection and use of biogenetic waste for the purposes of composting or for use in a biogas plant are highly commendable from an environmental point of view and must therefore remain possible in future. In Austria in particular we have found these processes extremely useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to address the extremely controversial issue of recycled catering waste. The Austrian example shows that application of the highest possible standards of hygiene, coupled with official monitoring, banishes any concerns regarding a possible risk of epizootic disease. This has been confirmed once again in the recent past. I would therefore regard a general ban on the use of pigswill for animal feed as an unduly draconian measure.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, we must not forget the investments that have been made in the municipal collection of organic waste and in the officially licensed decoction facilities, investments made in the belief that the future lies in an exemplary system of environmental protection. In recent years, 250 new decoction facilities have been built in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore lend my support to all compromise amendments that guarantee the continued existence of proven monitored systems for the recycling of organic waste. I consider it very important that we formulate our decisions on this sensitive subject in such a way that the general public can follow our reasoning. The public would certainly not want to see the prohibition of an exemplary practice.</p>

She always manages to steer between national positions and never loses sight of that corpus of food safety legislation which we are slowly bringing together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to look at the very wide definition of catering waste in the annexes and in Amendments 22 to 25. I will leave aside the feeding of carrion birds because I wish to look at a different form of carrion, that is the catering waste represented both by the recycled swill in some countries and by recycled cooking oils in others, including my own. Catering swill arouses deep misgivings in my country because of the role it played in the recent foot and mouth epidemic. Cooking oil is seen to be a problem after the dioxin scandals of recent years. The rapporteur has brought the two together in a complex series of amendments culminating in No 25, which I will support. I acknowledge her efforts.</p>
<p class="contents">The UK's problem, as Mr Goodwill has mentioned, is that we need to have an effective and rewarded system of collecting used catering oils for fuel – not feed – reuse. That will take time. If no other outlet is provided, users will dump it in drains and ponds. They will become sumps of noxious material. One constituent demonstrated to me in the most vivid terms what exactly those consequences will be.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, we really would like a statement of intent on whether the four-year transition period is achievable. I hope it is; otherwise, good intentions will founder here for sure and the old saying that the best can be the enemy of the good will be vindicated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I support most of the content of the report and am pleased that the Commission is prepared to propose transitional arrangements for the cleansing of waste water. I think, however, that we are going too far in a number of areas. During the last part-session, we debated Mr Olsson’s report on the extent to which the existing BSE decisions had been implemented in the Member States. That was depressing, and there was not much to rejoice about. There are too many countries which cut corners, and that creates too many holes in the system for BSE to be combated effectively. Something needs to be done about this. We owe it to ourselves and, especially, to those countries which comply with the decisions. I am unable to support the proposed amendments to the regulations governing post-mortem inspection of blood, for which I do not believe there is any scientific justification. Nor have I been given any estimates of its economic significance for the Member States and the regions, and I fear it would involve major costs for smaller enterprises and, in particular, for slaughterhouses operating on a very small scale. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Optimum control and traceability of animal by-products are vital prerequisites of greater consumer safety.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, I support the amendment which was adopted in committee on the use of kitchen waste for animal feed. The feeding of untreated kitchen and restaurant waste has often been regarded in the past as a possible source of swine fever and foot and mouth disease. For this reason it is especially important that all such untreated catering waste which is transported into our countries should be eliminated.</p>
<p class="contents">It undoubtedly makes sense to process catering waste in accordance with strict regulations, so that the entire operation can be supervised down to the smallest detail. Our declared aim in all of this must be maximum safety for consumers. Strict processing regulations, by which I specifically mean rules governing sterilisation and the destruction of potential pathogens, and firm European regulations on traceability and control are indispensable and reduce the risk of the spread of epizootic diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent checks by producers, but also by farmers, must supplement the system. The vital thing is that farmers and consumers must be able to rely on the safety of feed products. This requires a system for the conditional authorisation of catering waste for use as animal feed, a system that can be closely monitored. This is why I firmly support the amendment tabled by the Environment Committee. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The aim of this report, as previous speakers have said, is to draw up sanitary rules with a view to improving food safety. One of the fundamental aspects of this proposal is to ban re-use within the food chain of certain animal products, namely animal carcasses and downgraded animal by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the draft text submitted to Parliament at second reading – and I am referring to Article 4 here – indicates that all matter of animal origin collected during processing waste water in slaughterhouses and other premises must be classified as category 1, and this wording and change in the text gives us cause for concern.</p>
<p class="contents">A provision of this kind would cause huge problems in terms of storage, collection and disposal, since the sludge from processing waste water during slaughter would no longer be able to be spread on land, but would have to be incinerated, which would add to the millions of tonnes of animal feed that we have to dispose of.</p>
<p class="contents">The costs incurred by these new restrictions would force many slaughterhouses and cutting rooms throughout the European Union to close down their business that has become increasingly difficult in the wake of the various crises that we have experienced.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only reaffirm that, at local level, the professional workers, employees, citizens and local authorities, if they failed to grasp the scientific justification of this text, would find it hard to understand that, after all their efforts (sanitary measures, tests, slaughtering herds), the European Union is asking them to make a further effort which goes beyond the financial limits that they are able to cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is essential that we provide clarification on this matter and that this specific treatment only applies to equipment with specific risks, thus ensuring increased food safety and feasibility for our industries and tradesmen.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also step up our research programmes so that we have the most effective techniques possible for the processing of animals that are slaughtered and intended for human consumption and also pursue our other food safety policies to improve traceability, monitoring of imports from third countries and safe livestock feeding, as our priority must be to tackle the root of these problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does it become even dirtier when politicians have to deal with such unsavoury matters as pigswill and abattoir waste? Would it not perhaps be more consistent if we did not deal with these matters at all but simply proclaimed an outright ban? If we commit ourselves to the search for sensible solutions, does this necessarily make us somehow corrupt or venal? All sorts of inferences like these have been doing the rounds lately. I do not believe they have any substance. The European Parliament has shown courage. I should like to pay tribute to Mrs Paulsen for her systematic work on this issue and for her close cooperation with our committee. As draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I have had the task of representing the interests of the farming community. I believe we have successfully integrated their concerns into this common position. May I also thank you, Commissioner Byrne, for our long conversations and debates. They were no bad thing. They were fruitful and, besides, they were quite enjoyable too.</p>
<p class="contents">Here we are looking specifically at high-quality protein which is to be fed to non-vegetarian animals. We do not intend to make vegetarians of them, any more than we can induce carrion-eating birds to stop eating carrion. It would be the death of them. Similarly, when it comes to human foodstuffs, we want a system that will recycle all the high-quality nutrients. We cannot adopt a set of rules at the expense of the hungry people in the world, whereby anything that is no longer good enough for us is simply destroyed or abandoned.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not legislating on catering waste here; it is merely a matter of the Commission presenting its own legislative proposal, to which we accord the same systematic and meticulous treatment that we gave to meat and bone meal. I do not understand the position of some people who are saying that meat and bone meal can be fed but catering waste cannot. Then there are others, of course, who are saying that catering waste can be fed but not meat and bone meal. So both positions exist. That is why I tabled my proposal. Your compromise proposal, Mrs Paulsen, is fine. Tomorrow I shall move an oral amendment in which I shall alter the time scale in my amendments, which are similar in substance to the compromise; this alteration relates to the time before the entry into force of the proposed regulation. I believe the alteration will make the amendments compatible, and we can then adopt them as they stand. We shall then have a sound solution. Thereafter, Mr Byrne, I hope that, on your initiative, we shall soon have the new version back here on the table. Then we shall engage in some more of the good old cut and thrust, and we shall revel in it. Politics is not a dirty business; it is actually a most enjoyable occupation!</p>

We have been able to respond to food crises in the current parliamentary term in a way that has been both consistent and wide-ranging. Our common goal is to restore complete consumer confidence and levels of safety. I would like to say that I agree with the view expressed just now by Mr Pesälä regarding Amendment No 15.</p>
<p class="contents">The traditional, common sense way in which catering waste is used for feeding has for the present unfortunately proved problematic as a result of inadequacies in the processing of feed. Serious animal diseases have thus been able to spread. For that reason Parliament now requires the Commission to promptly submit a legislative proposal banning the use of catering waste of animal origin as feed and obliging Member States to provide proof of its safe disposal. As an exception, the production of feed from catering waste could be permitted if it has been properly sterilised in an officially authorised plant.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament can also feel pleased with how the codecision procedure works and the cooperation established with the Council in the area of food safety. That is why it is unfortunate that the most prominent element in publicising the work to improve food safety, the establishment of a new Food Safety Authority, has proved such a difficult task in the Council and that the agency is commencing its work in a temporary location. This is also likely to hamper the recruitment of qualified staff for the agency. In this respect the Council should be capable of making the right decisions swiftly and showing consumers that the long-term work done to guarantee the supply of safe food is more important that seeking to obtain short-term benefits for individual countries in the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The basis for a very specific distinction is provided by the submission from the Commission, which divides the materials into three categories. They must be separately registered, stored, treated and marketed, and evidence of each operation must be recorded. The items that must be destroyed and removed from the food chain are quite clearly defined, as are the conditions for their removal and destruction. We are all agreed that contaminated and inferior material has no place in the food chain. On the other hand, we can treat and then re-use important nutrient carriers that were properly prepared for their original use. Strict rules govern the procedure for such recycling. Here we have the example of pigswill. To allow the use of pigswill, the Committee on the Environment adopted Amendment No 10 on the recycling of catering waste. There is pressure to adopt this particular amendment within a short time frame. The directive on swine fever enters into force on 1 November and imposes a blanket ban on the feeding of catering waste. And this is why I ask you, Commissioner, whether Compromise Amendment 25 that has been set before us lifts this ban. A legal loophole must not be created here, because the existing processing facilities produce hygienic feed which contributes neither to the spread of classical swine fever nor to that of foot and mouth disease. I believe Amendment No 10 was good, which is why the committee adopted it. It is for this reason that I asked my absolutely clear and unequivocal question about the new compromise amendment on the table. We should take particular care to ensure that we make clear and unambiguous statements and that we leave no scope for confusing double standards and overlaps between different regulations. This sort of thing affects small and medium-sized abattoirs. For that reason, we must support Amendment No 2 to Article 4.</p>
<p class="contents">May I reiterate my sincere thanks to Mrs Paulsen for this report? It is a matter of the safety of our food chain, which is, after all, very closely connected with the health of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When shall we create an authoritative and objective system of public information in the EU? In Germany, catering waste is fed to fattening pigs under the strictest of rules. Confidence in the processing facilities is high. My country is the most populous in the EU; about a quarter of the entire population of the Union lives in Germany, and there is a correspondingly high output of catering waste. There is no evidence of any epizootic disease having occurred in our country through the feeding of treated catering waste to livestock. What are we actually doing to ourselves with this planned ban?</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, we have started to place pigs before people as far as food intake is concerned. Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf has already raised this point, and I too find it monstrous to do this in a world where people are starving every day, where slum children have to rummage about in rubbish heaps for food scraps. What life of luxury is Europe trying to lead? This, you may well say, is an emotional argument, but it is extremely important to me, Commissioner, that we restore some rationality to our examination of the feeding of catering waste. It must surely be possible for us, through our own efforts and with the aid of the media, to present these issues in a rather more objective manner.</p>
<p class="contents">The treatment of catering waste must, of course, comply with appropriately high sterilisation standards. That is the only way to guarantee the destruction of foot and mouth and swine-fever pathogens. Plants supervised by the public authorities are surely the best safeguard. Along with the numerous previous contributors to this debate, may I say thank you very much to Mrs Paulsen for the work she has done, but I also hope that we can reach a practicable solution and that we can send out long-term signals from which the feed industry, waste processors and farmers can take their lead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, this proposal is the second major component in our defence barriers against BSE. The other is, of course, the regulation on TSEs. It is a hugely important proposal, key to the safe processing of the millions of tonnes of animal by-products produced in the Union each year. The continued absence of a sound, comprehensive and regulatory framework to deal with these by-products is quite dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I would like to single out for particular appreciation your rapporteur, Mrs Paulsen, for her enormous efforts and tireless work over these months in pursuing a rapid agreement with the Commission and the Council towards early implementation of the proposed regulation. A great many of the key provisions of the regulation under discussion result from her personal commitment and determination.</p>
<p class="contents">I am greatly encouraged that all three institutions are in general agreement on three key principles: the requirement that only animal by-products derived from animals fit for human consumption should be used in feed, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products; the prohibition of intra-species recycling; and the need to tighten certain provisions in order to improve the control and traceability of animal by-products.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I regret that, despite the very good progress made on the proposal, the question of how to deal with catering waste remains a main obstacle to final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The feeding of catering waste carries a major threat of transmission of serious animal diseases such as foot and mouth disease and classical swine fever. For example, the outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the UK last year, which caused such enormous losses to both the farming and non-farming community, is reliably known to have originated from swill feeding. I might also add that the outbreak of classical swine fever in the Netherlands in 1997 was also caused by the feeding of pigswill in neighbouring Germany.</p>
<p class="contents">Nobody would wish this to occur again. Given the huge damage which has arisen from recent outbreaks of these diseases, the insistence of Member States on very high levels of protection is understandable and shared by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I am fully aware of your concerns that a total ban may not be appropriate, especially in Member States with strict controls. However, I am equally aware that the Member States are not prepared to take any risk arising from the authorisation of swill feeding. They have already decided on a ban in the swine fever directive, despite several opportunities to reconsider the need for a ban. There are no indications of a reversal of this position.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament must also accept that there are contradictions in any proposal to retain swill feeding. For example, Parliament is demanding the full traceability of ingredients in animal feedingstuffs and a ban on what might be described as cannibalism. How can this be consistent with a derogation allowing the use of waste collected from restaurants and hospital kitchens to feed pigs and poultry?</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, how can Parliament ask to exclude catering waste from the strict control rules of the regulation, fearing that these rules would compromise the practice of composting, and at the same time demand that the Commission propose a new regulation on the safe disposal of catering waste?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission, having heard the insistence of 13 Member States on the necessity for a ban, and in the interests of consistency, remains opposed to any relaxation of an outright ban in this regulation. We must therefore reject Amendments Nos 1, 10 and 25.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also opposed to these amendments on institutional grounds, as the insistence on a deadline and on the content of future proposals undermines the Commission's right of initiative. Furthermore, the disposal and recycling of catering waste is and will be governed by existing and future environmental legislation on biodegradable waste.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has already officially declared that it is ready to propose transitional measures, to be adopted by comitology whenever this is justified and appropriate, in order to allow the affected industries time to adapt to the new requirements introduced by this regulation. I would also refer you to Article 32, which might give further assistance in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the details, we cannot accept Amendments Nos 3 and 5 on the requirement of the marking of unprocessed category 1 and 2 material. Acceptance would require the marking of cadavers, including pet animals, and 1.2 billion tonnes of manure. I leave to your imagination the potential for the Eurosceptic press to exploit this requirement in order to undermine our credibility.</p>
<p class="contents">We also cannot accept Amendment No 9, as detailed and sufficient requirements regarding accompanying documents and record-keeping are established in the annex to the regulation and may be supplemented if need be by comitology.</p>
<p class="contents">We can, however, accept Amendments Nos 22 and 23 on catering waste making reference to environmental legislation, as they would ensure that the goals of the regulation are achieved without undermining separate collection schemes. Therefore, Amendments Nos 17 and 19 are unnecessary and cannot be supported by us.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 22 and 23 also clarify that the highest risk catering waste from international means of transport should remain subject to the control rules of Article 7. Therefore, they are preferable to Amendments Nos 7 and 8.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot accept Amendment No 18, aimed at excluding household kitchen waste from the definition of catering waste, as this is would be inconsistent with the existing EU legislation on classical swine fever.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to another important issue – sludge from slaughterhouses – we cannot support the first part of Amendment No 2, as it virtually destroys the effect of Article 4 by removing from the scope of the article material from waste-water systems from all slaughterhouses and other premises from which specified risk material is removed. It should be noted that the TSE Regulation does not establish any rules in this area. But as an aside, and in answer to Mr Goodwill, I should point out that I have written to Dr. Jackson on this particular subject. I have sent a copy of the letter to a number of Members and I will ensure that a copy is sent to you. It explains the position with regard to sludge and gives the kind of reassurance you sought earlier in your presentation.</p>
<p class="contents">We could accept in broad terms the second part of Amendment No 2, which seeks to clarify that animal material collected when treating waste water is a category 1 material only if contains BSE specified risk material. However, Amendment No 21, which has the same objective but is clearer, is acceptable. Amendment No 4 cannot be accepted as, when combined with Amendment No 2 or with Amendment No 21, it would be superfluous and confusing.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot support Amendment No 14, which would provide a 3-year transitional period without conditions to apply during this period. I repeat that the Commission has already officially declared that it is ready to propose transitional measures to be adopted by comitology whenever this is justified and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">We can support Amendment No 24 aiming to extend the derogation on the feeding of certain animals with category 1 material to endangered and protected species of, for example, vultures. We cannot accept Amendment No 11, as it would extend that derogation to any endangered or protected species.</p>
<p class="contents">We can support Amendment No 20 requiring Member States to submit a report on the implementation of the Regulation, except for the reference to the lifting of the ban on meat- and bonemeal. This is already comprehensively covered by the TSE Regulation. Similarly, we can support the principle of Amendment No 13, which has the same objective as the first part of Amendment No 20, subject to editorial change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we can accept Amendments Nos 6, 12, 15 and 16 to various articles and annexes, as they are in line with the basic objectives of the Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish also to note that Parliament has not made any further amendments to the second proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Council Directives 90/425/EEC and 92/118/EEC as regards health requirements for animal by-products. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
