This legislation must be correctly implemented in the legal systems of Member States, and it must be clear, transparent and understandable to the citizens. In practice, however, things are not that simple. European law is often described as confused, imprecise, and as leaving too much open to interpretation.</p>
<p class="contents">The general delays related to the transposition of law gave rise to Article 260 of the Treaty of Lisbon, a provision which enables the European Commission to punish Member States for failing to implement Union law properly or within the set time. In relation to this, it was with great interest that I listened to the idea of the ‘smart regulation’, which Mr Barroso presented in his political guidelines last year. While encouraging the Commission to put the ‘smart regulation’ agenda into effect, and taking the opportunity of the Commission’s representative being with us today, I would like to ask what is happening with this? How is the Commission acting upon this idea? I hope it was not just a trendy technocratic slogan. Something else which Mr Barroso promised was <span class="italic">ex-post</span> assessments. I agree that it is necessary to follow very closely what happens to Union legislation after it has been adopted. Is it implemented correctly, and if not, what is the reason for the delays in correct implementation? Is the new legislation something the citizens can understand? If European legislation does not have a beneficial effect on the economy, the environment and society, all of our work loses its meaning. Which explains the next question for the Commission: what is happening with <span class="italic">ex-post</span> assessments? How are they different from existing mechanisms used for monitoring the implementation of legislation? A further matter is that of the impact assessment which accompanies the proposal for every new law.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has repeatedly drawn attention to the fact that the Commission, when proposing new legislative acts, must carry out a detailed analysis of their implementation, based on credible data.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I have looked at the problem of impact assessments from two points of view: firstly, the content, or which consequences of the proposed legislative acts the Commission should examine. I appeal, here, to the Commission to attach particular importance to exploring the social effects of its initiatives. Answers to such questions as what effect a particular legislative proposal would have on the European labour market and on employment in particular age groups and sectors are particularly important in the context of the economic crisis. I think this aspect has not, as yet, been the subject of sufficient analysis. On the other hand, I would like to address the question of the independence of impact assessments, which is directly related to the problem of better lawmaking.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I highlight the need to guarantee full independence and suitable resources to the body which monitors the quality of impact assessments, and which, as you know, was established in response to Parliament’s demands. I am thinking, here, of the Impact Assessment Board, which is composed of the highest officials of the Commission and reports to the President of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, I am very cautious in my approach to the question of engaging external experts to conduct impact assessments, because Parliament is not, in fact, in a position to confirm their independence. In the report, I also address the Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens. Public opinion too often associates the European Union with complicated and unnecessary bureaucracy. Therefore, I welcome the fact that the Commission plans to reduce these burdens by as much as 33% by 2012. However, I have heard reports that in certain cases the exemption of businesses from administrative obligations has led to a reduction in standards, for example in relation to safety at work. Therefore, I appeal to the Commission to look at the problem from a global perspective. Cuts in administrative costs must not be made at the cost of a reduction in social standards in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, I also address the work of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, which is headed by Mr Stäuber. I think the work of the High Level Group to date has been very effective, and I welcome the news that its terms of reference are to be extended to 2013. I hope Parliament will be kept informed about how the group evaluates the realisation of the Programme for Reducing Administrative Burdens at European Union level.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to address questions related to the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon, and in particular what the strengthening of contacts with national parliaments and the realisation of citizens’ initiatives will be like in practice. I hope cooperation between parliaments will extend not only to questions related to monitoring the principle of subsidiarity, but will also contribute to better transposition of European legislation. As for the citizens’ initiative, I think millions of citizens are waiting to hear Parliament’s position on this matter.

She will see from my introductory remarks that the Commission fully agrees with most of it. We very much like the effort and strong emphasis the European Parliament puts on smart regulation because this is clearly the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad to announce to you today that on Tuesday the Commission took the final steps to withdraw 59 pending proposals listed in the 2010 work programmes which we will not pursue any more because we see that they are outdated or have outlived their initial purpose. This is also how we are honouring the commitment we undertook in our framework agreement negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to confirm to you that the Commission will adopt a communication on smart regulation on 6 October, as well as the annual report on better lawmaking where we will be dealing in a detailed manner with subsidiarity issues. I believe that these documents will address in detail the issues raised by Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg in her report, so I will just limit myself to some key points.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point on which I think we all agree, and the financial crisis is clear proof of that, is that regulation has a positive and necessary role in assuring that markets deliver sustainable prosperity for all. At the same time, I totally agree with Mrs Geringer de Oedenberg that we need to be very careful how we legislate because we do not want to overburden businesses, and especially SMEs, with unnecessary administrative burdens. We are doing our utmost to reduce the administrative burden in existing legislation and also in the legislation we are preparing.</p>
<p class="contents">We are going to work very hard to pursue the four main activities related to smart regulation. We are going to continue with impact assessments. We are going to do our utmost to further improve quality. We are going to simplify legislation which is already on the books. We will continue our efforts to reduce administrative burdens for businesses, and we are also going to evaluate regulations which are already in place to see how efficient this legislation is.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that we have some disagreements and shall limit myself to two issues. The first relates to the independent body accountable to Parliament. We are pleased at how the impact assessments are being done within the Commission. The Commission, as you know very well, is accountable to the European Parliament, so Parliament as a legislator is the body which in the end controls the quality of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second issue is recasting. You know we have exchanges of opinions between the Commission and Parliament reflected in the exchange of letters between our Presidents, where we see that the current situation which arose after the changes to the European Parliament Rules of Procedure raised questions about the use of the recasting technique. Ultimately, if this situation persists, the use of recasting for simplification initiatives and for amending existing legislation will no longer make sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Otherwise, I think we have very strong agreement on other matters and our mutual goal is to legislate smartly, efficiently and in a way that is very good for our citizens and our businesses. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also pleased that my opinion, which was prepared in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, has been extensively incorporated into the final version of this document. During the many years of the functioning of first the European Communities and then the European Union, we have learned that a single EU regulation for all Member States works more effectively in the world of free movement of goods, services and persons than intricate and very often extremely complicated legislation at the level of 27 Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">New and existing legislation must not, however, create additional obstacles for the people who use it. It should regulate areas of life, but not prevent action. The basic idea is to simplify Union legislation and create a friendly regulatory environment which is intended to make it easier for citizens to function in the European regulatory jungle. However, this must under no circumstances lead to a reduction in existing standards in this area, but should, on the contrary, lead to standards being raised. This year’s report draws attention to a number of changes brought to the Union by the Treaty of Lisbon, which are going to have a significant effect on the entire process of Union legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The increased role of the European Parliament as well as the European legislative initiative and further reductions in administrative burdens for small and medium-sized enterprises will, in a natural way, draw the attention of EU citizens to the process itself and to its quality and effectiveness. The increased participation of Parliament in the Union legislative process carries with it, of course, greater responsibility. Therefore, the citizens will perceive Parliament as an institution which has a real influence on legislation which is created, and will, therefore, look more carefully at our work as Members of the European Parliament. Therefore, another important question is that of guaranteeing independent and comprehensive impact assessments. We in the Committee take a view of the matter which differs at this point from that of the rapporteur. However, what we do all want is to have at our disposal an objective and reliable basis which will allow us to chart our course and make decisions about future legislation. We also have to remember that good legislation is one of the guarantees of effective implementation and subsequent application of the provisions of EU law in Member States, which, unfortunately, is still a fairly serious problem throughout the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I cannot fail to agree with the key objectives identified by the rapporteur, in particular respect for the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality, the importance accorded to the impact assessments and to reducing administrative burdens.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the impact assessments, I am keen to stress that the Committee on Legal Affairs is actively working so that the European Commission can develop mechanisms to provide guarantees and ensure the independence of the analyses carried out. This is a fundamental question: ensuring higher standards for the impartiality of the assessments would give the EU’s legislative proposals greater credibility, and would simplify the process for their adoption.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I consider it vital to work towards a clear reduction of the administrative burdens arising from European Union legislation. The European Commission would like to reduce these burdens by 25% by 2012, which would entail an increase in the level of EU GDP of 1.4%, equivalent to EUR 150 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">A substantial part of EU administrative burdens stems, in fact, from the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of administrative procedures implemented at national level. To give an example: 72 EU legislative acts have imposed 486 information obligations, which have led to the adoption in the Member States of more than 10 000 implementing acts.</p>
<p class="contents">While on the one hand, increased monitoring is required during the transposition of Union law, on the other, greater collaboration by the Council and the individual Member States is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I think that, leaving aside matters concerning the principle of subsidiarity, closer cooperation with national parliaments can provide a decisive contribution towards making EU laws more effective and ultimately bringing them closer in line with the needs of EU citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If all of those involved in European lawmaking abide by this, we will already have achieved a great deal. Ultimately, it is about the credibility of European law. The intention is to significantly improve the regulatory environment. It is a matter of greater transparency, coherence and effectiveness of European law.</p>
<p class="contents">Two elements of the report are particularly important. Simplification of the law – better lawmaking – must not lead to a lowering of European standards laid down in current legislation. In this regard, better lawmaking must be viewed in close association with another initiative, that of smart or better regulation. Every legislative initiative should include proper consultation of the interested parties, in particular if it will have an effect on employment and social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, an excellent impact assessment system is particularly important to me, as it is to everyone who worked on this report. We need a system that clearly indicates that the independence and credibility of the measures implemented are guaranteed. After all, we have had some very bad experiences in the past. I am thinking of the Services Directive and the one-sided assessment of the impact at that time, particularly on the part of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Lisbon now contains a horizontal social clause. As far as I am concerned, this is also the basis for the fact that, in the impact assessment system, we pay particular attention – as already mentioned – to ensuring that a thorough consultation of the social partners is carried out with regard to the impact on employment and social matters. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We want to make simple and transparent laws that EU citizens and companies can understand. In this regard, it is important, above all, to respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. We want to regulate at European level only what cannot be regulated at national or local level.</p>
<p class="contents">An important element of better lawmaking is, above all, having a clear idea of the impact of the planned regulations. Only with this can we achieve the best possible effects and, at the same time, keep any negative impact to a minimum. The impact assessment must therefore be prepared by the Commission with the greatest possible meticulousness. It is right, therefore, that, under pressure from the European Parliament, an independent board was set up to monitor the quality of impact assessments. However, this board is intended to be accountable to the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">For companies, authorities and citizens, the regulations are associated with costs, whether it is in relation to providing information, labelling products or complying with monitoring obligations. If the costs are too high, it cancels out the benefit of a policy. We therefore have the ambitious goal, which is also the right one, of reducing administrative costs by reducing red tape by 25% by 2012. To achieve this goal we need to act at European level, and the chances of achieving it are good. However, at this point it should also be mentioned that a good third – some people say two thirds – of the administrative burden that is derived from the EU is due to the fact that the Member States simply enact too many unnecessary administrative and bureaucratic regulations when transposing EU law. EU bodies and Member States should therefore actively work together to prevent unnecessary red tape. The transposition of Community law must also be fundamentally and actively scrutinised. Above all, the national parliaments should also fulfil their obligation for involvement in accordance with the Treaty of Lisbon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is therefore a lot of criticism too of European lawmaking, to which we must respond. This response must include essential elements, such as impact assessments that are genuinely independent and take account of all interested parties, and not just the economy, industry and the lobby groups. I consider that to be vitally important.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point, and this has been the subject of particularly strong criticism, is the implementation of Community law at national level. Very many difficulties arise in precisely this phase of transposition, or perhaps lack of transposition, of European law into national law. It is therefore here, in particular, in this transposition phase that we need to make new improvements and to respond to the concerns of citizens in an effective, transparent and clear manner. The complaints of citizens provide the greatest impetus for innovation in European law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Better lawmaking is a challenge of vital importance for the future of an EU that is relevant for citizens of our Member States. Much of the good lawmaking that we do in this House is, however, unfortunately negated, firstly by the large number of completely unnecessary regulations that still sit on our statute books and the administrative burden that places on the backbone of the EU economy, i.e. SMEs. I am pleased to see that the Commission has today recognised that in this House. Secondly there are the somewhat completely crazy initiatives that the Commission comes with to us from time to time, which achieve nothing other than to allow our real work to be ignored and these crazy ideas to be rightly rubbished.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving forward from the Lisbon Treaty, however, it is important that we concentrate on many of the issues that have been raised by my colleague. First of all, as the standing rapporteur on monitoring subsidiarity and proportionality, I can tell you that it is certainly of vital importance that our national parliaments play their right part in our process of lawmaking here, but without adequate interpretation facilities, that part of our job is not done to the best of our abilities.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the development on impact assessments. Consultation with all interested parties and compliance with subsidarity should also be tested. I welcome the report’s call for smart regulation to be defined. Impact assessments should be presented in committee right at the outset, so that Parliament can share its views with the Commission before any assessment is undertaken.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, my group is very supportive of the fact that we move forward on the following bases: the European Institutions must respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality; all draft legislation must include reasons for concluding that this level is the best at which we come forward with that regulation; all legislative proposals should be accompanied by an impact assessment with a greater degree of independence; the Commission should present all impact assessments to the committee right at the outset; and we must ensure that decisions are taken as closely to the citizen as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am particularly grateful for the fact that so much attention has been given to the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. Unfortunately, we have to lament the fact that the intentions set out in the Treaty of Lisbon will not be remotely fulfilled by what the Commission is proposing. It is very regrettable to see that the whole section on national parliamentary scrutiny, which is all about the principle of proportionality, has been removed, and it is equally regrettable that with the Treaty of Lisbon we have not gone all the way and said that if a large majority of the parliaments wishes to stop a piece of legislation because it violates the principle of subsidiarity it should, of course, have the opportunity to do so. The only thing we have been able to produce is yellow cards and orange cards – something that in reality is completely ineffective and is, as far as the autonomy and sovereignty of national parliaments is concerned, more of a joke than a real legal instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">This is regrettable, but I think it is gratifying that we have now started this debate, that we have placed the focus on these important elements and that, in the process that is now being started by the Commission, we will hopefully also arrive at a situation where the Member States are actually shown respect and where it is not merely noted if national parliaments feel there has been a violation of the principle of subsidiarity, but that we actually stop and think that, in that case, we need to find another way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was one of the fine aspects of the Treaty of Lisbon and received a great deal of publicity. However, the time has already come for us to see whether it was nothing more than a populist sop aimed at winning greater public support for the Treaty of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">If you have really been honest when you said that national parliaments need to play a role in determining whether a particular act respects the principle of subsidiarity, a procedure needs to be drawn up right now, which will allow national parliaments to join forces with each other and take united action. This is why the requirement for two thirds of national parliaments to make a decision against a particular act because it fails to comply with subsidiarity means quite a sizeable majority is required. At the moment, in order to ensure that this principle can really be applied, a uniform procedure actually needs to be drawn up for all national parliaments to comply with. Only then will it actually be possible to apply this regulation. This is why I call on the Belgian Presidency, which will be hosting the COSAC conference of national parliaments, to take the necessary measures in this direction. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It must, of course, be the case, as a matter of principle, that policies are pursued at regional or local level. Only there are policies really understandable to citizens, and that important instrument of direct democracy is only really possible to implement adequately at this level. That is the whole point of the principle of subsidiarity and that is precisely why the subsidiarity principle also has a requirement for the reasoned opinion. Thus, we should provide arguments based on quantitative and qualitative indicators as to why policy is pursued at EU level and not at local level.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is currently the case – and I would like to address this point here – that this very requirement for the reasoned opinion is constantly being disregarded. It is possible in some cases to find information in the Commission’s report to indicate that these tasks have already been carried out at national level. Thus, insufficient arguments are presented to indicate why it is better for this regulation to be carried out at EU level.</p>
<p class="contents">The right to control subsidiarity that has now been introduced with the Treaty of Lisbon is, in my opinion, inadequate; the national parliaments do not have sufficient power and this control right is ultimately a sham right. I therefore call on the Commission in particular to proceed much more rigorously according to the principle of subsidiarity and, above all, to comply adequately with the requirement for the reasoned opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Allow me to make a few comments on it. In recent years, the Commission has taken a number of steps leading to an improvement in legal regulation and I am personally very much in favour of that. This is despite the fact that I see with my own eyes that it does not always work as I would wish. I sometimes have the feeling in this venerable institution that the right hemisphere sees the content of ‘better regulation’ diametrically differently from the left hemisphere. I would also like to bring up the results of the work of the High Level Group of Independent Stakeholders on Administrative Burdens, chaired by Edmund Stoiber.</p>
<p class="contents">I must disagree with the report on one issue; that is, with the call to increase the number of employees of the Impact Assessment Board. In my view, it would be better to think about how to help the Board in this matter. For example, within the framework of current capacities here in the European Parliament, we could set up a committee for the removal of bureaucratic burdens which, within the framework of its activity, would judge the impact assessment, just as it would assess the reduction in the administrative burdens of the proposed legal rules. The activity of such a committee would ease the difficult task for the Commission without this impacting upon Parliament’s operational expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The points of the report which call for a more effective inclusion of SMEs in impact assessments are of particular significance. Enterprise support involves the provision of a reasonable regulatory framework and simple administration. As for impact assessment summaries, they assist Parliament in its work.

I think this is what the European Union and our Member States need. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for highlighting the importance of working with the impact assessments which are prepared for the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Very positive precedents have been set by the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, and we hope that other committees will also work in such a regular and detailed manner with our impact assessments as this committee has. We will of course try to do our best to improve the quality of impact assessments further, and to supply these together with a proposal for legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that we need to study the impact of proposed amendments is very important. I was glad that was highlighted in the report. Very often, legislation is proposed and we change it with significant amendments which are often adopted in a hurried manner. It can really improve the legislation, but it can also make it much worse, and we should bear that in mind.</p>
<p class="contents">I absolutely agree with those Members who said that we need impartial assessment. This is what we are trying to do in the Commission. We are working very closely with the Stoiber Group. We have a very strong impact assessment board which is really driving a new culture forward in terms of how the Commission works internally. The language is very bland, and I can tell you that more than 30% of the proposals sent to the relevant departments are refused by the impact assessment board and sent back for further improvement with a view to increasing the quality of the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards SMEs, I think we discussed two days ago how important it is to reduce the burden, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises so that they can benefit from the single market. I am very happy to report to you that this goal of reducing the administrative burden by 25% by 2012 will definitely be exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">I see that my time is up so I would like to thank the rapporteur once again for a very high-quality report, and all the MEPs for their commitment to smarter and better legislation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am glad that I had the opportunity to work on the report on better lawmaking this year, which was the first year after entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the year in which the European Council adopted the EU 2020 strategy. Both these documents are going to affect many aspects related to better lawmaking, and the report was a good opportunity to address the issues involved. In the course of preparing the report, I met many different groups and tried to listen to the opinions both of the business world and of workers’ groups, trade unions and organisations such as ETUC, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the complete consensus in the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs testifies to the fact that we have managed to find a judicious compromise between the expectations of all the political groups. I would like, here, to thank all fellow Members for their first-rate cooperation, and would like to add that the cooperation was exceptional because it came from all the political groups, which rarely happens in this Chamber. I hope, too, for a favourable outcome of the vote in today’s sitting. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The main principles guiding these Impact Assessments should be: that they act as a guide to law making, and must not replace or hinder the role of the politically accountable decision makers; and that any cost-benefit analysis should contain not only economic considerations but also social, health and environmental impacts.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the question of having an independent Impact Assessment Board, I believe the best method would be to ensure that it contains multiple stakeholders with their interests declared, whereby conflicts of interest are avoided. I do agree with the rapporteur that that the high percentage of assessments (over 30%) that are initially rejected by the Board testifies to the need for the Commission departments to improve their quality further. The Board of course should only inform the process and not make any political judgements. I would finally call on the Chair of the Board to appear before the Environment Committee on an annual basis following the publication of the IAB annual report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For only clear, coherent and easy to understand legislation can be assured of effective implementation in the Member States. In the area of reducing administrative burdens, particularly important material is to be found in the ‘<span class="italic">e</span>-Commission 2006-2010’ framework, as well as in the ‘<span class="italic">e</span>-2010’ strategy, which aims to modernise administration in Europe. Electronic communication is already a reality in our lives, as it will also be in the future. Thanks to <span class="italic">e</span>-communication we will gain time, eliminate many administrative barriers and reduce the use of natural resources, and in so doing we will protect the environment more effectively. Therefore, we must concentrate our efforts and resources on making its use more widespread, remembering to give help to disabled and elderly people to make things easier for them. We regularly appeal to the European Commission to simplify and accelerate procedures for the use of additional EU instruments, such as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund and the EU Solidarity Fund. The reaction of EU institutions to natural disasters and serious economic difficulties in Member States is still too inflexible and too slow. It is high time we developed new instruments without reproducing earlier shortcomings. The effectiveness of legislation is affected not only by its being written in a clear and understandable way, but equally by the way in which it is publicised and put into effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The challenge is to put the European Citizens’ Initiative – an instrument which gives people the ability to have a direct effect on the European agenda – into the hands of the citizens. In the ongoing debate on this subject, we are all talking about the necessity of simplifying this instrument as much as possible so that the citizens will really feel they have a genuine chance of putting their proposals into effect and that they do not get bogged down in the complexities of EU procedures. On the other hand, however, we do want to protect this instrument from abuse, and also to protect the European Commission from being excessively burdened.
