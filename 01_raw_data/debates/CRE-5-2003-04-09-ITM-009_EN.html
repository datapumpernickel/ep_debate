<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Auroi (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission’s positive intention is to tidy up ten directives, the first of which dates from 1966, concerning Community comparative tests and trials for various conventional seeds and propagating material. As the Commission has confirmed over the past twenty-five years, agricultural crops such as cereals, fodder crops, and oilseed and fibre crops have been subject to Community comparative tests on the basis of the applicable legislation. Over the last few years, this exercise has grown in importance following new legislation on the marketing of propagating material of fruit, vegetables and ornamental plants, which lays down detailed rules for implementing the Community comparative tests. This post-control system for seed and propagating material marketed in the Community is recognised as being an extremely important tool for the harmonisation of marketing by Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The planned tidying-up exercise, however, would be neither complete nor relevant if the comparative tests funded by the European Union were limited to currently certified seed and plants included in the Union’s common catalogue. The Commission’s proposal must take into account the recently adopted legislative provisions in the area of processed products, as regards the adventitious or technically unavoidable presence of genetically modified seed in conventional varieties of seed.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, it seems to me that in order to update these directives properly three objectives have to be achieved. First of all the proposal must cover all existing seed, so as to have a complete range which takes into account, in addition to traditional seed, the special requirements of biodiversity, and the effects of introducing biotechnology via GMOs. Secondly, it must include within its scope the so-called ‘amateur’ varieties, covered by Directive 98/95, which is still not taken into account by all Member States. Thirdly, for the sake of democracy, it must enable Parliament to be involved in the decision-making process right the way through from beginning to end. In this sense, the sensitive issue of the risk of contamination of traditional seed by GMOs must be included in the series of directives concerning the marketing of seed with which we are dealing here today. This issue cannot be dealt with by the committee procedure, because that would exclude Members of the European Parliament from the debate and prevent them from making proposals on this subject.</p>
<p class="contents">If I may return briefly to my first point, the comparative tests funded by the European Union should not be limited to the species included in the common catalogue. Conservation varieties and seed originating in organic farming should benefit from these tests. They have to be tested in conditions which correspond to these farming systems and they therefore require more funding. It should be pointed out such seed is not allowed to be coated and must be absolutely free from any trace of GMOs. Tests of the same type are necessary for plants at risk of GMO contamination. In effect, this proposal for a directive provides an opportunity to settle issues regarding the proven presence of genetically modified seed in conventional seed. The Commission has been working for some considerable time on a directive which would legislate on additional conditions and requirements regarding the presence of genetically modified seed in batches of seed, planting sites, and details of the marking of such seed. Unfortunately, the draft of the latest directive does not sufficiently take into account Directive 2001/18 on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms, which has come into force in the meantime.</p>
<p class="contents">To come back to my second point, it is important that the conservation species and varieties referred to in Directive 98/95 should be defined and tested for marketing in accordance with special criteria, and that will require an implementing regulation, something which we are still waiting for. In the same way, farm-saved seed or seed of local origin ought to be able to benefit from special flexibility and should be the subject of special contracts linked to Directive 98/95.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to my third point, this is where the democratic debate plays an important role. In the modified articles it is important to decline, as I have tried to do, to make any reference to precise traceability. It is therefore important to say, for each type of seed individually, that if accidental or technically unavoidable traces of GMOs are present in that seed, it is possible to set a threshold level, below which the seed can nonetheless be placed on the market. The level of that threshold should be established in accordance with Article 21 and set at the lowest possible level allowed in accordance with state-of-the-art scientific knowledge. Moreover, appropriate measures must be taken during the transport and storage of traditional seed, so that the accidental or technically unavoidable nature of any GMO pollution can be proved. In fact, although the directive already lays down that genetically modified seed must be labelled, it does not provide a solution to the problem of the risk of traces in traditional seeds, the rule being that such seed must not, in principle, contain any GMOs. This rule is extremely important to farming, because the spread of contaminated seed may have unforeseeable economic consequences, both for farmers and for food producers.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the directive already lays down that the Community may make a financial contribution to the carrying out of the tests laid down in Paragraphs 1 and 2. The same treatment should be possible for the special comparative tests needed for seed and plants produced and cultivated for organic farming and for the utilisation and conservation of genetic diversity in plants. For the sake of transparency, therefore, it will be necessary in future to establish a clear legal basis for a financial contribution, of whatever kind, and it is therefore necessary to make provision for Community financial measures which will be applicable to these comparative tests and which will include the necessary obligatory Community budget expenditure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Commissioner Byrne has said, this is about the marketing of seeds and I am rather disappointed that Mrs Auroi has decided to bring in GMOs. This report is about the marketing of traditional, conventional seeds and to bring in GMOs is really not part of the topic that we are debating today. I say that to Mrs Auroi as a seed producer and a seed grower. We spend much time and effort making sure that the product that we produce is completely free from any contamination and this is the way that conventional and traditional seeds are grown. To bring the issue of GMOs into this piece of legislation is wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also wrong because in fact the next piece of legislation to come from the Commission will be one on GMO seeds, after the two reports that are to go through Parliament, one of which is Mr Trakatellis's report which is currently before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, and of which Commissioner Byrne is well aware. Therefore I see little point at the moment in bringing that up and that is why I hope this Parliament will endorse my amendments while agreeing with the principle stated by Mrs Auroi that we must be aware of the situation with contamination of GMOs. I have tried to bring a little bit more of what I call a more pragmatic approach into this legislation and I hope this House will support my amendments on Mrs Auroi's report which, while supporting in principle what she said, will in practice enable the Commission to bring in the proposal that is due to be submitted after the two reports in Parliament. Therefore it is quite important that we look at these.</p>
<p class="contents">I say to Mrs Auroi that, yes, we are all aware of the risk of GMO contamination but it has not happened yet and there is no certainty that it will happen in the future; everyone involved in seed production is concerned about it, but please wait until this legislation comes from the Commission, when we will be able to take a decision on it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the tasks is to utilise those resources which safeguard transparency and traceability for all market participants, and, of course, for consumers. Seed production is a broad-based business; marketing is regulated in the various countries by official supervisory authorities, and the factors such as varietal purity and certification of origin are confirmed.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is intended to close the gaps. To this end, financial support in the sum of EUR 1 million is available, but as I have already said, this is a broad-based business. The provision of EUR 1 million illustrates, to my mind, how long it will take to be able to carry out comparative tests in this area. Labelling has always been required for the genetically modified varieties, and it is a matter for the countries themselves to deal with the thresholds. The problem of multiplication of sowing seed on individual farms, which is addressed here, will and should be regulated flexibly through special replicate licences, a solution which I can only endorse. Here, there have been – and continue to be – substantial gaps. The EU should deal comprehensively with the entire complex issue of GMOs within the framework of the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Action Plan, also as regards seed. I wish to call, at this point, for competition law and competitive freedom of choice to be maintained, not restricted, in agricultural production. This report does not do so, but I would like to highlight this issue once again. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The burning issue at present is not comparative tests, but coexistence between seed containing genetically modified organisms and seed for organic farming, which cannot contain GMOs by law. It is this coexistence that is the problem. It was not so difficult as long as there was no contamination, no transfer of genetically modified organisms. Indeed, the scientists had told us that this was not possible – until one of their genes escaped. The problem facing us now is that we cannot protect organic seed. This is the problem that we are seeking to address. In advance of this process, the Commission is putting forward proposals which we do not find satisfactory. However, we want to put this problem at the heart of the debate, and we have used the report for this purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of ten directives, there is going to be just one new one. In this new directive, account can also be taken of the latest developments in the field of seeds. Unfortunately, the Commission’s plans fall short. The rapporteur rightly argues that the new directive is incomplete if it takes no account of the specific requirements of biological agriculture. In this form of agriculture, seeds may not contain any GMOs or pesticides. Non-genetically modified seeds that are contaminated with GMOs must be kept off the market. We consider the introduction of GMOs undesirable as a matter of principle, but apart from that the EU is obliged to ensure a lasting GMO-free line of crops. For the threshold value below which contaminated seeds may nonetheless be put on the market, the most recent state of the art must alone be decisive. Finally, we all know the effect of one coloured sock in a white wash. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, my fellow Member Mrs Auroi, for this report. I welcome the Commission's proposal to simplify matters by drawing together and streamlining ten directives on the Community comparative tests. For twenty-five years, comparative tests on arable crops have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions. The scope of these tests has further increased substantially in recent years. This system of follow-up controls is seen as a very important instrument to harmonise the marketing conditions in the Member States and is therefore also endorsed in the internal market. These comparative tests must not, however, be restricted to those seed and plant varieties that have so far been certified and listed in the Union's common catalogue. There must also, in my view, be a quite specific way of dealing with seed designated for use in organic farming.</p>
<p class="contents">With this Directive, however, we should not only be looking at organic agriculture. I believe we should also be taking a look at conventional farming, and so I personally wish to support Mr Sturdy's amendments. A clear threshold for GMO traces in seed must be laid down in accordance with the latest scientific knowledge and research, not ideological criteria. If the traces lie below this threshold, it should still be permissible to place the seed on the market.</p>
<p class="contents">The presence of genetically modified organisms in seed, at least in the lower batches, is generally adventitious and often technically unavoidable. What is required here is genuinely feasible detectability in order to draw conclusions as to whether the seed should be placed on the market. With this Directive, we must therefore create a clear legal framework for agriculture as a whole – both for organic and conventional farming – and for food producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, it is also one of the most difficult chapters, as open market access must not distort competition. We need harmonisation of the marketing conditions in the Member States. This sounds quite simple at first, but it is actually extremely complicated, not only because there is a large number of products to regulate, but also because we must focus on upholding the same conditions as regards cultivation, care, and not least, quality definition.</p>
<p class="contents">For twenty-five years, comparative tests have been carried out in the Community on the basis of relevant legal provisions. I myself was a rapporteur on the amendment of Directive 68/193/EEC on the marketing of material for the vegetative propagation of the vine. The report was adopted by Parliament on 24 October 2000, and today, two and a half years later, the Commission is still only at the stage of discussing the contents of Annexes I to IV. With the tighter provisions envisaged here, I see a risk that the report's intention, namely to simplify, will be pursued ad absurdum. The virus tests which are called for, for example, would result in very high costs, which could lead to a reduction of clones and thus a depletion of genetic resources. This clearly conflicts with the Directive, whose content aims, in the long term, to abolish standard material while maintaining genetic diversity. I therefore ask the Commission this: firstly, why is the work here progressing so slowly? Secondly, can the Standing Committee on Seeds really amend a Commission proposal – one that Parliament supports – so radically? The resultant question for all of us is how effective our cooperation is.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we are discussing the financial contributions made by the Community for the comparative tests. I support the Commission's proposal to create a clear financial basis for this support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Secondly, I wish to thank the Commission, because I greatly welcome the fact that it has presented these proposals to provide a clear and transparent legal basis for funding comparative tests and trials for seeds and plants.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that we are all on the right track and that this is precisely what is needed. The fact is, however, that there are some differences of opinion on how far this work should go. On this I agree with various fellow Members who have spoken and with the rapporteur herself on the need to take a broader view of the entire issue of testing seeds and plants. We must therefore address this issue in a way that better reflects the reality of the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, we can then disagree on the issue of whether or not to regulate the issue of mixing pure seeds with seeds containing GMOs. My views on this matter are not based on ideology and like Mrs Keppelhoff-Wiechert, I also believe that we must accept what science has to say and that we must adopt a limit that entails no risk of excessive contamination. I also agree, however, with the need to ensure that we have pure seeds that are, as far as possible, uncontaminated by GMOs. For this reason, it would perhaps be worthwhile providing for special funding only for seeds not containing GMOs, covering organic farming, of course, but also traditional farming, which uses traditional regional and local seeds and varieties that are not sold on any large scale but which ought to be safeguarded from the point of view of genetics. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should make clear from the start that many amendments go beyond the scope of the original Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The request to ensure the inclusion in the Community comparative trials of organically produced seed, and seed falling in the area of plant genetic resources deserves consideration. However, the proposal to take specific measures in these areas has to be carefully considered to avoid any risk of overlapping with measures already in place. For this reason, Amendments 2, 4, 5, 6, and the relevant parts of Amendments 12 to 17, 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 are acceptable – subject to re-wording.</p>
<p class="contents">The compulsory indication of Community financial allocations laid down by parts of Amendments 12 to 17, 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 can be accepted only as a general recommendation to the Commission, again subject to rewording.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Amendment 22, the Council has already adopted the legal base for the implementation of measures for the marketing of seeds and plants for the conservation and diversity of genetic resources in Europe (for example, Article 21 of Council Directive 2002/54/EC on the marketing of beet seed). Hence the principle is acceptable, but not the amendment as such. I should add that this is an area to which the Commission is paying particular attention.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 7 to 11 cannot be accepted. The reference to financial and to other commitments of the Member States should take into account the specific competencies of the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me now to turn to the important issue of the adventitious and technically unavoidable presence of GMOs in seeds of conventional plant varieties. This is a totally different matter to the issue of comparative trials that we are discussing here today. It is therefore being addressed in another proposal, in the context of the directives on the marketing of seeds. A proposal for a Commission directive is being prepared, which will aim to set thresholds in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">As a consequence, Amendments 1, 3, 23, and the relevant parts of Amendments 12, 13, 18, 19 to 21 and 24 to 29 cannot be accepted. In relation to Amendments 24 to 29, they are not accepted on the basis that they repeat exactly the Commission proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I have explained on a number of occasions how the Commission intends to proceed with this file. As the seeds thresholds for GMOs are based on the food labelling threshold, and as the labelling threshold will be discussed again in the next few months in Parliament during the second reading of the proposed GM food and feed regulation, the Commission will wait for the outcome of these discussions before proceeding with the question of GMO thresholds in seeds. As Parliament is aware, there is draft legislation in preparation at the moment in relation to that issue.</p>
<p class="contents">On this issue I should refer to the points made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf in relation to coexistence. This issue has been dealt with by my colleague Commissioner Fischler, who is bringing forward a communication to the Commission within the next number of weeks on that issue which I expect will deal with that situation.</p>
<p class="contents">A full listing of the Commission’s position on each of the amendments is being made available to Parliament. I trust that this will be included in the minutes of this session.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would I reiterate my commitment, prior the adoption by the Commission of any Commission Directive on the subject, to listen to the views of all concerned, in particular the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
