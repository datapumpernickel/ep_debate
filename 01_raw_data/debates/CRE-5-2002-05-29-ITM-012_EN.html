<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lannoye (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I am forced to take a trip eleven years down memory lane since it was, in fact, in 1991 that the Council of Ministers for the Environment adopted a directive, to be discussed this evening, concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market. The aim of this directive was, firstly, to define a common evaluation procedure of active substances for both existing and new pesticides, and, secondly, to establish a positive list of authorised substances, which are deemed to be acceptable for health and the environment. A positive list means that any substance that does not feature on this list is, essentially, banned. Twelve years was chosen as the period in which to complete this considerable undertaking, which of course gives us until July 2003. In the meantime, however, the Commission was required, under Article 8, to publish a progress report on the procedure. This report was in fact published at the end of last year and this is what forms the basis of this evening’s debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report, the Commission states that 31 out of the 834 active substances on the market have been evaluated, that is, less than 5%. In these conditions and as the Commission quite rightly states, it will clearly not be possible to meet the July 2003 deadline. I shall not dwell on the causes of the enormous delay placed upon us, other than to say that it must be attributed, in the main, to a lack of political will, on the part of the Commission as well as the Member States. The Member States divided between them the task of carrying out the evaluation of substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is now proposing to extend the deadlines and inevitably, for the sake of realism, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, for which I am spokesperson this evening, must agree to this extension. Although it accepts this extension, the group’s agreement is, however, subject to strict conditions, which include adopting clear priorities for drawing up the new timeframe for the task, giving priority to substances deemed to cause problems for environmental health and drinking water and refusing to allow any degree of indulgence on this issue. Businesses that do not submit the dossier by the prescribed date shall obviously not have their dossiers evaluated, unless it appears to be easy to fulfil the requirements of the directive. Lastly, we call for a regular report on the progress made with the evaluation programme to be submitted to the European Parliament and the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission – and this is what the Committee on the Environment desires – is also due to submit a proposal for the revision of<span class="bold"> </span>the 1991 Directive before the end of 2003. Why do we need this particular proposal? The Commission itself is proposing this, therefore we can only support it and add what I believe to be appropriate comments. We have noted serious lapses in the process. In particular, I do not believe it is sufficient to evaluate active pesticides: we must also evaluate metabolites if necessary, in other words, the decay products, which can be more dangerous than the basic substances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment also supports the introduction of comparative assessments and of the substitution principle which will result in encouraging the emergence onto the market and the use of substances with the lowest toxicity; the more toxic substances will therefore be withdrawn. Furthermore, new criteria – there have been considerable developments in the space of ten years, and even more so in the last two – must be taken into account. These include the lack of evidence relating to endocrine disruption – back in 1991, no one spoke of endocrine disrupters but since then, this has become an important subject in environmental policy – or the specific effect on the health of children and foetuses, as well as the synergistic problems related to exposure to several pesticides.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, ladies and gentlemen, I urge you to support the report by the Committee on the Environment, and I should also like to draw your attention to a particular point, namely item 14 of the resolution, which calls on the Commission to publish, before July 2003, a new proposal for a directive establishing a programme for a reduction in the use of pesticides, similar to the one introduced in some Member States. I feel that the Committee on the Environment is right to support this proposal which aims not only to bring the 1991 Directive to a successful conclusion but also to reduce the use of pesticides, which is certainly a very good way of reducing the risks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are 834 substances still to be evaluated. The Commission is trying to be realistic, and it does of course have our support, but I think that its position is optimistic, as in the previous period less than one hundred substances were analysed.</p>
<p class="contents">I am going to highlight the most important points for the Group of the European People’s Party: first of all, we must retain the possibility of essential uses, as it could be traumatic for some farms and regions if they were to disappear. We should retain and support those amendments in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I cannot share the thinking that the substances are harmful in themselves, as it depends on the concentration, the situation, and how they are used. Our objective should therefore be the smallest risk, which does not mean the smallest quantity.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the preliminary evaluation should under no circumstances be conducted by industries, NGOs, etc., as proposed in an amendment that we do not support, but by those legally established to conduct it. However, the industries, NGOs, etc. should have access to all the information and can contribute studies and tests to the evaluations.</p>
<p class="contents">The new integrated farming policy that is emerging in the European Union has led to a considerable decrease in the use of plant protection products, for example in some farms such as extensive arable farms. The public has not appreciated this and is not sufficiently aware of it. The public is increasingly sensitive to the theories of environmentalists, which if they are upheld could lead to undesirable effects on biodiversity due to accumulation as a result of a lack of protection on small farms. This could cause serious problems in terms of lack of supply and dependency and could prevent us from seeking solutions for essential uses and lead us to establish parameters that are beyond the limits determined by analysis or to have plant protection products evaluated by interested NGOs. Interested in what, and why, I wonder? Technical evaluations are done by scientists and discussed between scientists.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the European Commission, the Commissioner and all of the political groups in Parliament to be responsible when voting and to take into account that, without agriculture, sustainable development is not possible. Perhaps agriculture can exist without sustainable development, but the reverse is not an option. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, the rapporteur, who, as I have said repeatedly, has done sterling work and receives unqualified support from my group for this, is quite right to criticise a number of those shortcomings in his report. For example, it transpires that it is not so much inherent characteristics as commercial interests that play a decisive role, that evaluation is limited to certain aspects of hormonal disruption, for example, and that effects on children are barely taken into account. However, the rapporteur has already been considering all these aspects for some time. We have to conclude that we have no guarantees whatsoever that substances that feature on the positive list are in fact really safe for the public and the environment. </p>
<p class="contents">We hardly have any choice but to go along with extending the evaluation deadlines, because only three percent of the substances have been evaluated to date. We do this, however, on a number of very specific conditions. As the rapporteur has elaborated on these extensively, I shall not repeat them here. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I do want to take this opportunity to make another point. The pesticides policy should not only focus on admitting substances regulated by this directive, especially since this directive is unable to stem the continuous increase in the use of, and dependence on, pesticides, and hence the presence of pesticide residues in water and food. </p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of important things to do, and I, along with many others, am waiting for the Commission to take the initiative. There is a wide range of instruments which we need to use at European level. First of all, the extra financial support for research into, and the application of, non-chemical pesticides must be greatly increased, both for integrated crop management and for organic agriculture. Secondly, compulsory training in integrated crop management methods and good agricultural practices is essential. Thirdly, the lack of information requires that a database accessible to the public be set up at European level as a matter of urgency. This database should comprise both sales and user information on all pesticides and their toxicological characteristics. Fourthly, a VAT level must be set which is harmonised at European level. It should be harmonised, Commissioner, but at a sufficiently high level. This currently fluctuates between 23 and 25%, and we need to do something about this. Furthermore, we need special taxes on external environmental costs related to products and product prices. And last but not least: reduction programmes must be set up at national level which must curb the use of, and particularly dependence on, pesticides. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Blokland (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, more than 10 years ago, Directive 91/414 concerning the authorisation, use and control of plant protection products entered into force. Admittedly, it was clear beforehand that the implementation of this directive would be a complex task, but you will agree with me that the fruits of 10 years of labour are very disappointing. Indeed, less than four percent of all active ingredients that need to be assessed have fully undergone the procedure. At this rate, the task will not be completed until the 22nd century. </p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it appears that a number of important assessment aspects have been overlooked. The use of additives which boost the effect of plant protection products springs to mind. For example, agriculture in the Netherlands adds 1 500 tonnes of chemical additives to 3 600 tonnes of pesticides annually, the effect of which on the public and the environment is unknown. In addition, an assessment criterion for drinking water originating from surface water is lacking. Practice has shown that the pursuit of the sustainable production of drinking water is hindered by the lack of sustainability in the use of plant protection products. These are just two examples illustrating that the present Community framework for plant protection products leaves something to be desired. </p>
<p class="contents">Given the current state of affairs, we are unfortunately forced to extend the evaluation deadlines for plant protection products. Only in this way can we get the difficult process of the past 10 years back on track. I should like to bring three important points to your attention. </p>
<p class="contents">First of all, harmful substances must be phased out as soon as possible, with the time when the new period sets in applying as the latest date. Further delays are, in my view, highly undesirable. Secondly, we must exercise restraint when granting exemptions. Thirdly, we must ensure that the conditions we have prescribed for extending the assessment periods are actually observed. Herein lies an important monitoring role for Parliament. In short, I call for consistent action when it comes to authorising, using and controlling plant protection products within Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">I have to get something off my chest with regard to the Dutch translation of the word 'protection'. This is sometimes translated into Dutch as ‘gewasbescherming’ – with good reason, and the interpreters have been using that word repeatedly this evening – but the agenda also mentions ‘gewasbestrijdingsmiddelen’ on one occasion, which is, of course, the exact opposite of ‘gewasbeschermingsmiddelen’. This mistake often occurs in the Dutch version of the Commission documents, as well as the document by Mr Lannoye, through no fault of his own, of course. I propose that something be done about this, and that we stop mixing up the terms 'onkruidbestrijding' and 'gewasbescherming'. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Whitehead (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur for the way in which he has approached this complex issue and his willingness to entertain a wide range of reservations across the Committee and where possible to approach these efficaciously; and also my colleague, Mrs Van Brempt, for her work on this. I have only time to deal with one specific area, and it does not in any sense detract from my belief that the effective regulation of dangerous pesticides must be a priority task of this Parliament, and, indeed, this Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">My reservations lie in the section addressed by Paragraph 13 of Mr Lannoye's report, where we are calling on the Commission to notify us by the end of this year of the measures taken to ensure that useful substances which have low toxicity levels, and appear on Priority Lists 3 and 4, which have not been notified because of a limited commercial interest, or of high evaluation costs, may be so evaluated with the help of an appropriate restricted data package.</p>
<p class="contents">Why am I so concerned about this? I am concerned because there is a danger that some products of high toxicity which have not yet been regulated or properly examined, are still remaining in the market, whilst others, which are of no conceivable danger and are very low on Lists 3 and 4, are going to be taken out of the market because those who produce them, and they do indeed in some cases come into the category of essential uses, are likely to be unable to produce the complex dossier needed to go through all of the processes initially set out in what, as the rapporteur says, has been an extraordinarily slow process.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to give the Committee one example of this: <span class="italic">ad hominem</span> arguments are always dangerous, but I have a producer in my own area who turned to a particular plant protection range of products because he was himself alarmed by the effect of dangerous pesticides as he had seen them. If I talk of things like Agent Orange, you will know exactly what I mean. Truly harmful substances.</p>
<p class="contents">He has produced a product, which I use myself, called Armilatox which is the only effective way of treating plant diseases like Honey Fungus. There is no way he could pay the estimated cost for the assessment of that product which is in a low toxicity range. It would be two or three times his annual turnover.</p>
<p class="contents">There has to be some way in which we could help people of this kind come up to the standard necessary, or at least present the relevant dossier over the period of time we now have. If we do not do that, we are flying in the face of all the statements in this House, not least by the rapporteur's<span class="italic"> </span>party, that we should help small businesses. We should not just help the big battalions who can, of course, accept all of the high evaluation costs. If we do not do that in this very important area, we will have failed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, I am grateful for the opportunity to discuss this issue here today. First, I wish to thank both Mr Lannoye and Mr Parish for their efforts in preparing the texts we have in front of us. I await with considerable interest the final text of the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">My intention in publishing the Commission's report in August last year was twofold. First, to ensure greater transparency. Second, to improve understanding of the evaluation process for plant protection products and the problems confronting the Commission in meeting the impossible deadlines under the present directive.</p>
<p class="contents">In the present text of the resolution, there are a number of statements and assertions with which the Commission would strongly disagree. I could provide in due course a comprehensive reply to the resolution after its formal adoption. As you will all know, although the Commission report focused on our progress to date in the evaluation of active substances, it also has one eye firmly on the future. We all recognise that all evaluations will not be complete by 2003. There are many reasons for this, these are dealt with in the report and many of you will be familiar with them.</p>
<p class="contents">I would mention in particular, the mismatch between the ambitious targets set in the directive and the resources available to the Commission to deliver on these targets. This situation requires us to seek agreement on an approach to be taken in July 2003 as regards those substances and there will be several hundred of them where evaluations have yet to be completed.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the directive delegated this decision to the Commission through the comitology procedure, we considered that the issue was of sufficient importance to request your agreement on the approach to be taken in relation to these defended substances in 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">I share the view that this work should be completed in 2008. However, I can commit to it only with the provisos that deadlines are respected and sufficient resources are made available by all partners in the process. We should also be aware that major new scientific issues might arise that would necessitate requests for additional data, thus delaying the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that needs to be highlighted is that the directive is now ten years old. It clearly needs to be improved. The preparation of the report has enabled us to reflect on how to effect these improvements without compromising the directive's principles. There are a number of areas where effectiveness could be improved and where problems that have arisen over the years could be resolved. Again, I appreciate your feedback in this regard and I envisage coming back with proposals to amend the directive later this year.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, we are organising a stakeholder meeting in Greece in July in preparation for the Greek Presidency and we would welcome both the presence of Mr Lannoye and Mr Parish at those discussions to make sure that Parliament has a voice even in our preparatory work. Similarly, pesticide residues are an important aspect of this area of work and we intend to bring forward proposals in the coming months to consolidate and amend the basic legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">An important point is that the forthcoming proposals will be under the co-decision procedure. This will allow Parliament a full say in the final content of the legislation which of course I greatly welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I recognise that there are many issues we could discuss and there are many points in the texts in front of us with which I could take issue, but I do not want to take up too much time, and I think that these issues would be better discussed when we propose amending the directive. It would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the impact of July 2003 when several hundred substances will be withdrawn from the market. This will include substances where there are few or even no recognised alternatives. Member States and farmers insist that this could create serious problems.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is sensitive to this issue and is working with the Member States to see how such problems could be resolved and minimised without compromising safety. However, I note that the present text suggests that any authorisations granted for essential uses should have strict conditions attached. I will be careful to report this view of Parliament to the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I recognise that there is some impatience regarding the adoption by the Commission of a communication on sustainable use of pesticides. This is in the final stages of our internal consultation procedure and will be available in time, I hope, to form part of your summer reading.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I appreciate receiving the conclusions of Parliament and look forward to coming to you with proposals for change later in the year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
