This ranges from a rather guarded expression of thanks for a great deal of hard work, to the offer of congratulations on the production of an excellent report. Were I in that situation on the present occasion, I could not in all honesty take the congratulatory line, for I believe the report to have some obvious shortcomings. That is not to say that it does not make very valuable points, or that there is anything in it with which I am in substantive disagreement. I am very grateful, too, to colleagues for the interest that they have taken.</p>
<p class="contents">My concern is two-fold: first, the extent of redundancy in the text – there may be circumstances in which repetition is used to good effect, but I do not consider that this is one of them; secondly, the range of issues covered – I believe that the European Parliament should be taking seriously all aspects of the lives of women in the fisheries sector and doing its best to address the problems that affect them. But the original intention of this report was to concentrate on the role of women’s networks and their potential to contribute to the socio-economic fabric of fisheries-dependent communities. We have mentioned two of the parallels between their situation and that of women similarly engaged in the agricultural sector and of the possibility of joint action on their parts. That focus has been lost. I find that unfortunate, since women’s networks are central to achieving the other objectives itemised in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I shall state quite simply and briefly what my own message to the Commission and Council would be: please give your encouragement and support to the creation and development of women’s networks, at both domestic and pan-European levels. Please also give your encouragement and support to their activities in diversifying local economies, in contributing to the development of the common fisheries policy and in providing a coordinated approach to tackling issues of common concern.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouragement and support, however, call for more than just a few kind words; they entail active assistance in accessing the necessary financial means and specific measures to remove all existing social and administrative barriers to women’s full participation and progress in all areas of the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, thank you for listening. I thank you, too, in anticipation of concrete actions to come. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the initiative of the European Parliament and share the rapporteur’s commitment to equal opportunities in the fisheries sector. I also share her opinion that the participation of women’s networks is particularly important in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next programming period, 2007-2013, the Commission will attach great importance to promoting the role of women in the fisheries sector. The proposed European Fisheries Fund reflects the Commission’s commitment to equal opportunities. The future fund is even more specific about the role of women in fisheries than the current Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance. The integration of the gender perspective is promoted during the various stages of implementing the Fund. We will ask the Member States to ensure that operations to enhance the role of women in the fisheries sector are promoted. The report under consideration calls on the Commission to provide active support for existing women’s networks and the creation of new networks.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very pleased to inform you that the European Fisheries Fund proposal will support specific actions like networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">For the next programming period, the Commission suggests including the actions relating to networking and the exchange of experiences among organisations promoting equal opportunities in the Member States’ operational programmes. This replaces our past approach of launching calls for proposals for innovative actions directly managed by the Commission. We believe that this option will have more added value than funding small-scale projects, which was the case under the innovative actions formula.</p>
<p class="contents">An ex-post evaluation of transnational projects for innovative actions was conducted in 2005. One of the main findings of the evaluation was that the operational programme projects were more highly performing than the innovative action projects. The evaluation also showed that the EU added value of the innovative actions, as well as the exchange of experiences and good practices were fairly limited.</p>
<p class="contents">In your report you called on the Commission to promote more vocational training and education specifically geared to the activities of women working in the sector. I am pleased to announce that the European Fisheries Fund’s new priority – the sustainable development of fisheries areas – will make an important contribution to these needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Support can be granted for the diversification of activities and the promotion of multiple employment opportunities for fishers outside the sector. Measures, such as the promotion and the improvement of professional skills, worker adaptability and access to employment, particularly in favour of women, are foreseen. The measures aimed at the diversification of economic activities, as well as education and professional training, will be of particular benefit for women in fisheries-dependent areas.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also shares with you the concern about the difficulty in recruiting young people in the fisheries sector. The sector suffers from a poor image with the younger generation and an effort has to be made to attract young people to join the profession. In this regard under the European Fisheries Fund, we are considering more incentives for young fishers, in addition to the measures already foreseen under the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance such as training, including training on health and safety, and the upgrading of professional skills. There will also be limited assistance offered under the EFF for first-time young fishers entering the profession. In addition, there will be increased possibilities for the participation of women in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">The new priority ‘sustainable development of fisheries areas’ will be implemented through a bottom-up approach. The local actors, including women’s associations, will be the motor in designing and implementing the local development strategies. This new approach is a further opportunity for women at local level to get involved in decision-making and to ensure that their specific concerns are taken into account in the local development strategies. Likewise, for the establishment of the National Strategic Plans, a wide partnership with all relevant actors, including women’s representatives, is foreseen. Women’s organisations should therefore give their input for the analysis of the trends in the fisheries sector and the development of a strategy for its sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and their representatives are also encouraged to participate in the regional advisory councils, which are the cornerstone of the ‘governance’ pillar of the reformed common fisheries policy. For instance, women’s associations already have a seat in the North Sea RAC, which was the first to be created as a result of the common fisheries policy reform in 2002. Women are also represented in the North Western Waters RAC.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, following the conference on the role of women in fisheries organised in January 2003, I am pleased to inform you that the Commission is planning to organise another conference on equal opportunities in 2006. This conference will take stock of the situation of women in the fisheries sector and reflect on ways further to improve the situation and make further progress. I hope that the views of this Parliament will also find reflection in the proceedings of the conference.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to underline the Commission’s determination to attribute great importance to equal opportunities in our policy. However, in order to make equal opportunities a reality, all policy-making levels need to take responsibility: the Commission, and national as well as regional and local levels. Your own commitment to this objective will assist in keeping and furthering the importance given to equal opportunities at all levels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Although just 3% of people employed in extractive fishing are women, women do participate actively in all the other activities relating to fishing. As a result of their invisibility, many women working in the sector do not enjoy social and economic rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We would therefore call upon the Commission, together with the Member States, to take the necessary measures to guarantee fully the rights of these women.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that they should have access to professional training, to funding and to credits under the same conditions as men. It is also necessary to increase the participation of women in decision-making processes, and therefore a recommendation from the Commission to the relevant bodies so that they take the necessary action in this regard would be very positive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to help women’s organisations and networks, and we therefore welcome the Commission’s commitment to carry on actively supporting existing ones and the creation of new ones, since they are absolutely essential tools for the exchange of information and for good practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I must not end without mentioning in particular shellfish gatherers, the majority of whom are women of over 50 years old whose health suffers directly as a result of their work and who in many cases do not have the right to unemployment benefits, to health services or to job security.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow groups such as this to carry on with so little protection and, as a member of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality, I would call for greater recognition of the work of women in the sector and that we provide solutions to the problems resulting from this work without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am proud to be able to say that, over recent years, the fisheries authorities in my region have paid particular attention to the role of women, promoting ― and indeed calling urgently for ― the creation of associations and unreservedly supporting the integration of those associations into the existing networks, and arranging international forums and conferences to strengthen them and create new ones, with a view to the exchange of knowledge and experience amongst women from all parts of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The results are spectacular, particularly with regard to making women themselves more aware of the economic and social importance of their work, moving on from seeing their role as one of supporting the family economy, which had traditionally fallen to them, to demanding the compensation to which they have a right as workers: better salaries, social benefits and training.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Attwooll accurately illustrates the role that they have played and the role that women’s networks may yet play in this field and calls upon national administrations and the Commission to continue providing and intensifying their support. For all of these reasons, our political group supports the fundamental points of this report and hopes that the plenary of this Parliament will support it as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that we can see from reading this report that women’s networks play numerous roles in fishing areas and could play a greater and better role in the future. It is important to make the extremely important work carried out by women in this sector more visible and thereby to ensure that these activities are better valued and remunerated since, in many cases — as has already been said — women work for nothing and sometimes without any social protection. We still have a long way to go.</p>
<p class="contents">The report also acknowledges the effort that the Commission has already made, holding the Conference on the role of women in the fisheries sector in 2003. We eagerly await the conference scheduled for 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">There is still a lot to do, however. I am therefore pleased to have noted a change of emphasis on the part of the Commissioner, and this is very necessary for women in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the measures that the Commission must take in order to support these networks must be aimed in four directions, which are indicated in the report: information, funding, representativeness and training.</p>
<p class="contents">A more exhaustive report must be produced. I agree with the rapporteur that the report on women’s networks does not impress us very much. An exhaustive report must be drawn up, which accurately reflects the situation of the existing networks, and their development must then be monitored.</p>
<p class="contents">Funding is required, since these networks are playing, and can play in future, more and better roles of public interest, from economic, social and also ecological points of view, and they therefore deserve funding instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The training that the Commissioner mentioned is needed. Aware of the important work done by women in the fisheries sector, the Commission should promote the education and training of young people in these activities so that they can take over this work in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been demonstrated, certain situations provide examples, such as the situation of the shellfish gatherers. I therefore believe that we must support organisations of women that form around networks, so that they can achieve and consolidate better living conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to announce that my Group is also going to support Mrs Attwooll’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also indebted to the Commissioner. It is not the first time that he displays great social concern in the fisheries sector. I should also like to thank him for the way in which he wants to actively involve all social strata within the fisheries industry.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is that so important? There are three points why it is vital that the scope of fisheries is widened to include factors other than economic ones. What is apparent to me from the shrimp crisis in my own region, and the role that VinVis has played in this, is that the women’s network has contributed towards a solution, and I have to conclude quite simply that it is very much to be welcomed that the fisheries sector is being broadened socially speaking.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that this network has now been given its rightful place in the regional advisory council for the North Sea. It is of particular importance, though, in the area of training, social position, and economic impact on the fisheries industry. If I consider the high fuel prices and a number of other factors which certainly have social implications within the fisheries industry, then I consider it to be a good thing that the women’s network, VinVis, but also other organisations, are given their rightful place.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, I was also very taken with the hearing which the rapporteur organised in July that involved a large number of women’s organisations, and I think it would be good if activities of this kind were also organised by Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I would once again like to thank the rapporteur for this report and I hope that the Commissioner will also follow up the recommendations. His response in this respect creates reasonably positive expectations to this effect, and I hope that we politicians will also ensure that all social strata within the fisheries industry are given their rightful place within the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We all know that women engaged in coastal fisheries are at a disadvantage, because their work in this sector is classified as supplementary work rather than as a profession. What is missing is the recognition of their work, at both a legal and social level. We need to support and to safeguard the social and economic rights of women in all sectors of the fishing industry: equal pay, pension rights, social security and access to public health services.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to step up efforts to implement policies which support initiatives to create women's networks throughout the European Union, especially in remote island areas. The development of these networks should not be based merely on voluntary or one-off actions. These networks must be institutionalised so that their role in the areas in which they develop can be strengthened and they can act as advisors and experts on the councils in their areas.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the full application of the principle of equal treatment and equal opportunities in the fisheries sector is concerned, I consider that we have fallen a long way behind. I think that the time has come for a bold decision, so that the contribution of women to the development of fisheries and of economic life in general is recognised. Let us not address women's networks merely with sympathy and understanding. Let us turn them into an important tool, which will promote fisheries policy, sustainable development and respect for the environment, ecosystems and man. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The traditional role of women in fisheries and the various modern forms of participation in the women's job market by areas with fishing activities were certainly strengthened decisively following the Commission conference in 2003 and the start of networking of this specific category of workers.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot but welcome the initiative by the Committee on Fisheries and, more importantly, by the excessively modest Mrs Attwooll, in drafting the report. I, in all events, as shadow rapporteur for my party in the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, thank her for including most of my committee's comments. All that remains, therefore, is for us to trust that the Commission will help at the new conference in 2006 to integrate a pan-European network of women engaged in fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Not only the European Fisheries Fund but also the Structural Funds and other programmes, such as FEMMES and LEADER, can become tools for special actions, in parallel to educational development and the development of professional skills, the development of adaptability, research programmes into the impact of restructuring in the fishing and farming industries, innovation in production and the promotion of consumption with environmental awareness and respect for biodiversity. It depends on these actions as to whether or not young boys and girls remain in fishing areas, so that traditions, with valuable, long-standing practices, can be maintained with new technology and can bring about added value for the European Union. However, added value will also come from maintaining everything provided for in Council Directive 86/613 and I would ask you, Commissioner, to address its extension to the fisheries sector. The application of the principle of equal treatment of men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity, including agriculture, and protection during pregnancy are important sectors and the Gender Institute being set up will have a role to play with special research into the matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The work of women is often invisible, and Mrs Attwooll’s report helps at any rate to bring it into the light.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries industry is a heavy industry, one with regrettably long working hours and also dangerous work. More women on the ships can help improve working conditions there. Work that is too heavy or dangerous for women is often detrimental to men too. In many sectors, it has turned out that, as soon as women joined their ranks, the working conditions improved. Greater involvement of women in the safety of ships is essential to make actual progress in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">A concern for sustainability is something else we can expect from women and women’s networks. Sustainable fishing is essential to provide future generations with fish. Sustainable catching methods with minimal bycatch and sound monitoring are essential. The quotas will be laid down this month, and it is very important to take the scientific recommendations into consideration; if not, future generations will be fishing behind the net, something of which women often bear the brunt.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be time to adopt fresh policy, to experiment with fish reserves for a few years, to put fish reserves on the map, or to give fish stocks the chance to recover. The maritime strategy that is now being prepared is an appropriate time to hold the discussion on this. I would invite everyone to involve women in particular in this discussion in all countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Women often trade in, and buy, fish. The viability of sustainable fishing is dependent on the full involvement of consumers, as also on the introduction of quality marks that guarantee quality and sustainability. It is good to involve women in this as much as possible. In short, like Mrs Attwooll, I have great expectations where women are concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I thank the rapporteur again for her report. I would also like to thank all the speakers for their remarks, for the determination they have shown on the subject of equal opportunities for women in fisheries, and for the proposals that they have made to the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">On women’s networks, let me state again that the European Fisheries Fund aims to support networking and the exchange of experience and best practice among organisations promoting equal opportunities. The European Fisheries Fund will also provide for educational and social needs in the fisheries sector, with particular emphasis on women.</p>
<p class="contents">Women’s networks in fisheries are already benefiting from Community funding under programmes such as EQUAL, and certainly this funding will be enhanced with the entry into force of the European Fisheries Fund. The focus in the fund on young fishers will also help in the field of equal opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">An important milestone in the reform of the common fisheries policy was in the field of governance through the creation of the regional advisory councils. I can only express the hope that women’s organisations will take up their place in the regional advisory councils in the same way as they have already done in two out of the three existing regional advisory councils. Participation in such governance fora will see benefits for equal opportunities at various levels.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point raised with regard to shellfish gatherers, I would like to point out that they benefit from assistance from the FIFG under the Spanish operational programme. I trust that such funding may also be requested by the Spanish authorities under the European Fisheries Fund and I am confident that the Commission can continue to support such activities. In fact, such an example can certainly be promoted further.</p>
<p class="contents">In conjunction with the Commissioner responsible for equal opportunities, I will do my utmost constantly to underline to Member States the importance of promoting equal opportunities in the fisheries sector. As I stated before, there will be another conference in 2006, following the conference of 2003. The purpose behind that conference is to take stock of the situation concerning equal opportunities in the fisheries sector and then to consider what further initiatives can be taken in conjunction therewith. I look forward to Parliament’s constructive contribution to that conference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
