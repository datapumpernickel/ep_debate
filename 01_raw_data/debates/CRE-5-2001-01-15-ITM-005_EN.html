<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Peijs (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, the European Commission tabled a proposal for a directive on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the reorganisation and the winding-up of credit institutions back in 1985. That so much time has lapsed, is largely down to the Gibraltar issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose of the directive is to ensure that a credit institution and its branches in other Member States are reorganised or wound up according to the principles of unity and universality. This means that the administrative authorities of the home Member State have sole jurisdiction in carrying out the reorganisation or winding up of a credit institution and its branches across the EU. This applies to all cases, except where Article 20 of this directive specifies otherwise. The aim of the directive is, thus, not to harmonise but to ensure equal treatment of all creditors and a consistent approach across the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I can completely identify with the thrust of this report. In tandem with the Council and Commission, I have tried to make a few improvements to this report in the shape of two types of amendment. The first type is related to the fact that the wording of the Council’s common position was not consistent with the existing insolvency directive and the directive on the winding up and reorganisation of insurance companies, which is to be voted on next week within the Economic Commission. This kind of discrepancy in directives which cover the same subject matter is unacceptable, unless there is a good reason for it.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I have taken great pride in rendering legislation on this particularly important subject matter as clearly and transparently as possible. All our amendments pertain to Article 20, which deals with the exceptions to the rule. Some amendments bring the directive into line with other directives, such as the insolvency directive and the winding up of insurance companies, as I mentioned a moment ago. These are Articles 20(1)(h) and 20(2). By means of Articles 20a to 20d, they are re-introduced in the report, but this time by using the same wording as in the other two directives.</p>
<p class="contents">The second type of amendment pertains to the deletion of a number of exceptions to the main rule. These exceptions had been worded in an ambiguous manner and were open to interpretation. Also, there was the risk, in the article on the regulated markets, that the exception was more comprehensive than the main rule. Despite this, the articles on regulated markets, repurchase agreements, netting agreements and debt renewal were included as such in the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first instance, I wanted to see these articles deleted. The only problem was that certain parties within the Council could not live with completely deleting these articles. For this reason, I have tried to reach agreement with the Council, and this was done at the eleventh hour last Wednesday. The compromise still prescribes the deletion of the three articles, but three other articles will be inserted instead. Broadly speaking, the compromise articles do not prejudice legislation of the Member State to which the contract pertains. These articles also clarify that the bankruptcy rules of the home Member State of the credit institution in question are not prejudiced. That means, therefore, that if contracts are concluded with regulated institutions, the proceeds from those contracts are still included in the estate. That is what this is about, and that was the reason behind my original proposal to delete.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything is now spelled out loud and clear, everyone is happy and I am delighted that, by joining forces, we have probably avoided a lengthy conciliation procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are thus tabling two types of amendment. One type is introducing harmonisation with respect to other directives, the other deleting a number of exceptions. I hope from the bottom of my heart that this legislation, which I believe Parliament has upgraded in terms of quality, will never have to take effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Villiers (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, the main points of controversy in this report concern three different types of contractual agreement, namely repo agreements, netting agreements, and contracts conducted on a regulated market. As Mrs Peijs' report outlined, these types of contracts were discussed in committee pending this debate and, in essence, what we are seeking to do with the compromises proposed by Mrs Peijs is to ensure that parties can choose their own contract law in relation to these particular contracts, but not their own winding-up proceedings law.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a separation here between the law of the contract and the external insolvency law, because it is quite important to ensure that parties, though they may choose the law of contract, may not actually choose their own insolvency law.</p>
<p class="contents">Now a problem arises concerning the interaction between the law of contract and insolvency law. What we are trying to do is to ensure that the contract operates and whatever proceeds are left at the other end are then dealt with according to the insolvency law of the home State. There is still one slight uncertainty in the text about what happens with regimes, for example, in Spain which have insolvency proceedings which kick in before the contract law actually takes place. In essence, these are known as automatic stays and mean that in certain countries, such as Spain, I believe all contracts are suspended automatically by an insolvency proceeding. I applaud Mrs Peijs' work in reconciling what looked fairly irreconcilable and coming up with a solution that favours home State control which is preferable in terms of the internal market, but I have some anxiety that there will still have to be some fine-tuning.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will not have to have a third reading, but we may have to just to make it absolutely clear that these automatic stays would not affect netting contracts, repo contracts and contracts in a regulated market. I would appeal to the House that in some ways it is more important to get a clear answer than to get one that suits everyone; one that is absolutely perfect in every respect. Because with a clear answer people can arrange their transactions around the framework that we have set up. It is vital to do that. I applaud the work that Mrs Peijs has done and I hope that we have finally sorted this issue out. I just have certain worries about the automatic stays and suspect that we might need some fine-tuning at a later stage.</p>
<p class="contents">The other controversial issue involves right in rem and the difference between the common position and the tidying up operation that Mrs Peijs has done, and this is something we have discussed at length. In essence, there is a lot of common ground between what the Council proposes in the common position and the alternative wording that Mrs Peijs has proposed. I am inclined to think, in view of the uncertainty, that it may well be worth sticking to the common position on that particular issue, because of the potential threat that it might pose to the mortgage bond market. This is not a strategic interest to me as a British MEP, because it does not affect the British market in any way – it is much more important for the Danish, the Austrian and the German mortgage market.</p>
<p class="contents">I would congratulate Mrs Peijs on her work. It is a very good report. There are still one or two small points of controversy in it, but she has done an excellent job. I apologise for the confusion we have had in committee over the voting and I am glad that it has all been resolved now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Skinner (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I do not feel that I will need the full five minutes, hopefully this will allow you to speed up proceedings tonight. I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Peijs as rapporteur on this report which, as Mrs Villiers has already outlined, has been extremely complicated. The issue has long been problematic, mainly because of the national differences at governmental level, rather than the issues directly originating from Parliament, but compromises produced in Parliament have been both efficient and expedient in terms of their approach and are very welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">In an effort to provide for equal treatment across the EU, the principles of unity and universality are the central pillars, of course, of this report, and coherence and consistency are therefore attained.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly the rights of creditors in Member States other than their own are safeguarded by the assurances of cooperation between the relevant authorities in the Member States, but let us be clear, in case some of you have not read the document, this is not about harmonisation, it is about mutual recognition of Member States' reorganisation measures and winding up procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament's success in introducing substantial changes in the original proposal is important. There are many in Parliament who feel the issues here are of real concern since they all concern the safeguarding of European citizens' interests and rights; indeed this report helps clarify many of the elements, such as the deposit guarantee scheme. But, of course, many of the changes in the common position which finally came back to us have to be welcomed, as they reflect many of Parliament's concerns, although some work has still to be done.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore sensible for Parliament, whilst accepting the improved document's intentions, to reimpose our priorities from the first readings but to organise and also clarify the suggestions emanating from this text. Amendments Nos 1 and 2 bring the text into line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals which had already been agreed last summer: this confirms Parliament's desire, therefore, to see a degree of coherence in this matter. I also see great strength for creditors in Amendments Nos 3, 5 and 6 while recognising that other national delegations, especially in my group, may have other concerns in this area. But I personally offer my support to the idea of bringing this directive in line with the insolvency regulation and the insurance winding-up proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to me that, finally, in the remaining amendments, following in the tradition of tidying up texts for the purpose of clarification, Parliament's rapporteur has maintained the type of quality we have come to expect from experienced Members. Whilst issues such as netting seem to have been slotted in as an extra series of amendments, what we have here is a workable document nonetheless, capable of securing support in the House and provoking serious discussion within the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A uniform procedure is at last to be established and there is to be coherence between the reorganisation procedure and the insolvency regulation. We would do well to stress that the provisions on protecting creditors’ rights, in particular, are of crucial importance here, since they establish the principle of providing creditors with information, as well as the conditions governing payments made to them. In this way, all creditors, including those in countries other than the home Member State, are guaranteed equal treatment under the winding up procedure, and a consistent approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the text in its current form is absolutely excellent, some clarification is needed. Thus, for example, the all-important principle of universality was strengthened by a series of amendments in committee, and several areas of incompatibility with the provisions relating to financial conglomerates, and which could lead to legal uncertainty, were ironed out. You will already have noticed in the course of the debate that we differ on one point, specifically in relation to Amendments Nos 3 and 5. The close correspondence between the reorganisation and winding up of credit institutions and insurance companies is not desirable for all aspects. Opinion differs on this because we believe what we are talking about here are different products, and sometimes different markets, and that different products and different markets should be treated differently, and not automatically the same.</p>
<p class="contents">The common position is well-balanced to my mind and was improved on, to some extent, by the committee’s amendments and those tabled by the rapporteur, Mrs Peijs, whom I would like to thank. The text ought, therefore, to be adopted without delay and transposed by the Member States. I regret that the dispute in the Council has led to this being delayed by more than a decade. I would point out that the Commission’s first proposal was published as early as 1985 and Parliament’s first reading was held back in 1987. The reason I stress this is because we constantly discuss the balance between the European institutions in our debates – particularly in the wake of the Nice European Council – and in many cases discuss how the procedures ought to be accelerated. This does not just apply to Parliament, which is often the impression given in the public arena, although we would, of course, do well to consolidate and accelerate quite a few procedures of our own too.</p>
<p class="contents">But this is not about apportioning blame. However, doubtless the opinion-forming and decision-making process in the European Council offers the best bet for accelerating the procedures between the European institutions. That has been made crystal clear again here.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission proposal is designed to ensure that a credit institution and its branch offices in other Member States can be reorganised and wound up according to the principle of unity and universality. That is guaranteed under this proposed directive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, the market and national authorities have been looking forward to the directive on the reorganisation and the winding-up of credit institutions coming into effect for some time now. This directive, in fact, aims to provide a guarantee with regard to the regulations which, in an organic manner and in a way which is specifically tailored to the sector, govern the institutions, the assets, the rights and business relations when a bank, which is active in different EU Member States, gets into difficulty or goes under. This directive spearheads the action plan for financial services.</p>
<p class="contents">In its common position, established by qualified majority, the Council displayed a discerning and keen insight into the specific characteristics of the banking sector which set it apart from the rest, both in terms of the insolvency procedure in general and compared to other financial sectors, such as the insurance business and the stocks and shares industry. This is why Article 20 of the common position grants the banking sector special treatment on a number of scores. This special treatment does not in any way prejudice the harmony and logic of a set of rules for the financial services as a whole. Quite the reverse, in fact; it does justice to the specific characteristics of banking, thus giving a better guarantee for stability and legal certainty.</p>
<p class="contents">The report by Mrs Peijs, on which I would like to congratulate her on behalf of the Commission, and in respect of which I would like to endorse the compliments extended by Mrs Villiers and Mr Skinner, which welcomes the common position for the most part, proposes a number of amendments to Article 20, as was explained earlier this afternoon.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can approve the purport of these amendments, barring one. It objects, at least in principle, to Amendment No 1 with regard to repurchase agreements. After all, it is of key importance that the banks know in advance what legislation will govern repurchase agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">As it happens, Mrs Peijs, on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, has tabled five new amendments. These amendments draw the amendments adopted by the Economic and Monetary Commission together in a coherent manner which does justice to the special position of the banking sector. Under a different guise, the new amendments take into consideration the specific requirements which are prescribed in the banking sector with regard to netting agreements, repurchase agreements and agreements and transactions within regulated markets. The Commission can go along with the spirit of these amendments, as is apparent in its explanatory statement. If the five new amendments are adopted by this Parliament, the Commission can assent to the spirit of all amendments proposed in Mrs Peijs’ report, including Amendment No 1. However, the wording of all amendments – and I am also making this point in response to comments made by Mrs Villiers – would then have to be adapted in order to guarantee the compatibility and consistency of these amendments with Article 20. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
