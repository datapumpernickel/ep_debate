He has asked me to present the report on his behalf and on behalf of the committee.</p>
<p class="contents">The Fiscalis programme has demonstrated its effectiveness as an instrument for the promotion of mutual understanding between the European Union's tax officials and it is therefore the committee's view, and that expressed in the Commission proposal, that it should be continued. We have, however, tabled seven supplementary amendments. The committee gives its unreserved support to the Commission's proposal that the programme be proceeded with for a further five years. We consider this a matter of urgency in view of the difficulties confronting the European Union in its attempts at preventing tax discrimination and tax fraud in the internal market, as mutual understanding and greater cooperation between the various tax authorities is of vital importance not least because of the difference in competences between internal market legislation and tax law.</p>
<p class="contents">What are this programme's objectives? Firstly, the efficient operation of the internal market, which is substantially impaired by tax evasion, which damages legitimate business, has a detrimental effect on employment and undermines trust in the Community's tax systems. That requires effective monitoring and measures to combat fraud. We need a network of tax administrations working together as if there were only one European tax administration, and this programme also contributes towards achieving the Lisbon objectives. We also welcome the innovations in comparison with the old programme, which was a successful one, in the shape of the Commission proposals, chiefly for the increase in operational expenditure from EUR 40 million to EUR 56 million.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the programme's scope, which formerly covered the treatment of indirect taxes, has been extended to officials dealing with direct taxation. We also welcome its clearer alignment and extension through the programme's objectives being directly linked with those of other Community policies in the field of taxation. Let me also say that we think it right for the programme to be open to candidate countries, as that already facilitates participation in seminars and exchanges and as administrative cooperation is very much of the essence in preparing the accession process and to make adjustments to regulations as and when necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' amendments relate mainly to the following areas. Firstly, we hold fast to the view that finance after 2006 will have to be agreed to by the Budgetary authority; secondly, that the EU is in urgent need of a VAT system based on the principle of taxation in the country of origin, and that the direct taxation field needs increased awareness of Community policy in this area as well as of other Community policies and general principles of Community law affecting the taxation of individuals and of enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">You will find, in addition to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' seven amendments, an amendment by the Liberals and another by the Greens accompanying the reports from the Commission and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and serving as bases for discussion. What is crucial is that we include the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs' amendments in the Commission's programme, for that is the way we have taken, and it is the right one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We do not support the extension of the FISCALIS programme to cover direct taxes, in particular income tax and capital tax. These are areas which should remain a matter for the exclusive competence of Member States. The right to tax citizens is one of the hallmarks of a government. Increasing EU involvement in taxation could spell the death of the nation state. I know the response will be that this is just a technical scheme to exchange information and run seminars for tax officials, but I say it is one more step that takes the European Commission and the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Prodi himself recently stated, very high political ambitions have often been achieved in the EU as a series of small, almost technical, steps. I suggest that this is happening with tax, in the numerous different tax initiatives and ways in which the European Commission and the European Union are seeking to enlarge their competence over areas of tax.</p>
<p class="contents">I reject the technical steps that take the European Union closer into the tax affairs of Member States, just as I reject the ultimate objective of allowing the European Union to levy taxes on individuals in the European Union. Democratic national governments should levy taxes. Undemocratic supranational organisations should not. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has allowed knowledge to be disseminated and it has added to the experience of those who participated in the programme. It has definitely helped the fight against fraud and in doing so has improved the workings of the internal market. It has allowed officials to adopt new administrative practices and cooperate more with each other. All of these things have been very beneficial since 1998. It has also improved mutual understanding of Community tax law on indirect taxes such as VAT and excise taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">There have been exchanges of officials from the EU Member States, seminars on indirect tax issues of common interest, multilateral control of excise duties, development of common professional training across the European Union, including improving audit skills for the officials concerned, and, significantly, development of language training. There has also been funding for the maintenance and development of communication and information systems and schemes.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we are enthusiastic about the Fiscalis programme and believe that it has been very successful and that it should be continued, but only in its present form. It should also be extended, but only in its present form, to the candidate countries, which could benefit very much from this programme for the objectives and the kind of things that the Fiscalis programme has been carrying out. They could certainly benefit from implementing the necessary legislative, organisational, administrative and technical measures in the programme as it exists at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">I have stressed the notion of the programme as it exists at the moment because I agree with Mrs Villiers that the Fiscalis programme should not be extended to direct taxation. Unlike value added tax, there is little by way of a shared body of knowledge of direct taxation across the EU Member States and different Member States impose indirect taxation in very different ways. The fact needs to be borne in mind that the Fiscalis programme as it stands has not really been properly evaluated yet and it would not, therefore, be a good idea to carry it forward on this basis. The programme as it stands at the moment has been a success. It should be continued in its present form and we should not extend it beyond its current boundaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In a poem, the Swedish Nobel Prize winner, Erik Axel Karlfeldt, writing at the turn of the nineteenth century, highlighted five dangers in life: sheriffs and their constables, alcohol, women and the Devil. ‘First comes the sheriff with his hard and overbearing ways; he’ll rob you of inheritance, prosperity and farm.’</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that taxes have a special role to play in my own country, in which we have the world’s highest taxes, doubtless does not surprise anyone. It is not, however, only in Sweden that the issue of taxes, particularly at EU level, is difficult to deal with. There is also anxiety that, as Mrs Villiers and Mrs Honeyball pointed out, the next step after the common exchange of information might be the harmonisation of taxes, including direct taxes.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party are not prepared to allow the EU to decide about direct taxes. What, of course, we can appreciate, however, are the advantages of, and need for, greater cooperation within that area too. It is a question of increasing tax officials’ understanding of the Member States’ tax systems and the fact that, for example, one country might wish to reduce its high taxes; it is a matter of raising the level of training and, in that way, improving the way in which the tax system operates in the internal market; and it is about combating fraud, promoting developments in the computer field and ensuring that the candidate countries are fully involved.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore support the Commission’s proposal and the report by Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, we endorse the rapporteur’s observation concerning the VAT system and country of origin principle and we also support the amendments by the Committee on Budgetary Control.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to emphasise how important it is for issues concerning personal privacy and the use of personal data to be dealt with in accordance with existing EU and national regulations. That is important, especially in the area of tax. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that the report, and the programme, have forgotten the fiscal competences of certain regions that the Lamassoure report, as you will recall, terms ‘regions with legislative competences’ and ‘constitutional regions’. In fact, these are often nations that are already highly restricted by their own legal framework. This is the case of my country, Catalonia. With regard to taxes, situations can obviously differ. Thus, the Basque Autonomous Communities possess real power. The Catalan Autonomous Communities, meanwhile, do not have as much. In any case, all these political bodies would like to be able to establish direct links with the Commission. They would also like to be able to participate in Council meetings when their competences are at stake. The amendment we have tabled is along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Santos (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, tax evasion and fraud are, unfortunately, common features of the tax systems of all European countries. Tax fraud and evasion take on a specific national dimension for each country, in line with its culture and varying according to the degree of citizenship felt in that country. They also have a supranational dimension, however, based on the use of sophisticated techniques and schemes for getting around the law. It clearly falls to each country to adopt appropriate measures for eliminating tax evasion, although some of the stimulus for this must also come from Community policies. In Portugal, for example, we know, as a result of studies of unquestionable scientific merit, that more than 25% of potential tax revenue is lost every year. Consequently, recovering around one-third or EUR 4 billion of this tax revenue would be enough to ensure that we easily meet the objectives set in the Stability and Growth Pact and, not least, balance public finances in 2004<span class="italic">.</span></p>
<p class="contents">This is leaving aside, obviously, the social damage caused by the injustices and inequalities – in other words, the iniquity – that such a permissive tax system allows and encourages. In this context, all the Community measures favouring this effort, and specifically the continuation of the Fiscalis programme, which has been updated and strengthened under the proposals put forward by the European Parliament, which also apply to the candidate countries, are correct, welcome and are measures that we can support.</p>
<p class="contents">Tax evasion and fraud also have a supranational dimension, however, and in order to combat these practices, harmonising technical approaches or standardising administrative procedures, although important, are not sufficient. We must move resolutely towards achieving legislative harmonisation itself. Economic and Monetary Union means all countries sooner or later having a similar and harmonised tax model. Although steps forward and progress in this field (sufficiently supported by common policies, which would entail various concessions being made) must be cautious and gradual and this policy must be formalised in accordance with the objectives set for Europe at the Lisbon Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">In accepting the renewal of the Fiscalis programme as a crucial instrument for the efficient functioning of the internal market, the European Parliament must also give a clear indication that this will simply be the other side of the coin of the requirements for economic competitiveness and financial consolidation that we so often demand – and rightly so. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Before the Commission decided to propose the Fiscalis 2007 programme, it evaluated the activities and the results of the existing Fiscalis programme. That evaluation was based on Member States' reports on their experience with that programme. The evaluation indicated that Member States viewed the programme as being an essential tool in fostering administrative cooperation between administrations responsible for indirect taxation. Accordingly, the Commission decided that the existing programme activities should continue to be funded by a Community programme.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also felt that it was necessary, particularly taking into account the conclusion of the Council's ad hoc working party on tax fraud, to propose the extension of the programme to direct taxation. That will mean in future that direct tax administrations will have a tool to help them to work closer together in a manner which has become second nature to indirect tax administrations by means of the Fiscalis programme. The Commission also believes that it is important to give as much support as possible to the countries preparing for the enlargement of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, candidate countries are put on an equal footing with Member States in this programme, which has special objectives to meet the needs of those administrations. I should like to add it is very important that this programme is adopted before the expiry of the current Fiscalis programme.</p>
<p class="contents">I and the Commission are therefore extremely pleased that this proposal is supported by the European Parliament. I particularly welcome the positive contribution of Mr García-Margallo y Marfil, the rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the fact that examination of this proposal is ongoing in Council and given the Commission's strong desire to have the programme adopted as quickly as possible, I believe that the most appropriate course of action at this time is for the Commission not so much to accept the amendments put forward by the Parliament. In particular, as regards the budgetary issues raised in the reports, Amendments Nos 1 and 2 appear to be counter to the agreements between our respective institutions on budgetary discipline and in substance do no more than repeat what is already found in the proposal as regards the programme's financial framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 3 and 4 go beyond the scope of the Fiscalis 2007 programme which is a purely administrative measure. Amendment No 5 is superfluous, because Parliament is already entitled to obtain the relevant documents. Amendment No 6 would interfere with the proper implementation of the programme. Amendment No 7 is superfluous because the decision already contains provisions on a regular follow-up of how objectives are achieved. Amendment No 8 is also superfluous because the present programme does not have any direct impact on local fiscal authorities and I say this in particular in answer to remarks made by Mr Mayol i Raynal.</p>
<p class="contents">May I say that I am personally confident of the fact that an agreement between the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission will be achieved on these issues. The Council has already started to discuss the proposal in detail. It will do its best to reach an agreement as soon as possible. Your support for the proposal is very important in achieving that result. I should like to thank Parliament for that support.</p>
<p class="contents">To reply in further detail to Mrs Villiers' remarks, the Commission believes that there are convincing reasons for the programme to be extended to direct taxation, not least because the Council itself, in its ad hoc working party's report, explicitly recommended improved cooperation in direct tax matters. I am very much aware, as perhaps Mrs Villiers knows, of the fact that direct taxation, except where it distorts the internal market, for example in the case of contributions to pension funds across borders, is very much a matter of national political preferences. That is a position I have often defended, both in the Commission and in outside discussions. On that point I agree with Mrs Villiers. But here we are talking about administrative cooperation and the basic issue is combating fraud. I am sure Mrs Villiers dislikes fraud as much as the Commission. Disliking something is one thing, doing something about it is another. If we want to do something about fraud in the area of direct taxation, we must facilitate cooperation between fiscal authorities. With all due respect to Mrs Villiers, I cannot escape the impression that perhaps she is looking at water burning if she objects to cooperation between the fiscal authorities in the field of direct taxation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
