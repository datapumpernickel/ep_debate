<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we needed the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster or the scientific reports that we recently received from ISIS about cod and the catastrophic state of this very important species of fish to see how urgent a reform of fisheries policy is. I think everyone who has eyes to see and ears to hear must recognise that our existing fisheries policy enables us neither to guarantee our fishermen and all those families that depend on fishing a future nor to create stable conditions that will allow our fishery resources to remain available for future generations.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there is no need to over-dramatise; the situation itself is dramatic enough. I believe that makes today’s debate crucial for the future of the fishing industry. We are debating several questions and several reports at once. I would like to begin by thanking all the rapporteurs, and also the person who tabled the question, for the reports because they give us an overall view.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to divide my contribution into two parts. First of all, I would like to speak mainly about the general aspects and then I would like to speak again at the end about the various tabled amendments and the Commission’s stance on those amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">I would, however, like to say a word about the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, ladies and gentlemen. It is a complete misnomer that this ship should be called <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. The consequences for fishermen, for mussel and oyster farmers, are indeed colossal and dramatic. We in the Commission are trying, with the means that are available to us, to help at least to avoid the worst and to get help to the stricken families as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has therefore set up a task force. It has already been to Galicia and has spoken with the people affected on the ground and with the authorities there. We are currently working on plans for aid programmes and we are ready to use all the statutory means available to us to see that the existing instruments are applied as flexibly as possible so that we can help those affected.</p>
<p class="contents">I contacted the Spanish authorities myself at the very start of this disaster and I am keeping in touch with those in positions of responsibility there, and since it now appears that France, too, will be more severely affected than was previously anticipated, the same principles will of course also be applied and the same assistance made available for France.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the ISIS reports were the most recent evidence of the dire straits our fishing industry is in. As you know, in October ISIS published the news that four of the Community’s cod stocks are close to collapse. One reason for this alarming state of affairs is that stocks were already low – and that does not only mean young fish; there are no longer enough adults either - another is the poor spawning last season, and another is that fish mortality is still too high.</p>
<p class="contents">The ISIS scientists have recommended – quite clearly and unambiguously – that in the absence of a recovery plan direct cod fishing should be discontinued for the next year in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, the waters west of Scotland, the Skagerrak and Kattegat. Fishing for haddock and whiting should also be suspended because too many cod are caught with them.</p>
<p class="contents">Reducing cod catches in the last few years has not been enough and unfortunately we now find that quota reductions have resulted in false returns being made and illegal fishing. The scientists have also pointed this out. It is not just an assumption by the Commission as many have claimed. The scientists have repeatedly warned that we should not only set quotas, but that we must also reduce the fishing effort so that we are able both to make better controls and to ensure that unwanted catches are not too high and that the total allowable catches are appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only quote them. The scientists say – they said so back in 1990 – we recommend that the fishing effort be limited because TACs alone cannot control fish mortality.</p>
<p class="contents">Twelve years later, ladies and gentlemen, we have still not put that recommendation into practice. Subsequently we presented the ISIS findings to our Scientific and Technical Committee on Fisheries, and it again recommended that we should adopt a recovery plan for cod as soon as possible, a plan which, apart from cutting TACs and quotas more than originally planned, must also reduce the fishing effort accordingly. In its opinion, that is the only way to do the one and avoid a moratorium.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Commission proposed a year ago that the fishing effort be limited as part of a recovery plan for cod and hake. To this day the Council has taken no decision on it, and the situation has got worse in the meantime. Parliament, however, gave its opinion on this recovery plan on 13 June this year.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation, the Commission has been weighing the various options that are available. We have decided against a moratorium, going instead for an improved recovery plan, precisely because we must take both the scientific findings and the difficult situation of our fishermen seriously.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, how is this different from last year’s plan? Firstly, in terms of catches the big reduction in the fishing effort means a total allowable catch in the North Sea for the Community and Norway of 16 800 tonnes of cod, 31 600 tonnes of haddock, 10 400 tonnes of whiting, 60 000 tonnes of plaice and 16 000 tonnes of sole. For the waters west of Scotland it means around 1 000 tonnes of cod and 7 200 tonnes of haddock, for the Irish Sea 1 200 tonnes of cod, 7 500 tonnes of haddock and 400 tonnes of whiting. Those are only some of the catches of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we propose a simplified system for the fishing effort, where we want to operate the effort not for each individual ship but for a group of ships. Thirdly, we have tightened up our proposal concerning controls. Member States will have to notify the Commission of the fishing effort on a monthly basis and ships must notify the controlling authorities when they change fishing zones.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also willing to fund further research work to help us find even better ways to rescue this fishery. That cannot, however, mean, ladies and gentlemen, postponing the necessary measures again. Our aim is to take a decision on this improved recovery plan together with the fisheries reform in December.</p>
<p class="contents">What does this all mean for our fishermen? I am aware that it means great hardship at first, unfortunately, I have to say, great hardship for those concerned. I am very much aware that livelihoods are at stake here. That is why we must not abandon the fishermen in this difficult situation. We have therefore also submitted a corresponding action plan in order to cushion some of the possible negative socio-economic consequences. I would like to pick out just three of those measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Member States are urged to adjust their structural programmes and provide additional resources for the fishing industry and areas dependent on fishing. Secondly, Member States can introduce targeted measures for small-scale, employment-intensive coastal fishing. They can, for example, reserve certain fishing grounds for small vessels or they can gear their programmes to the coastal fleet in order to preserve jobs in the coastal regions in particular. Thirdly, it is essential that the economies of the coastal regions be diversified.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I turn now to the other topics on the agenda today, firstly and in particular Mr Jové’s report. Our proposal in this connection is a new basic regulation for the common fisheries policy as the cornerstone of the reform. The four crucial elements of this basic regulation are as follows:</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, we want in future to manage stocks on a multi-annual basis. Applying an annual principle to fish is not consistent with fish biology; instead, we must make the biological cycles of our fish stocks the essence of our policy. To make management consistent, for those stocks where it is sensible to do so we want to manage the fishing effort as well as TACs and quotas. Note that I say where it is sensible to do so. That means not everywhere, and it depends primarily on the state of the stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we propose a new fleet policy. The ultimate objectives of the so-called MAP4 are to be the starting point for the upper limit. This upper limit can only change in one direction, namely a reduction in fleet size. Whenever a fisherman has his ship scrapped using public funds, the upper limit is reduced by the tonnage in question. This means we also need a system to define the ratio by which new vessels can be exchanged for old ones, provided that is done with private funds.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we propose closer surveillance of fisheries. Member States will have to coordinate their control activities and Member States’ inspectors will be able to make controls across borders. Satellite surveillance will gradually be extended to smaller vessels, and finally there will also be greater powers for the Commission concerning controls in the Member States. Only when everyone involved can count on his neighbour being subject to precisely the same controls as he is and to the same sanctions as he is if he breaks the rules, only then will there be justice and only then will people have confidence in the system.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we want the fishing industry to be more closely involved in decision-making in the regional advisory councils.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the Structural Funds. First, there is something I would like to make clear. It is not the case, as is repeatedly claimed, that the Commission is under a legal misapprehension because the Member States are legally entitled to continue using money from their structural funds for fleet renewal. The fact is that if the Council fails to find a compromise this December and does not reach a decision on reform, we will not be able to use any more money for fleet policy after 1 January 2003. That is the legal consequence of the Council’s decision of December last year.</p>
<p class="contents">This policy involves three specific measures. Firstly, we propose retaining those public aids that serve to improve safety, working conditions and hygiene on board. Secondly, we want no more aids for modernisation or the building of new ships.</p>
<p class="contents">In future we want these resources to benefit those who really need them; that means the fishermen, whom we must help financially so that they can diversify their activity and have a chance – if that is what they want – of getting out of fishing. In particular, this is aimed at the many fishermen who are in fact not far off retirement but are unable to retire because they still have loans outstanding with the bank, because their ships have not yet been paid for. Are we taking a social attitude if we continue to ignore that or pretend it is not a problem? I do not think so.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we propose that the aids paid up until now for the export of ships and for joint ventures should in future be used to reduce overcapacity. I am prepared to proceed differently for small vessels in order to help the many owners of small vessels in a different way because they are a source of much less pressure on fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the final proposal, namely the emergency measures for scrapping. We propose setting up a scrapping fund. That is an emergency measure. It is designed not as a long-term scheme but an emergency measure and is intended to help us restore a better balance between the sizes of our fleets and the available resources. The fund will add the resources for scrapping that are yet to be reprogrammed to the resources already provided in the structural fund for fisheries. These resources and the new fund will guarantee financial support for laying up fishing vessels.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two main elements to this. Firstly, a 20% higher premium, but with a time limit, for ships whose days at sea are cut by at least 25% and, secondly, an additional EUR 32 million available for scrapping in the coming year. We are also willing to talk if further resources are needed to help the fishermen who want it. Then we shall also have to find a way to do it.</p>

In any event, I would like to apologise to the members of the Committee on Fisheries because my speech is going to consist not so much of comments on the final result of the report – and I would like to stress that I have not presented any amendment to the final result of the vote in the Committee on Fisheries – but rather on the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with a proposal which presents various problems – several in my opinion – in terms of the lack of compatibility with the Treaties and elements of legislation. It is true that fish populations are experiencing difficulties and that it is necessary to adopt urgent measures.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that fishing should be sustainable and to this end it is necessary to preserve fish populations, obviously, but in the two-word term ‘sustainable development’, the two words are not dissociable and there must therefore be a balance: there must be fishermen and there must be regeneration of fish stocks. But it does not make any sense to talk about sustainable development, if we dissociate the two words.</p>
<p class="contents">I have the impression in this regard that the Commission is proposing an approach which prioritises, or basically only takes into account, the issue of the rapid regeneration of stocks and ignores the other facet of sustainable development. Its approach therefore, in my view, implies a greater social impact on populations dependent on fishing, which may lead to far-reaching structural changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Effectively, only the larger scale sections of the fleet would survive and the small-scale fleet, which generates most employment, would be heading for extinction. Therefore, the management and the recovery of stocks should take account of the social and economic impact of recovery plans. To this end it would be necessary, firstly, to improve the quality of scientific information and, furthermore, to introduce economic and social elements into the drawing up of recovery plans.</p>
<p class="contents">Only in this way, by adapting the speed of recovery of fish stocks, can we modulate and minimise the impact on the populations dependent on fishing. And I believe that the Commission has not been careful and my interpretation is that there has been an implicit weakening in its proposal by not wanting to strengthen the Technical and Scientific Committee on Fisheries which I personally believe should be strengthened. And naturally the focus of the multi-annual plans should be multi-specific, taking account of the relationship between species within populations, and plans involving just one species should be the exception in very serious circumstances.</p>
<p class="contents">In some respects the Commission’s proposal implies a de-communitisation of the fisheries policy, or at least that is how it appears to me. For example, it is proposed to empower the Member States to adopt emergency measures in fields of Community competence or in fields where there is already a Community mechanism in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has presented two difficult, complex and very restrictive proposals on, for example, cod fishing. I will take this opportunity to make the following very personal comment, which is perhaps my observation on what I have heard during this debate.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that there is a reduction in stocks going on. Furthermore, and this is very serious, the destruction of jobs has been much greater than that of resources, and this has happened in all the States of the European Union despite the exceptions, the protection measures and discriminations, some relating to access. I, who have not been excessively belligerent on this issue, am making this comment because now it is surely going to be necessary – let us pray that we can prevent the worst repercussions – to take tough measures which are always going to have most impact on the small-scale fleet.</p>
<p class="contents">This perfectly illustrates the need to change the approach of the common fisheries policy, because I believe that it is not the States but the fishermen who fish and it is necessary to adopt measures to safeguard the activity of the most sensitive sections of the fleet, of whatever nationality. And, although I imagine that this is an issue for the future, I believe that in terms of the allocation of catch quotas by type of fish and sections of the fleet, if we want to preserve the fishing regions and the sections of the fleet which create a lot of employment, we are surely missing a unique opportunity, perhaps allowing ourselves to be carried away by too many individual interests, which the Commission to a certain extent has encouraged.</p>
<p class="contents">I will not comment on other Commission aspects. I would like to thank my fellow Members for the debate, the President, Mr Stevenson, for handling this whole difficult issue, and express my group’s support for Mr Varela’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Stevenson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, could I first of all add my thanks to the rapporteurs, Mr Jové Peres and Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, for excellent reports, and could I also say to both of them, because they come from Galicia, that they have our deepest sympathy from the Committee on Fisheries on the unfolding tragedy in that area from the wreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. If the Committee on Fisheries can give any help at all, we will do whatever is necessary and find whatever help we can muster to aid the people of Galicia. Our heart is with them at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to speak about the cod crisis. As the House knows, in order to tackle dwindling cod stocks in the North Sea, the Irish Sea, to the west of Scotland and the Skagerrak, the Commission are calling for massive cuts of up to 80% on the cod and haddock fisheries and significant reductions in other parts of the white fish sector. Cuts of this magnitude would wipe out the white fish sector in the United Kingdom and Ireland and destroy many thousands of jobs in those countries, as well as in France, Scandinavia and the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I have seen the revised cod and hake recovery plan from the Commission. I have to say to the House that this is a radical change from the original cod and hake recovery plan that we considered and I believe that, under Article 37 of the Treaty, we have a right to be consulted in this House on these revised proposals. I hope that this House will support me in saying that we demand that right and that we intend to have our say and our full consultation will be called for on these revised proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">In the interests of enhancing this debate, I want to ask the Commission why they are prepared to accept the flawed and out-of-date scientific data on which they have based their call for these draconian cuts, because the ICES scientific data was collected in the year 2001, before stringent conservation measures were put in place, the benefits of which have not yet been measured. For example: the fishermen in my constituency in Scotland extended mesh sizes to 120 millimetres, they suffered the 12 week closure of 40 000 square miles of cod spawning grounds in the North Sea last spring, 170 vessels were scrapped under the latest decommissioning rounds, leaving many thousands of tonnes of fish swimming in the sea that would otherwise have been caught. And of course, parts of the Irish Sea have been closed for cod fisheries for the last three years, enabling cod stocks to recover. The impact of these measures has not yet been analysed by the scientists, nor has the possibility that rising temperatures, pollution or the North Atlantic drift may have contributed to the migration of cod further northwards towards Iceland and the Faroes where many thousands of tonnes of cod are regularly being caught. Indeed the same scientists who are calling for a minimum closure of six years for our white fish industry cannot guarantee that the cod will ever return to the North Sea even if we implement these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">As we know in the Committee on Fisheries, 10 years ago the Canadian government closed the Newfoundland Banks and there is no sign yet of the cod returning there. In their place, however, Canadian fishermen are finding huge stocks of snow crab and shrimps, which are netting them around four times the dollar income that the cod used to earn. I think a similar pattern is now emerging in the North Sea, where we are seeing large burgeoning populations of prawns, now one of our richest fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">Scientists have recently revealed that, just as the cod fish will eat prawns, prawns eat cod larvae. It may well be that, whatever draconian measures we take, we will fail to re-establish the cod. By the end of six years of intended closure, at the very minimum, such measures would be academic in any case because according to the most recent socio-economic impact study, up to 44 000 fishermen and ancillary workers would have lost their jobs. That is the kind of catastrophe they face this Christmas after faithfully adhering to the rules and regulations of the Common Fisheries Policy for the past twenty years.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the need for a sustainable fishery and the need to get fleet capacity into balance with available fish stocks, but I also recognise that a viable fishing industry needs fishermen to catch the fish. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These implications are to be presented in separate proposals and the Committee on Budgets will therefore examine them thoroughly at the appropriate time.</p>
<p class="contents">The sums forecast for implementing the reform, however, are fairly modest, and include, in Chapter B-II 90, ‘Support measures for the Common Fisheries Policy’: EUR 1 million to create a joint inspection structure, EUR 100 000 to create four regional advisory councils and EUR 1 million to improve scientific advice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets is in favour of these three actions under the reform and has approved the sums proposed, keeping them in reserve as proposed by the Commission, pending the definitive adoption of the framework regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets nonetheless considers that Parliament should be able to examine closely the detailed proposals presented by the Commission on each one of these actions, taking account of their repercussions, in particular on human resources, administrative spending and missions and Comitology meetings. I would like to ask the Commission to clarify one point with regard to improving scientific advice. The framework Regulation stipulates the sum of EUR 4 million; the Commission, however, in the preliminary draft budget, states that only EUR 1 million, held in reserve, will be allocated to this action.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we see that the Commission has increased this sum by EUR three million in comparison with last year. This amount, in addition to the EUR one million in reserve, could represent a general increase of EUR four million, as laid down in the framework Regulation. As this is not clear, however, my question to the Commission is this: is the EUR four million increase – three plus one – allocated to improving scientific advice, as stipulated in the framework Regulation, or on the contrary, will this action benefit solely from the EUR one million held in reserve? And in the latter case, what does the Commission intend to do with the EUR three million increase in the B-II 904 heading?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Mr Varela’s report, which concerns one of the main elements of CFP reform – reducing the capacity of the EU fishing fleet – the Committee on Budgets assumes, as it is bound to, that the Committee on Fisheries considers it necessary to apply scrapping measures. We therefore need to implement other less drastic, reversible measures, such as evaluating the number of vessels to which this measure would apply, and the Committee on Budgets is therefore only giving its opinion on the financial impact of scrapping.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft Regulation stipulates an initial sum of EUR 32 million for 2003, as a special incentive for cofinancing. It also calculates the total additional sums required during the 2003-2006 period to be EUR 271.6 million.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Budgets considers that financing the new action is incompatible with the maximum limit under Heading 2 of the current financial perspective and that it will therefore only be possible to make available the EUR 32 million already laid down for the 2003 budget by mobilising additional appropriations using the instruments provided for by the interinstitutional agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not just apply to cod and white fish. All the scientists are afraid that we are fishing most of our fish species to extinction.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to remember that, without fish, there would be no fishermen, there would be no economy and there would be no fisheries policy. What we are also in the process of losing is a very important coastal and fishing culture in almost all European countries, which is possibly the worst catastrophe as far as we are concerned. We cannot continue fishing in this way, however. We bear responsibility not only for those living today but also for the future of our children and our grandchildren.</p>
<p class="contents">In its decision, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy also addressed the fact that we rich Europeans buy – for considerable sums it is true, but still for small change – fishing rights from poorer countries. What are we really doing there? What are our plans for sustainability? What readiness is there to help the poor coastal fishermen on Africa’s coastline? Do we have the right to behave as colonially as we are actually doing when it comes to fishing agreements with developing countries? There are a lot of pretty words on paper, but what does it look like in reality?</p>
<p class="contents">We have fished ourselves into a catastrophe. For God’s sake, do not let us also fish the poor to the brink of catastrophe too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The largest reserve of fish and shellfish in Europe – and possibly even the world – is being ruined by an accident which we all had a duty to prevent. The scale of the tragedy we are facing is as yet unknown. The entire Galician coast, one thousand kilometres, is closed to fishing and shellfish-gathering. Scenery of unique beauty, national parks, the Natura 2000 network, the entire marine ecosystem and our great wealth of biodiversity have all been ruined.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a European problem, which requires a European solution. A Member State, and in particular a region, in this case, a disadvantaged, peripheral, objective 1 region that lives principally from the sea and associated industries – involving 54 of the 62 economic sectors contained in Community input-output tables – over 10% of the gross domestic product, such as tourism, etc., are significantly affected.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel impotent in the face of this situation, and we are asking Europe and the Member States for help. Help us, help the Galicians.</p>
<p class="contents">Last summer, when we saw the powerful State of Germany literally flooded by its overflowing rivers, we all joined forces to create a European Solidarity Fund. Here today, in the European Parliament, we are asking for this Fund to be mobilised as a matter of urgency in order to help Galicia. This is no time for legal pedantry; we must mobilise the Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to reiterate the statements made recently by the Galician Government: the European Union cannot merely be a dream of unity, but must also be a genuine source of solidarity that supports each and every one of its citizens at times of misfortune in any country, whether in the North, the South, the East or the West. Europe will become a reality when it is sensitive to the problems faced by its citizens. Let us all start working together, side by side.</p>
<p class="contents">We have created a European Maritime Safety Agency and we do not know where it should be located. Which European region is most vulnerable to maritime accidents? Which region has suffered the most accidents? Which region has the greatest natural fish and shellfish resources, that must be protected? Which region is most dependent on these resources? Which region could be the most aware and most motivated to welcome and work towards maritime safety? We in Europe must leave behind politics with a small ‘p’ and pointless discussions. Europe owes Galicia a debt. Galicia is the answer to these questions and Galicia must be the proposed location.</p>
<p class="contents">We are unashamedly promoting our shipbuilding industry and constructing double-hulled oil tankers that will ply the seas more safely, following the example of the United States. We are creating maritime corridors for dangerous goods, as France and Spain have already proposed. What we should do urgently and immediately is help those who have lost their livelihood and restore the environment. We should therefore make aid from all the Structural Funds more flexible and mobilise the Solidarity Fund. In the short term, however, we also need measures such as those that I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall end, ladies and gentlemen, with the slogan that thousands of Galicians adopted at a mass demonstration last Sunday: ‘<span class="italic">Nunca mais</span>’ [‘Never again’].</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Fischler, we will talk about this matter on Monday 9 in the Committee on Fisheries, since, as spokesman for the PPE-DE Group, I have asked for it to be included in the agenda. For now, I would ask and invite you to visit Galicia in order to see the situation for yourself, as well as how we have been affected by the disaster, in terms of both fishing and shellfish-gathering.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us now talk about fisheries reform. What we need to scrap, Commissioner, are not fishing boats, but old oil tankers. The <span class="italic">Prestige</span> has caused more damage to fishing than the entire European fishing fleet put together. Let us stop being hypocritical. When will we assess the damage caused to fishing by other activities? Why can a boat 12 metres long receive funding, while a boat of 13 metres cannot? Do you not know that the most serious problem is fishing in breeding areas? Both large and small boats can do that, and small boats may even be more likely to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">CFP reform would not require the use of funds; it would, however, affect access, but the FIFG was not specific, and certainly not across the board as the Commission claims. As your colleague, Mr Barnier, said – and this is written in black and white – you lack the legal and moral basis to reform the Structural Funds now. Why can the agriculture policy receive subsidies that represent 50% of the EU budget – and can receive them until the year 2013 – and, on the other hand, the subsidies that were supposed to be granted until 2006 for the CFP, which does not even receive 1%, must be withdrawn now? Are you forgetting the agricultural surplus? And yet, we have a deficit of fisheries products.</p>
<p class="contents">The fisheries sector is not asking for more money, but only the amounts that were promised, under the promised conditions. This is what we are asking for, with increased monitoring, as stated in the reports I am presenting to Parliament, with greater transparency, being fair to the Member States that fulfil the fleet reduction objectives and not treating them the same as those States that fail to meet their objectives. In 2004 or 2005, we will have to reform the Structural Funds. We shall see then whether all aid must be stopped. We must analyse the matter. If it stops, it will have to be stopped for all, but for now we want the plans laid down to be fulfilled, and we want the European Union to have a renewed, modern, safe fishing fleet in 2006. It is not a case of more fishing, but of better fishing, monitoring resource conservation by means of total allowable catches – which were designed for that purpose, as well as quotas and technical measures – selective fishing, biological recovery periods, the fishing effort, regulating days at sea, and also, with scrapping, but as an additional measure, not the only one, because it is the only measure that is irreversible.</p>
<p class="contents">With every boat we scrap, we are destroying jobs, and this must be taken into account. We must make the conservation of fish compatible with the conservation of fishermen, and at difficult times, such as Galicia is going through at the moment, and may go through in future, we must not increase the fishing effort, particularly not in Community waters; it is possible to cooperate with the development of third States while maintaining our employment and supplying our markets. That is the promotion of ship exports and the creation of joint enterprises. Unless this happens, we will be encouraging fishermen, at difficult times, to sign on with illegal fishing boats sailing under flags of convenience, which we must prevent.</p>
<p class="contents">I have therefore accepted my fellow Members’ amendments, which enrich my reports, in order to provide increased monitoring and greater transparency in fleet policy. I myself have tabled two amendments along the same lines, to make it clear that we are not trying to increase fishing capacity in any way, and which are also aimed at achieving coherence with development cooperation policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now just like, therefore, to thank all the Members who have worked on this matter and tabled amendments, for their cooperation. I would now like to say, not only as rapporteur for these reports, but as I said at the beginning, as a European from Galicia, to all those who do not fully agree with these reports, that I have tried to draft them as honestly as possible and with as much dedication as I could, which was a great deal, and ask them not to vote against these reports. I would be grateful if you would at least think about it and consider abstaining.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to thank and congratulate my colleague, Mr Jové Peres, on his excellent work in what were – as our chairman Mr Stevenson has acknowledged – difficult conditions, racing against the clock, with a certain amount of pressure and a great number of misunderstandings. Lastly, I would like to express my solidarity, naturally, with Mr Stevenson, over his oral question. Thank you all very much. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, Commissioner, in reality, the painful situation that my country, Galicia, is currently experiencing as a result of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> tragedy takes precedence over any other consideration. Contemplating the state of the Galician coast following the disaster, and the Galician people, in their sorrow, anger, bravery and concern, who, despite everything, are looking to the future, seems to me to be the best proof that Galicia, the north-eastern region of the Iberian Peninsula, is heavily dependent on fishing, and not only because 20% of its gross domestic product comes from fisheries and related activities. I would also like to reiterate all the requests made by the rapporteur, Mr Varela.</p>
<p class="contents">What I have just said relates to Mr Jové Peres’ report because the Galicians, in the face of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> disaster, are working courageously to mitigate the terrible social, fishing, economic and environmental consequences. I believe the three aspects are inextricably linked as parts of a whole. The proposal on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the common fisheries policy must be based on and committed to sustainable development and environmental protection. Both ideas are starting points, hinges, upon which the construction of CFP reform rests.</p>
<p class="contents">Sustainability would clearly be guaranteed if there were no development, but depending on the starting points – which are sometimes deductive and other times not well founded, but which, in all cases, are questioned or questionable – the solutions can vary, and in this, yet again, the work of the rapporteur, Mr Jové Peres, deserves to be praised for not over-emphasising across-the-board aspects, although these were important.</p>
<p class="contents">In this matter, the recovery we all want and are aiming for cannot rest on a single idea – the reduction, if not the disappearance of the fishing sector – because fishing is carried out by real people, human beings, family men, and for this reason alone we need to seek and find a balance between the consequences of limitation and means of conservation. One example would be the mechanism of temporary cessation of activity, restriction of fishing days, etc.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, a Galician newspaper this morning contained the following: ‘the European Fisheries Commissioner says that cutting off aid would mitigate job losses. The removal of state aid for the modernisation of boats will be positive, as it will contribute to maintaining jobs on-board boats’. In my opinion, given that the boat is not just the centre of work, but also the professional fisherman’s home, the brave workers fully deserve an improvement in their working and living conditions. Their dignity requires it and society, in particular the fisheries sector, has requested and expects this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For the first time, you have recognised that your staff can do something for my region. I hope that your task force has informed you that Galicia, has not only oysters, but also mussels and turbot, which make Europe the main world producer of these two species, thanks to modern, vigorous aquaculture companies, which have lost everything in the past twenty days.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope they have told you that our coastline is incredibly rich in biodiversity and that this biodiversity is not Galician, Commissioner, but European. We are now rich in oil and the lack of action by our leaders has struck a glancing blow to what we love most, our way of living.</p>
<p class="contents">The twenty thousand people who live from fishing in Galicia do not understand you very well. I have tried extremely hard to explain your proposals, trying to find common ground between you and my fellow countrymen. Since we have been told about this task force, who have not informed the Galician fishermen of any plans to visit, I would like them to present their conclusions to Parliament, here and now.</p>
<p class="contents">We have listened to the Commissioner for Transport, who, in the face of the total lack of activity by the Spanish and Galician Governments, has drawn up practical proposals in order to table them at the Council, so that we might address this disaster and prevent a reoccurrence. We have also heard measures proposed by Commissioner Barnier, who has shown himself to be sensitive and receptive and has agreed to appear shortly before the Committee on Regional Policy in order to explain to us how the Solidarity Fund can be mobilised.</p>
<p class="contents">Now it is your turn, Mr Fischler. Is it not time, Mr Fischler, for European fishermen in Galicia to hear more than just bad news from their Commissioner? So far, Galician fishermen associate your name – and this must be said – with the non-agreement with Morocco, fleet scrapping and a whole series of measures that might turn out to be good or they might not.</p>
<p class="contents">The Socialist Group has made a huge effort and has even held a hearing to discuss CFP reform, has published a leaflet and listened to the sector but, to say the very least, the measures are not explained well enough. All this, Commissioner, and this is my criticism of you, translates into a loss of European credibility, because your fellow Austrian citizens, as well as the Germans, will still remember the European response to the disaster you suffered due to floods, and I include myself in this European response, Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The European citizens of Galicia would like to receive exactly the same treatment. I cannot believe that, after a month of disaster, all you can say to us is that you have sent a task force. I believe it is now up to you, Mr Fischler, to tell your fishermen – because they are your fishermen, not mine; they are mine, but also yours, you are responsible for them – what they can expect from their Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not going to suggest visits, although I do not think it would do any harm if you were to go to Galicia. Tour operators are starting to think, as a way out, of offering disaster tourism, as we in Galicia are very fond of black humour. However, Mr Fischler, do you not believe it is now time to explain, in this House, in Parliament, here and now, what the European fishermen, the Galicians, can expect from their Commissioner at this time of disaster?</p>
<p class="contents">In Galicia we all know that we have two ears, one on either side of our heads, but what we did not know is that as well as two ears, we were going to have sixty thousand tonnes of oil on our beaches, and that today, in Parliament, we were going to be talking about what to restrict or deciding to prevent fishermen from continuing to deplete the sea’s natural resources.</p>
<p class="contents">All this, Commissioner, is Galician black humour, but it is also tragi-comedy. That is all I have to say. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reforms of our fisheries policy that we are debating this evening are very important. In particular, Mr Varela’s reports on public aid for the renewal and modernisation of the fishing fleet are very important. On behalf of my group, I would at the same time express understanding for Mr Varela’s statement concerning oil pollution along the Galician coast.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party supports the Commission’s proposals for reform, containing those elements necessary to our being able to adapt the Community’s fishing fleet to the ocean’s resources. We might well have been able to endorse maintaining public aid for the modernisation of fishing vessels if this would exclusively have improved safety and working conditions on board. We could also discuss aid for renewal if we were to make the aid conditional upon more capacity’s being withdrawn than added. Under no circumstances, however, can we accept a continuation of the present situation, in which the European fishing fleet is becoming larger and larger at the taxpayer’s expense.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the biggest problems for the European fishing industry is, specifically, that the fleet is too big. There are simply too many vessels for too few fish, and there are unreasonably large discrepancies between the ways in which the Member States have so far administered fisheries policy. To continue with this catastrophic policy, which will only exacerbate the problems and postpone the reform process which must undoubtedly take place, would be to pull the wool over the eyes of the fishermen. With regard to the proposed ban on cod fishing, we in the ELDR Group would like to support the conservation arrangements. We also emphasised, however, that, when such drastic measures for reducing the quotas are being proposed, we really need to be sure of the facts, for the measures would have very far-reaching consequences for the fisheries sector not only at sea but also on land. Research must therefore be accorded high priority, and sufficient resources must be made available.</p>
<p class="contents">Everyone agrees that current fisheries policy has proved to be a failure. That is why it is absolutely crucial for us to support the Commission’s proposals for reform and thus to reject the tabled amendments aimed at perpetuating current fisheries policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would highlight the aspects of this revision that are most worth saving: a permanent derogation governing access to resources within the 12-nautical mile zones of Member States' territorial waters is crucial to traditional fishing and to the socio-economic fabric of regions that are dependent on fishing, defending small-scale coastal fishing, protecting fish stocks and the most sensitive part of the coastal rim. I would remind you that one proposal which we tabled previously has already been adopted here, calling for this derogation to be extended to 24 nautical miles. At least the permanent nature of 12 miles should not now be called into question! The adoption of the proposal that we tabled to extend this derogation to 50 miles in the outermost regions under the terms of their special status is also extremely positive. This special status, when confirmed by the Council, will provide clear advantages for the protection of the fisheries sector in the autonomous regions of Madeira, the Azores and in all the outermost regions, thereby contributing to their development.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reject the reprogramming of the Structural Funds (FIFG) for the fisheries sector, preventing the appropriations for the ‘modernisation’ objective being transferred to the destruction of vessels, which is, as a matter of fact, in line with the Committee on Fisheries’ opinion on the 2003 budget. As we have pointed out, there are other alternative ways of reducing the fishing effort, which have already been referred to here, such as the system based on regulating days at sea, the adoption of biological recovery periods and technical measures geared to more selective fishing. It must be said, Commissioner, that in certain regions, what causes the greatest destruction of fish stocks is not fishing, but pollution. And, now, unfortunately, we have the case of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>, showing that this is sadly true: what causes the greatest destruction are these accidents; the old and unsafe oil tankers that still sail around our coasts.</p>
<p class="contents">The scrapping of vessels must be seen as a last resort, bearing in mind that any new policy to reduce fleet capacity must be based on the degree of true compliance with previously set objectives and must not further penalise those who have already fulfilled these objectives. Even prohibition, in some cases, for vessels less than 12 metres long, although positive, is extremely limited. We need to go further.</p>
<p class="contents">We must nevertheless bear in mind that any reduction of fishing effort must go hand in hand with an increase in the financial resources for the FIFG and the Union’s internal policies, in order to compensate for the socio-economic effects of such a reduction. I also regret the fact that the specific programme for small-scale coastal fishing has not been adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">The participation of fishermen and their representative organisations in the decision-making process is also crucial to the common fisheries policy and to stock management, specifically through co-management, so as to guarantee genuine decentralisation.</p>
<p class="contents">We also feel that it is the Member States’ responsibility to guarantee the effective monitoring, inspection and implementation of the rules laid down in the common fisheries policy. We therefore disagree with the proposals intended to undermine this principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hudghton (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   – Mr President, in the CFP reform process, I have consistently favoured retaining the founding principle of relative stability – installing the coastal zones as a permanent feature of the CFP at least up to 12 miles and strengthening the role of the proposed regional advisory councils so that real involvement of stakeholders can be achieved. I have also supported in principle proposals to move to a multi-annual, multi-species and ecosystem approach to fisheries management and my views are broadly in line with the Commission's on structural issues.</p>
<p class="contents">But I believe that all of the positive potential of CFP reform could be in vain if the Commission does not show itself to be willing to really listen to those who are actually affected by fisheries policy. Our fisheries policy must be understood and not just perceived as something being arbitrarily handed down by a European Union which claims to know better but cannot really prove it. Certainly the CFP to date has not exactly been a resounding success, as we have all acknowledged. That means that the scientific advice has to be up-to-date, it has to be verifiable, it has to be independent and it has to be able to be proved to be so.</p>
<p class="contents">The cod crisis that has been looming over the North Sea for almost two years has seen fishermen already being subject to real-time closures, to swingeing cuts in fleet size and a variety of technical measures including increased mesh sizes. Their efforts have borne at least some fruit in that the improvement of stocks of cod is only approximately 3% short of the target set by recovery plans. Now, these same fishermen are faced with drastic cuts and a total loss of any confidence in the Commission and its scientific advice, with measures being proposed which could totally devastate already fragile fishing communities.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the Commission must take into account the specific nature of this cod crisis and not tie its hands with political deadlines. The forthcoming December Council will be the forum for finalising reform proposals and it should not be used for rushing through panic measures for cod and associated species. I urge the Commission to transform its words into real action. Why not establish urgently the first pilot regional advisory council – or management council, as I would prefer – and give it the task of helping to devise measures to save the stocks of white fish in the North Sea. In that way, faith could be restored in the process at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on the Commission to think again too when it comes to open access to the North Sea as part of a future CFP. The present crisis only underlines the fragility of that sea and the key stocks in its mixed fishery. Your own words, Commissioner, in a written answer to me said: ‘very little is known about the abundance and status of non-quota species in the North Sea but fishing for non-quota species would almost certainly incur by-catches of species subject to quotas’. I say let us get reform right and then use it ...</p>

I broadly welcome the Jové Peres report in its present form. The Commission proposal is based on the principle of sustainable development and the poor state of fishery resources. The starting point is indisputable but many views, including my own, differ as to the quantification of the state of stocks. The basis of the proposal is that account is taken exclusively of scientific reports as regards management measures. However, no credible measures are proposed to improve scientific knowledge even though the shortcomings in this area are well recognised. They envisage a common fisheries policy which is geared more to the short-term interests of some Member States than to fishermen. I say to the Commission that the CFP must be geared towards keeping alive regions which depend on fishing rather than making it a battlefield between Member States. Fishermen share common interests. They all need fishery resources to carry out their activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Decisions and objectives of the recovery plans cannot discard the social and economic consequences which they may have. Recovery plans must seek a balance between the recovery and conservation of stocks and measures to limit the impact on the fishing industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The exclusive coastal zone is something that Irish fishermen are adamant about maintaining and so are fishermen from Scotland, Wales, England, France, Portugal and Holland, from Denmark, Germany and others – it is something that I am adamant must be retained. The basic objective of the 6 to 12 miles coastal zone regime was to protect fishery resources by reserving access to small scale coastal fishery activities. In general, this puts less pressure on stocks in these zones which often harbour nurseries in juveniles. It also contributed to protecting the traditional fishing activities of coastal communities, thereby helping to maintain their economic and social fabric.</p>
<p class="contents">The current critical situation of many stocks makes it more urgent now than ever, not merely to roll out the 6 to 12 mile access regime which is totally inadequate, but rather to roll out the exclusive zone to 24 miles if we are serious about conserving stocks. I ask you to support my amendments to extend the exclusive coastal fishing zone to 24 miles. I have no doubt that the greater majority of your fishermen would ask you to do the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">Because I regret the present unsatisfactory state of fish stocks and because I am in favour of conservation, I am adamant that highly sensitive areas must be protected. The Irish box is one such area of very great sensitivity. Waters in this zone are important spawning grounds, which is why there has been a derogation from free access in these waters. Regrettably, this did not prevent the illegal plunder of stocks in the Irish box over the years by some Community fishermen flying flags of convenience. This plunder must stop. These waters must be protected. Existing arrangements for access to the Irish box must be retained permanently in the reform process. There is no bureaucratic replacement for the knowledge and experience of fishermen. For this reason, and for many years, my group has been calling for a greater involvement of fishermen in the ways the common fishery policy is run.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has now adopted this idea, which I welcome, by proposing the creation of regional advisory councils which will include fishermen and their organisations for the very first time. If these councils are to play a meaningful role in the future, fishermen must be involved in all phases of the management process. Fishermen must also be more involved in the work of scientists in order to establish mutual confidence. Only in this way can fishermen contribute to and influence Community policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Varela for both of his balanced reports. I agree with his analysis. I agree with his criticism. I agree with his proposed changes to the Commission's proposals. I will be supporting his reports.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, let me say unequivocally, as I did during the debate on the Stevenson report, that the common fisheries policy is not only about fish, it is also, and more importantly, about fishermen. It is about their families and their families' future. It is about their way of life, the only one possible in many areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The conclusions of the Varela report are heading in the same direction and this we welcome. The European Parliament must confirm its support for maintaining this aid and must not approve the proposals by the Commission which is seeking to withdraw it on the pretext of preserving the marine environment. Aid for modernisation is still needed and does not in itself contribute to overfishing. Quite the opposite. By using a modern and suitably equipped fleet and using more selective and controlled fishing methods, we will encourage the sustainable management of resources and combat fraud. It is not this aid which contributes to overcapacity; it helps to improve working conditions, hygiene and on-board safety; it helps conservation and improves the quality of fisheries products. It therefore has a crucial role.</p>
<p class="contents">More broadly speaking, having listened to Mr Fischler earlier, giving an outline of the general policy, we also wish to stress that good resource management is obviously necessary, but this has to be performed objectively, transparently, involving the professionals and with quota reductions or increases, depending on fluctuations in fish stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last comment to make. If we introduce stricter legislation in the area of fisheries, will consumer demand lessen or, on the other hand, will imports from third countries increase further? For whose benefit? How can we avoid this pernicious effect? We would like answers to all these questions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Does that mean that cod will be off the menu in future, as is apparently already the case in Newfoundland? That reminds me of a joke. Why do we need cod when we have fish fingers? But seriously, we have been preparing for this reform on 1 January 2003 for years now and just what has the European Parliament delivered in the end? A lot of people are saying this is a lot of hot air about nothing, because the strong wind of change expected in European fisheries is now no more than a mild breeze. And I think that the House has given birth not to a reform but at best a mini-reform. Oh well, be that as it may …</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of safeguarding long-term fish stocks, short-term, short-sighted maintenance of the status quo is the order of the day. Harsh words, but I stand by them. Hardly the real reform everyone supposedly wanted. Hardly a ray of hope for exhausted resources, more a fatal ‘eyes down and charge!’ We have too many vessels chasing fewer and fewer fish, with some stocks in a state of total collapse. You cannot ignore the facts, even if you think it might lose you your seat. Do you really believe that people do not see through politicians? I cannot continue to support public aid for new vessels with a clear conscience knowing that we simply have too many vessels. If building new vessels were a profitable business with good profit forecasts, surely the banks would be queuing up to hand out money?</p>
<p class="contents">They are not queuing up, there are no good profit forecasts and yet we expect European taxpayers to step in, whether they want to or not. That is just plain stupid. Sad, but true!

One of the most important reasons is that stocks of several species are at a critical level. There are too few fish for too many fishing vessels and the proposed regulations need to be judged in this context. Parliament needs to pluck up courage and stand firm if it is serious about protecting fish stocks. Unfortunately, no thread of real reform runs through Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's reports. I do not think that minor cosmetic corrections are of any use at all in the long term, be it to the fishermen or to the endangered stocks, which are on the verge of collapse.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I totally agree that we should call the voluntary scrapping measures proposed by the Commission into question. The emphasis here is on voluntary; to me, everything else is just talk. As far as I am concerned, neither report is acceptable as it stands and I cannot vote for them. The fact that all the proposed measures need a soft social and economic landing is one of our main demands and I think we all now agree on that. But today's debate is about the proposed reforms, not the loss of the <span class="italic">Prestige </span>and we must not confuse the two. We stand by the Galician fishermen but we must keep our eye on the ball. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We need to maintain sustainable marine ecosystems conserving fish stocks for future generations. Parliament's resolution the green paper identified the fundamental aim of the CFP as attaining a balance between the two.</p>
<p class="contents">ELDR amendments to the Jové Peres report seek to ensure the long-term future of the 12 mile limit and of relative stability. These are essential both to the sustainability of fragile coastal communities and of the stocks on which they depend. We aim to specify more clearly the other measures that need to taken to protect stocks. We would rename regional advisory councils as regional management councils. This makes it clear that such councils should have a real role in helping to formulate and to implement the measures needed under the reformed CFP.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we must use these councils to help achieve the fullest possible understanding of the functioning of marine ecosystems. For example, recent research suggests that an increase rather than a decrease in nephrops quotas could actually be positive for the regeneration of cod stocks.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, balancing the viability of the sector and the sustainability of stocks is not just a matter for the reform of the CFP. It is precisely what is required in the current cod crisis. It is good that the Commission has addressed the socio-economic problems but the measures so far seem like prescribing a couple of aspirins to cure a severe case of pneumonia. So we are formally in support of the resolution. Let us hope that a proper implementation of CFP reform will prevent any such crises arising in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is up to the Member States to decide on their plan of action during this time.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to make a plea for small-scale fishing, which affects the most jobs and enables many families of traditional fishermen to survive. Until now, it has primarily been industrial fishing which has been increasingly encouraged, and I thank Commissioner Fischler for the proposals that he made in his presentation on the general policy in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, when FIFG subsidies are used to build increasingly large and increasingly powerful boats, the Member States, of course, encourage a greater and less selective fishing, which has a detrimental effect on small tradesmen, who are concerned with preserving efficient boats that are kept in good condition and which therefore provide good levels of safety without damaging the marine environment. We would like more money to be granted to businesses, particularly from the Structural Funds. This money must also be used to buy better equipment, not to destroy boats. We should also, for example, give small, less powerful boats access to reserved areas to be used as their main resource. The Member States could implement similar measures to encourage access to markets in which small-scale fishermen, whose activities are less well structured than large-scale fishermen, have less influence in the area of management. For example, aid can be given to fisheries and to fish auctions. As regards the representation of fishermen in Commission advisory councils, we must encourage small businesses. We should increase the representation of traditional fishermen, particularly within regional fishing committees, in which professional associations can express their views. The industrial tribunals in the Mediterranean are a good example of this. They could thus defend their interests more forcefully. Lastly, it is always the large-scale fishermen who can go further, to Africa, for example to Senegal where species are fished to a greater degree, or to other countries whose fisheries resources are essential for the local economy. They contribute to the depletion of stocks, which is harmful for both local fishermen and fishermen all over the world.</p>
<p class="contents">These are some proposals, therefore, that we can make to encourage small-scale fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More sacrifices have been made by that fleet than any other fleet in the European Union. It has been pruned and pruned and pruned yet again. Northern Ireland fishermen more than anyone want to maintain sustainable fisheries in the Irish Sea. Cod amounts to about 10% of the value of all fish annually landed in Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">Northern Ireland fishermen are opposed to the present proposals. They are not viable as an economic option, either for fishermen whose assets are not really being fully used or for the governments who may be spending considerable amounts of money on aid without obtaining long-term change assuring a viable future for the industry. Fishermen have promoted the following as alternatives in Northern Ireland: further targeted decommissioning; real-time closures; additional technical conservation measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishermen want to work with the scientists but the scientists who advise the Commission will not work with them. I have been at a meeting where they invited the scientists to come and look at the Irish Sea and the scientists would not even come and look at it. They prepared a boat for them and they would not even go out in the boat. I say that if the scientists cannot go and argue their case in the Irish Sea then it must not be a scientific case that they are really arguing.</p>
<p class="contents">The chairman of the Committee on Fisheries has a proposal that would secure more money for investigating the effects of the measures already in place. That is something that is very important. We need to know if all the sacrifices that fishermen have made in the past have done anything to help the fishing industry, and the scientific evidence should be produced if they have it. This should be supported, and a proper evaluation of what has already been imposed conducted, before any new decisions are taken that will have a discriminatory effect on the Northern Ireland fishing fleet. Fears of discrimination are not myths in Northern Ireland, they are stubborn facts. We need to have a real evaluation of what success the past cuts have had and what information is available to be examined.</p>
<p class="contents">Northern Ireland fishermen have made great sacrifices in the past but they are now being convinced that the knife has been turned on them. For example, we have had an announcement from Dublin that there are going to be bigger, larger and better boats. There is going to be an Atlantic dream financed partly by EU aid while the fishermen in Northern Ireland are being pushed to destroy their own boats.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say that not only fishermen are going to suffer but also their wives and families will suffer and death is going to come to the fishing villages and to the hopes of the future for these people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do, however, have some observations to make. The golden rule for any fisheries policy is stock preservation and the fundamental priority must be the preservation of stocks and marine life, because, to use a culinary metaphor, just as you cannot make an omelette without eggs, you cannot go fishing if there are no fish. This problem first arose a very long time ago when, around 1600, a renowned jurist, Hugo Grotius, wrote a book entitled ‘Mare liberum’, in which he advocated the principle of the freedom to navigate the seas, which later became a principle of international law. Even then, some jurists added that this also implied the freedom to fish, which could also lead to the depletion of stocks. As you see, this is an age-old problem.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the freedom to fish must be conditional on the marine resources available. Protecting marine resources is not only about guaranteeing the future of fishing but also concerns a biological value, an essential value of humanity and of life on Earth. Consequently, we cannot make intrinsically contradictory speeches, in which we advocate one thing and also its opposite; speeches in which, on the one hand, we call for the preservation of stocks, but immediately also claim the right to practically unlimited and unconditional fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, I should like to say something to Commissioner Fischler: as Mrs Miguélez said, what is impressive about Commissioner Fischler is his indifference to the fate of fishermen and of fishing communities, and his lack of feeling. In fact, we need to show solidarity and understanding towards fishermen, specifically towards those who, as has already been said, are now suffering the consequences of a terrible and criminal shipwreck. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a particularly bad state of affairs and reference is often made to the situation in Newfoundland, where fishing has gone on to the point where the Grandbanks are empty, but we should also set in motion drastic measures to stop excessive fishing. However, we have not always done this in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of comparison, there was a shortage of cod in the 1960s, followed by a huge surplus in the North Sea in the Seventies. To this day, nobody can explain why that was. We do not know enough, and certainly not everything there is to know, about cod.</p>
<p class="contents">During 2000 – 2001, cutbacks by 40% were imposed, which was very drastic. The effects of such a measure have left the sector with little resilience to take any further knock-backs. The sector is under pressure and we are expected to take a careful approach. We should not consider last year's reserves as an option; these had a negative impact on cod stocks. This is an example of hasty, rather than careful, decision-making, with a negative result.</p>
<p class="contents">Needless to say, the situation is very worrying, but I should like to repeat that we need to produce far clearer information before we can take draconian measures of this kind. We cannot sell this to the people who work in the fishing industry. We cannot simply discontinue cod fishing. We can certainly not pass on the problem to the flatfish sector, since cod is caught in that sector as a secondary line. Neither flatfish stocks, nor cod stocks would justify this.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not simply talking about fish stocks, but also about the socio-economic implications of another major intervention. We should, therefore, think carefully and take informed decisions. I am thus pleased with Mr Stevenson's resolution. We should think of alternatives, think in terms of cutting the link with flatfish, and consider setting up a compensation fund. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Why, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, must CFP reform take place specifically in 2002? It is taking place because a transitional period has just come to an end in Spain and Portugal. Since 1986, Spain and Portugal have not enjoyed rights equal to those of the other States over the seas that belong to us all, as Community seas.</p>
<p class="contents">This fact does not appear anywhere, however; it does appear in the Commission document, but Parliament has rejected it.</p>
<p class="contents">We are drawing up a series of documents, regulations, as if the main reason for reform were not actually the fact that since 1986, five new States have joined the European Community and these States should have the same rights on Community seas that the Member States had when the European Community was made up of six States or ten. We must not uphold privileges and discrimination that allows these States still to be considered as intruders in seas that belong to us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, we are now seeing enormous confusion. Privileges are being confused with the conservation of resources. In order to justify the privileges it is said that we want to conserve resources. We all want to conserve resources – that is not the problem; we accept all fair decisions to conserve resources; the problem is how to distribute between fleets, resources that scientifically, reasonably, with common sense, applying the precautionary principle, are considered fair. This principle is not being applied. This situation has arisen, with the reform disadvantaging Spain and Portugal, and therefore Galicia, which has been referred to so often today, because it has not even been considered to be a territory that depends on fishing.</p>

Against this backdrop, some fundamental criticism must be made of the Commission proposals. In their current wording, these proposals are unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first criticism is that ending aid for fleet modernisation is totally unacceptable. Given that 40% of Portugal’s fleet is more than 25 years old, this would definitively sideline the overwhelming majority of Portuguese fishermen and prevent them from undertaking any modernisation. Our second criticism is that the ban on aid for the creation of joint enterprises for fishing outside Community waters will only serve to increase our imports from third countries; it would, therefore be sensible to continue to allow vessels decommissioned from the Community fleet to fish in the waters of third countries under these joint enterprises. Lastly account must be taken of the efforts that some countries, in this case Portugal, have already made under the Multi-Annual Guidance Plans for fisheries, where the effort that has already been made to reduce the fleet should now be considered and deducted from their targets.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Commissioner, I should also like to say that other issues have not been given due consideration. For example: if a stock preservation programme exists, why are we continuing to allow fishing for the manufacture of fishmeal to take place? Also, why is it that no specific measures have been envisaged for the outermost regions, whose aquatic ecosystems are highly sensitive? In this regard it is crucial that a specific solution is found for these outermost regions which, in Portugal’s case, are Madeira and the Azores. I also hope that the opinion delivered by the European Parliament will take account of those aspects that have not been considered and that the Council is able to reach a reasonable agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a tragic day today if we are meeting here not to focus on the positive reform of the CFP but to debate the fate of fisheries in the North Sea. As we all know, ISIS has recommended no fishing for haddock and whiting in these areas unless ways to harvest these stocks – and I am quoting – ‘without by-catch or discards of cod’ can be demonstrated. ISIS has also implied severe restrictions in the fisheries of nephrops, plaice and sole with – and I quote – ‘stringent restrictions on the catch and discard rates of cod with effective monitoring of compliance with those restrictions’.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Commission has moved away from an all-out moratorium. However, sadly, due to the nature of mixed fisheries, 80% would still effectively mean the same: a closure of fisheries in the North Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to commend the work of the UK and Scottish Fisheries Ministers; the UK Fisheries Minister Mr Elliot Moreley, the Scottish Fisheries Minister Mr Ross Finny and the Secretary of State for Scotland, Mrs Helen Liddle. They are fighting for the future of Scottish fisheries and the final decision ultimately rests at their doors, not ours. However, we have to consider what kind of future we want. Do we actually want to say: ‘sod the cod and allow fishing to continue and just hope for the best. The other stocks will not go the same way as the cod’? Or, do we want to work through, in a cooperative manner, with industry, ministers and other organisations to seek a common solution?</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever solution is agreed, change is inevitable. At present there is no specific UK/Scottish counter-proposal to what the Commission is proposing. However, doing nothing in the light of declining cod stocks is not an option. The difficult task of reaching a quota figure that is sustainable yet scientifically credible remains. The next two weeks will be critical to finding a solution to this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Researchers in the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea have found that cod stocks in the North Sea, the Irish Sea and the Skagerrak are threatened by total collapse. They demand a total ban. Are we listening to their advice and suggestions? No, we are trying to find all manner of arguments for avoiding taking our responsibility.

If we do not do this, it might mean the complete destruction of the future of the fishing industry.</p>

<p class="contents">There is something I really do fail to understand, however, Commissioner. We have the same perspectives and goals and we understand the concerns expressed by the Commission: we understand its concerns regarding the conservation of stocks; we understand its concerns about not increasing fishing effort. Parliament is on your side. We even agree on providing incentives for scrapping and, therefore, encouraging some fishermen to leave the fisheries sector. I genuinely fail to understand, however, why it is that we cannot succeed in coming to an agreement. You continue to deny that modernisation, specifically modernisation of the fleet, is essential, even though, in our countries, fishing vessels provide the most unliveable working conditions still existing in Europe. Then the other point is the reliability of the scientific data, which we have mentioned several times. Now, I do not believe that an agreement cannot be reached between Parliament and the Commission, given that our goals are the same.</p>
<p class="contents">I would add just one thing, Commissioner: consider the political implications if we were to fail in this matter. We are on the eve of redefining the Europe we want, and we want it to be more intergovernmental and more Community-based. If you do not succeed in this, it will be evidence that more Community-based organisation means a European Union which is more removed from the citizens and less attentive to their concerns. I do not believe that we will fail, but we must fight this battle together, to ensure that everything we have built up over the past 50 years is not lost. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You are as stubborn on this issue as a deep-sea fisherman. You have conceded a small amount of ground for vessels less than 12 metres long, which is positive. In my view, however, it is not because the money is public money that fish are disappearing! And you are well aware that without state aid, deep-sea fishermen, or a number of them at least, will prolong the life of their boats, using them for sea-fishing for longer. An old boat, however, is a dangerous boat. An old trawler is as dangerous as an old oil tanker.</p>
<p class="contents">Here are the statistics from France, which were published a few weeks ago. According to the ‘Accident Investigation’ Bureau, there have been 30 shipwrecks and 22 people have died. What sort of boats are involved, however? All of them were more than 30 years old – that is obvious. Above all, however, most of them were modernised some months or not long before, in other words destabilised and made heavier, because fishermen have no other choice.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe and hope that, in December, you will also find an answer for vessels over 12 metres long as well, in other words, for small-scale fishing, which is dependent not only on the size of boats but on the skipper being on board too. You want to find a solution without increasing capacity. Fine. Small-scale fishing has no proper funding and so, without a boost from the state, nothing will change.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, I believe we need a solution other than ‘nothing’, so I hope that you will adopt a slightly more flexible approach by the end of our debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the light of recent events, it is only right and proper that the European Union, and also the Commission, should express solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the Commissioner has, in fact, taken the bull by the horns with regard to what is wrong with the fish stocks. It is true that, as far as cod is concerned, something is amiss. It is also true that cod may well be found in other locations, but the fact is that cod levels in the North Sea are at an all-time low. However, we should also be careful, if we want to adopt a fair and sound administration in Europe, not to throw out the baby with the bathwater. We should look at the situation fairly and consider the underlying causes. There is, of course, the warming of sea water to some extent, but we should also examine the probable causes of overfishing in the first place. Why was quota control not in place? Let us mainly focus on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to turn to the next topic. It is unacceptable for the good to be punished along with the bad. If the Commission indicates that it also believes that quota for flatfish should be cut, for example by between 30% and 40%, then I have to say that I do not go along with this. Sound quota management in that very sector has meant that, relatively speaking, this sector is doing well, certainly taking into consideration the drastic cutbacks in additional catches. This is why the flatfish fishing quota can be cut disproportionately in relation to those for cod, as has been illustrated in Denmark, Germany and certainly in my own country, the Netherlands.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also add that over the space of ten years, cod catches from the Netherlands have decreased by 70%. It is unacceptable for fishermen to have to suffer extra for sole and plaice. If the European Union wants to remain credible, it is essential that this policy on flatfish should not be carried through in other sectors, and I assume that the Commission will act fairly in this too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a real need to set out a fisheries policy that creates a balance between resources and their use, that is based upon the principle of sustainability and that takes much more extensive account of environmental and ecological considerations than the previous policy did. We need the multiannual management plans proposed by the Commissioner, based upon scientific advice and to be applied to all the stocks. We must get away from the annual quota lotteries and the emergency crisis resolution that takes place every single year.</p>
<p class="contents">The collapse of cod stocks in the North Sea, Irish Sea and Skagerrak is, in reality, a judgment upon fisheries policy so far. If the Member States had followed the scientific advice and warnings, including the Commission’s proposal from June of last year for a rescue plan, this collapse would presumably not have happened. It is the lack of political responsibility and monitoring on the part of the governments that is now giving rise to a range of serious social, environmental and economic consequences in the region concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to cut back on the combined fishing fleet, something which necessarily means using the subsidies for eliminating the fishing fleet’s overcapacity and, if need be, for supporting those fishermen affected by the measures required. We must not, however, use the subsidies for renewing and converting the fishing fleet. Moreover, we need to establish much more efficient common supervision of fisheries. On that point, the Commissioner should know that aid will be required.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot endorse Mr Varela’s reports. I think that they are both on the wrong track. I hope that a sustainable fisheries reform may be implemented before the New Year, and it might be useful if the Commissioner could confirm that the work is continuing in accordance with this timetable and if he could provide his assessments of the options. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In our joint debate on this proposal, I should first of all like to take this opportunity to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna and underline the remarkable quality of the work he has submitted for our consideration. Like the rapporteur, I acknowledge that the Commission proposal is largely unacceptable. Without calling into question the entire concept of vessel scrapping, I must stress the irreversible nature of this measure and draw attention to its enormous socio-economic costs in the Member State that I represent and especially in my home region, the Algarve.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the reality of the situation in Portugal: fifty thousand jobs in the fisheries sector, 90% of vessels are old and small and are engaged in traditional forms of fishing. I would point out that there are other measures that are not irreversible and which will cause less upset in achieving a balance between fleet capacity and available fish resources. Portugal has been extremely committed to fulfilling and even exceeding its targets for the multi-annual guidance plans, unlike other Member States, which have made no effort or have even increased their fleet capacity, with total impunity. Portugal is becoming increasingly concerned to see the Commission ignoring this situation, rejecting inspections and continuing blindly to ask all Member States to make the same sacrifices.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the Commission proposal, the sudden redirection of funds from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG), raises serious doubts at the legal, financial and budgetary levels. It is therefore becoming unjustifiable at all levels to reprogramme funds already earmarked for the period until 2006 and which have been planned with the national and regional bodies and the economic and social operators. As the rapporteur quite rightly said, this Commission proposal appears, more than anything, to be a leap in the dark.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fischler,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to thank you for the very extensive debate we have had here. May I say to everyone who referred to the shipwreck of the <span class="italic">Prestige</span> that perhaps it was not perfectly clear from my first speech that we, by which I mean the services responsible for shipping in the transport DG under Mrs Loyola de Palacio, the environmental experts under Mrs Margot Wallström, the Structural Fund experts and my experts, have joined in setting up a task force. All these experts have been in Galicia for some time now and have been looking at ideas <span class="italic">in situ</span>,<span class="italic"> </span>together with the agencies responsible, as to how we can best help here.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as direct responsibility for fisheries is concerned, as you know, the current rules only allow 4% of total structural resources for fisheries to be used for compensation following a disaster. I have said that this is too little. We need to do more here and I am in the process of doing something about this. I shall be bending the rules as far as I possibly can without actually breaking them. We are also prepared to look, with the Spanish Government, at how we can put structural resources for fisheries to the best possible use here. We want the compensation ruling to be flexible enough to include joint activities undertaken by groups or organisations in the fisheries sector.</p>
<p class="contents">We really cannot completely ignore the polluter pays principle here but, as you know, there is a sort of solidarity over and above that, in the form of a fund of EUR 300 million, which the Commission has been demanding to see increased to EUR 1 billion for some time now – for several months in fact. It is not up to the Commission to take the decisions here; this is a decision for the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the cod plan and the oral question. I really must categorically reject what Mr Stevenson said about everything being based on out-of-date data and hence not being very relevant. These are the latest data available and the evaluations were not carried out by just any scientists; they were carried out by scientists from all the Member States who worked as a group, were paid by the Member States and had to reach a common verdict. To say this was an academic exercise which, if you want, you can ignore, is totally uncalled for.</p>
<p class="contents">For the most part, catch data for 2001 were used. If 2001 brought about such dramatic results, then it is obvious from stock patterns that 2002 will bring about even more dramatic results. If you believe these fish have all moved to Iceland, you are deluding yourself! Why is the situation in Iceland better? Because the Icelanders introduced a multiannual cod management plan years ago. It is we who need to catch up, not the other way round. And we need to stick to the facts if we want to make any headway here.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the reports. I should like to comment mainly on the proposed amendments. First to Mr Jové Peres's report and stock management. I am more than happy to accept Amendments Nos 4, 14, 27 and 30, because the Commission too feels that fisheries management should include social and economic aspects. However, I must reject Amendment No 2, because economic considerations cannot be used as an excuse for watering down the measures needed. I must also reject Amendments Nos 24, 31 and 99, because our wording for the precautionary principle is in keeping with international maritime law and cannot therefore be watered down.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 19 and 50 do not pose any substantive problems; however, the precautionary principle already takes account of environmental considerations per se and I therefore feel that these amendments are superfluous. However, I welcome your support for multiannual management plans, Mr Jové Peres, and gladly accept Amendments Nos 1, 3, 6, 29 and 32. I cannot accept Amendments Nos 35 and 36 because it is up to the Council to set the framework for management plans. However, I gladly accept Amendment No 22 on international guidelines for sustainable fisheries management. I must reject Amendments Nos 67 and 68, although I agree that we urgently need better scientific data on third country stocks and we shall be sending Parliament a separate communication on this in the spring of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to access to waters and stocks. I gladly accept Amendments Nos 8 and 46, but I must reject Amendments Nos 70 to 74 and 94, because I think we need to keep the twelve-mile zone. I must also reject Amendment No 45, because we shall be examining access restrictions such as the Shetland Box in 2003. I must reject Amendments Nos 9, 47, 95 and 97 on a 50-nautical-mile economic zone for the outermost regions as they stand, because this is a matter of national law. I reject the proposed amendments on relative stability because I think that relative stability is part and parcel of our common fisheries policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I can accept Amendments Nos 28 and 76 but I must reject Amendment No 11, because both the Commission and the Council legal services are of the unanimous opinion that the system for western waters needs to be changed and that these Member States should be treated on a equal footing with other Member States when it comes to the fishing effort planned for this zone.</p>
<p class="contents">And so to fleet policy. I am delighted that the rapporteur agrees in general with our proposals and I welcome these amendments. I accept Amendment No 44, although we must comply with Community provisions governing data protection. I also accept Amendment No 78. However, I must reject Amendments Nos 7, 26, 34 and 39 to 43, because they add nothing new of substance and create a whole host of practical problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Now for your proposed amendments to the chapter on controls. I am delighted that many here are in favour of stepping up controls and the implementation of a common fisheries policy and gladly accept Amendments Nos 51, 57 and 61. However, I should like to accept Amendments Nos 51 and 57 in a slightly different form. I cannot accept Amendments Nos 52 to 56 or 62. Nor can I accept Amendment No 12, because we need effective tools if those who break the rules are to be held liable for the damage they cause. And that includes quota reductions.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to decision-making procedures and consultations. I must reject Amendments Nos 21, 37, 65, 66, 80, 84 and 86 to 89 for the sake of institutional equilibrium, although I gladly accept your Amendment No 64 and part of Amendment No 85 to do with regional consultative committees and the demand that they should also be set up in third countries. Finally, I am unfortunately unable to accept your Amendment No 69, because the basic principles will be included in our new framework regulation in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the proposed amendments in Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna's two reports. First, I have made the Commission's standpoint on this quite clear. I must say, to my great disappointment, that many of the proposed amendments are designed merely to maintain the status quo. I find that unacceptable and must therefore reject the proposed amendments which refer to it. I am convinced that it makes no sense to hand out money for scrapping with one hand and to finance new ships with the other, because all that does is to put more pressure on endangered stocks and subsidise this absurd state of affairs out of taxpayers' money.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor do I agree with you on exports or joint ventures. These mechanisms do nothing to reduce excess capacity in our waters because most of the vessels which receive public aid for joint ventures or export were already fishing in third countries. However, I can accept Amendment No 3 on the possibility of adapting programme planning during the current Structural Fund period. I can only accept the part of Amendments Nos 19 and 37 designed to promote the diversification of vessels out of fisheries. Finally, I think that Amendment No 27 is superfluous.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to the final proposal on scrapping. Unfortunately, I must reject Amendments Nos 2 and 9, because if we ask the taxpayer to fund the scrapping of vessels out of additional public money, then it is only logical that we re-programme public aid for fleet renewal at the same time. As far as Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8 are concerned, here too I must beg to differ. Scientists have been telling us for years that our fleet is far too big and that stocks are depleting under the tremendous pressure from fisheries. Our scientists have repeatedly concluded that TACs and quotas and technical measures alone are not enough. As far as additional funds for scrapping are concerned, we have drawn up calculations based on empirical values. Of course they are only estimates, but the majority of Member States see them as an upper limit, which is why I cannot agree with Amendments Nos 3 to 6 and 8.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor can I accept Amendment No 7, because the Commission has indeed honoured its obligations by instituting infringement proceedings against Member States who fail to achieve their fleet targets. As for Amendment No 10, the point here is that Member States must meet all the conditions of MAP 4, that is, overall fleet targets and individual targets, if they want to claim additional scrapping premiums. Anything else would put Member States who have achieved their overall fleet target at a disadvantage.</p>
