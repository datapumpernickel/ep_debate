Mr Bush’s decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol is an indication of his immense lack of responsibility regarding the future of humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Social Democrats also wish to strongly emphasise the fact that his attitude is, more than anything, irresponsible with regard to the developing countries. The USA’s own emissions of carbon dioxide account for around a quarter of those now produced around the world. The USA produces per head of population more than ten times the amount that would represent sustainable development if that were the average figure for everyone on earth. </p>
<p class="contents">The unilateral decision taken by the American President will tend to have an adverse effect on dialogue on either side of the Atlantic. To avoid any greater confrontation Bush should reverse his decision and embark on an active dialogue with the EU and other parties to the agreement on climate to ensure that we can together take adequate action to prevent climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in any event, the European Union must keep to its obligations. Europe, and presumably the United States also, today have all the technical facilities to ensure that emissions from industry can be reduced by a third from the levels for 1990 by the year 2010. Now enormous effort, greater than ever before, must be made in the energy production and traffic and transport sectors. There is no economic justification either for abandoning the aims and obligations of Kyoto. Sustainable development does not threaten economic prosperity, on the contrary, it promotes the rational use of natural resources and is an assurance of prosperity and jobs for generations to come.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, the Social Democrats in the European Parliament would like to make a strong plea in favour of strengthening the action to prevent climatic change, ensuring that it does not in any way weaken and that the Gothenburg summit will send a clear message regarding the wishes of Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Major American oil concerns, such as Exxon, Texaco and Chevron have helped Bush into the saddle. Their hand in this boycott is obvious. Bush is not only thick, he is as thick as two short planks.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must respond by ratifying the Kyoto Protocol before the summer of 2002. More than 20 countries have already done just that. The EU can and must ratify Kyoto, together with our Eastern European partners, Russia, Japan and countries such as Brazil. These 55 countries combined account for 55% of emissions. Even without the US, the Kyoto Protocol will be legally valid.</p>
<p class="contents">Worldwide negotiations have taken place for nearly ten years. The time has come for action and deeds. Europe must take the lead with energy savings and renewable energy. The new technologies – wind power, biomass and solar energy – will also yield economic benefits for Europe. Windmills are Denmark’s second export product.</p>
<p class="contents">European actions should persuade the developing countries to accept the climate objectives in time. Those same developing countries already made it clear at the failed climate summit in The Hague that they did not want nuclear energy, even if it were subsidised. European and American citizens can break Bush’s Kyoto boycott by boycotting fuel and diesel from Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.</p>
<p class="contents">The political pleas by Commissioner Wallström and the troika were to no avail. The majority of MEPs refuse, on principle, to sign such a boycott. But MEPs from Sweden and the Netherlands have in the past called for a boycott of the apartheid regime in South Africa. Citizens, show your anger and boycott Bush. Boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron. Capital punishment in the US may be ethically unjustified, but in the final analysis it is a matter for the American people. However, the demise of the climate which Bush is bringing about for the whole world is unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And one of the objectives of this debate is to comply with the decisions made in Kyoto, which we consider to be an unavoidable objective for the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union set an example when, in Kyoto, it asked for a greater reduction. It is true that later, in the discussion and debate, this reduction ended up lower than we all thought, given that the European Environment Agency said that instead of the 8% reduction from 1990, it should be 30%, if we wanted to go along the right path.</p>
<p class="contents">I, therefore, share in the two amendments tabled by my colleagues in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, that is, we have to tell the United States that it is immoral not only for it not to comply with the Kyoto protocol, but also for it to rely on developing countries, saying that only they need to reduce pollution. It is immoral, and we have to say so here loud and clear, because while the annual average CO2 emissions of a European are 10 tonnes, the average for an American is 24 tonnes and developing countries are way below the average.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to use this argument in the transatlantic relations that we have with the United States. We need to act unilaterally, not only on the basis that we need to look after the competitiveness of companies, but also on the basis that, from an economic point of view, the most reasonable thing to do is to support the Kyoto Protocol and take specific and clear measures aimed at implementing and ratifying the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that in Europe we can once again set an example if all the European countries ratify the Protocol, if they start to take unilateral measures and if they force the United States, in transatlantic relations, not to continue acting in such an immoral way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Doyle (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, there was palpable shock and disappointment at President Bush's recent announcement that the US will not cooperate with efforts to decrease carbon emissions in the endeavour to stave off the real threat of global warming. The US, with 5% of the world's population, produces 25% of the world's greenhouse gases. For President Bush to tell the EU delegation in Washington this week that he acknowledges both the problem and the need to find a solution is hollow rhetoric, when the US distances itself from the only solution on the table, and that a partial solution at best.</p>
<p class="contents">Kyoto is only the beginning of the way forward. What is President Bush afraid of? Many of the Kyoto signatories, including my own country, are failing to meet our agreed targets; but we must keep trying, we must keep talking – at Bonn next in June or July – and endeavour to reach the targets set for all the difficulties posed in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">The longer-term consequences will be far more difficult to resolve. It is not a question of the environment, or of employment. The promotion and protection of economic competitiveness is inextricably linked to the protection of the environment. Well-managed environments are themselves a source of wealth creation through agriculture, tourism and the maintenance of assimilative capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">Environmental protection is therefore a matter of enlightened self-interest for the future economic wellbeing and competitiveness of Europe, the US and the entire world. Viewed this way, environmental protection becomes part of a virtuous circle whereby a high-quality environment is sustained by wealth, which in turn is sustained by competition, which in turn requires a high-quality environment. Yes, environmental orthodoxies must be constantly scrutinised and re-evaluated to ensure that the protection required is proportionate and effective.</p>
<p class="contents">What Kyoto requires of us all is just that: proportionate and effective responses to the global threat of climate change. And developed countries and communities have a particular responsibility. Great sensitivity, tolerance and compassion must be employed when it is proposed to apply the environmental standards of the developed world to the economies and environments of emerging economies. We need to acknowledge the resilience of natural systems and their ability subsequently to recover once a plateau of economic stability has been reached. This has been the pattern over most of the developed world. Productivity and profitability are important prerequisites for environmental protection and enhancement. I acknowledge the need for sustained economic competitiveness to provide the very resources required for a high-quality environment.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush, there does not need to be any contradiction between these two objectives. It is not jobs or the environment. Please come back on board Kyoto, and be sure you do not mortgage all our children's heritage. Environmental pollution, climate change, is no respecter of borders. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is with deep regret that the Europeans and all those who are sincere friends of the United States see a great country, which ought to be the leading light not just of economic progress but also of human civilisation in all fields, abandon one of the fundamental principles: the protection of the environment, of health and of the world that, in years to come, we will be leaving to our children and heirs.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the current problem is not just deciding upon a position which, it appears, has been adopted by these bodies with a very wide majority, but how to move forwards. We must, in fact, ask ourselves whether a political position such as that we are adopting, a position putting pressure on the public, is enough in this matter, or whether more tangible action might not be required. Now we come to the question we are already, at this stage, putting to the Commission, to the competent bodies. Certainly, an initial recommendation has already been made: ratify Kyoto, in any case, and assume all our responsibilities before the world. But will all this be enough to make it clear that, without the cooperation of the United States, the battle on the world stage is a difficult one? As of today, therefore, I am posing a question. Will the European Union genuinely stand 100% firm on this issue, or, as I regret to say has happened on other occasions, for example, in certain matters such as the death penalty, will it put up a good fight and then fail to achieve the key objectives at the decisive moment? This, Mr President, is the question we wish to put to the representatives of the Commission today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is therefore extremely odd that the country responsible for a good quarter of the earth’s total carbon dioxide emissions should not be contributing to the reduction of such emissions. It is dreadful and a big disappointment, but it is not exactly surprising. It was hardly by chance that President Clinton did not establish the Kyoto Protocol firmly in the American Senate.</p>
<p class="contents">Time after time, and most recently at last year’s Climate Conference in The Hague, the United States has shown its unwillingness to negotiate about the American life-style. Now, President Bush has spoken his mind and said openly that the United States does not intend to participate in the Kyoto process because the Protocol, as he puts it, excludes 80 per cent of the world and would seriously damage the American economy.

I wish to make four brief points. First of all, I must strongly condemn the unfortunate unilateral decision rejecting the Kyoto Protocol, which warrants our criticism, announced by President Bush. Secondly, although this is a serious development, it comes as no surprise; the Union should have forearmed itself a long time ago with alternative strategies. Thirdly, we must not waver or hesitate over the need to implement the Kyoto Protocol, with or without the United States. My fourth and final point is that the European Union must now redouble its efforts and demonstrate effective leadership, both within the European Union, by fighting against the increase in emissions that we are seeing today in most of our fifteen Member States and beyond the Union, by ensuring that Kyoto is ratified by as many countries as possible so that it can enter into force before 2002. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sea levels will rise; there will be more severe droughts and more brutal floods; islands, coastal regions and deltas will disappear; we will see famines and epidemics and entire species will become extinct. The poorest populations will be most affected. And this is not necessarily the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why Parliament must take a stand on this issue and express, in the strongest terms, its deep indignation at the decision taken by President Bush to reject the Kyoto Protocol. At a time when populations are quite rightly apprehensive about the prospect of climate change, the consequences of which would be disastrous, the United States, the major consumer of energy in the world, has taken a decision which is totally irresponsible and dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I think that all honourable Members are aware of the fact that the United States has even gone so far as to authorise an oil company to drill for oil in an Alaskan nature reserve. This attitude of allegiance to the interests of multinational companies shows total contempt for both humans and nature. All nations must assume their responsibilities. I welcome the protests made by the European Union, other major countries and Member States. The United States, which signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998, must be called to account.</p>
<p class="contents">We must reject any re-examination of the Kyoto commitments. We must ratify and apply the protocol even without the United States. Commissioner, as we know from past experience that a verbal protest will not be enough, in order to apply effective pressure it would be judicious to include environmental clauses in international commercial negotiations. It is the future of the planet and of our children that is at stake. I do not think it is employment which acts against the environment. Once again, it is the primacy of money that militates against humane and sustainable development, which is the undeniable ambition espoused by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For more than ten years, negotiations have been under way concerning measures to protect the climate. The United States has participated the whole time and privately forced compromises, especially on the part of us Europeans. Now that they are jumping ship, it is like throwing ten years of negotiations out of the window. It jeopardises the whole of the international negotiation system in the environmental sphere. President Bush states that the United States’s economy would be damaged. At the same time, we know that the United States consumes more than twice as much energy per produced unit as is on average the case in the EU. The potential for energy saving in the United States is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened is deeply tragic. The United States’s action means that we Europeans bear that much heavier a responsibility for taking the lead in climate work, for the work must continue, with or without the United States. We must then hope that the United States’s political leadership will listen to reason, for positive cooperation on the part of the United States is crucial in the long run if we are to be able to stabilise the climate. We must not therefore stop at merely criticising and condemning the United States, because we at the same time need a dialogue if we are to succeed in changing President Bush’s decision in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The behaviour of America’s leaders is only the reflection of the behaviour of an entire social class which monopolises the means of production of the entire planet, in the United States, in Europe and elsewhere.

<p class="contents">As you know, we took the initiative of condemning this rejection. Mr Prodi and Mr Persson wrote to President Bush on 14 March to voice our indignation. Mrs Wallström and our Council colleagues spent some of this week in the United States with Mrs Wittman and Mr Armitage, who are the competent persons in the American administration.</p>
<p class="contents">We are not going to settle for these contacts, and we have also decided that this troika will hold talks with Canada and will initiate talks in the coming weeks with Russia, Iran, China and Japan. We have decided to do everything within our power to keep the Kyoto process on track.</p>
<p class="contents">Be that as it may, the American administration has confirmed its unwillingness and hence its refusal to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. It has given no indication of the content of the recently announced re-examination of its policies on climate change or the date on which this information will be made public. The problem is very serious. The only good news, if you can call it that, is that, up to now, nobody has challenged the current state of scientific knowledge on climate change, which is an achievement, and the United States has indicated that it will continue to be involved in future international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström clearly pointed out to our American counterparts that abandoning the Protocol would be a mistake. To start from scratch would not only be a waste of time but would also risk breaking the fragile balance that the Protocol had succeeded in establishing between the industrialised world, which had greatly contributed to the problem, and developing countries whose emissions per inhabitant were far below those of industrialised nations.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the European Union declared its intention to continue negotiations within the Kyoto framework, despite the fact that the United States had dropped out. The Protocol could come into effect if the European Union, the applicant countries, Russia and Japan ratified it. Like Mr de Roo, we believe that the impact of the Protocol will be lessened because of the absence of the biggest polluter on the planet, but we cannot, and we must not, wait for the Americans.</p>
<p class="contents">So we have clearly reaffirmed our commitment to ratify the Kyoto Protocol in 2002 at the latest and, to this end, preparations are under way. This requires us to adopt a consistent approach, which means continuing our efforts to combat climate change. The European programme on climate change that Mrs González mentioned is now in existence. It is under development. We are going to make every effort to move the Protocol forward. We will ratify it and we will ensure that we are consistent.</p>
<p class="contents">You can count on the Commission to continue to fulfil its role as the driving force in matters of climate change, which Mrs Isler-Béguin called for. We will also continue to ensure that the European Union is the driving force at an international level both in terms imparting our values to other countries and also in terms of our own implementation strategy. Like Mrs Myller, I am in no doubt that the two issues will feature on the agenda of the summit between the United States and Europe, which will take place in Gothenburg during the next European Council which, as you know, will be mainly devoted to the environment. This is therefore an important date for us all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
