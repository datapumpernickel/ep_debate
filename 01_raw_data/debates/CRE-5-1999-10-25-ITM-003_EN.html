Ladies and gentlemen, the report and proposal for a decision that I am presenting and briefly explaining on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs concerns the implementation of the interinstitutional agreement on the methods used to investigate fraud. We are tabling this report at the specific request of the President of the European Parliament, taking fully into account the opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control. </p>
<p class="contents">I would like to remind you of the facts that are, actually, very simple. On 6 May 1999, the European Parliament approved this interinstitutional agreement with its own vote in plenary session. On 25 May 1999, the agreement was signed by the President of the European Parliament – Mr Gil-Robles, the President of the Council and the President of the Commission. The Council and the Commission adopted, on 25 May and 2 June respectively, the necessary decisions under their competence concerning the implementation of the agreement within those institutions. We are somewhat late in implementing this agreement, which can, of course, be explained by the hiatus caused by the elections and the start of the new Parliament’s work. We must proceed, however, without further delay in order to avoid any ambiguity regarding our desire to cooperate fully in the more correct and rigorous way fraud will be investigated. In fact it means inserting, in accordance with Rule 186(C) of the Rules of Procedure, a very short new rule – 9(C) – which will allow an annex containing the text of the interinstitutional agreement to be included, in which the necessary technical alterations with regard to our institution’s competences have been introduced. </p>
<p class="contents">To avoid any ambiguity regarding the respective functions and competences of an institution such as the European Parliament and a unit such as OLAF, I would like to stress, Madam President, that both Recital 5 and Article 1(2) state unequivocally that the provisions on privileges and immunity of the Treaties in general, and of the Protocol in particular, will take precedence and will be fully complied with. I would like to add that because concern had been expressed about Article 2 in particular, during the debate of 14 October in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, all of us in the committee agreed on an amendment which now appears as the last paragraph of Article 2 and says: ‘This article applies without prejudice to confidentiality requirements laid down in law or in the European Parliament’s Rule of Procedure.” I therefore believe, ladies and gentlemen, that this text can be adopted without any reservations, especially because the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has unanimously adopted this report and proposal for a decision. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know that this clarification has come at an opportune and important time – at a time when there are widespread calls to tackle, and ultimately root out altogether, fraud and those conditions which nurture it. As you are all aware, the European Parliament showed some awareness of this issue when, some months ago, it adopted a decision containing very specific articles – a decision which Mr Napolitano has incorporated in his report which also contains very specific articles on how we should function and what factors we must consider in order to achieve our goal of combating fraud. </p>
<p class="contents">Now is not the time to re-examine the articles one by one. We all know them very well. However, at this time, it is essential to draw your attention once more to the awareness this House has shown and the awareness the European Parliament has shown on the issue of fraud – an awareness which was turned into action by the internal decision of the European Parliament, and an awareness which is re-formulated in the report and the proposal of Mr Napolitano. It is, I believe, quite significant for this House and it is significant for the institution of the European Parliament that, once again, it is responding to the demands of the European citizens – demands which have been made quite clear of late, particularly during the recent European elections. </p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, you all know that the word “fraud” forms part of our major focuses. On many occasions, we have mentioned the need to combat and eradicate fraud altogether. However, you all know very well that our experience, both in the European Parliament and in Europe, proves that it is not enough just to say this, to go on reiterating that something should be done. We need to take steps – specific steps – and it is up to us to take the first steps since we are the ones who anxiously call for fraud to be tackled and eradicated. Mr Napolitano’s proposal which, as he himself said, was adopted in the Committee of Constitutional Affairs without any objections, is a very clear and very specific step in this direction. For precisely this reason, this House must also vote in favour. At the same time, it would be an oversight on my part if I failed to mention the contribution made by the European Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control which has laid down the right foundations for us in one of its opinions, which can also be found in Mr Napolitano’s report. </p>
<p class="contents">In closing, I would once again like to thank the Chairman of the Committee of Constitutional Affairs, as well as the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I would like to ask the House to vote in favour of the Napolitano report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We give our unqualified support to the report by our colleague Mr Napolitano. We, on the Committee on Budgetary Control, have recommended that the changes that have become necessary as a result of OLAF should be incorporated directly into the Rules of Procedure. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs has suggested that a single basic rule be incorporated into the actual Rules of Procedure and that the full wording – consistent with the interinstitutional agreement – be added as an appendix. That is perfectly acceptable. It is crucial that the substance remains unchanged. The key point, as has already been mentioned, is that we, as a Parliament, should give a clear signal that we are not just demanding or stipulating that others should be subject to investigations by an external, independent authority, but that we want to subject ourselves to this process too. I would have liked us to be able to discuss this decision of Parliament’s together with the question of appointing the new director of OLAF. We had planned to hold the hearing for shortlisted candidates last week, in the Committee on Budgetary Control. The Commission, however, did not draw up the definitive list of candidates in time. Some people, moreover, have the impression that we have sought to interfere improperly with an appointment procedure that is, and must remain, the responsibility of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet those who have this impression overlook or gloss over the fact that this is by no means a normal appointment procedure, rather it is a matter of filling a key post that has far-reaching powers and the right to conduct administrative investigations into every organisation and institution of the Union. The Regulation on OLAF of 25 May 1999 lays down specifically that the Commission can only appoint its director once Parliament and the Council have voted. Therefore, there must be harmony between the three bodies. This procedure was chosen to guarantee the director’s independence. I hope that this week, here in Strasbourg, we will succeed in resolving the confusion over the procedure which has emerged. Ultimately, we must not be the ones to delay any decision of this kind when, almost exactly a year ago, the overwhelming majority of Members of this House gave their support to the idea of launching an independent anti-fraud office.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say “another” building block, because since last year this Parliament has had the toughest provisions of almost any parliament in Europe as regards the declaration of the financial interests of its Members and it already has, in the Rules of Procedure, one of the toughest provisions as regards the behaviour of lobbyists within the institution.</p>
<p class="contents">This interinstitutional agreement takes us one step further in another direction with the obligation it would place on all Members and staff to use the proper procedures to inform the future office, the OLAF office, so that any allegations of fraud can be properly investigated.</p>
<p class="contents">The interinstitutional agreement has been signed by the other institutions, and indeed already adopted as regards the internal provisions both by the Council and by the Commission, where it applies both to the politicians and to the staff alike. Today we shall be adopting the same or very similar provisions for ourselves. I was very glad to hear in the debate so far that the EPP Group now appears to accept that these provisions should also apply within Parliament to the Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">There was a question on this but I think we solved it satisfactorily in committee by the compromise amendment tabled by Mr Gil-Robles and myself, which specified that application of this interinstitutional agreement is without prejudice to any provisions in law or in our Rules of Procedure as regards an obligation of confidentiality upon Members. Now that has been clarified, there is no reason whatsoever not to apply this interinstitutional agreement in full. I am pleased that, at least as far as the speakers that have spoken until now are concerned, this should be something we can achieve today.</p>
<p class="contents">To postpone it further or, even worse, to fail to approve this interinstitutional agreement and to fail to apply it internally would be a severe embarrassment to the European Parliament and one that would undermine the good work that this Parliament has done in rebuilding the credibility of the European Union in matters relating to fraud and financial mismanagement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We regret, in fact, the delay of four months now in Parliament bringing the report to a conclusion. A failure or further delay would be catastrophic for Parliament’s reputation with its public.</p>
<p class="contents">The centrepiece of the decision is Article 2. This will avoid a potential van Buitenen affair emerging from inside Parliament’s own ranks. The final clause of Article 2 is slightly cryptic, and questions will arise about its meaning.

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Maes (Greens/ALE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Madam President, I am very keen to add my congratulations to those extended to the rapporteur and fully concur with the previous speakers who actually said that they will support this report. I could stop there, but since I have four minutes of speaking time, for once, as opposed to two I will say something more on the subject after all.</p>
<p class="contents">The call for more openness and transparency is closely bound up with the call for more democracy that is ringing out loud and clear across Europe, not least in relation to the institutions of the European Community. Parliament – and we have been reminded of this – was most insistent in its calls for clarity during the last part-session and made a stand against dirty tricks and fraud. When I arrived here a year ago I saw the reports produced by the Committee on Budgetary Control, the report by Mr Bösch, how many meetings there were under Mrs Theato’s leadership, and the protest being made by Mr van Buitenen. It all revolved around the question of clarity and transparency. This therefore led to an interinstitutional agreement being produced, which we welcomed. It may not have contained everything we could have wished for but it was still a very honourable compromise and went further than Parliament had been able to manage. But all this happened back on 25 May 1999. The Council, the Commission and Parliament have now reached agreement in principle but OLAF, the new anti-fraud office, was unable to set to work because, on the one hand, a formal ruling still had to be issued by the Bureau for the purpose of making the procedures applicable to Parliament’s services and, on the other, we have yet to take up responsibility ourselves, as a Parliament, so that we as individuals, our services, and our working practices also become subject to the same supervision that we impose on the Commission and on Parliament’s services. I therefore think it is absolutely essential that we take this step here today. There are, of course, individuals who have raised formal objections, and rightly so, but the rapporteur’s expertise and that of the people who have assisted him in compiling the texts, completely reassures us that there is no further cause for any objections and that we have crystal clear texts which will make the procedures applicable to Parliament itself, providing we add this amendment. Consequently, we are in favour of this happening without delay, for imagine if the reverse were to be the case. It does not bear thinking about, Madam President.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the worst moments I have ever experienced in this Parliament occurred when we voted on the Statute, for there is still no sign whatsoever of a European Statute despite all the hoo-ha that was made about it at the time and despite all the praiseworthy efforts on the part of our Parliament. The fact that the “best” result had not been achieved was used as an argument for not pursuing something that would merely be “good”. I believe that in this case there is not even an argument for taking such a line, and that we can give our full support – in the firm belief that all formal objections have been resolved – to the proposed texts, so that the fight against fraud will be something to be undertaken not just by others but also by ourselves. The obligation to provide information that we impose on others will also apply to us, and we will be subject to the same supervision that we require others to submit to. I was often asked at the time if, in view of the fact that Parliament wanted to subject the Commission to more stringent supervision and to impose on it a stricter regime for combating fraud, Parliament would also live by the same code? I will be ashamed if we are unable to adopt this unanimously.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Berthu (UEN).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, my group is totally supportive of the interinstitutional agreement of 25 May 1999 on the internal investigations which the anti-fraud office must be able to carry out within the institutions, bodies or agencies of the Communities, including the European Parliament. This seems to us an excellent agreement. It is indeed necessary to react vigorously to any suspicion of fraud of any nature whatsoever.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, rather more puzzled when faced with the measure to be applied with regard to the European Parliament which has been proposed to us today, in the form of an amendment to Parliament’s Rules of Procedure, directed at both officials and Members of Parliament. I feel that we have simultaneously moved too fast in one respect and not fast enough in another. Not fast enough because, as regards the officials, it seems unnecessary to me to wait until the end of October before taking an implementing decision applying to parliamentary officials. A simple Bureau decision taken under Rule 22(5) of the Rules of Procedure would have been sufficient.</p>
<p class="contents">But perhaps we have moved too fast regarding the Members of Parliament, and here I plead guilty before Mr Napolitano, chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, as I am a member of this committee. But perhaps the debate in plenary session will enable us to make good some omissions. We should at least have found it strange, considering that this does not exist in many parliamentary democracies, that Members of the elected House may be monitored by a body which is more or less answerable to the Executive and, as it happens, although OLAF is supervised by an independent supervisory committee, it is still run by a manager appointed by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">This observation should bring us back to the interpretation of Recital 4 and Article 1 of the interinstitutional agreement defining the persons whose breaches of discipline may be subject to administrative inquiries by OLAF. The persons targeted are the personnel subject to the Staff Regulations and Conditions of employment of other servants as well as, I quote, ‘Members, heads or members of staff of the institutions, bodies and agencies of the Communities not subject to the Staff Regulations’. I think that this wording and the reference to the Staff Regulations in particular show that the members and personnel involved here are employees rather than elected representatives. In any case the Members of the European Parliament are subject to specific rules under the Treaty itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, Madam President, I think that Members of Parliament must, of course, be subject to a rigorous internal inspection system, and I am the first to say so, but I do not believe that the text establishing this control should be one that is simply derived from the standard decision applicable to just any individual within the administrative bodies of the Community. The Members of Parliament must be covered by a specific decision which could perhaps envisage a separate supervisory board, for parliamentary inquiries, for example, which would be elected by this House at the beginning of each legislative term. This text could quite naturally be included in an Annex to our Rules of Procedure, whilst it would not be necessary for the text on officials to be included.</p>
<p class="contents">If, however, my fellow Members considered it politically impossible to postpone the adoption of the current draft legislation, and I am not that far from their point of view, I think that a reform should still be started fairly quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bonde (EDD).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam President, the best way of combating fraud is not to appoint more inspectors but to implement, in our own Parliament too, a policy of complete openness about subsidies and administration. It is the present culture of secrecy which is the fraudsters’ best defence. All administration and all subsidies are nowadays dealt with by computer. It is a very simple matter to give our citizens access to the information on the Internet. Everyone can see, at the library or on their own computer, who has received what amount and for what purpose. If a company or an association wants there to be confidentiality about any subsidies it receives, then it is free to use its own resources to ensure this. If a company, a municipality or a Member of this Parliament wants a subsidy from myself and other European taxpayers, I want to know what I am supporting. I ask that funds should be seen as being entrusted to our care and that they should not, en route to their recipients, be wasted or siphoned off by fraudsters. But no matter how many people we appoint to OLAF, fraud is, at best, only going to be slightly reduced. We need to go to the root of the problem if we want to stamp out fraud.</p>
<p class="contents">The first prerequisite for doing this is a radical reduction in the number of projects and subsidy schemes the EU operates. Brussels ought only to be granting subsidies to cross-frontier projects or in cases where each country is too small to be able to carry out the projects concerned on its own. It should not be the EU’s job to decide if taxpayers’ funds are to go to a church in Christiansfeld or a golf course in North Jutland. Prioritising of this kind can be done much better by Danish voters and politicians. Nor should it be the EU’s job to decide whether motorways or schools are to be built in Alentejo with the help of EU subsidies. We can safely leave those decisions to Portuguese voters and their representatives. Funds are more efficiently transferred to poor Member States from the rich countries in the north by reducing or completely doing away with the contributions paid by poor countries to the EU. At present, EU subsidies mean more often than not that poor people in rich countries are taxed for the benefit of rich people in poor countries. None of us ourselves want to pursue a policy of wealth distribution of this kind, but this is happening nonetheless because of the EU’s numerous systems for granting subsidies. For example, 20% of farmers receive 80% of subsidies. We ought instead to make all subsidy schemes transparent. Our citizens will then ensure that they are done away with. The newspapers will write about the absurdities entailed. And then the voters and the various organisations will get involved. In this way, living democracy will ensure that incentives to fraud are abolished and that the fraud which does go on is revealed. To combat any remaining fraud, it is a splendid idea for the police authorities in the Member States to cooperate with each other. On the other hand, we have no need for a Corpus Juris, a common prosecution service, penal legislation and a European answer to the FBI. These things are aimed not at reducing crime but only at creating a new state and developing a more intrusive European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I totally agree with Mrs Maes that complete openness about subsidies and subsidy schemes will make the job easier for OLAF’s new director. So who is this to be? My group proposes that we do not turn the decision into an election battle between left and right. We ought instead to unite around the best qualified candidate and be content with nominating him or her for the job. For years, the Council has approved faulty accounts and so disqualified itself from finding the right candidate. The Commission has positively concealed fraud and so shown the need for an independent director of OLAF. As the situation stands, a unanimous nomination from the European Parliament is therefore the best solution, and my group sincerely hopes that we can find a director for OLAF who will take decisions to prevent any fraud in future. And because, Madam President, Parliament must clearly abide by the same rules, I too am voting for the agreement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have taken note of the consensus which seems to reign in this House on this matter, but I have the impression that there are a number of us who, in spite of everything, have doubts and some concerns regarding the wording of this agreement and this amendment to the Rules of Procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the creation of an anti-fraud office, logically designed to ensure that the Community budget is handled properly, have anything to do with the establishment of all-round supervision, exercised without discrimination, not only of basic staff but also, as someone has already mentioned, of the members of institutions?</p>
<p class="contents">I have read the rule governing members of the Council. Do you really believe that the Ministers of European States, despite the little phrase which was added, will stand for effective supervision of their professional activity? This in a way draws a parallel between the role of the member to that of the civil servant who is subject to supervision both under the Staff Regulations and also within the framework of his responsibilities. I do not want Members to be exempt from all monitoring or not to be subjected to any sort of questioning regarding their activities including their activities as a Member of Parliament in the execution of their mandate, but I am afraid that this agreement may allow some uncertainty to remain and may entail precisely this parallel nature of the roles if we proceed in an over-hasty way, just like the events of recent months, and do not take a step back. For my part, I would have preferred to wait a while, just as some groups suggested at one point, in order to gain a more objective overview.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the provisions which we have implemented require further thought. There is certainly a contradiction between the fundamental decision and the application thereof. We inherited this matter, and indeed I even wonder why it was not considered to have lapsed. This House even decided that it was necessary to proceed to a new vote on Mr Prodi as the decision was taken on 4 May.</p>
<p class="contents">On 6 May, the previous Parliament adopted a text which has since been changed. That text has the force of law. President Gil-Robles signed it at a time when everyone was involved in election campaigns and now, two or three months later, we are involved in making it enforceable.</p>
<p class="contents">There is food for thought here. My own opinion is that a little time would perhaps enable us to gain more objectivity and better understanding of the margin we must retain within the framework of the protocol on privileges and immunities in the event that we all become subject to OLAF decisions or inquiries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am also reminded of a past event. On 7 October 1998, so a good year ago, there was an overwhelming two-thirds majority here in Strasbourg for Mr Bösch’s report on OLAF and thus for the establishment of an operationally independent anti-fraud office. In view of the reproaches that were already being made in the Chamber at the time, we had asked that OLAF be an investigative body that should be able to pursue cases of fraud or corruption objectively and without reservations. The first draft from the Commission of the time was unusable. We pressed for changes. Then, in May of this year, together with the Council, we adopted the Regulation on OLAF and the three of us, Parliament, the Council and the Commission, reached a decision on the interinstitutional agreement that we are discussing today. </p>
<p class="contents">This agreement, if you like, opens the door for OLAF. It sets out the obligations and rights of those affected by investigations. Through this, we are giving, amongst other things, a clear response to the much-discussed ‘whistle-blower’ question. Any official who has concrete grounds for believing that he is dealing with a case of fraud or corruption will, in the future, not only be obliged to pass this on but will also have the right – bypassing their superior if need be – to go directly to OLAF if they feel this to be necessary. The official should not be disadvantaged in any way as a result of taking this action. </p>
<p class="contents">There is another important point in this regard which has been a grey area in the past. This concerns the information given to those affected by an investigation. This information must, in the future, be provided as quickly as possible. In no case must Members of this Parliament, officials or employees be singled out in conclusions by name, without the person concerned having been given the opportunity to state their case. With this we have clearly established the contradictory principle. Any exceptions to this will only be possible with the agreement of the President or the Secretary-General and only then in strictly circumscribed individual cases concerning particularly complex investigations and in which providing the individuals concerned with information at too early a stage could endanger the work of national judicial authorities. </p>
<p class="contents">These are the two main components of the interinstitutional agreement. They were approved on 6 May 1999 here in Strasbourg with a large majority. The political decisions that were made at that time must now be firmly and formally established in Parliament’s Rules of Procedure so that they can become legally effective. I know from conversations that I have had that some colleagues are concerned, and this concern has been expressed here too, that investigations by OLAF could be misused in order to put pressure on them, even though they are very well aware that it is a matter of our credibility that we as MEPs should not exclude ourselves from such investigations. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two different aspects to this. Firstly, through OLAF, the Protocol on privileges and immunities which gives this Parliament and its work special protection, will not be abrogated. Therefore it will still be the case that it will be up to national judicial authorities to apply for immunity to be revoked should the need arise, following which this House will then have to take its own decision on the matter. Secondly, we have taken all conceivable precautions to ensure the independence of this office in its investigative work, even though it is officially, and organisationally, a department of the Commission. As the body of political control, we shall intervene if this independence is infringed. This is why I must take this opportunity to advise the Commission that I do not find the recent appointment of a new divisional head for OLAF acceptable. This is not a criticism of the person concerned, whom I do not even know, but a criticism of the fact that rapid attempts are obviously still being made here to pre-empt matters before the new director arrives. This situation must be reversed. </p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">The new Commission must be careful to ensure that in this regard too, there is not the slightest hint of suspicion either. </p>
<p class="contents">A brief word on the appointment procedure for the new director, as there has been some confusion. After the Commission draws up the definitive list of suitable candidates, it becomes a political matter for Parliament and the Council to reach agreement between themselves on the best candidates. I refer to what Mr Bonde so rightly said: the new director faces a huge challenge which will require a high degree of experience, independence and the ability to assert oneself. We are involved then in a very important decision-making procedure. Let us make good use of it. </p>

I believe that along with my group, I can give my full backing to President Napolitano’s report, because the amendment to the Rules of Procedure and the proposed decision are a serious response to the concern that Members might be subjected to excessive and arbitrary checks – a concern which has been voiced of late, most recently by Mr Dell’Alba. I think that there is no reason to delay the decision any longer. The European Parliament and its Members have a wide range of means available to defend themselves in the event of these investigations. This will clearly become easier if the internal procedures are made clearer and more transparent. We must have confidence in OLAF’s future work and make its work easier. Only in this way can we react in a credible way in the event of abuse, and react effectively to episodes like those mentioned today by Mr Theato and Mr Bösch.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The establishment of this office was a very significant decision because combating fraud plays a central role in the way the citizens of our Member States perceive European politics. This is why the general public expects this office to be able to perform its task thoroughly, and this ability to perform its task thoroughly will relate primarily to the institutions in which OLAF is able to carry out investigations, and I therefore welcome Mr Napolitano’s report and the contributions that have been made here. </p>
<p class="contents">The appointment of the director will obviously play a major role in the office’s ability to do its job. A special appointment procedure was agreed on and has been emphasised here several times. That is why it is also necessary to prevent irregularities in this procedure. I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, and you, Mr Bösch, that I, for my part, will prevent any improper influence being exerted on the selection of a director. The only decisive factor in appointing someone to this extremely important post should be that person’s qualifications for the job. I hope that very soon the selection of the candidates and the appointment of a director will take place, through consensus, and also that the posts you have already approved for this year will soon be filled. </p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission is fully aware of the role that combating fraud plays in the way European politics are perceived by our citizens and therefore, on behalf of the Commission, I once again welcome the report and the work that went into it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
