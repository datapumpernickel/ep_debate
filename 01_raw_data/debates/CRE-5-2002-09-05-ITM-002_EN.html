<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Van Brempt (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, today we are discussing a report on an area for lifelong learning. This report forms part of a process started a few years ago which has already received some attention at the Stockholm and Lisbon European Councils, for example. However, it was primarily the Feira European Council that concluded that lifelong learning would be crucial to the development of our European society in terms of social cohesion, employment opportunities and suchlike. It also called on the Member States, the Commission and Parliament to develop strategies and a policy. It is in this framework that we now view the Commission communication and, particularly, the memorandum that was published prior to this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should now like to take some time to consider the areas of attention which Parliament highlights in its report. Allow me to start with the principles on which the concept of lifelong learning should be based. This is a matter of great importance and often discussed, but the question is: are we using the same guiding principles? We have already underlined a number of these principles in Parliament's first report. I shall outline them here very quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is democratisation and the principle of equality – of crucial importance, in my view. If we fail to provide better and equal access to education and training via lifelong learning, then we have failed in our objective. Everyone knows that there is a yawning chasm between the highly qualified and the poorly qualified. If we cannot reduce this chasm and do not succeed in doing this via lifelong learning, then we have failed.</p>
<p class="contents">A second crucial principle is, in fact, the right to individual personality development. This does not only encompass lifelong learning, it also recognises the wider social value of lifelong learning. This is about the right to work on one's own personality development without necessarily focusing on the jobs. In addition, we need to strike the right balance between, on the one hand, a right that we have to create for our citizens, a right that we, as a government, must be able to make reality on the basis of our own resources, and, on the other hand, the individual's duties and responsibility.</p>
<p class="contents">A second vital aspect which still needs a great deal of attention – and I am addressing the Commission, in particular, here – is formal and informal learning. Formal learning is very important in the Union, because we need to ensure that our citizens' qualifications are also recognised in Member States other than their own and that the citizens know that their qualifications are equivalent elsewhere. This is why the Commission has proposed the European curriculum vitae, to be replaced in due course by the portfolio system. I welcome these, but they strike me as somewhat vague and the link with informal learning is distinctly missing.</p>
<p class="contents">Informal learning is precisely what this is all about. We must ensure that we can validate, certify and also verify informal competences, or the competences acquired elsewhere, for this is, once again, the key difference between those who have a qualification and who can build on it, and those who do not have a qualification, those who have already dropped out. We could incorporate the latter by recognising informal learning. In this area, the Commission still has a great deal of work to do, Commissioner, for we are, in fact, nowhere at the moment. Along with my fellow MEPs, I trust that you, together with the Member States, will develop the instruments required for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already mentioned individual personality development and the fact that not only is lifelong learning is important, it is important to recognise its wider social value too. In my first report, and now in the second report as well, I have introduced the concept of the individual learning account. We would very explicitly ask the Commission to look into this and consider, working together with the European Investment Bank, whether we could not free up resources to invest in what is so valuable to us, namely our human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish off with a few critical remarks. I notice that we in the Union are capable of formulating clear objectives, or even of enforcing them. The Maastricht standard, the employment strategies and the benchmarks all prove this point. In the field of scientific research, we have the courage to introduce a benchmark, but we are clearly lacking the political courage to do this for education and lifelong learning. This is, in fact, causing me concern, for I do believe that it is vital that we should do this.</p>
<p class="contents">On a final note, I should like to say that we must find a new way of describing 'lifelong learning' as a matter of urgency, for it sounds like a sentence. If we have to say to our school leavers: you have done well, you have your qualifications now and you can now learn for the rest of your lives, then this will hardly motivate them. We can write the finest speeches and adopt the finest policies, but if our people and our students refuse to cooperate, then I fear, Commissioner, that these words will not be translated into action. And this is exactly what we need to avoid. I therefore suggest we might need to involve a communications agency that can produce a different name for lifelong learning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This report confirms, if confirmation were needed, the importance that Parliament attaches to our action in the field of lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also pleased to note that Parliament supports the broad principles that the Commission has emphasised in its communication, in particular with regard to the broad objectives that lifelong learning seeks to achieve and the need for every citizen, and I stress, every citizen, to have access to education and to lifelong learning. We know that, today, we are far from achieving the target: only 8% of European adults have access to lifelong learning and almost two out of ten young people leave the educational system without any qualifications. This is an unsustainable situation common to all our Member States. On this matter, I am relieved to note that most of the ministers are addressing this problem, which is already a scandal, before the new school year starts. What is needed, therefore, to resolve these two problems – education and lifelong learning – is the mobilisation of all the actors involved and of the financial resources needed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, Parliament addresses a number of points in its report. I should like to highlight three of them: basic skills, investment and the European area of education and lifelong learning. With regard to basic skills, our objective is clear: every European citizen must have these skills in order to be able to learn, work and live in the knowledge-based society. I say ‘live’ because personal development and the capacity to play a role in our society, in our democracies are also important. I am thinking, in particular, of the most disadvantaged, who also have to learn to read, write and count. We know, however, that illiteracy is still a major problem and that the main obstacle to social integration, as Mrs Hermange’s report also emphasised, is this lack of basic knowledge. I shall also add to this basic knowledge the ‘digital divide’ between those who have access to the new technologies and those who do not. Lastly, I should like, if I may, to return to one of my favourite themes: the failure to acquire foreign language skills and the lack of personal and social skills.</p>
<p class="contents">The Member States and the Commission are currently working on the issue of basic skills by implementing the work programme on objectives for education and training systems. Together, we have identified the basic skills needed and there will be an exchange of best practices in order to see, together, what works, what does not work, what can done by certain people and what must be worked on by everyone. The conclusions of this work will be included in the interim report which the Education Council and the Commission present at the European Council in spring 2004. Mr Chairman of the Committee on Culture, as promised, your committee will be involved in this.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is funding. This is a delicate matter, as you know, for which the Member States are largely responsible. If we want to create a genuine system of lifelong learning, if we want to translate our political ambitions into practical actions, we, not only the Member States but also the social partners, will clearly have to spend more. It is indeed true, Mrs Van Brempt, that where lifelong learning is concerned, we are leaving the framework of formal education and entering that of informal education, and, as a result, are working with partners which are not traditionally academic.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, therefore, start by defining national strategies. In this field, the Member States have made some progress, especially those which lagged the furthest behind. What needs to be done now is to improve the coherence of the strategies – a coherence which is, most of the time, I am bound to say, lacking – and to translate these strategies into practical actions. This is where we must develop the partnerships that you underline in your report. Because lifelong learning is a shared responsibility, national strategies must be the result of agreements at all levels, including at the local level, and between all operators, in particular the social partners. Unfortunately, attempts to achieve this are very inconsistent and not nearly forceful enough.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point concerns the European area. Although responsibility for implementing these policies falls primarily to the Member States, the Community itself has a role to play in creating a European area of education and lifelong learning. An area in which citizens, whoever they are and whatever country they come from, can transfer their skills and their qualifications from one country to another, for the purpose of studying, training, working, getting involved or just living. We now know, and we have already discussed this on several occasions, that a number of obstacles to the creation of such an area exist, mainly with regard to the recognition of qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">A great deal of progress has been made in this field, however, and rest assured, ladies and gentlemen, that the Commission is working on this, to ensure that we achieve the recognition of qualifications and that, especially in the field of vocational training, we are able to open up new perspectives and use new common working methods.</p>
<p class="contents">A political initiative has been taken to strengthen cooperation between Member States in the field of vocational training. This is generally known as the Bruges process, because it is in the beautiful city of Bruges that national ministers and the Commission decided to adopt this approach. Various projects are currently underway, such as that established by the former French Minister, Mr Mélenchon, which is a model of its kind. New initiatives are, therefore, being taken, progress is being made, and I must say that, despite all the difficulties that exist, governments are moving in the direction described because they have understood the absolute need for such measures.</p>
<p class="contents">At the next Education Council, which is due to take place in November, a resolution must be adopted. This will also be debated by the governments of the 30 countries that will be meeting at the end of the year. We will, therefore, be extending the issue of education and lifelong learning to encompass our future partners in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as my own involvement is concerned, I shall say this: my staff are in the process of implementing the communication. A European website on the various options for learning will be up and running before the end of the year. In forthcoming weeks we shall be launching other actions such as the creation of European learning region networks and the establishment of a database on best practices. These will all be very practical measures because we have studied the problems and we understand them. We know what we need to do, so let us make a start!</p>

Despite all our agreements, despite the fact that we all recognise that training and lifelong learning must be linked to the world of work if they are to yield any returns, we have a problem and there is a vacuum. Training and lifelong learning are based on education, which has huge problems of its own, and training cannot replace a poor education. We have huge inequalities between the Member States in the field of education, as the report acknowledges, and consequently we also have huge vacuums and huge problems in lifelong training.</p>
<p class="contents">One typical example is that we have yet to reach an agreement on what constitute basic skills in education. Whenever ΟECD statistics are published on the different countries, there is an outcry and there are some countries which find the criteria used hard to accept. Likewise, education systems need to be changed and improved. But what are we, the European Union, doing about it? We try to coordinate but do little else. That, I think, is a huge political shortcoming.</p>
<p class="contents">What are the Member States doing about their lifelong learning strategy? At least one in two Member States has no specific strategy and a strategy is vital if we are to have economic development, if we are to improve industry and mobility and if we are to improve unemployment programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that one very important factor would be if the Member States were to set a budget. Similarly, lifelong learning should be able to reach the underprivileged, the unskilled, people who left school early, the unemployed and, of course, immigrants. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We talk about the forthcoming knowledge society and about lifelong learning, and there are no limits to what we all want. However, this is only a kind of policy of piracy, since the reality of education policy in the Member States is completely different. Priorities have to be set and expenditure on education has to be weighed up against other forms of expenditure. Education budgets are being cut at the moment. It is not, therefore, very helpful if we sit here discussing our long lists.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of drawing up long lists, we should prioritise. We should prioritise the most important items of expenditure. I agree with those who say that, if this is the case, we should prioritise the needs of the undereducated, for education exaggerates differences unless some sort of compensation is built in. I would point out, in particular, two aspects that I believe are important and that are perhaps not adequately stressed in the long lists.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, there is a great need for proper vocational retraining. It is not enough to have a little training here, a bit of additional training there and an extra course there. Training is needed if people are to be able to shift from jobs that are no longer required – agricultural workers, lumberjacks or fishermen, for example – to jobs in an expanding service sector. A transition such as this cannot be achieved after a six-week course. Instead, long training programmes are required. Such programmes are quite expensive, however, and it is consequently difficult to obtain political support for them, yet this is vital since we in Europe are facing major problems of structural change that will require radical job changes.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to emphasise training organisations or training on the job. This is, of course, mentioned in the Commission’s justification, but it should be accorded greater attention. Since we know that it will be difficult to get funding for in-school training, it is extremely important that we try to create the kinds of organisations and jobs that provide scope for continuous training, education and learning as part of the labour process. It is difficult to send people on courses, but it is perhaps easier, cheaper and better to make sure that people can learn on the job. We can take the new IT sector as an example. All the small IT firms that sprang up in the 1990s could afford to let people experiment and learn in the workplace, and the IT sector was very successful. That is something we can learn from . </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This being so, we urgently need a European policy to give momentum to this sector and, from this point of view, I congratulate you on your initiatives, Commissioner, and I congratulate our rapporteur on her excellent report.</p>
<p class="contents">As the draftsperson of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities, I should like to point out that the only way of achieving a European policy on lifelong learning is to take serious account of the new order created by the mass, dynamic entry of women on to the job market. Women are currently the most dynamic force behind development because, as you know, two-thirds of the new jobs which it is estimated will be created over the next ten years will be filled by women. We therefore need to take serious account of the gender dimension when we take policy decisions and apply measures which will abolish direct and indirect discrimination against women, given that such discrimination always comes at the expense of the viable development and competitiveness of the economy.</p>
<p class="contents">An active lifelong learning policy needs to be designed with women's needs in mind, which means involving women, improving their skills, widening their professional choices, removing glass ceilings, ensuring there is a balance between men and women in the sciences and new technologies and abolishing gender-based divisions of the job market.</p>
<p class="contents">You spoke, Commissioner, of the digital divide. This digital divide applies mainly to women. We also need to give special attention to the most vulnerable groups of women, such as immigrants, women in rural areas and elderly women.</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, the gender mainstreaming policy and the need to reconcile family life and work must become part of the overall policy to promote lifelong learning. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I feel that the effort being made by Europe is not really being reflected in the results. It is very difficult to establish these principles, to establish a system of quality evaluation, and to develop the right types of teaching so that lifelong learning can genuinely become a common basis throughout people’s lives.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I believe that the measures we should adopt should include an increase in monitoring and inspection and the clarification of quality indicators, and they should be of differing types, and, above all, it seems to me extremely important to ensure that training be established throughout the territory. This type of training is usually available in the big cities. Rural areas and the most distant extremes of the regions, on the other hand, are not usually so well served.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that, from now on, we must implement a policy of proximity, of accessibility, and that really is sustainable development: bringing education closer to people and making it more flexible. Furthermore, there are huge numbers of complaints from companies that they cannot find qualified staff, and we have a very high level of unemployment given the economic situation supporting it too. In this respect, I believe that we must implement these expansion policies throughout the territory and prevent education causing people to be uprooted from their regions, as many women are because they have to move away to be educated. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Commissioner Reding has appropriately described the situation regarding education and training as undergoing a quiet revolution. This description is also true in a negative sense. The European Parliament and its Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport have barely played any part in setting targets for education and training. Furthermore, the open coordination method that has been adopted in the education sector has caused the main focus of the debate to move away from the forum of democratically elected bodies to one made up of civil servants. Now that Kathleen Van Brempt has produced her excellent report, we have a good opportunity to talk about lifelong learning here in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">An economy built on people’s knowledge and skills will be more successful the more widely human resources are used. Ensuring that all our citizens keep up with developments as best they can is not only an ethically sustainable policy but also one that is wise and practical. Lifelong learning is becoming increasingly important with regard to citizens’ participation, boosting employment and regeneration of the workforce. It would help employment and increase motivation if there were a clearer link between lifelong learning and qualifications based on the needs of industry. Nevertheless, I want to stress the importance of the point made in the Committee on Culture’s report that lifelong learning is not merely a social necessity. It must also be a social right for everyone, irrespective of their age, sex or social background.</p>
<p class="contents">Equality of education is, for many reasons, very difficult to bring about. However, it is precisely education that is the path to equality. For that reason I wish to emphasise the need for setting special targets so that the provision of lifelong learning can be made to include people who failed to finish their secondary education, are untrained, have special needs and learning difficulties, or who are socially underprivileged. We should remember that a quality secondary education creates a basis for lifelong learning. It is not very realistic, for example, to consider demanding IT skills if a person’s literacy and numeracy skills are inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">Although it is the responsibility of Member States to organise education, we need practical European targets and measures. The Commission communication is a step in the right direction. We also have to try to achieve consensus on what the basic skills mentioned at Lisbon – knowledge of information and communication technologies, foreign languages, science, entrepreneurship and social skills – actually consist of. It is easier to achieve aims if we know what we are aiming at. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In 2002, there are still more than a million people in the Netherlands who are functionally illiterate, and I think that the situation is not much better in other Member States. It is therefore for a good reason that the European Union – my congratulations to Mrs Reding, incidentally – is giving this topic so much attention. It might be an idea, after the Johannesburg Summit, to organise a world summit in Brussels on functional illiteracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the memorandum, and having defined the strategy and priorities, we are now about to make the European area for lifelong learning a reality. This receives my warm support. My group has always endorsed the rapporteur's previous reports and, I should like to thank her now for her sound report. I still have two minor observations to make.</p>
<p class="contents">Permanent education is a sweeping term and can range from teaching correct manners to very technical further training courses, from infant education to university courses. Anyone can become involved – all governments, all public establishments. Nevertheless, I should like to drive home the message that we should not lose sight of the quality of education. We may need to set up a quality evaluation programme for this purpose, as is done in regular education. I therefore endorse the request to exchange information, experiences and best practices at European level and to set up and maintain a European database. This will obviously require the support of the European Commission as a matter of vital necessity. Moreover, in this way, it is possible to reach mutual recognition with regard to credits, certificates and qualifications obtained, which is crucial to mobility.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw the attention to the importance of the citizens' own responsibility for their education. It is up to them to decide whether they want to work on it and thus enhance their chances within the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The link is clear, and was, furthermore, emphasised by the Feira European Council, where it was stated that ‘education and lifelong learning are an essential policy for the development of citizenship’.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, as everyone has said, education and learning must be accessible to everyone so that everyone has the same opportunities to find their place in society. As we know, however, we are a long way from achieving this objective. Inequalities become clear as soon as children enter the educational system, and are responsible for many academic failures, before breeding social exclusion in later life. This is a downward spiral and hence the vital importance of adopting a coordinated strategy at European level which provides access for every European citizen to a decent and sufficient minimum standard of education and of learning. The Commission communication attempts to respond to this ambitious project. Several proposals are, furthermore, of the greatest interest, even if they would benefit from being clarified and complemented by the provisions contained in Mrs Van Brempt’s report, on which we are about to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the fact that the Commission is advocating the right of every citizen, including those who have left school early, to acquire basic skills via free compensatory learning in later life. We also support the idea that the Commission should, working closely with the Member States, put in place a European framework to define the basic skills that all pupils have to have acquired. With regard to training, I support the request for the Commission to implement clear strategies with adequate funding for the chapter concerning lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in order to create a European area of education, equal opportunities in the field of education and training must be guaranteed for everyone, in particular for women, through close cooperation between all the social actors concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the integration programmes designed for immigrants should exist even for pre-school pupils.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall finish by very warmly congratulating Mrs Van Brempt on her work and her report and by pointing out that education and lifelong learning are not only a social necessity but a major social right too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, not everyone has access to this knowledge base. The proposals on lifelong learning are an emerging response to this deficit, but only an emerging one. It is not simply a matter of training for particular job skills, although people with a low educational base face a higher risk of unemployment and such inequalities of education need to be particularly targeted in the case of both women and men.</p>
<p class="contents">Training cannot replace a poor education and there is considerable risk that those with a strong education base will benefit further from lifelong learning and those without it will become even further marginalised. This should be of particular concern.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposals are encouraging, but it is far from clear how they will be implemented and funded. Here, the rapporteur has done an excellent job in firming up rather vague proposals. This is not the fault of the Commissioner, whose commitment is not in doubt, but is due to the difficulties in coordinating education across the Member States when there is no clear European responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I am constantly having to learn about new things in order to be able to continue to do my job. What is more, I am also having to remain abreast of the latest developments in order to be able to communicate by e-mail with my children and grandchildren. I still learn something new every day using my computer.</p>
<p class="contents">Lifelong learning is therefore not a policy model; it is a fact. I subscribe to the need for lifelong learning. Accordingly, I consider it necessary for the government to adopt a proactive stance in order to enable the public to acquire new knowledge continuously. The current policy in many Member States leaves something to be desired in this respect. The measures are aimed at employers, local councils and benefit agencies, but not at motivating the individual citizen.</p>
<p class="contents">The best approach is one whereby the government pays for the education that a person receives before entering the labour market. Thereafter, employees should be responsible for their own development. In this context, the government and employers need to ensure that the right preconditions and financial support are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">Within Europe, we will then be able to establish these preconditions together in order to guarantee the public – even those reaching retirement age – ongoing participation in the labour process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We had great expectations for this communication because we all knew that the Member States had made almost no progress in the field since the Lisbon Council. If we genuinely wish to create a Europe of knowledge by encouraging equal opportunities, it is crucial to offer every citizen of the Union equal access to education and to lifelong learning. With a view to the translation of this strategy into practical action, I shall focus on a number of points.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, we must make efforts in the area of the recognition and transferability of learning and qualifications by making use of already existing networks or by creating new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, access to lifelong learning must be provided for all employees and for jobseekers. It therefore falls to the Commission to promote all Member State initiatives in this area and, wherever possible, to propose specific programmes designed, for example, for jobseekers or for young people without qualifications.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is crucial to agree on a target for annual expenditure in the field of education and lifelong learning and to provide fiscal or other incentives to encourage investment by employers and individual citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to focus on the European dimension of education and training, which requires mastery of a second language. All the institutions and the Member States must pursue their efforts in this field so that there is a proper follow-up to the European Year of Languages. The European area of education and lifelong learning is a huge workshop and we must establish it without delay to enable all of our fellow citizens to benefit more from this right to learn. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Union cannot realistically achieve that alone, considering that 1% of the total budget is invested in culture and education. Something would need to change there too. What is more, there is often a narrow-minded anxiety in the Member States, in Germany's <span class="italic">Länder</span> for example, as regards cultural sovereignty. They feel that their cultural sovereignty is being threatened when the EU makes pronouncements about education policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of the Pisa Study should have opened people's eyes. Finland has achieved excellent results in practising lifelong learning, beating Germany with its achievement principle in the first phase of education, which often blocks people's path to further education. So we can learn from each other. We should draw up training plans for new developments relating to the electronic revolution, in industry as well. We should extend education centres. The rapporteur has proposed individual learning accounts. The key issues here are exchanges of information and experience. We need to have recognised, guaranteed systems for mutual recognition of final examinations. That needs to be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to gear what is on offer towards specific groups, for example mothers returning to work, for single parents who need childcare arrangements, for migrant workers, and for people in rural areas. The Commission and the Member States should focus on this in a coordinated way, and particularly careful attention needs to be paid to the gender mainstreaming approach for lifelong learning. We also need to take advantage of all possible instruments, such as loans from the EIB, in order to extend our educational systems so as to create a modern and efficient educational system. We need to involve the informal sector and accelerate the political process of adult education, we need a new learning culture to secure sustainable development of the most precious resource at our disposal – people and their minds. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do, however, have a few comments to make. We are certainly following the approach called for at Feira, but I have heard some speakers, including a colleague from my group, mention illiteracy. I would like to draw the attention of the House to this specific point: there is a disturbing degree of returning illiteracy affecting a large part of our European population as regards new technologies and new languages.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner mentioned ‘living’ in the knowledge-based society. Of course, living means interacting, but living also and above all means communicating, for, nowadays, it is those who communicate who count in society. In order to communicate, a person needs both knowledge and the ability to communicate, which means being in possession of the tools of communication – languages. This is the area where we have to make progress. This is what we must concentrate on.</p>
<p class="contents">One consideration is training and another is teaching. If we want high-quality teaching, we must take steps to establish a common basic curriculum and review all the European education systems. As regards training, then, the individual States must strengthen these national agreements on training, working together with local communities, businesses, firms and all those who invest in the training of the young and not so young.</p>
<p class="contents">I certainly support lifelong training, but I feel that if specific preparation, specific training in learning skills is not provided at the appropriate age, namely during school years, we will have even less chance of success with adults who are no longer open to learning. There therefore needs to be a whole strategy for strengthening primary and secondary education, and we can introduce lifelong learning measures after that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to end with the comment that our countries spend less than 5% of GDP on teaching and training. It may well be that the Commission needs to take action and prepare the ground for a political and cultural debate at European level, because the knowledge-based Europe, the Europe of culture, the Europe of values, can only become reality if we invest more and differently in training ...</p>

<p class="contents">As she has illustrated so well, in our societies, equal opportunities, personal development and the ability to take charge throughout one’s life are dependent upon better access to education and training.</p>
<p class="contents">This report has the merit of reminding us of the essential issues in lifelong learning. It gives a precise definition of the vulnerable social groups that must have access to this process, namely the illiterate, immigrants, the handicapped, the unemployed and women finishing maternity leave.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish now to pay tribute to the fine work done by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Furthermore, this report reflects our societies, which are undergoing enormous changes and in which everyone can change career several times in their lifetime. If this report is rapidly implemented, it will be an opportunity for all men and women who think that progress in society is definitively blocked for them.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain shortcomings must, nevertheless, be mentioned. Mrs Karamanou has highlighted the disparities between men and women in access to training, but there are genuine shortcomings where the illiterate, immigrants, the handicapped and the long-term unemployed are concerned. The most crucial issue for me, ladies and gentlemen, is funding, because, although the Commission has currently earmarked more than EUR 500 million and will set aside an equivalent sum in 2006, and although the European Investment Bank intends to increase the budget earmarked for this area, the Member States, on the other hand, seem not to want to make any great effort on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it would be inappropriate, on such an important matter, to indulge in penny-pinching or, for example, to restructure already existing programmes, such as Leonardo and Socrates.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally Commissioner, I am categorically opposed, as I hope you are, to the idea that the price for even a tiny part of this education should be met by those who are precisely in greatest need of it. Let us bear in mind the phrase by Victor Hugo: 'Every school that is opened closes one more prison'.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, let us bear in mind that it is the most vulnerable people who must be concerned by lifelong learning. This gives enormous hope to them all, men and women, and perhaps a last chance too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That saying really does not hold true any more, as it implies that learning is limited to school. We need to see school as a foundation for acquiring basic skills, and we have to educate people in school as a basis for lifelong learning if we are to meet the challenges of the modern age.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is about the Lisbon objectives. We will not be able to become the most competitive continent in the world if we do not invest in human resources, which are our greatest asset. Competitiveness is not just about costs, it is about quality and about education and training, which are fundamental if we want a higher quality level of production, be quicker and reduce costs.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that we of course also need to attempt to define Europe's objectives. What do we as a continent want to achieve in terms of educational targets? There is another question linked to this issue about defining objectives: what are Europe's minimum standards that distinguish us from other continents and which we also want to achieve within the internal market in all the Member States despite varying levels of competence? The Pisa Study provides an important basis here, because it is comparative and includes a best practice model. However, we have four players: the Member States, employers and employees, the public and providers. They all need to work together, and not just on programmes but also as regards financing. That is why I welcome the proposal for a ‘lifelong learning account’.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It really does sound like a prison sentence and I would like to suggest an alternative straight away: ‘learning for life’. It implies the same thing, but it does not sound negative, or like a prison sentence. Perhaps we could use that in future.</p>
<p class="contents">The report we have before us highlights many possibilities and this debate has also demonstrated how much we can and should do. I would also like to touch again on a few points that are not clear to me, and, in particular, the question of recognising formal qualifications. The Commission talks in one place about a voluntary minimum quality standard and in another place about a modular system that needs to be worked out by 2003 and which would allow people to combine different educational and vocational training establishments. The term ‘voluntary’ gives rise to a degree of uncertainty here: we need to clearly express what we want and what would result in mutual recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already talked a great deal here about equality of opportunities, and about lifelong learning or learning for life. The fact that according to a Eurostat survey 16% of university graduates take advantage of further vocational training compared with only 2% of people with the lowest educational qualifications tells us that access to education should not create inequalities but reduce them. We in this House need to help to overcome these barriers. Social exclusion and marginalisation need to be reduced by means of a new European project such as lifelong learning. The Lisbon Council set the target of making the EU the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economic area in the world. However, if we are to achieve this objective, everyone needs to be involved right from the start. Access to education and training should no longer be dependent on people's level of education, gender and nationality and on infrastructural issues.</p>

I cannot do this, but we have taken note of everything you have said and these are very practical and very useful proposals. I shall simply give a brief explanation of the actions that are planned for the next few months.</p>
<p class="contents">In November, the Commission will present a communication on indicators and benchmarks, which will serve to measure the progress made in the priority areas. And so you will have this communication, which will enable a real evaluation to be made of the practical measures that are adopted. Furthermore, with regard to basic skills, seven working groups are in the process, in collaboration with the Member States, of reaching agreement on the common criteria necessary to apply the benchmarks correctly and to evaluate the measures that have been adopted. This task is almost over now and things will therefore, move ahead rapidly.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, in the field of vocational training, the situation will develop very quickly. Clearly, to achieve progress in the field, the social partners will need to be directly involved. I wish to add that the social partners and the Member States have given a commitment to establish common principles in the field of non-formal training, a task that we are striving to see through. I should also like to state that I am as shocked as anyone at the frightening number of people in our societies who can neither read nor write. I have understood your message: you would like us jointly to undertake a major action to combat illiteracy. Together with my staff, I shall study this proposal and perhaps the Commission and Parliament could then adopt a joint initiative on this matter.</p>
