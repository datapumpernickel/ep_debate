<p class="contents">I welcome the resolution which we were able to draft together, but I do consider it to be the bare minimum after all the disasters which El Salvador has experienced, and now after this last earthquake disaster. If truth be told, I find it a bit of a flimsy resolution, for although the feeling of solidarity which we all share and which gave rise to this resolution may be expressed well, we need to translate our solidarity into action, and that is why, on behalf of our group, we have tabled a few more amendments in order to bring this idea more into focus and to reinforce it. Among other things, this is to enable the existing plans for improving the situation to be put into practice, especially the reconstruction programmes, but we should also deliver the money that Europe had set aside for this. Despite this, we believe that the entire world, and we, along with the world, must express our dismay and solidarity, now that thousands of people have fallen victim to this earthquake.</p>
<p class="contents">An earthquake in a poor country is, of course, all the more serious the less resistance and less resilience the country has. El Salvador has survived a war and natural disasters, and now there is this on top of everything else. In order to work ecologically in environmentally responsible circumstances, the government too should set its political preferences for certain forms of politicisation of aid to one side, and we, on the other hand, must meet our obligations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I have just spoken to the office responsible for humanitarian aid in Nicaragua and I would like to communicate to this House, and to the Commissioner, the great concern of all those self-sacrificing people who, today, are working on emergency aid, and who, tomorrow, will be involved in cooperation work, and the concern of the Spanish and international media about the fact that we have yet to send the promised economic aid following hurricane Mitch, when we are now facing the next tragic event.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the Commission, let us see if, this time, we can make it on time. I am saying this not only as a member of the Delegation for Relations with the Countries of Central America and Mexico, but also as coordinating spokesman of the Group of the European People’s Party and European Democrats in the Committee on Budgetary Control. To spend so late is to throw money away. Money must be spent on time and the officials – not only those in El Salvador, but also those in Brussels – will have to assume their responsibilities. Mr Kinnock’s reform must serve some purpose. Let us see whether or not, this time, the aid to alleviate the consequences of the earthquake arrive before another tragic event strikes this sister country.</p>
<p class="contents">To be effective, aid must arrive at the right time. Otherwise, there will be so many people working with no compensation in those countries, so many people waiting, so many administrative costs, and for what? If we cannot do it any other way, let us send aid by means of the Member States. We already give money to the UN – to the UNHCR – we are the main contributors, and they only fly the United Nations flag. So, although it does not look good, let us do it by means of Spain or Austria, or under two flags, but the emergency aid, and especially the cooperation aid, must arrive. Let us not make fools of ourselves again.</p>

There are continual aftershocks in El Salvador and even in Nicaragua. This situation occurring in Central America is nothing new. As Mrs Maes and Mr Poméz Ruiz pointed out, Hurricane Mitch, in November 1998, also had tragic consequences in both human and material terms in that part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Central America is one of the world’s poorest regions. Around 40% of the population live below the poverty line and Europe therefore has a particular responsibility to the region not only because it is a region that has experienced much serious conflict and where there is still tension, particularly over borders, but also because we need to assist their recovery for the sake of democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am happy to say that all bodies there are democratically elected, but very undemocratic habits still remain in these Central American countries. Apart from this, they have a very large foreign debt and only two countries are involved in the initiative that has been launched. Therefore, the impression we receive from the principal authorities in Central American countries – and on Tuesday we had the opportunity to receive the President of Honduras – is of a people that is suffering and that, just when it sees a little light at the end of the tunnel and starts to pick itself up in order to confront its problems and its history, is struck by tragic situations caused by these natural disasters.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe acted promptly in sending emergency aid, both in November 1998 and this time. Nevertheless, the problem requires – as my two fellow Members have already stated more than adequately – more structural aid. It is vital that the Commission implements its reconstruction programme for Central America. What we are proposing, Commissioner Nielson, is that there should be a rapid redefinition of this programme, with greater resources, both human and financial, to achieve the objective of assisting El Salvador as well. On 26 March of this year, another meeting will be held between the San José Group and the European Union in Guatemala. A positive way to conclude this meeting with the San José Group would be to proceed to implement the reconstruction programme for Central America with the new procedure for helping the victims in El Salvador. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In fact, I had the honour and gratifying responsibility of presenting a report to this House, on behalf of the Committee on External Affairs, on aid for the reconstruction of Central America following Hurricane Mitch, which was adopted unanimously. The truth is that I feel frustrated that our hopes and efforts have not been accompanied by efficiency on the part of the people responsible for the implementation of this programme.</p>
<p class="contents">On that occasion, I pointed out that, when the hurricane struck, the Commission acted quickly in terms of initial aid. This has been the case this time as well, but we must continue to provide this aid. We must be more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">The scale of the earthquake was considerable. This region was beginning to recover and it is going to be essential that we make an immense effort to achieve levels of economic, social and democratic security. The European Union has to do some very hard work in this area and, amongst the problems to be faced, there is one I would like to highlight: the fraudulent diversions of the aid sent.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union – and the Commission in particular – must prevent this from happening, by guaranteeing that associations, NGOs and local authorities actively participate in the utilisation of the aid, for the sake of the efficiency and justice of the efforts made by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We express our deep sympathy and solidarity with the many who died or were injured and the many who have lost their family and their possessions. The PPE-DE Group supports the motion for a resolution tabled by several groups in the European Parliament. It is good to know that the Community has responded to this natural catastrophe so promptly by dispatching experts and money. This is a convincing example of solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a suitable occasion for me to add that, as a positive member of the generation of 68, when I was a reserve officer in the German army in the seventies, I did not throw stones as other young men did, but searched with my own hands for the dead and injured in an area of Italy which had suffered an earthquake. On that occasion we were able to rescue very many people who had been buried alive. This is a great joy. I can still see the dreadful images from the seventies of the earthquake in Italy, and I can understand the sense of distress prevailing in El Salvador. It is excellent that Europe has sent help so quickly. It is to be hoped that the aid will not come too late and that it will enter El Salvador through the proper channels. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Schulz (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, I really must say that I am quite amazed at how one can manage, in a debate about an earthquake in El Salvador, to say that one was a reserve officer in the German army and a "positive" member of the generation of 68 and to talk about stone-throwing members of the 68 Movement. I do not know what one has got to do with the other, apart perhaps from the fact that Mr Knolle felt compelled to tell us a little of his own biography, but this is perhaps not without interest either.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the descriptions of my colleagues, the events in El Salvador are dramatic and we have heard many speakers state quite correctly that if the question being asked here is how quick and efficient our aid is, then in the case of this natural catastrophe it does actually seem to be arriving quickly, our initial assistance I mean. What concerns us, however – and what also characterised the discussion about the motion and how it should be worded in our group – is the fact that we know from experience that this has not always been the case. We call on the Commission to ensure that the aid – when the European Union helps by providing a go-get-it approach, know-how, equipment and people on the ground – does not only arrive when the people have, for the most part, already helped themselves or when the next natural catastrophe is due to be dealt with. The European Union's credibility, both internally and in its relations with its partners, is threatened when money is admittedly made available and aid is promised, but because of bureaucratic obstacles the aid either arrives far too late or not at all.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, therefore, this is about immediate help for the poorest of the poor, who need our solidarity, but on the other hand it is also about the fact that we need to bear in mind that our aid is futile if it becomes entangled in a jungle of red tape. That is why we are glad that this motion has been drafted jointly by several groups. We hope, Commissioner Nielson, that the Commission will work just as quickly on this motion as Parliament has. As for Mr Knolle, I hope that he does not encounter any stone-throwing foreign ministers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Nielson,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, let me reply to Mr Seguro, who talked about the situation in Honduras. I want to make it clear that as part of our decision last year, supported by this House, to increase our stake in the whole HIPC initiative – EUR 1bn, we decided to spend it globally, not just on the ACP countries. The reason for this was that, as a consequence of Hurricane Mitch, Honduras was included in the HIPC initiative. We needed to find a budget line outside European Development Fund money to make it possible for the European Union to be even-handed and support Honduras. Honduras will receive EUR 15m as debt alleviation from us because of this. This is, of course, in addition to what Honduras is receiving from the Hurricane Mitch mid- and long-term rehabilitation and reconstruction follow-up as part of the regional programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Members have raised concerns about the slow delivery of the more long-term reconstruction part of the Hurricane Mitch follow-up. I can only agree with the criticism. I myself have characterised this as a real scandal. It took almost one and a half years for the Commission services to find the six to seven people to send to Managua to form the unit to run the implementation of the regional reconstruction programme of EUR 250m. This is pathetic. It is not just bureaucracy, it is a totally dysfunctional set-up of different parties who do not talk to each other. This is exactly why I am still in the market for more TNT to blow up those kind of structures which are blocking good performance in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation today for the implementation of this programme is that these people have now been working in Managua since early autumn. Of the EUR 250m, we have specifically earmarked and started the execution in a number of the states covered by the reconstruction programme of more than EUR 80m. So EUR 80m out of EUR 250 are now set to work. Things are finally starting to happen on the ground.</p>
<p class="contents">I still want to make the very clear distinction – which I urge everyone who has spoken in this debate to note – between the immediate humanitarian short-term response to disaster and the long-term reconstruction work. They are two totally distinct types of activity and this has to be borne in mind. Nothing has moved slowly in the Hurricane Mitch follow-up, except, as I mentioned here, finding seven people to send to Managua. But this is bad enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me now turn more specifically to the terrible situation in El Salvador. Of course, the Commission fully shares the consternation and solidarity expressed in Parliament's resolution on the terrible earthquake which struck several countries of Central America, and in particular El Salvador. The Commission – President Prodi, Mr Patten and myself – immediately expressed its condolences to the families of the victims and the authorities and announced a quick and efficient Community response to this catastrophe.</p>
<p class="contents">As in the past, when it assisted El Salvador after the 1986 earthquake through the construction of a new hospital and provided very substantial humanitarian and reconstruction aid to the countries stuck by Hurricane Mitch, the Commission stands ready to help Central America and El Salvador to face the present dramatic challenges.</p>
<p class="contents">As soon as the earthquake occurred the Commission humanitarian aid office, ECHO, directed a field expert stationed in Honduras to go directly to the scene and he was there by Sunday. ECHO also arranged this Monday for a mission to be sent to make an initial assessment of the needs as regards cooperation with other donors and the local authorities. It left yesterday.</p>
<p class="contents">On Monday I decided that the first response in terms of money should be EUR 2 m. This would cover the things that we knew would be necessary in any case. Without any type of coordination or further studying, it was clear that drinking water, sanitation, shelter, food aid and medical supplies would be needed. We also were immediately clear as to the organisations we should ask to take care of this on behalf of the Commission, namely a couple of European NGOs and the Red Cross family. We will follow up these initial decisions with further commitments, depending on the feedback we get on what we are going to do compared to other donors and so on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me add here that this terrible catastrophe once again proves that poverty as such is dangerous. Most people think that earthquakes and these types of catastrophe are much more damaging in our sophisticated societies with all the elaborate infrastructure we have, yet in El Salvador the immediate consequence has been that more than 50% of water provision to the whole nation is cut off because of damage to pipes, electricity etc.</p>
<p class="contents">So the secondary impact is enormous, often because the systems are vulnerable, not functioning very well. For instance the flooding in Mozambique caused much greater damage to dams, road, bridges and so on than it would have done if the country had had normal, well-maintained, strong and more expensive infrastructure. So poverty is dangerous, and this has to be kept in mind. For this reason, we are giving more emphasis to disaster preparedness activities as part of our humanitarian assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also considering as favourably as possible the requests for a re-orientation of resources available in Commission-supported development projects in the zones and sectors affected, including those foreseen in the framework of the post-Mitch reconstruction programme.</p>
<p class="contents">My view here is that we need additional resources for this. It is not acceptable to divert money from the post-Mitch reconstruction programme which has had enough problems already due to our bureaucratic difficulties, but it is an asset that we have a unit in place in the region which consists of people who are specifically engaged in these kind of reconstruction activities. Of course, this is an asset and we will definitely come back to the more long-term problems for El Salvador when we get beyond the immediate humanitarian response.</p>
<p class="contents">So I thank you for the very strong support here. We will come back on how to do these things. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I now turn also to colleagues in their offices who should be here not at 6.30 p.m., as stated on the printed programme, but at 5.30 p.m., depending on when we are able to begin the vote. The President already said at midday today that it would be 6 p.m., and it may be that it will be 5.50 p.m., and depending on the result of the vote on Mr Deprez's request it may even take place earlier than that. I would therefore request, in accordance with the decision of the Conference of Presidents, that you please ask your colleagues to come into the plenary as early as 5.30 p.m. for the vote and help us to ensure that we are all here at 5.30 p.m.</p>
