<p class="contents">This report sets a precedent, as it is the first time that the Council has consulted Parliament on these measures.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development has studied this legislative motion for a resolution extremely promptly and with great interest, and has approved it unanimously.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to highlight the following aspects of the amendments proposed by Parliament: First, in Amendment No 2, rural information and activity centres are included as possible agents for these measures. Secondly, the amendment refers specifically to the important role to be played by young farmers in the aforementioned measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we indicate to the Commission the value of simplification and cutting through red tape, both in the examination of the programmes submitted and in subsequent monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we single out countrymen and women, farmers and other parties active in rural areas as the ideal beneficiaries of these measures. On examination of our amendments, it is clear that they have a human aspect and allow a far more dynamic, open discussion. They avoid dealing with the CAP in a passive, purely bureaucratic and technological fashion. That is why we believe that Parliament's amendments improve the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, with regard to the cofinancing percentage, Parliament would like the Commission to be able to increase this percentage, increasing financing for organisations or associations with few financial means.</p>
<p class="contents">Sixthly, we already know that, according to the proposal, commitment appropriations provide EUR 4.5 million annually through the EAGGF, which implies EUR 27 million for the current period, 2000-2006. However, the proposal made by Parliament indicates that the European Commission should adapt the budgetary allocation to the large number of organisations entitled to participate under this regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I would like to highlight the contribution of Amendment No 10, which proposes a new Article 5a, defining the following criteria to be met by programmes or measures eligible for funding: that these programmes should foster sustainable, multifunctional farming; they should serve to maintain or create jobs; they should promote social and regional cohesion; they should give a more prominent role to women and young people; they should protect the environment and safeguard the water supply, air quality and soil quality; they should treat agricultural waste and control energy expenditure, in the countryside and in transport.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, these are proposals that should promote rural development and improve food safety and product quality.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament would like the Commission to make these priorities, which are priority objectives for agriculture in 2000, easier to visualise in these next information measures.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, that is all I have to say. I would like to thank all the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development for the support and collaboration they have given me at all the meetings we have held. I would also like the European Commission, in one way or another, to take account of Parliament's criteria.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Fiori (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, this is a very specific instrument which is of major importance for all citizens. However, it is the farmers who have to be its protagonists. Our position on the proposal for a regulation on information measures relating to the common agricultural policy can be summarised as follows: after the period of DG VI management and dependence on EAGGF-Guidance, a window of further transparency has at last been opened, and it must not be allowed to close. The common agricultural policy is an instrument for farmers: it is a basis from which to provide farmers with a broader understanding of their overall role, both in respect of the consumer and in terms of the major environmental issues. It is also the means of increasing awareness, among farmers, of current situations and, in particular, of the requirements of European society as a whole. </p>
<p class="contents">All too often, we have heard speeches extolling the virtues of the CAP’s role in production, the environment and consumer and agricultural protection. On many occasions, these words proved to be an end unto themselves and did not provide specific occasions for taking up the opportunities offered. This regulation is our chance to send a clear message to the farming world. This is why we do not understand why the CAP should be extended to include all the consumer and environmental associations, which can claim no rights and have no responsibilities as regards measures of this type. Should we pass up this opportunity, we will miss another chance to target the objectives of growth, shared responsibility, multifunctionality and quality improvements, which are the basis of the European measures envisaged for the agricultural sector. We are also concerned at the poor level of funding available to implement the programme. </p>
<p class="contents">This is all the more reason why the policy should not be broadened to include as many potential tenderers as possible, but rather, in the light of what has just been said regarding determining who represents agriculture, this extension must lead to the judicious, appropriate allocation of funding to the destination indicated in the very title of the programme, the common agricultural policy, where the term “agricultural” is a decidedly operative word. If we were to take a different path, we would only be contributing to highlighting the existence of a tangle of roles, which would be of no benefit to either farmers or consumers. </p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, this major programme is an opportunity for responsibilities to be defined and recognised, in order to provide the farming world with a genuine opportunity to take the lead in the changes taking place. However, in all this, we must not forget or overlook the merits of the other organisations<span class="bold"> </span>which have<span class="bold"> </span>taken up parallels with the world of agriculture production and interpreted them to best advantage, without mentioning the fact that this broadening out to embrace other activities in itself represents a development of areas of potential recognised by the Union. The transfer from EAGGF-Guidance to EAGGF-Guarantee is another consoling aspect, in terms of attaining the objectives already outlined, providing both the possibility of tracking funds to their destination and, in particular, to the objectives which we want to achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">Alongside all this, in consolidation of the positions expressed, the true focus of the programme must not be forgotten: the involvement of the farmers themselves in adopting a more resolute stance on the validity of the instruments introduced under the reform of the common agricultural policy. Today, this instrument appears to be fully understood by most of the farming world, but not all. It is probably this element which is most attached to conventional schemes that are difficult to reconcile with the rapid, revolutionary changes which we are witnessing. But it is an element which the Union itself intends to adapt more closely to current conditions and manoeuvre towards the euro, globalisation and the open market, and also towards those market niches which are characteristic of economically sound areas which must be developed still further.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In line with this rationale, a parallel with the development of rural tourism springs to mind. Rural tourism is a source of income and, at the same time, a means of protecting a citizen’s land. It is proposed as a driving force that will speed up the passage to a European agriculture which encompasses as wide a range of production possibilities and sources of income as possible. Rural tourism not only meshes well with organic production, but also complies with the highest of product quality standards recognised by the European Union. Factors such as these confirm the integration of agricultural policy with the other forms of economic and social development of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Providing factual and objective information about cooperation in Europe has become very important in recent years as we face considerable challenges with the extension of the EU into Central and Eastern Europe. It is especially important to explain what the common agricultural policy is about and to provide information about objectives, resources and potential for development. There are many target groups – farmers, first and foremost, but also people generally, as well as everyone directly or indirectly affected. If this work is to succeed, it is important that cooperation should be established with the farming organisations and also with consumers. The common agricultural policy was the first, and is also the most extensive, of the Community’s integrated policies and it accounts for a very large proportion of the EU’s budget. It is, therefore, also important to make it clear that the subsidy arrangements ensure that consumers obtain food at prices which, as a result of the subsidy, are lower than they would be without the subsidy. This means that the EU’s agricultural arrangements are of benefit to all EU citizens. The common agricultural policy is always undergoing change and development. It demands a great deal in terms of the supply of information and, especially, in terms of the coordination which is needed if cooperation is to succeed, both within the Member States and independently of the Member States. Circumstances are very different from one country to another, and it ought, therefore, to be farming organisations which are among the main players, because these organisations focus primarily upon farmers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It represents the attempt we need to give the financing for groups and associations in the EU agriculture sector a legal basis. This budget line has always been there, only there were no legal safeguards, and the Court of Auditors criticised us for this. In producing this legal standard, the Commission has now put the matter to rights.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The only difficulty regarding implementation resides in the fact that the Commission is now to lay claim to a large portion of the budget for its own information measures – or so the report says – when previously, the budget was available in its entirety to the associations in varying amounts. We have reason to fear that these funds are now to be withheld from the associations, and that is not a very happy turn of events.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it used to be the case that the money was made available to the associations and it was for them to draw up their own criteria as to how the money should be spent. This was, and continues to be, an unacceptable practice, and it is therefore right and proper that the criteria are now to be stipulated. However, precise rates of interest are now to be fixed for the financing – Mrs Izquierdo has already made reference to this – which will mean that small associations having limited financial resources will be deprived of the opportunity to delve into this pot because they do not have their own resources. The smaller, weaker associations will therefore be at a disadvantage. That is why we welcome with open arms Mrs Izquierdo’s proposal that the possibility of full financing be allowed for where there is evidence that the measures meet the criteria, and where there is financial weakness – which may be the case throughout the region – so as to avoid these areas being completely left out. </p>
<p class="contents">All in all, our Group welcomes the fact that we are now to get a legal basis, and also supports the proposed amendments tabled by the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Figueiredo (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, the purpose of information on the common agricultural policy should be to establish a strategy for communication, directed mainly at those working in farming and rural areas. In our opinion, the main criticism of this proposal for a Commission regulation relates to the opening up of a budget line to non-agricultural organisations and also the reduction in budget appropriations to EUR 4 500 000. This situation has been made even worse by the reserve of appropriations that the Commission is building up for itself, which, when taken in conjunction with specific actions, in fact leaves the organisations with only EUR 3 million, which is obviously a very limited amount.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome the rapporteur’s proposal that the Commission should match the budgetary appropriations to the numerous organisations that have a right to funding under this regulation. However, another negative aspect of the Commission’s proposal relates to limiting cofinancing to a rate of 75%, when actions implemented directly by the Commission are financed at a rate of 100%. Furthermore, we know that the draft guide to the rules makes access to the budgetary line I have just mentioned even more difficult for organisations, especially those in a weaker financial position, in other words, exactly the ones that need the most support.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence the importance of our amendment designed to supplement the concept set out in the report. With our amendment, we hope to see Community cofinancing rise above 75% for organisations representing small farmers and family-run farms in financial difficulty. We hope that this amendment will be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the amendment designed to reduce funds intended for the Commission by EUR 1 million and instead increase specific actions, we feel that this is potentially a way of improving the Commission’s proposal for a regulation. Lastly, it is important to emphasise the need for the Commission to simplify its administrative procedures both in order to study the programmes presented by the organisations and for their future monitoring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From an administrative point of view the formalisation is a good thing. But when we come to think about it the amount of money is quite small – EUR 27 million over a period of six years. Considering the size of the agricultural budget and the fact that it extends to every corner of the Union, it is a relatively small amount of money. That is why I welcome that fact that most of it will be spent at the rate of 50% rather than 75%. The more of it that is spent at the rate of up to 50%, the further the money goes and the greater the impact.</p>
<p class="contents">The common agricultural policy gets a lot of criticism. One of the things that was not widely understood was the importance of this policy from a social point of view: the fact is, that in all the depressed regions of the Union, the common agricultural policy has maintained the population and supported communities, in a social sense, that would not otherwise have survived. This is particularly true of the peripheral countries such as Ireland, Greece, Spain and Portugal, where communities that would have disappeared have been supported and maintained, if not for ever, certainly until a change in economic environment, until the new technologies arrived. The long-term effect of the common agricultural policy in that sense will be greater than people have often imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no fault to find with the way the Commission interacted with the agriculture industry over the years. From my experience the European Commission was more open to representations and information exchange with the agriculture industry than most departments of agriculture in most Member States. The Commission taught Member States over the years how to be open with very limited resources. But there are new pressures, arising out of consumer concerns about new processes and systems of producing food. These have to be explained, not only to farmers, but to consumers as well. There is a lot of mythology about what is safe and what is not safe. We have an important job to do to explain the workings of the whole productive system to the consumers of Europe and those outside the Union who will buy our food. It is important that we apply as many resources as possible to this.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to make is that, arising from these pressures, we will have a reaction from agriculture. As we inevitably wind down some of the supports in the process of enlargement and, at the same time, maintain the pressures to protect the environment and the consumers, then there will be friction between the producers and the European administration. To devote as many resources as possible to good relations is a wise policy.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Liikanen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission. – (FI) </span>Mr President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur, Maria Izquierdo Rojo, and the members of the Committee, for their report. The proposed regulation intends to provide the Commission with a tool to help it to present an operational model for European agriculture, and give wider publicity to the common agricultural policy. In this way, the implementation of agricultural policy is facilitated.</p>
<p class="contents">Now I would like to speak about Parliament’s proposed amendments. They are not generally aimed at changing the subject matter but rather at amending the proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 2 and 6 concern organisations falling within the scope of aid. It is the opinion of the Commission that it is not necessary to mention the groups and organisations by name. All agricultural organisations and rural players fall within the scope of aid according to Article 2. This being the case, the proposed addenda are unnecessary.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 5, 8 and 10 concern measures that are eligible for aid. Amendment No 5 contains amendments regarding information services and fora for discussions for men and women in rural areas. They are unnecessary, as they are already contained in the Commission’s proposal. One of them, which reads “supporting them in their choices” is not in harmony with the Commission’s proposal. The purpose of this regulation is not to offer farmers any special services. Local bodies are better qualified to do that. The resources available would not be sufficient for that either. I would, moreover, like to make the comment, with regard to the amendments tabled for Article 3, that information visits are not being ruled out. The list of activities that are eligible for aid is not exhaustive, which is indicated in the word “particularly”. The Commission is prepared, however, to adopt this amendment. The funding of long-term exchange programmes cannot, however, be accepted, as such action is not a part of the information policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 concerns Article 5. The Commission supports the objectives mentioned here, proof of which is to be seen in the fact that they are implicitly contained in Article 1, which concerns the operational model for European agriculture. That is why it makes no sense to repeat the contents of the model in further detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 7 and 13 concern contributions. The Commission thinks that it is not desirable to pay more than 75% of eligible aid costs. The funds available are modest. The lower the contribution stays the more measures there will be that can be financed and the greater the multiple effect. Amendments Nos 9 and 12 concern the allocation and approval of appropriations. As we know, Parliament is a budgetary authority together with the Council. For this reason, the Commission thinks Amendment No 9 is not necessary. Regarding Amendment No 12, which proposes including the allocation of appropriations in the regulation, I would say that if the allocation is settled on beforehand, the administration of the budgetary heading will lose its vital degree of flexibility, which might be damaging from the point of view of proposed applications for financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 11 concerns evaluation. The Commission agrees with Parliament on the usefulness of regular evaluation. It can best be taken account of in the implementing regulation. Amendment No 4 concerns administration. This extra recital is unnecessary in the regulation, in the opinion of the Commission. Provision for administrative details, evaluation and later assessment will be laid down by the Commission in the Implementing Regulation. In this connection, it has to be said that the effective monitoring of public funds has to be assured in the process regardless of how open and simple the process is.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 1 and 3 concern linguistic nuances. These the Commission does not consider significant, as Recitals 4 and 7 in the Commission’s proposal are not as restrictive.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
