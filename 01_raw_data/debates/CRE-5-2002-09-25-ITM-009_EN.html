<p class="contents">I wish to begin by thanking the Commissioner and all those who have taken an interest in the report for being here this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be a minor subject, but it is very important to those involved in the recreational boating industry and those many thousands of people across Europe who also indulge their hobby of boating. Many of the problems apparent in the legislation at first reading have been substantially resolved by the Council at second reading. Most of the retrospective elements in the proposal at first reading have now been removed and I can broadly support the Commission's proposals at second reading, albeit with a few riders.</p>
<p class="contents">I tabled a few amendments for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, some of which were accepted. Most of the technical amendments we put forward were accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just run through a few of the problems that I still see with the legislation. I continue to have doubts about the effectiveness of a regulatory committee, particularly one empowered to alter quite important items of the directive such as Froude numbers. The committee supported my recommendations on that and the amendments are up for vote tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I continue to believe that craft built for users' own use should be exempted for five years, provided they are not placed on the market. This directive was introduced under single-market legislation and it is self-evident that if those craft are not intended to be placed on the market, then they cannot affect the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of in-use compliance testing is a particularly thorny one. I understand that at some stage the Commission will be coming back with proposals on that. I hope it will consider that issue very carefully. The last thing we want is an extremely bureaucratic system imposed on the boat owners and users of Europe. It needs to be very simple and effective and, above all, free of charge to those who have boats at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to tell our German colleagues that a number of amendments – I call them the Bodensee amendments because they are the result of lobbying from the Lake Constance authorities – have been tabled. There are broadly two categories of amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, those tabled to allow Member States to set their own limits in particular local circumstances. I am not usually against Member States derogating from European regulations, but if we are going to produce a directive whose specific purpose is to permit a single market across Europe and then introduce specific exemptions into the directive, that would defeat the whole point of having it in the first place.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I have a particular problem with the so-called Table 1a amendment, again based on the Bodensee limits, but even stricter. Again it would be a barrier to trade. However, I would say to our colleagues on the Bodensee that, if there is a problem in this particular stretch of water, then, firstly, there is no evidence that it is caused by recreational craft and, secondly, that if there is a difficulty it can be solved by local measures in the area of Lake Constance. Speed and navigational limits could be imposed, and I entirely support their right to do that. But do not saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits just to solve a particular problem that the German and Austrian authorities might have.</p>
<p class="contents">I have looked quite extensively at the limits proposed in that table with boat-users' representatives and representatives from industry, and there are no commercially available engines on the market that meet those limits at the moment. Obviously technology could be developed further, but it would require the use of catalytic converter technology, which is extremely difficult in a marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">By all means let the research go ahead, let us look at the issue again in a few years, but please do not try and saddle the rest of Europe with unenforceable limits. All that would happen – because there are no retrospective elements – is that, as has happened on the Bodensee, the whole of Europe would become pretty much a museum for old engines. The companies making new engines go out of business, but those refurbishing old engines continue to make a lot of money. The engine could be old, polluting or spilling oil into the water but, as long as it was in existence at the time the limits were introduced, it would be perfectly legal. It is completely self-defeating to impose unachievable limits. I would strongly recommend the House to vote against those amendments tomorrow. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Commission's proposal to modify the recreational craft directive aims to avoid fragmentation of the internal market and seeks to integrate environmental concerns. As such, this proposal provides a good example of the synergy that is needed between environmental and industrial policies for the achievement of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">Air and water pollution and engine noise from recreational boating activities have become increasingly sensitive issues. While exhaust emissions from recreational craft contribute little to the overall pollution of the marine environment, their local effects are nevertheless important.</p>
<p class="contents">Recreational boating activities are often concentrated in environmentally sensitive areas so it is important that this activity does not disturb local fauna. Moreover, boating activities often take place at the weekend and in holiday periods resulting in a concentration of the nuisance they can cause to local inhabitants.</p>
<p class="contents">I share with Mr Callanan the hope that the amendments that are adopted will deal appropriately with the need for harmonised reduction of exhaust and noise emissions, while at the same time avoiding over-regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore welcome in particular Amendment 14 to extend the 3 decibel sound allowance to the scope originally proposed by the Commission. The Commission can also agree with Amendments 6 and 21 as they will provide for consistency in the references to 'placing on the market and/or putting into service' throughout the directive. Also the first part of Amendment 1 can be accepted, since it provides an improved wording of the recital.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 4, 5, 12 and 22 re-introducing the proposals to delete or reduce the provisions on the Regulatory Committee cannot be accepted by the Commission. A regulatory committee is necessary for the efficient implementation and the regular updating of a specified range of technical elements contained in the technical annexes to the proposed directive. This approach is in line with the principles of better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important topic of debate has been that of the right to adopt more stringent requirements at national level. Amendments have also been tabled to introduce at Community level more stringent emission limits on standing inland waters.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 11 and 13, as they would fragment the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments 16 to 20 and Amendment 24 envisage changing the scope and timing of future work to be undertaken by the Commission. They cannot be accepted as they would restrict the Commission's right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the Commission can accept the first part of Amendment 1 and Amendments 6, 14 and 21. On the contrary the Commission cannot accept Amendments 1, second part, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 15 to 20 and 22 to 24.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is looking forward to working with Parliament and the Council towards a solution which on the one hand guarantees a high level of environmental protection and on the other hand meets the requirements of the internal market. I would like to thank the rapporteur and Parliament for their efforts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the World Summit in Johannesburg, the European Union advocated a global water initiative. This should make it possible to realise the aims of the World Summit on Sustainable Development – access to clean drinking water and basic sanitation. So what are we doing, we who want to achieve such ambitious targets at international level, here in our own countries in Europe?</p>
<p class="contents">We are making a law on abating water pollution that will reinforce the use of yesterday's technology for tomorrow's developments. That, at any rate, will be the result if the opponents of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy succeed in defeating them in plenary. Regrettably they include our rapporteur, who actually ought to represent the opinion of the majority of the committee. Unfortunately, amongst these opponents of advanced technology are also colleagues from groups and countries which are usually in the vanguard of any initiatives to protect water and the environment and cannot go far enough.</p>
<p class="contents">Go and stand sometime at a filling station in a large harbour for recreational craft; you will see the quantities of fuel, diesel, petrol and oil that are pumped into the tanks of these boats. A considerable proportion of this fuel, although it depends on the design, is discharged directly into the water – without undergoing combustion – along with the exhaust emissions, because the exhaust pipe is under the surface of the water. The pollutants accumulate in inland waters and lakes, which are frequently used for the abstraction of drinking water. Nowhere else is the exchange of pollutants so great. It is precisely on lakes that the density of boats is often particularly high.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why we want more stringent requirements for these waters, that is, stricter limit values for recreational craft. The technology, Mr Callanan, is available. As an engineer you ought actually to be aware of this. Since existing craft will enjoy absolute protection and be able to be used until the end of their life, the argument of our Nordic colleagues does not hold water either.</p>
<p class="contents">The limit values laid down now will only have to be complied with by boats newly brought onto the market from 2005. An individual who buys a new recreational craft after 2005 will be able to use it on all waters. That is why I would urgently request your support for Amendments Nos 1, 11 and 13. By adopting these amendments we Europeans would be putting our words in Johannesburg into action.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Callanan, I have already heard your arguments almost word for word here in plenary; it was nearly 20 years ago in the mid-eighties, in the last century, when we were debating limit values for cars and the introduction of new technology. Then, as now, your country was the first to slam on the brakes. It is quite astonishing that in two decades you have not learnt any better. I believe that water is also the life of the future. We must do all we can to prevent our waters from becoming even more polluted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This in turn has its roots in the needs of industry and the manufacturers of recreational craft and the objective of a more viable internal market. The inverse of this can also be seen, as Commissioner Liikanen said, in that the question is also that we are finding ways of improving standards of environmental protection. It really is very important in this sector because waterways, for example, lakes, are often very vulnerable and they are also stocks of drinking water. Furthermore, recreational boating is a leisure activity, and people want to spend their time in the most tranquil surroundings possible. The reasons given for protection of waters are therefore, I believe, justifiable, and the better emission norms we obtain the better things will be.</p>
<p class="contents">The notion, however, that we might specify different emission limits for sea areas and internal water areas will not work on any account. It would, perhaps, in some parts of Europe but not where internal waters – lakes – are directly linked to the sea by means of rivers or canals, for example, and where people are very keen on boating. It would be very hard to tell people that they must change engines when they reach the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore in favour of emission limit values being as stringent as possible, but these kinds of artificial limits cannot be imposed. However, I do enthusiastically support our being able to impose tighter limits nationally, regionally and locally, as it is absolutely clear that the waters in different parts of Europe also differ greatly from one another. Certain areas need special protection from noise and other emissions, and this option must exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue, not connected with this directive, but connected with boating and the environment, is all the other waste associated with boating. By this I mean litter and other associated problems that boating causes. This must also be a cause of concern to us when we talk about the environment and boating. For example, boating organisations should be given the task of informing and enlightening their members with regard to what it means to be a good yachtsman, one who takes care of the environment. It will obviously then be society’s task to arrange things in such a way that yachtsmen can be responsible for their environment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, however, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, particularly since he has been so unfairly attacked by his own group. I consider, like the previous speaker Mrs Myller, that Mr Callanan has a realistic, practical and sound environmentally friendly basis for his work. It is important to have proposals that aim to improve the marine environment, and we Finns know how important it is to have a living sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Ever since work began on this directive, and at least since 1966 when Germany and Sweden came up with their proposed legislation, we have seen good developments with regard to the environmental impact from both two-stroke and four-stroke engines. Already today, we can see a positive development and lower fuel consumption. Personally I consider, however, that sailing is the activity in this context that is the least harmful to the environment, but that is another matter.</p>
<p class="contents">This matter is important for us Finns. Here in the Chamber, there are now three of us from Finland and Mr Arvidsson, who almost counts as one. In our countries, there is one boat for every seven inhabitants, so this is an important source of employment for us.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very difficult to measure the actual effects of the proposal. I have an estimate from Finland that shows that if we implement the proposal put forward by the rapporteur, the carbon monoxide emissions in the country would fall by 1.8% and emissions of hydrocarbons by 4.3%. On the other hand, there is not expected to be any difference in emissions of sulphur dioxide and other particles. The proposal would therefore lead to a slight reduction in hydrocarbons and at the same time produce a considerable reduction in the burden on the boat sector.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the proposal for a review clause from the rapporteur and the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will continue in its present form, since it is important for us to develop the boat categories. We know that this has some connection to the so-called Savolax boats, which should be familiar to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">I also hoped that the Commissioner would support Amendment No 22, since I believe that a committee is required. The present directive contains many technical details that apply to boat safety, and I do not believe that even we, well-informed MEPs who are present here, can cope with it properly. I understand that Amendment No 22 should be some sort of compromise. The industry is expecting this, and we should not need to dwell so long on issues that require the committee system. There are technical aspects. Just as the Commissioner said, this is in line with the principle of improved regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">You are concerned about Lake Constance, and we are concerned about our lakes and our Baltic. Under existing legislation, we can and shall introduce stricter provisions. These can be limited where there is reason, for example in relation to ground water. This does not need to be done with a directive, however. When we adopted directives on lawnmowers and cars, we introduced the same regulations across the entire Union. In that instance, we did not introduce something different for cars driving through the sensitive Austrian forests. It is consequently one and the same set of regulations, and afterwards limits are placed on the cars themselves with ecopoints or some other system. The same logic should apply to boats as well. I therefore support what the rapporteur and the previous speakers have said about the so-called Table 1a. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can assure you that these boats make a hell of a racket and produce an awful lot of exhaust, much more so than cars. Why is that? Because we have considerably improved cars over the past ten, fifteen years.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, in fact, on the initiative of the German and Swedish boat industry that this improvement is before us. The improvement, which will reduce noise and exhaust to some degree, has been adopted by the Commission. Unfortunately, we did not go far enough; we could have done much better, as Mrs Schleicher has already pointed out. The new technology is in place. Since it is not being used, we are forced to afford certain environmentally sensitive areas extra protection. I am also in favour of the internal market, but we should have used those very high standards that are technically possible. This will hopefully be done by way of the review clause.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased though that the rapporteur has endorsed my amendments and that we are going to do something about lubricants. As a huge number of boats leak, a great proportion of lubricant seeps out. There is also organic lubricant, which also leaks, but which does not present a problem. Organic lubricant is used on the famous lake in the Alps, for example, which we talked about earlier, where it is compulsory. It should, in fact, be made compulsory, or at least be promoted, in many more cases. This should be feasible by means of a simple tax rule. We suggest that Member States consider this.</p>
<p class="contents">I also suggest that the Commission considers this when we review this directive, because it would then be possible to provide for clean boats which hardly make any noise or hardly produce any exhaust, which do not leak, do not produce any annoying pools, that are not just ugly to look at but also harm the environment. All these boats combined emit an awful lot of this oil, and something could be done about it without too much effort. I hope that the Commissioner is prepared to consider this matter carefully during the review procedure. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard we must thank the rapporteur, Mr Callanan, for a job well done.</p>
<p class="contents">Harmonisation is reasonable and necessary, as some Member States, for example, Germany, Austria and Sweden, have already decided to bring in or plan their own legislation regarding exhaust limits for recreational craft. Harmonisation is necessary for trade, but it is at least as important to fix exhaust norms at the same minimum level in all Member States. In this way we can achieve ecological benefits and general well-being.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur thinks it inappropriate that craft built for personal use should be included in the scope of this directive, as this would not contribute to market harmonisation. This argument relating to the market is certainly a valid one. However, the second half of the directive that deals with people’s well-being as an aim will not materialise in the case of people living close to these sorts of self-built craft if noise limits, for example, are freely allowed to be exceeded.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a dubious notion, however, at the very least that different noise and exhaust limits should be applied according to whether a boat is meant for internal waters or the sea. Firstly, the amendments tabled with this in mind by my esteemed colleagues Mrs Schleicher, Mrs Flemming, Mr Wieland, Mrs Emilia Müller and Mr Bernd Lange are unrealistic in practice, as the same vessel is often taken from one water system to another, either by road or by driving it along canals or water channels. This I have done many times myself – I am a keen yachtswoman. Secondly, it is inconsistent with the idea of market harmonisation: if Amendment No 13 were approved, it would already have to be known when a boat was being manufactured whether it was to be used in fresh or salt water.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the ecological state of the seas in the Community area is already so bad that the argument regarding the vulnerability of inland waters does not stand up, because the converse of what these same colleagues of mine are saying is that it is fine to race around even a little more in the open sea – just go ahead! Unfortunately this is not true.</p>
<p class="contents">The report states with regard to vulnerable waters that the authorities in Member States may issue more stringent regulations than what is contained in this directive and that, I believe, is the correct way to proceed. In my country, for example, we have already been able to ban the use of motor vessels at local level in certain lakes which it has been seen especially justifiable to protect.</p>
<p class="contents">There are more than 182 000 lakes in Finland. Of Europe’s hundred largest lakes, half are in Finland. There are 647 rivers. Finland has 314 000 kilometres of coastline, which is about eight times the earth’s circumference. For Finland these natural features are a source of wealth that we have traditionally taken good care of, and it is therefore unnecessary under this directive to establish more stringent emission limits for our waters than for other areas. Instead, we should urge the Commission to issue proposals for emission limits common to all waters now being decided to be made more stringent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sweden and Finland have considerably more lakes than all other EU Member States combined. In our countries, it is common for the lakes to be sources of drinking water or very sensitive natural areas, for example breeding grounds for birds. In sensitive lakes, we currently meet the environmental demands through limits on boat traffic, for example boating bans in certain areas during the birds’ breeding periods.</p>
<p class="contents">In Sweden and Finland, it is also common to sail up lakes in boats that are used for coastal journeys. It is good that environmental requirements are set high even for leisure boat engines, as occurs in this directive. We Swedes, and my colleagues from Finland, are concerned, however, that this proposal for a directive opens the possibility of higher environmental requirements for leisure boats used on lakes than for those used for coastal journeys. In our countries, this would be an impracticable EU law, created by those who do not want to listen and take on board the message about the actual conditions in the Nordic Member States with their thousands of lakes.</p>
<p class="contents">With a separate environmental standard for boats used on lakes, we should be neglecting the actual reason for the proposal for a directive, the single market. In addition, we do not currently have the ability to obtain a higher environmental standard for leisure boats on lakes. The consequence will be that people will refrain from buying modern, environmentally better, boat engines. This proposal might look good on paper, but in reality the result would be a bad one, and there would be a bad result for the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">I would willingly raise the requirements for environmental standards for leisure boat engines in the future, but realistic specifications would then have to be set. Moreover, the transition periods would have to be adjusted to the time required for the development of new engine technology. No such amendments have been put forward, which is why the only reasonable thing is for the Commission to come back with new environmental requirements in a subsequent review of this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Boats often lie at anchor, but environmental policy must also be anchored. It has to be anchored in reality. If this is not the case, environmental policy will come adrift in troubled waters and among hidden rocks, and then it will be the environment that is damaged. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We also have these regulations for cars and that certainly does not mean that if our cars meet these standards they too are permitted to be driven anywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">At present, for example, there are rules limiting the number of boats on lakes to 100 or even 2 per lake. It is possible to ban recreational craft from lakes entirely. There are time restrictions, limiting the use of boats only to certain hours each day. In the end, this directive does not confer any right to operate recreational craft on all lakes at all times and under all possible conditions; all it does is allow free trade in boats and their licensing and it permits them to be used in authorised areas.</p>
<p class="contents">All of us in the European Union value the principle of harmonisation, but only where minimum standards are set so that these technical products can also be used. As you know, we in Parliament – and in particular in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy – attach the utmost importance to the principle of mutual recognition, and I believe that this directive makes boat licensing possible.</p>
<p class="contents">We see it as very positive that the general standards in the European Union are being raised substantially here. This would also automatically have an impact on the market, because with higher standards proportionally more boats would be permitted on the waters of Member States. If the standards are very low, the Member States will quite certainly take matters into their own hands by prohibiting the use of recreational craft on certain lakes altogether or by imposing time restrictions, for example by only allowing boats to be used in May or June.</p>
<p class="contents">There is therefore sufficient room for manoeuvre here. It is precisely from this point of view that it is necessary to alert individual drivers, as part of their training for their motorboat licences, to the environmental and noise problem, as well as to the problem of exhaust emissions. There are countless regulations here and these are of course very important in the individual countries. We should also observe how this directive develops in the future, because it is in all our interests – everyone in this House will agree – to have environmental regulations that are as good, rigorous and sustainable as possible. The sportsmen and -women who operate these boats are also keen to have the best possible boats, so the switch to a new generation of craft certainly has to be in all our interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
