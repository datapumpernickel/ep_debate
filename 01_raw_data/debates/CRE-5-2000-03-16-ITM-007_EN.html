<p class="contents">After democracy was restored, as a result – certainly – of the activities of the Shining Path terrorist organisation, the democratically-elected President of Peru, Mr Fujimori, carried out a government coup by dissolving Parliament and drawing up a constitution made-to-measure for himself as President.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament has already had occasion to condemn this type of action by President Fujimori.</p>
<p class="contents">President Fujimori has obviously re-established a degree of calm, if one can call it that, in Peru. But he has continued to keep himself in power by authoritarian means. In fact I would say that, for many, President Fujimori is no more than the civilian representative of military power exercised indirectly.</p>
<p class="contents">Yes, there are still elections in Peru, there are political parties, there are means of communication and there are certain guarantees. But the guarantees are not complete. The proof is that three judges from the Constitutional Court were removed for opposing his re-election plans. That means the guarantees are not complete. There is no independence of the judiciary or of the legislature.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Peru recently withdrew from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights, and I think that is a very bad sign for a country. I think we should ask the Government of Peru to review that decision.</p>
<p class="contents">And thirdly, there is still military action going on inside Peru at this moment, frequently creating difficulties for democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Remember that, as a member of the Andean Pact, Peru is bound to the European Union by a democracy clause and the European Community, or more specifically the Community institutions, has a certain responsibility by virtue of that democracy clause to call for the electoral process in Peru to be adapted, as far as possible, to certain essential democratic requirements.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I want to denounce the situation that exists in Peru, a situation which is due not just to the complacency and connivance of the United States, as has been mentioned here, but also to that of plenty of other countries, including European ones, and the hypocrisy which reigns over international politics.</p>
<p class="contents">It is well-known – and there is the Carter Foundation report – that access to the media must be provided as soon as possible, media bias must be ended, harassment of candidates and observers in local elections must be ended, improper use of public funds for electoral advantage must be exposed, there must be transparency in electoral administration and access for all parties to the elections and the rights of independent electoral observers must be guaranteed. In this respect, the reference just now to a permanent human rights observatory for Latin America seems to me entirely appropriate.</p>

<p class="contents">As has already been mentioned, the European Union maintains relations with Peru in the context of the cooperation agreement signed with the Andean Pact, in force since 1998. That agreement has borne fruit and the European Union is Peru’s principal economic partner and also its leading investor, having invested – together with the Member States – over USD 6 500 million in the last seven years.</p>
<p class="contents">United with the Republic of Peru in this context of friendship and cooperation, we trust that the coming presidential and legislative elections will be held in a fair and transparent manner, in accordance with universally recognised principles, and that they will serve to consolidate and deepen the rule of law and the democratic maturity of the Peruvian institutions. We hope all the political parties will be able to take part in these elections freely and on equal terms. </p>
<p class="contents">From 1980 until barely two months ago, there were regions in Peru under the control of the armed forces, due to the insecurity generated by the terrorism of Shining Path, which cost Peru – and this is the worst thing – 25 000 lives in the last fifteen years and losses of over USD 30 000 million.</p>
<p class="contents">In October 1998, the peace treaty was signed with Ecuador, ending a conflict which had been another reason for the presence of the armed forces in the frontier zones. Since then efforts have been made to re-adapt and re-organise the armed presence and, in our opinion, that must be continued.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I would not want to close without mentioning the fact that, regardless of Peru being a signatory to the American Human Rights Convention, we are concerned about its withdrawal from the jurisdiction of the Inter-American Court for Human Rights. So we would like to take specific advantage of this debate to ask Peru to review its decision and once again join in that work and accept the jurisdiction of the Convention.</p>

This should also be uppermost in the mind of the parliamentary delegation due to travel to the war zone over the coming weeks.

It is clear, including from the report by the Council of Europe delegation, that human rights have been violated and war crimes committed by all the warring factions.

This gave us a unique opportunity to discuss Russia’s war with Chechnya face-to-face with other Parliamentarians. These visitors appealed to us to understand that, in their words, Russia was fighting against terrorism and was not waging a real war, and that this fight against terrorism had been exacerbated by outside arms flows and training camps sponsored by predatory nations jealous of Russia’s power.</p>
<p class="contents">We responded. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and even her need in terms of security to protect her citizens internally from outside assault could not absolve her from her responsibilities under international conventions. I put the point that the containment by Russia of arms flows from Russia would be a very welcome step forward in terms of shared efforts to combat terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, two sides to this political tale of war and suffering, and I think we must seek more strongly to understand the causes of conflict between Russia and Chechnya, so that we can help to stem the flow of human blood more quickly another time. I suggest no sanctions, no economic sanctions against Russia should be considered at this time. We have a duty, now that the war is almost over, to have access to victims and to give aid for rehabilitation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is not apportioning blame to one side to talk of the genocide committed by Russia against the Chechen people, as Lord Judd does in the report by the Parliamentary Assembly delegation of the Council of Europe. Of course, both sides are guilty of infringements, but Lord Judd’s diagnosis is pretty unequivocal: genocide. That is reason enough not to ask Russia to investigate infringements and war crimes. It would be highly unusual to ask the murderer to investigate himself and we need international bodies to do this. What we need is the international criminal court and we must bring those responsible to justice. Of course, we must call on the Russian authorities here but we too must become more involved than previously, because this is not a simple internal matter of state; it is a question of human rights violations on a massive scale in an area subject to the Human Rights Convention of the Council of Europe, in an area subject to the system of rights and values of the OSCE. We seem to keep forgetting that the Chechen government was elected under the supervision of the OSCE and that we also need to intercede for this legitimate Chechen government, except that we cannot find this government today, because its representatives are holed up in the mountains fighting for their very survival. That is why I warn against a pseudo balanced approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, we must condemn infringements on both sides, but we should not confuse the perpetrator of genocide with his victims and that means that we must take good care not only to provide humanitarian aid – that must be done and it is high time that something was done by the EU here – but also to ensure that a political solution is found to the conflict. A political solution to the conflict cannot be enforced using the arms of the Russian army, because then the war will just keep breaking out in new forms as guerrilla war or as terrorism or as some other form of underground war. So we need to ensure that a negotiated solution is reached with the elected representatives of the Chechen people.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we discussed the right to self-determination in the Western Sahara; I should like to point out that the Chechen people also has a right to life and we must safeguard the Chechen people’s right to life, either jointly with Russia or on our own. We have not yet reached that point, but we did hear how Russian society is currently becoming more radical from an expert this morning.</p>
<p class="contents">We interceded for the release of the Russian journalist Mr Babitsky. He was due to visit the European Parliament today and give us an eye witness account of the situation in Chechnya, but he was not allowed to leave Russia. He was not allowed to come to Strasbourg because the Russian authorities are frightened of the free and open report of an independent journalist who looks at both sides critically and wished to throw some light on the truth here and reveal the genocide being committed against the Chechen people. It is a scandal and we cannot accept it. Freedom of the press for Russia is also a service to the Russian people.</p>

It seems to be becoming a permanent phenomenon in the region. We have condemned the Russian action over the recent months in five separate resolutions. There has been a certain amount of one-sided thinking in them here and there, which has not made them any more effective. For example, the idea to use the TACIS programme as a sanction will only lead to ordinary people suffering and has not deterred the Russian government in their policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The extension of the war and terrorism is a major threat to us all. For that reason, we need a Caucasus peace conference, because these problems are not confined to Chechnya. Secondly, the human rights situation is intolerable, and we therefore need a proper investigation into violations of human rights by all parties. In addition, speedy and unhindered access to the area on the part of relief organisations must be guaranteed once and for all. Thirdly, the war must be stopped and talks begun. And fourthly, Russia’s active participation in the work against international terrorism and the illegal arms trade is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the principal rule with respect to refugees is that they should be helped near to where they live and helped to return to their homes. We should be reminded, however – so as not to be too sanctimonious in all of this – that when Chechen refugees turned to us for help we did not receive them in our own countries as we did on such a large scale with Kosovo. In this we recognise the short-sightedness of our own policies.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A full investigation of human rights violations involving international observers is also in Russia’s political interests. Except that the Russian government does not appear to be totally convinced of the fact. How else are we to interpret the fact that the UN envoy Mary Robinson was not granted access to Grozny and the filtration camps.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement which has now been brokered with Mr Kalamanov by the human rights envoy of the Council of Europe, Gil Robles, is a step in the right direction. But it will only continue to be credible if the two Council of Europe envoys really can work independently and move freely and independently around the country. We reject and shall not accept any unilateral interpretation of the agreement by the Russian government. If it should come to the point that the Russian government fails to keep to this agreement, the Member States of the European Union must bring intergovernmental proceedings against Russia before the European Court of Human Rights and ensure that there is an international investigation of the human rights violations, and I cannot but support Mr Paasilinna. We too are required to put a halt to the expulsion of refugees in our countries, as the German government has done. We too are required to grant Chechens political asylum in our countries.

<p class="contents">We are also appalled, however, at the attitude of the western powers, in particular the European ones.

All societies and all States which stifle their own press are after one thing only: to silence debate and to extinguish the vital spark of democracy, which is to say the open and free society. </p>

Mr Milosevic and his fellow criminals must be removed. Democracy must be saved. </p>

The result is yet more conflict and violence.</p>

The situation in Yugoslavia is deteriorating by the day. In fact, it seems as if Mr Milosevic and his friends are playing a three-way game by means of which they are trying to deregulate anything which can possibly be deregulated. </p>
<p class="contents">Tension surrounding Montenegro is mounting. At Kosovo’s border, the situation is very unsettled and the regime in Belgrade is creating a climate in which large-scale accidents are likely. </p>
<p class="contents">The last few weeks have been marked by a series of repressive measures against the independent media. This ranged from high fines to direct intimidation. In addition, there is talk of a kind of internal isolation. It is increasingly difficult to enter the country. I experienced this myself a couple of weeks ago when I tried to attend a few conferences of opposition parties in Serbia. During that weekend, I was refused an entry visa whilst, two weeks prior to this, many international guests had been able to attend that bizarre conference staged by Milosevic. It shows that every effort is being made to keep out outside influences. There is also talk of curtailing communication by telephone, e-mail and keeping tabs on written correspondence. The government seems keen to remove the opposition from local authorities, where they have been entitled to be since the previous local elections. </p>
<p class="contents">The new regime can only win the new local elections, expected in May, if the opposition is, in effect, eliminated. I find this a dangerous game. </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we would like to see extensive protests against this media repression, but the EU should also look for ways to provide direct support to Serbia’s independent media. The latter is a vital lifeline for the opposition which will be mounting campaigns again this spring and which certainly deserves our support, also where the media is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

So much is clear. It seems to be heralding the elections in a perverse kind of way. The campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with him needs to keep their mouths shut. It is really unacceptable that elections will soon take place – allegedly formal, democratic elections – in a country where the opposition has first been left without any tool to express itself. It is a trademark of a totalitarian regime which knows all too well that free, independent media are a nuisance and pose a threat, even to a regime such as that of Milosevic. The EU’s support – on which we are probably all agreed – can roughly take two forms. It would be beneficial to support the media in the neighbouring countries: Croatia and a number of other countries have been mentioned. I am in favour of this. But it can never replace support provided to the media in Yugoslavia, in Serbia, media which deserve this support. The EU makes a difference. The EU has made a difference in the past with its support. It has an obligation to do this in future and should also be given the means to do this. This is fine within the framework of the new CARA programme, but it is also particularly important that this should happen in two weeks’ time, in conjunction with the Stability Pact. At the finance conference on the Stability Pact, the European Union can and must commit itself to a number of programmes. The programmes are ready, the necessity is there; let us take swift and unambiguous action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This crook, this old communist crook, is able to remain in power on account of his virtual monopoly of radio and TV and his oppression of any critical independent alternative, among other factors. </p>
<p class="contents">Various actions have been undertaken on the part of the European Union, such as providing independent stations with equipment. But now that one station after the other is being closed down, the EU will need to act again in consultation with the affected parties. We just heard that Mr Wiersma was denied a visa to visit the opposition in Belgrade. It is most peculiar that the European Union is not really aware that we too have this tool at our disposal and that, for example, we should, in fact, deny entry to the EU to the Serbian football hooligans in return, because they are people who take advantage of the Milosevic regime in the most shocking manner. </p>
<p class="contents">Now that the Stability Pact will be coming into its own, the help of the neighbouring states will provide a new and sound alternative, especially now that Croatia has experienced a political U-turn. Alternative reports can be directly provided via stations in Croatia and also in Montenegro. The Stability Pact can only succeed if Serbia is a democratic constitutional state, not before, and once the criminals have been brought to justice. As long as Milosevic and his friends can introduce laws which undermine the traditional human rights and human freedoms, as long as this is the case, the outlook for Serbia remains bleak. It is unfortunate that the internal opposition is so weak and so divided nationally. The European Union will need to look for powers in Serbia which are not driven by this blinkered nationalism but by values whose observance has also proved to benefit humanity in the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we will gladly support our compromise resolution, especially once the GUE/NGL has pulled out. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We should remember that, in October 1998, once NATO considered that the first planned attack on Serbia in order to help the Kosovars was over, because Milosevic had allegedly given way and allowed unarmed OSCE observers into the country, that it was precisely at this point that this Information Act was issued and began causing so many problems for the independent media: and now we are looking at the result. It has become clear over the last two years that the media are being increasingly sidelined. But we have already said that.</p>
<p class="contents">How weak must the Milosevic regime really feel, given how it treats the media? Apparently he is terrified that the awful truth of his inhumane treatment of all Serbian citizens over the years, even against the Serbs in Serbia, might finally be revealed to the majority of these citizens, terrified that the people might soon deal with Milosevic and his henchmen the way the Romanians dealt with Ceaucescu. I think he is terrified of this and we should help the media so that they can spread the truth about Milosevic and his regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Recently, it has taken systematic action against local stations, in particular. It does not flinch from using violence in these activities. Neither do the government-run media shrink from launching a full-blown witch hunt against the country’s independent media. They are then termed rather scornfully ‘NATO agents’ and ‘traitors of the mother country’. </p>
<p class="contents">It is not by chance that the powerful Serbian police apparatus operates mainly at local level, especially in those towns and cities where the opposition emerged victorious in the 1996 local elections. With the same elections round the corner and parliamentary elections not too far off either, many in Serbia suspect that the Milosevic regime has already launched its own campaign. </p>
<p class="contents">The target, regional radio and television stations, is an obvious one from a Milosevic viewpoint. Anyone in Serbia’s small and medium-sized towns who wants to see and hear anything other than what is spouted parrot-fashion by the state media based in Belgrade is heavily reliant on these stations. By the way: the few independent papers that do exist are hard to come by in the provinces. This once again underlines the significance of a political counter weight on the Serbian air waves.</p>
<p class="contents">As can be expected, Serbia’s dictator is fighting his battle against the as yet independent media in an underhand manner. Legalistic arguments over missing licences or outstanding financial state payments mask the true political intentions: to silence his own people as much as possible. What did receive the official seal of approval for the Serbian population, however, were the politically correct pop music stations of Slobo’s son Marko and daughter Marija.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this sad situation, all those in Serbia who stand up for the freedom of the press deserve our support. This is not just verbal support, but also tangible support in the form of new transmission equipment being provided to the affected stations, following consultation, as stipulated in paragraph 3 of the present joint resolution. Milosevic’s willing servants are then welcome to hold on to the confiscated technical equipment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Imposed on the Iraqi people I should say. The UN inspectors responsible for monitoring disarmament in Iraq have destroyed or ordered the destruction of the stocks of arms, material and products that could lead to the manufacture of weapons of mass destruction. They have made sure that Iraq has no long-range missiles that could threaten its neighbours. The International Atomic Energy Agency has concluded, after a number of investigations on the ground, that Iraq has no capacity to produce nuclear weapons, as has been confirmed by the reports of three groups of experts on Iraq, and as the UN Security Council’s Resolution 1284 confirms today. That is why our resolution calls for this embargo to be lifted.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, the US Government refuses to definitively lift the embargo, on the pretext that Iraq has not respected its obligations. Without offering the slightest proof, Washington continues to accuse Iraq of secretly manufacturing biological and chemical weapons. In response to this concern – which, according to the experts, is unfounded – France has proposed to the Security Council that the lifting of the embargo be accompanied by further inspections relating to disarmament and by controls on Iraqi imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Washington has refused this proposal too, thus creating a situation which primarily hits the Iraqi people and not their leaders. According to the UN humanitarian agencies, several hundreds of thousands of Iraqis, including some 500 000 children, have died prematurely because of the embargo, for lack of food, medicines or adequate care. For the first time in ten years, an American delegation of advisors and congressmen published a report yesterday, on 14 March, on their return from a visit to Iraq. In it they call for the embargo to be lifted for humanitarian reasons. According to that delegation, the ‘oil for food’ programme is a totally inadequate response to the urgent physical needs of the Iraqis. Mr Eric Rouleau, the former French Ambassador, speaks of a slow-motion genocide.</p>
<p class="contents">Our resolution therefore calls for an end to this situation. However, we also think we need a broader debate on this subject. That is why we are not putting this resolution to the vote today. On an issue as serious as this one, we prefer, first of all, to call for a Commission and Council declaration. We are therefore proposing that this debate be deferred to the month of April. At that time, we will endeavour to obtain the support of all those who want to bring this inhumane embargo to an end and to do so, needless to say, without giving Saddam Hussein’s regime a blank cheque.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As things stand at the moment, the Iraqi government is not prepared to accept this resolution, and there is a real danger that when the United Nations Commission responsible for monitoring the destruction of weapons of mass destruction applies for an entrance visa it will be refused. The British and American Governments have already given it to be understood that, in this case, hostilities would be resumed. It is therefore possible that, in a few months’ time, we will have a major military clash on our hands, not just the ticking over of long drawn out hostilities as, sadly, is the case even now – the bombs continue to fall periodically – but large-scale bombings within the space of a few weeks.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel that we should focus our attention on the possibility of preventing this from happening. I am sure that the Iraqi Government is prepared to accept Resolution 1284 – a fact confirmed by contact with the Iraqi leaders – but it needs clarification on certain points which are referred to in the Resolution. It must be made clear that, at the end of the United Nations mission, the embargo will be lifted – not just suspended, but lifted once and for all. No one will consider rebuilding Iraq if it is obvious that there will only be four months of stability, and that, after that, the embargo could be reimposed without fresh, credible reasons. </p>
<p class="contents">We have attempted to besiege Iraq and to force the Iraqi people to change their government through the embargo and we have not succeeded, even though we have been trying for seven and a half years. Instead of driving the Iraqis to rebel against the regime in power, the embargo has induced them to hostility towards the West, and in any case, has made them incapable of any kind of action. I feel that it would be more destabilising for the regime to return to a more comfortable situation in terms of trade, to a situation in which the people have at least some hope of happiness, rather than to continue with the embargoes which, at this stage, are not succeeding in overthrowing the regime, but are simply inflicting enormous suffering on the people and, in particular, on Iraqi children. Iraqis are not going to die of starvation. There is no famine, but there is an extremely serious health problem: the water and drainage systems have disintegrated and sewage water and drinking water mix, creating dysentery rates which send the infant mortality rate sky high. The people need more than medicine: they need us to go out there and rebuild their water supply network, their drainage system and their power stations, restoring an adequate quality of life. </p>
<p class="contents">I feel that our resolution should also serve to reassure the State of Israel. We must not forget that Iraq does not possess any nuclear weapons and is not likely to be able to produce any, but it is also true that if it did, its government, or part of it, would use them. We must therefore make it clear to Israel that a major concern of our policy is the defence of the State of Israel and the right of the State of Israel to exist. </p>
<p class="contents">We must draw up a balanced resolution which is acceptable to all the parties involved if we want to avoid the military clash which is lurking over the horizon: not a demagogic declaration, but a political proposal in which Europe takes control in order to protect world peace, exercising its key role in this area with due responsibility. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I must confess that I am extremely unhappy that we are not going to vote on this motion today. With every passing moment, we are rushing towards the danger of a military clash which must be avoided. I called for the issue to be debated during the last part-session, and I wonder at the fact that a month passed before our socialist friends managed to reach a consensus with us regarding a motion, even though there should not have been any difficulties as we agree on the basic points. Nevertheless, I realise that it is also important for us to achieve as great a consensus as possible in order to give our governments a firm basis. However, I call for no more time to be wasted, for I would not like us, as has happened in the past, to once again have to discuss what we should have done to preserve peace once war has already started. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Dennis Halliday, who resigned from his position as director of the UN humanitarian mission in Iraq in protest at the sanctions, confirms the UNICEF statistics – five to six thousand children die every month as a direct result of the sanctions. Mary Robinson, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, has been speaking out against the sanctions imposed in violation of international law, which prohibits the starving of civilians as a method of warfare. She says: ‘How can you expect me to condemn human rights abuses in Algeria, China and elsewhere when the United Nations themselves are responsible for the situation in Iraq?’ The UN economic sanctions have denied Iraqis spare parts to restore infrastructure, making water and airborne infectious disease rampant. Furthermore, the shortage of medical and food aid has made deaths from these treatable diseases epidemic. The UN estimates that five to six thousand children die unnecessarily each month due to sanctions, even after the UN food for oil programme. The sanctions constitute relentless lethal force, and innocent Iraqi people caught between opposing forces are paying the price. It cannot continue.</p>
<p class="contents">John Pilger's documentary two weeks ago on British television showed quite clearly what the situation is, and nobody with an ounce of humanitarian concern in them can ignore this plight and can persecute the innocent people who have no say over Saddam Hussein.

It is in the interests of all of us to prevent a new crisis and a new war in Kashmir, because, in the final analysis, it would come down to a military conflict between two countries which are equipped with atomic weapons, which are striving for atomic weapons and which are prepared to acquire atomic weapons. Whatever the details, whichever way you look at it, it is a damned dangerous situation which we have to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">Without making a value judgement, I think that both countries, India and Pakistan, must exercise extreme restraint. The one with regard to increasingly frequent violations of its borders and the other with regard to increasingly frequent proven discrimination against sections of the population, especially Muslim sections of the population in India. I do not want to make an assessment, I do not want to put it on the scales, but both sides are guilty of fanaticism, in this case religious fanaticism and extremism, which is making this trouble spot more and more dangerous.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union – and we have debated human rights, xenophobia and discrimination at length over the past few days – must fight against this extremism with all the means at its disposal wherever it occurs, at home, in the candidate countries or throughout the entire world.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to support all available initiatives. We are not the ones in the hot seat when it comes to taking initiatives. The United Nations and, without doubt, the United States of America find themselves in this position. But it is incumbent upon us to state clearly that this conflict needs to be resolved, not exacerbated.</p>
<p class="contents">In this sense, Mr President, I consider it important for Europe to raise its voice and call on both countries, both India and Pakistan, to do whatever they can and to offer them both international aid if they consider that it is needed or makes sense in order to resolve this conflict. What we must not do is keep quiet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

India and Pakistan have carried on this conflict for over fifty years now. There were UN resolutions that called for a plebiscite for the people of Kashmir all that time ago, and still nothing has happened. It is even more important now that we find a solution, especially as both India and Pakistan are nuclear powers. If there is another war across that border, I believe it could turn into a nuclear war, and that will be a problem not only for India and Pakistan and the people of Kashmir but for all of us. That is why I hope India and Pakistan will come to the negotiating table, together with the people of Kashmir. I would like to see either the European Union or the USA acting as an honest broker, as a mediator, to try to find an end to this dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">But whatever happens, the human rights abuses must stop. We have daily reports of rapes, murder, torture, and a lot of people say, “Oh, this is an exaggeration”. But when I was in Azad Kashmir and I went to one of the refugee camps a few years ago I was very moved by the first-hand accounts I heard. I was even more moved when I went into a tent where the women and children were. I went up to one woman and although we could not speak each other’s languages we stood there and hugged each other. That woman was sobbing her heart out. I could almost touch the pain, really feel the pain of that woman. She was not acting it, she was not pretending it – nobody goes to a refugee camp for fun. They were there because they had been tortured, they had been mistreated and they were escaping. That was not an isolated incident, and it is still happening today. We must find a solution. They must come to the negotiating table.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is long overdue, for the reasons which our previous speakers have already underlined. Relations between India and Pakistan are indeed deteriorating, with Kashmir being a particular bone of contention. Tensions are also being aggravated by the fact that these two countries are nuclear powers. Indeed, in the Herald Tribune of Tuesday, March 14, 2000, the headline reads: “Nuclear war between India and Pakistan is a real possibility”.</p>
<p class="contents">For this reason alone, supported also by the well-known UN resolutions and the reference which has already been made to the constant violation of human rights, Kashmir is no longer a problem that can be swept under the carpet and not debated in this Parliament, as has happened for many years. It is increasingly an international problem and one where mediation will, in my view, become essential.</p>
<p class="contents">So what can we do to bring long-term stability to this volatile region? We discussed this issue when we met with members of the US Congress in our normal framework of delegations earlier this year. The US is in favour of arbitration, but it strikes me that, when President Clinton visits these two countries next week, India should be asked to come to the negotiating table so that, together with Pakistan, it can find a long-term settlement to this Kashmir question.</p>
<p class="contents">Equally, the European Union should, when formulating policy towards South-East Asia, raise the profile of this issue in order that we in the Foreign Affairs Committee can have a more substantive reason to have a debate in our Chamber in a few months’ time. As these two approaches are made, this two-pronged approach by the European Union and the United States is, in my view, the best way to start the process for long-term peace and stability in this region.</p>

It has not been completely forgotten in the sense that political refugees who live in our own towns and neighbourhoods come and talk to us about this problem. I am then often ashamed at how little influence we can exert as a huge economic power in the political field. This is why I welcome the debate on this conflict today. However, we should not just treat it as a conflict between Pakistan and India regarding the respective spheres of influence that the two countries want to see established. Very often, the people who actually live there are not taken into account. Although the UN resolutions of 1948 and 1949 stipulated that the fate of Kashmir and Jammu should be decided by a referendum under international supervision, this never actually happened. India and Pakistan were supposed to attempt this on their own, but this only led to a whole raft of small conflicts which – and the previous speakers were right to underline this – have taken on more threatening proportions since both countries have become nuclear powers. This appears to have awakened world opinion again. I am convinced that international mediation is desirable and necessary. I am therefore happy to concur with what Kofi Annan said concerning this matter, but I do hope that this will not prejudice the right to self-determination on the part of the peoples involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Over a year ago, in February 1999, there was hope for new relations between India and Pakistan. In the Lahore declaration, both presidents confirmed their determination to comply with the 1972 Simla agreement. Unfortunately, the Lahore process came to a standstill during the clash over Kargil between May and July 1999. The latest development in Kashmir is worrying. We condemn the continuing human rights violations, the religious fanaticism, the sabotage and the terrorism. The cause lies in activities by rebels who are operating across the border, across the line of control from the Pakistani side and systematically attacking unarmed civilians. India has repeatedly accused the government and Islamabad of backing the guerrillas with technical and military know-how. Border crossings have to be prevented along a 700 km stretch of country which is hard to monitor. The political and military situation needs to be further stabilised in order to create a climate for bilateral talks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Indian government has already declared that it is prepared to resume negotiations, provided that the demarcation line is strictly adhered to and fundamentalist tendencies are checked. When US President Clinton visits South-East Asia at the end of March – James Elles referred to this – and if we are to visit India in April as the SAARC delegation of the European Parliament, then the subject of Kashmir will need to go to the top of the agenda. We must work on achieving a <span class="italic">rapprochement </span>between the two neighbouring states, the Islamic state of Pakistan and the multinational state of India.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to Commissioner Patten and the high representative of the Council, Mr Solana, to ensure that the European Union has a chance to distinguish itself as a successful international mediator in conflict situations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A consultation took place between the Commission and the Member States, concluding that the situation does not justify the organisation and deployment of a full EU observation mission. Some Member States announced, however, that they would be sending observers on a bilateral basis including, in some cases, representatives of their national parliaments. They are also supporting the mission of observers of the Organisation of American States, led by the former Minister for Foreign Affairs of Guatemala, Mr Eduardo Stein.</p>
<p class="contents">On the human rights situation in Chechnya I have the following comments. The Commission is also deeply concerned about increasing evidence of human rights abuses in Chechnya. We want Russia to comply with its OSCE/Council of Europe commitments and seek a political settlement, allow independent investigations on reported human rights abuses, improve the climate for an independent press to operate, and address the legitimate requests of humanitarian operators. These issues are also mentioned in your resolution. It was exactly these issues I discussed very directly with the Russian Government during my visit to the region at the beginning of February.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also reiterated this message through Foreign Minister Ivanov during the ministerial troika on 2 March, where we submitted to him a number of concrete proposals including ECHO assessment missions to Chechnya, NGO access and basic requests, visits of EU diplomats to the region before presidential elections to report on civil conditions, the humanitarian situation, alleged human rights abuses and investigations. We are still waiting for an answer from the Russian authorities on these concrete proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">On the media situation in Serbia, the mounting series of actions taken against Studio B by the authorities last week are wholly unacceptable and we deplore them. The increasing pressure put on the independent media shows just how important those media are.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission has made great efforts to support the independent media in Serbia. In December 1999 we approved a EUR 3.3 million programme of support. We have put aside an emergency envelope of funding which will be able to provide equipment and survival funds for these media, including such television stations as Studio B. The Commission is allocating new personnel for the implementation of media projects, and our contracts with beneficiaries have been streamlined to try and speed up the process of the delivery of grants.</p>
<p class="contents">Satellite equipment is being distributed across the region to Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Macedonia.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Commission's Europe-by-satellite service is continuing its support by making available time on its service for independent TV stations in Serbia to broadcast information which will reach the rest of the region and encourage exchange of programmes.</p>
<p class="contents">On Iraq, I have the following comments: the Commission is concerned about the unilateral Iraqi decision to oppose the acceptance of UN Security Council resolution 1284 and its subsequent delaying of the operation of the new monitoring instrument UNMOVIC and the easing of the sanction regime. This will only prolong the crisis in Iraq. Oil for food remains the best short-term option to alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi population. In the longer term, the economic and social situation in Iraq can only be improved by increased economic activities stimulated by lifting sanctions. Ways should be pursued to engage the Iraqi government in a dialogue on the implementation of UN Security Council resolutions which might lead to a gradual easing of sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">But let us be clear – the key to the lifting of sanctions lies with the Iraqis. The Commission has, since the Gulf War in 1991, been the major donor of humanitarian aid to Iraq, to the tune of over EUR 242 million. Another EUR 8.6 million is allocated from the 2000 ECHO budget. The Commission is, however, concerned about the restrictions imposed by the Iraqi Government on NGO operations, which may jeopardise the implementation of ECHO financed humanitarian aid programmes in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, on the situation in Jammu and Kashmir, the Commission welcomes the European Parliament's deep concern regarding the Kashmir conflict reflected in the different draft resolutions. The international community's concern for the region is a legitimate one, particularly as both sides possess nuclear weapons and as dialogue between them has, at this stage, effectively broken down. Precisely because of this impasse and the high risks involved, third parties must adopt a balanced approach. Third parties may urge both sides to de-escalate military confrontation in a structured way and resume comprehensive dialogue with a view to relaunching the Lahore peace process. Pakistan should be asked to put a stop to infiltration of paramilitary personnel crossing over from their side of the line of control. India should be encouraged to look for and explore the full potential towards internal political solutions to meet the expectations of the Jammu and Kashmir populations in line with the possibility for enhanced autonomy as enshrined in its constitution.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission believes that a stand on the issue should take the present extreme sensitivity of the situation into account, especially with a view to the upcoming EU summit with India, where Kashmir will certainly be discussed.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
