I should like to remind you that in March of last year, Parliament indicated that in its view, the present situation, with unlimited provision of information to the United States, should end. Parliament repeated this request in October last year and asked the Commission to indicate what information can be passed on legitimately and without any risks. Parliament has also asked for the immediate replacement of the present ‘pull’ system by a ‘push’ system, and for negotiations on an international agreement to provide European citizens with real guarantees and the same legal protection as American citizens. That is crucial and lies at the heart of this discussion. What is now before us is a so-called light agreement, an agreement in which, to all intents and purposes, this House is off-side. After all, our approval is not required; all we can do is to make a recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, a deliberate decision was made in favour of a light agreement, while we had specifically asked for a heavy agreement. Indeed, a heavy agreement would have involved Parliament, whereas now, we are to some extent off-side. The Article 29 Committee, the group of experts, has stated that this agreement is inadequate, I, as the rapporteur, would suggest to Parliament that we act upon their opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, what is happening? As early on as in Article 1 of the agreement, it is stated that the existing situation, in which unlimited information is provided to the United States, can be sustained until such time as a ‘push’ system is developed, which, as it happens, it has not been, and neither is it in the pipeline. We have taken advice on how long it can take before a ‘push’ system is in place, and I have included that in my resolution. A ‘push’ system can be in place within three months, and in actual fact, has been in place already, because we were told in December that such a system was underway. What we are therefore doing now is to legitimise what we have considered to be illegitimate on two occasions. Meanwhile, we are put under extreme pressure, both by the United States and the Commission, to rubberstamp the agreement, while we are uncertain as to its exact purpose. On the one hand, it is stated that it aims to fight terrorism, while, on the other hand, it is also used to fight serious crimes. These are not defined, though, which I find extremely objectionable.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament has asked for an agreement in which the role of the airline companies is clearly indicated, how they are protected and what the guarantees are for passengers, enabling the latter to correct their details. We have also asked for an agreement in which the liability of airline companies and governments is regulated in the event of errors in code transcription. Meanwhile, we have gained some practical knowledge involving the United States. My colleague, Mr Sörensen, has asked, after having travelled to the United States, to peruse his details with a view to changing them if need be. After two months, he received a reply, stating that he is not allowed to peruse his details, because that would expose the US strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">If we look at legislation in the United States, we have to conclude that the Privacy Act should provide some level of protection. I have asked the United States to inform me specifically what this protection would consist of, and have not had a reply to date. The Patriot Act also plays a part in this. As a matter of fact, pursuant to this Act, any citizen who is suspected of terrorism can be indicted, without having any access to the courts. In short, the judicial process in the United States is not sufficiently regulated. The protection of our citizens in the United States is not sufficiently regulated. There is no level playing field where European and American citizens are concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore discussing a matter in which we, should we approve it, would miss the mark altogether. It has been suggested that we would not be prepared to fight terrorists, but it is not about that at all. On the contrary, we have asked the Commission three times to table our own proposal which could also apply in Europe. Neither is this about bad relations with the United States. That is completely unrelated and should, in my view, not come into the discussion in any way. It is about us having to protect our citizens and them being able to expect this from us, in the same way as US citizens can expect this of their government. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From the very beginning, all those involved have recognised the difficulty of finding the answer to the question in front of us: what is the right balance between security demands and civil liberty? We tackle this against a rather sombre backdrop. Just before the weekend, the European Council agreed on a strong package of measures to reinforce the anti-terrorism efforts of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I know that Parliament will not want to send any equivocal messages about terrorism. At the same time, we all agree that the fight against terrorism cannot and must not be carried out at the expense of the protection of fundamental rights such as privacy. Against this background, I would like to invite Members to reflect carefully on what this resolution – if adopted – could possibly achieve and to check whether this corresponds to our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">I dare to say 'our objectives' because the Commission and the Parliament can surely agree on what our goals are. Firstly, to cooperate to fight the scourge of terrorism without sacrificing fundamental civil rights and liberties. Secondly, to free airlines from the threat of being caught between contradictory legal requirements with which they have to comply. Thirdly, to make sure that such transfers are made in a clear and secure legal framework. Fourthly, to foster a cooperative and balanced relationship with the United States. Fifthly, and most importantly, to improve the protection given to air passengers and to their data that are transferred to the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">For over a year, the Commission has been negotiating with the United States with a view to meeting these objectives. I ask you frankly: does the motion for a resolution in front of us pay sufficient attention to the significant progress that has been achieved? The Commission certainly wanted more and pressed hard for more over long months of tough negotiations. But, as Members of this House know from their day-to-day dealings, the result of negotiations is rarely, if ever, perfect.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be honest with ourselves: our own delivery of our high data protection standards is far from being ideal. Recent Eurobarometer results show worryingly low levels of knowledge by European citizens about their rights and obligations. So let us be cautious before preaching to the rest of the world. The key question today on this file is: can we realistically achieve more?</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution asks the Commission to tell the United States that its concessions are not enough. Furthermore, it seeks to open new negotiations with a view to reaching a better solution. The list of demands in the resolution is no doubt a very fine one, but will it take us closer to our objectives? In the light of my experience over the last 12 months I am afraid I have to inform the House that this is pie in the sky.</p>
<p class="contents">The results of rejecting this package will not be a better package, but no package at all. Having no package does not get us one inch closer to our objectives, which I thought we shared. It certainly does not lead to better data protection in the United States. We would be simply throwing away all those hard-won improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">It certainly does nothing either for future EU-US cooperation. We can only influence the United States if we are credible interlocutors. Credible interlocutors deliver results. Delivering nothing after a year of negotiations does not meet the credibility test, and believe me, there are voices in Washington only too ready to say to Secretary Ridge 'We told you that negotiating with these people is a waste of time'. There is therefore a real risk that the United States will leave the negotiating table and not return.</p>
<p class="contents">Defenders of the resolution by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs may say that this is an unlikely disaster scenario and that the Commission is just running scare stories to justify its own poor achievements. Of course, the proof of the pudding will only be in the eating, but if I were a Member of this Parliament, I would not bank on it that the aims of the resolution are achievable.</p>
<p class="contents">Please ask yourselves whether it is likely that the United States will suddenly double the amount of change it is prepared to make and do so by June, as the resolution demands? Members of this House have had their own contacts with American representatives over the last few months, and I am sure you have formed your own views about their openness to our arguments.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution and its defenders also point to obtaining passengers' consent to the transfer as the 'magic' solution while we skilfully negotiate a new and better deal. Let me repeat the Commission's full and active support for measures that ensure that passengers are fully and accurately informed and, where possible, give their agreement. But that should be in addition to – not instead of – the actions we have taken to improve protection in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the last year, Parliament has been an extremely active and outspoken participant in this debate. In doing so, it has undoubtedly strengthened the Commission's position in its negotiations with the United States. Clearly, Parliament should not be silent at this stage. I was indeed expecting some further expressions of concern and constructive criticism. Of course nobody is asking Parliament to say that it approves of and espouses the American system and approach. Indeed, the Commission itself does not espouse the American approach part and parcel, nor will we stop trying to achieve improvements in it. Indeed, I am currently still in touch with the American authorities with a view to firming up and clarifying their commitments regarding the conditions under which they will be able to forward passenger data to third-country authorities. So, we are still working to improve the situation even further – and will continue to do so – before the Commission takes its final decision on an adequacy finding. It is one thing to say that what is on offer is not perfect, and quite another to seek its complete derailment – as the resolution as it stands does. That is why I would ask you to reject this motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I shall summarise the choice before Parliament. Rejection of the motion will allow the Commission's proposed package – <span class="italic">with</span> the improvements in data protection that we negotiated with the United States – to go ahead. Among these major improvements there are annual joint reviews to enable us to keep a close eye on things, and a clear cut-off date after three and a half years. It would also end legal insecurity and remove threats of sanctions for the airlines. I have no doubt there would be positive spin-offs for EU-US cooperation. That is the first choice.</p>
<p class="contents">The second choice is adoption of the motion for a resolution, which would mean foregoing those advantages in return for a declaration of principle and a wish list that – I am sorry to say – cannot realistically be delivered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, we are once again debating an issue in this House with which we are all only too familiar. In fact, since data on passengers whose final destination or transit destination is the United States was first forwarded to the United States more than a year ago, this Parliament has expressed many concerns about the completely unacceptable way in which this information has been and is still being forwarded.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, however, we are once again debating this issue, but in rather different circumstances. Firstly, because we have before us a Commission decision which describes the level of protection that the United States guarantees for the data forwarded to them as ‘adequate’, and, secondly, because the recent tragic attacks of 11 March in Madrid – following on from those of 11 September – oblige all of us to reflect and accept that only through international cooperation can we triumph over a brutal and merciless enemy which attacks free and democratic societies such as ours.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, my group is not entirely satisfied with the decision the Commission is presenting to us. It even shares some of the criticisms expressed by the rapporteur in her report. But what shall we do? Shall we go back to the beginning? Shall we wait another year? Are we going to concern ourselves with strengthening legal safeguards as much as possible while terrorists move freely from one continent to another and mercilessly murder thousands of people, who – incidentally – have not been given any right to defend themselves?</p>
<p class="contents">Let us be realistic. Let us accept this new legal framework for cooperation with the United States despite all our reservations. Let us subject it to a test period and, if necessary, revise it later. The general public, who are horrified by all this violence, would not understand any other option at this time.</p>
<p class="contents">The negotiations held between the Community authorities and the United States authorities have led to agreements, the importance of which I believe must not be underestimated: we have managed to reduce the data that will be forwarded, to restrict the purposes for which they will be collected, to restrict the time for which they will be stored and to ensure that our citizens have mechanisms allowing them to correct that data and lodge complaints in the event that these are used improperly. Furthermore, following a period of three and a half years, the agreement could be revised in the light of the results achieved. In saying this, I am not implying that the agreement reached is ideal in every way, but that it is satisfactory in some respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore – as I have said – circumstances have changed and have done so in a tragic way. The European Union – and this was demonstrated by the European Council, which has just been held – has fully and firmly declared war on terrorism. Effective action in this regard requires cooperation and coordination to be promoted within the European Union, between the police and judicial authorities of the Member States and between the bodies which the European Union has created for this purpose – of which I would highlight Europol and Eurojust – but also through cooperation with third countries, and there is absolutely no doubt that we share with the United States the common objective and firm intention of beating the scourge of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that the agreement we are debating today and which has been the subject of an excessively critical report by the rapporteur, strikes a reasonable balance between implementing much-needed security measures and safeguarding civil rights. The agreement also provides citizens with a level of protection and legal certainty that we would lose if we decided to refer the Decision back to the Commission, leading to a further period in which there would be a legal vacuum. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is all too clear that the United States, like any other country that seriously wants to combat terrorism, has the right to carry out any type of inspection into the identity of those entering their territory, their reason for entering and the time that they are staying. To this end, the European Parliament has often hoped for and continues to call for an international agreement defining what personal data of air passengers must be automatically transferred in advance to the United States security agencies, what further data can be requested, who can use them, how long they can be kept for, what responsibility airlines have in case of error in the transcription or transmission of data and, above all, what redress is offered to passengers in the event of error and what appeals are possible in the event of infringements of their rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the long negotiations, the unilateral commitments made by the United States do not provide the guarantees requested or an adequate level of protection. This is because these undertakings do not constitute a binding international agreement, in fact, it is explicitly stipulated that they do not result in any right for any public or private party. It is also due to the fact that a huge amount of personal data, which varies according to the practices of individual companies, is obtained through direct access to different airline archives. These data are collected for private purposes and might be different if collected for security purposes: for example, all those who failed to leave the United States on the return flight that they booked could be considered suspects. Now we are all used to buying return air tickets simply because they often cost less than single tickets. If we were to reply to a question from a policeman or a customs official concerning the date of our return, we would give the exact date and not the one appearing on the flight ticket that we do not intend to use for the return journey. The date that will be considered, however, is the one that appears in the airline records. Do you see what serious misunderstandings could be created by the uncontrolled use, for security purposes, of data collected for commercial purposes? The same goes for the accuracy of data, such as the correct and complete spelling of names.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, I am still waiting for the Council to reply to an urgent question on the serious misfortune of an Italian citizen, arrested on his arrival in the United States and sent back to Europe because of a misunderstanding, without being able to offer any explanation. A European manager who is a victim of a similar misunderstanding and thus unfairly considered a suspect could see his career ruined. How could he get justice?</p>
<p class="contents">It is wrong and dangerous, even to effectively combat terrorism, to depend on the arbitrary collection of data that were not specifically selected for security purposes, and it is unfair not to provide for quick and effective instruments to guarantee the rectification of incorrect data for those concerned. I recall that Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union states that ‘everyone has the right of access to data which has been collected concerning him or her, and the right to have it rectified.’ The Commission’s decision does not respect Community law or the Union’s principles. The Commission goes beyond the powers conferred on it by Article 25 of the directive on the protection of data when it states that the United States provides adequate protection of the rights of European citizens. It is not true that it is impossible to obtain a more adequate result. The US associations for the protection of fundamental rights are themselves calling for better legislative protection in their country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Airlines are almost certainly breaking the law on data protection by giving the US authorities confidential information about their passengers. To take action would harm our airlines and may lead to disruption in travel to the US; not to act rides roughshod over individual privacy in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has sought to reach an agreement with the United States. The concerns about this agreement are widespread. They are shared by the Article 29 Committee, and quite possibly by the heads of state and government meeting last weekend, who amended the draft presidency conclusions on this issue. They are very much borne out from this House in this report. In the United States widespread criticism of methods adopted by the government in the fight against terrorism is evident, whether it is to do with the policy of detention without trial or the way in which the heavy hand of the state is being imposed in areas like this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission's proposed deal on the transfer of data is a deal too far: more information is sought than is strictly necessary; that information can be held too long with no right for the individual to correct it; there is no right to compensation for people denied boarding of aircraft and no legal redress against abuse of personal data by the state. Liberal Democrats believe that it is possible to be tough on terrorism and true to the treaties we have signed on civil liberties. We bow to nobody in our determination to fight terrorism. We urge our Member States to act more effectively. We recognise the need to work with democracies across the Atlantic; but let us do so intelligently, with a response that is measured and proportionate, and not sacrifice our freedoms in our determination to fight those who threaten them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The point has already been made – not least by the Commissioner – that there is an issue here about balancing security and civil liberties. It is our job as parliamentarians to scrutinise proposed agreements and to hold the line in terms of civil liberties. My Group believes that the balance is wrong in this agreement, because there is a lack of certainty on the protection of information. It seems, in many respects, to be a fishing policy – a wide trawl with the hope of catching something, and who cares about the by-catch, as it were.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already heard about the question of those refused boarding. What happens to them? What happens to their employment prospects if they cannot get into the United States because some of their details do not look right? The issues of appeal and redress are crucial in any legal situation.</p>
<p class="contents">We are already aware that certain European Union airlines have been fined considerable sums of money by the United States for not supplying full data. Certainly the attitude that we have heard from them is that they are quite willing to see the American Government in court over these particular fines. This also raises the issue of whether our own institutions, despite the difficult situation, have the right effectively to override our own data-protection rules and controls in an international context.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, on the issue of passenger consent: it becomes totally meaningless if it has no result but to sign away rights that you were never sure you had in the first place. So we shall support the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner Bolkestein, for 13 months the law of 15 countries of the European Union and even Community regulations have been violated every day. You have not dealt with this. We should not have gone into negotiations such as these in the position of weakness of a party willing to give up respect for and enforcement of its own law. Of course, today we are in a weak position because we were already in a weak position when we entered negotiations. The US security authorities can in no way demand that airlines illegally transfer personal data. This is only possible because you, Commissioner, all of you, the European Commission, the Member States and the majority of those guaranteeing privacy accepted all of this.</p>
<p class="contents">There could have been an alternative solution: a solution, for example, that provided for the preparation by the US security authorities of simple visa mechanisms, on the basis of which the individual would provide personal data, not to the airline company for commercial purposes, but to the security authorities. You did not want to implement this solution because, just as the United States is doing, you are preparing to allow data that is collected for commercial purposes to be used for security purposes. This is contrary to the European Convention on Human Rights. Combating terrorism by tolerating illegality for 13 months is a true picture of what this Europe is doing; and ‘Mr Terrorism’ has been appointed on the same basis. Europol and Eurojust do not provide for any democratic control, or for any control by the Court of Justice. This is no way to build an antiterrorist Europe! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Terrorists have no fear of our debates, nor of directives or regulations; the only thing they fear is real and effective action.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to get on with taking appropriate steps to protect ourselves and the European public. What this means is that we have to act rather than holding interminable debates. What we need is cooperation within the European Union and cooperation with those outside it, specifically with the United States of America, but we do, obviously, expect certain ground rules to be laid down for them and, of course, we expect them to be obeyed. We have proposed, and the Commission has agreed, that certain expectations would have to be met, for example that the only data forwarded would be such as would help to combat terrorism, that data would be stored for decent period of time, which we demanded should be reduced, that only one authority in the United States would have access to it, that it would be possible to monitor what was done with it, that passengers had to be informed and that the European public would have an EU authority to represent them.</p>
<p class="contents">Those – among others – were our demands, and we were assured that they would actually be complied with. If they have been, and if we can also set up a ‘push’ system with filters, then we should use the opportunity to seek out others with whom we can cooperate in the fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We are one step away from bringing this to a close. We should see to it that we take prompt action, before it is too late for the European Union and for the security of its citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That perseverance will yet come in useful.</p>
<p class="contents">I will repeat myself yet again: it is necessary to fight terrorism, but not all means are justified. The agreement we are discussing today is one such means, which overshoots the mark when it comes to fighting terrorism. Although the Commission, in its adequacy finding, has concluded that the United States offers a suitable level of protection for the passenger details that are transferred, I am not all that convinced. The present agreement offers EU citizens insufficient guarantees. There are no satisfactory legal means for citizens who get into difficulties, as has been demonstrated in the examples that a number of Members have given. Moreover, it is explicitly stipulated that the details can also be used for other purposes, such as the domestic fight against crime in the United States. In that respect, the third party to which the details are passed on is not specified, and it is very difficult to monitor what happens to them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Article 29 working party has come to the unanimous conclusion that this agreement contravenes European legislation. In fact, the Council, too, carefully mooted the idea in February that the American measures might be in conflict with European national legislation and this doubt, as Mr Watson has already remarked in relation to the most recent European Council, has not been taken away – quite the opposite. It therefore looks as if the Commission is the only institution still holding to its conclusions concerning the suitable level of protection. Maybe the time has come for the Commission to acknowledge the error of its ways and admit that it has gone beyond its remit. The present proposal is inadequate and that is why the Commission has to submit a fresh proposal, one containing sufficient protection mechanisms for the European public.</p>
<p class="contents">For nearly a year now, European legislation has been broken under the pretext of fighting terrorism. If the Commission is so convinced that this agreement meets European legislation and does not contravene the Treaty, it is really beyond me why it is not prepared to apply the procedure of Article 300 of the EC Treaty and have the Court of Justice carry out a few verifications. I am therefore pleased that this option is still open in the resolution before us. Indeed, the fight is not over by a long way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with everything she said.</p>
<p class="contents">I was quite shocked at the Commissioner's attitude towards Parliament today. It was extremely arrogant, to say the least. Parliament has adopted a position much more in line with the Treaties than that of the Commission. The Commission should ensure that the Treaties are complied with and that data transfer complies fully with EU legislation on data protection. Last March Parliament asked the Commission to do this. However, what it seems to have done is to have gone away and come back claiming that it has adequate levels of protection. The Commissioner said that adequate levels of protection from the US is the best he can do and that Parliament's attitude is irresponsible. I do not believe that is justified. That is a cavalier attitude towards long-fought and established civil liberties.</p>
<p class="contents">What has been said today is in relation to access to data, trying to correct errors, the purpose for which this data will be used, where else it might go and, in particular, the right of people to legal redress. People's lives could be dramatically changed as a result of incorrect data held on them or mistakes that have been made. Why should European citizens have a different level of protection from US citizens? Ideally I would like to see an immediate termination of PNR transfers to the US until we have a permanent legislative solution in place.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the way to fight terrorism. If we push aside the rule of law and long-established civil rights, we will not only allow the terrorists to win on one front, but allow them to win on all fronts. We are creating a very dark and oppressive future for everyone. This is not the approach that should be taken. Civil liberties have to be upheld. One only has to look at the United States to see the measures that have been brought in, in recent times, to combat terrorism. They do not work. The Patriot Act and other measures do not work. All they do is suppress the rights of ordinary law-abiding citizens, without them having any right to legal redress. I do not believe that this is the way forward in the 21st century. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In order to do this, I had to apply for a visa and provide a whole array of highly personal details. As well as flying from Frankfurt to Peking, I was planning to take a connecting flight with a Chinese airline from Peking to Guilin, and this involved some of the data being transferred from one airline to another, a process that enables the Chinese state to get its hands on a plethora of personal data. I have to tell Mrs Lambert that I am unaware of there being any sort of data protection law in China, nor can I ask who there is storing my data, or which data are stored for any particular purpose; I cannot ask for it to be corrected, contact the Chinese data protection supervisor or take the government to court. Despite that, we are not banning flights to China or demanding general agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Now there is, I know, a great difference involved here, in that, when you fly to the United States, their system can directly access or ‘pull’ your data, rather than it being ‘pushed’ over to them, so that the United States have direct access to our systems; they are not limited to the data that we forward to them. Let me add, Commissioner, that the demands we are making now bear no relation to some sort of wish list; this is European data protection legislation, in black and white. The obligation is now on you to switch over to a ‘push’ system. What I would like is a response from you, and right now. Failing that, I appeal for more calm. The fact that different standards of data protection prevail does not mean that citizens’ rights are under threat. The United States has a legitimate interest in this instance, that being in the defence of their country. I doubt whether other countries could claim the same, even though they disregard our data protection legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I might add, ladies and gentlemen, that I never got to China, because I had not submitted my visa information in good time. Unfortunately, I had no legal remedy against that either. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There can also be no doubt that close cooperation is required, both at Community and at transatlantic level. What concerns me, however, is that we might be undermining the healthy balance between security and justice by promoting a comprehensive system of vigilance over every single passenger, every single citizen, thereby violating the principle of proportionality, which, in any democratic society, must always be complied with.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Bolkestein asks us what message we wish to send out to our partners. What we must send out is a clear message that we wish to cooperate on our common objectives whilst complying with our laws. Indeed, we received a most welcome contribution from the Article 29 Group, containing the nineteen essential items of information that strike me as sufficient to protect passenger security. We would also like assurances as regards the retention of this information, a right of appeal and the manner in which it is to be used.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, what kind of message did we send to the citizens, in March 2003, when Parliament deemed the transfer of passenger name records (PNR) unacceptable, in case guarantees were not provided for adequate levels of protection and of compliance with the Community rules in force? Or in October 2003, when we saw that the Commission’s own conclusions indicated that the protection offered was considered inadequate? Commissioner, you have heard speeches on the dilemma that you have posed Parliament in a vote on this proposal for a resolution. Let me ask you a different question, in order to get to the crux of the debate: what has changed since March or October 2003 to justify Parliament’s change of attitude? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Let us be honest: we had partially accepted, or at least we had become accustomed to the 11 September tragedy and therefore the issue concerning the data requested by the United States also fell within a normal dispute over legitimacy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we need to start with the assumption that, no matter what, citizens must be clearly informed in advance of the fact that they are going to face such requirements and, consequently, such control. Citizens also need to be just as clearly informed of the use and the destination of the information, particularly information that goes beyond mere personal details and can, for example, reveal membership of a religion, of a political movement or indicate tastes or habits of an extremely sensitive nature. On this subject, I would like to mention Directive 95/46/EC, which I quoted a short while ago pertaining to a request for clarification directed at Commissioner Bolkestein on the linguistic census in South Tyrol. I hope, Commissioner, to have an answer sooner or later, before the day is out.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a principle that is also valid in this case, that is to say where Article 6(1)(c) states that the personal data that are collected must be adequate, relevant and not excessive in relation to the purposes for which they are collected and/or further processed. Precisely: I believe that the phrase ‘not excessive in relation to the purposes’ gives the debate a much wider scope. The purposes are known: this is about combating terrorism; and – quite truthfully – doubts are being alleviated, at least as far as I am concerned, and I am also managing to overcome my doubts about the number of agencies that have access to the data, about the fact that an immediate access system is used, about the absence of appeal procedures and many other aspects. If I consider the fact that this is all for a purpose such as the one that we are aware of – combating terrorism – then I consider it a necessary sacrifice for a higher purpose. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The conclusions offer a clearer analysis of the issues surrounding the guarantees of legal certainty and the democratic control that is to safeguard the measures concerned. It is high time that the EU took seriously the balance between, on the one hand, combating terrorism and other crime and, on the other hand, preserving fundamental rights. The new terrorism tsar should work in tandem with a privacy tsar. If the political will existed, it should be possible right now – before the Constitution has entered into force – to guarantee democratic scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must not gamble away respect for privacy and private life. Europe is a forerunner in this area, and Article 29 of the committee’s objections gives rise to great concern. The objective is, of course, a global solution that has to provide people with the same high level of legal certainty. The fight against terrorism is much more difficult and needs to be tackled in a much greater variety of ways. This solution will not do away with all forms of terrorism, but it looks sometimes as though people believe it will.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I wish to point out the following. It is an extremely unsatisfactory situation we are in. Commissioner Bolkestein has just shown this through his speech. Even before Parliament adopts a position on the issue, the Council has gone and stated that it intends to accept the American demands, leading one to wonder why, in such a situation, Parliament has to have an opinion at all.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of how the voting goes on this issue, I would call upon the Commission tirelessly to go on striving for better protection of legal certainty, as well as for protection against terrorism in many forms other than just the present one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact is that I am a little thrown by Commissioner Bolkestein’s statement. He said: ‘we are still negotiating and we will then determine whether what we are doing is adequate’. However, in my view, there was an adequacy finding before us, which you described as being in order. You have to make up your mind: either it is in order or it is not.</p>
<p class="contents">To Mr Pirker, I should like to say that according to the Dutch Personal Data Board, there are 1 800 enforcement and law enforcement bodies in the United States that could retrieve this data.</p>
<p class="contents">There are still a huge number of uncertainties and if even the European Commission is uncertain, why should Parliament give its approval at this moment in time? I am quite convinced that, if this continues, we will have to ask the EC Court of Justice to advise us whether, in its opinion, this agreement is adequate and whether a light agreement can be concluded which intrudes into the data of EU citizens so drastically. This is the only road that is open to us, and we have to take it because this light agreement has been decided on. Commissioner, I would ask you again to withdraw this agreement and present a better one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Bolkestein,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – Mr President, I should like to thank Members of Parliament for their various comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I will reply briefly to some of the points, starting with the Mr Watson's remarks. He is no longer in the Chamber, but no doubt he will take cognisance of the report of proceedings for this sitting. Mr Watson said that the Article 29 Working Party has rejected the adequacy finding, which the Commission has proposed. That is perfectly true. In reply I would say that the Article 31 Committee has approved the Commission's findings by a qualified majority – in fact, 13 voted in favour and 2 against. The two Member States which voted against were Luxembourg and Italy.</p>
<p class="contents">My second remark addresses comments made by Mrs Boogerd-Quaak and Mrs Paciotti on requests for access to own data. The American commitments cover access in what the Commission calls a satisfactory way. We must verify that the commitments are complied with in practice and there are means to monitor this. Furthermore, the joint review and the possibility for European data protection Commissioners to intercede would see to that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Paciotti also mentioned international agreement in the longer term. The Commission is seeking a multilateral solution through the ICAO but that, as Mrs Paciotti will agree, will take time.</p>
<p class="contents">I return to Mrs Boogerd-Quaak's comment on an international agreement that would legalise the pull system. Mr Pirker also remarked on that. I should like to stress here that the Commission is committed to a switch from pull to push and, although that is principally a matter for airlines, it is preparing actions which will facilitate that switch and make it possible in the coming months. It is necessary to provide a legal basis for pull until the push system is in place. Nonetheless, this provision of the international agreement must not become an excuse for the introduction of push to be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cappato said that the Commission should drop its initiative for a European policy on PNR. The fight against terrorism is a global one. The European Union cannot afford not to develop its own policy in that area, which is considered to be an important contribution to the global fight against terrorism and organised crime. Last Thursday the European Council welcomed the Commission's intention to make a proposal by the middle of this year. It called on the Council to act on this before the end of the year. The Commission will, of course, take care that its proposal is fully respectful of civil liberties in general and data privacy rules in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cappato also criticised the non-application of the law. I take it that remark and criticism are addressed to the data protection authorities in the Member States. As Mr Cappato and other Members will realise, the data-protection directive is 'policed' by Member States and not by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Swiebel referred to Article 300 of the Treaty, concerning the international agreement. The Commission does not see the need to consult the European Court of Justice on the legality of the agreement or the adequacy finding.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Santini and others asked about passengers being informed – or not – about their rights. The obligation to inform passengers rests with the data controller – in this case, initially the airlines, subsequently the United States Government. The US undertakings contain a clear commitment in that regard. The Commission is working with the airlines and the travel industry to ensure that citizens have access to full and accurate information that they should receive at the appropriate time, ideally before they purchase their tickets.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and in general terms – I repeat what I said earlier, that the Commission does not espouse or approve of the US approach, but it shares some of the views about its effectiveness. However, we have to be realistic and we should take the improvements that are now on offer. Thus, it is not that we espouse the American approach, it is just that the Commission is at pains to stress that this is the best possible solution and that no other is on offer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
