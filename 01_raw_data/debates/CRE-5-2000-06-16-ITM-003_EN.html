<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sousa Pinto (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Regulation No 302/93, the amendment of which is the subject of this report, establishes and regulates the operations of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. Since 1993, this agency has made a significant contribution to increasing our understanding of the drugs phenomenon in all its various aspects, within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">With the enlargement of the Union approaching, the Commission has taken the view, and rightly so, that the Monitoring Centre has a role to play, together with the candidate countries within the framework of a pre-accession strategy. What needs to be done, therefore, is to prepare those countries to take part in the Monitoring Centre’s activities, specifically by creating the appropriate conditions for establishing structural relations with the REITOX network, which collates and undertakes a statistical analysis of the figures supplied by Member States in this field.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">In specific terms, we intend to entrust the Monitoring Centre with projects funded by the PHARE programme in the area of drug information systems. We must recognise the fact that the content of this report, which attempts to express the opinion of the European Parliament, exceeds the scope of the Commission’s proposals. It must be stated that, since 1993, when the Centre was opened, there has never been an opportunity to review the regulation governing it, through an assessment of how it uses the instruments at its disposal and of the task that has been entrusted to it. Nor has there been an opportunity to bring in any changes that might be required. In the meantime, new figures have come to light, as a result both of its operating experiences and from the so-called “independent assessment report”, published this March, and even as a result of developments in the Union itself, in its <span class="italic">acquis </span>and in the challenges it faces.</p>
<p class="contents">The report now before you is based on the principle that Parliament cannot ignore these facts on the one occasion it has been able to state its position. On the one hand, therefore, although the changes to the regulation proposed in this report go beyond the strict bounds of the changes that are essential for adapting the Monitoring Centre to the requirements of enlargement, on the other hand, these proposals have become absolutely crucial to the Monitoring Centre fulfilling its duties in a satisfactory way, even within the current Union framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Bearing this in mind, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs considers it to be essential that the Monitoring Centre should be given the task of assessing the action undertaken by Member States, as well as by the Union, in their approach to drugs and drug addiction. This does not mean giving a specialised agency the scope to make political assessments which are incompatible with its nature. What it does mean is ensuring that there are better and more appropriate instruments on which political decisions can be based. These political decisions would be taken elsewhere, and by the appropriate people. It also means giving the public thorough and objective information with a view to improving the general understanding of such a socially sensitive issue. In practice, the Monitoring Centre must not function simply as an address to which the Member States send the data describing the situations in their countries, not always in the best conditions or on time.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is the Member States’ responsibility to cooperate appropriately and promptly with the Monitoring Centre. The Monitoring Centre will have responsibility for collating the information and subjecting it to the appropriate statistical analysis, with the benefit that this data will be comparable. It will also be responsible, however, for analysing the data obtained based on the experience and the technical skills of its researchers. In this way, the experience of the various Member States in the fight against drugs can be of mutual benefit and political leaders will have a valuable instrument providing technical support for their decisions. To conclude, it is our view that we must start to take advantage of this European Agency. The complexity of the issues relating to drugs and drug addiction make an overhaul of the European Drug and Drug Addiction Centre more crucial than ever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following a request for participation by Norway, the Commission submitted to the European Parliament a draft agreement between the European Monitoring Centre and Norway authorising Norway to participate in the REITOX network and to be represented on the Management Board of the European Monitoring Centre as well as on its scientific committee. </p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs unanimously adopted 8 amendments which give a favourable opinion with reservations.<span class="bold"> </span>In particular,<span class="bold"> </span>our opinion was influenced by the EMCDDA evaluation report which the Committee had asked independent external consultants to prepare. </p>
<p class="contents">The evaluation reveals poor coordination and poor communication between the different departments within the EMCDDA. Decisions are far too centralised. The REITOX network is more a virtual network than an operational one. The National Focal Points are under-used and they could make a far greater contribution to the EMCDDA’s work. The role of the scientific committee is still poorly defined and its work is not a central part of the programme. The Management Board is ineffective in achieving its goals and its meetings are often held without a pre-established agenda and do not involve genuine discussion of strategies. There is no dissemination strategy for the results the Board produces and, therefore, only a small proportion of the information produced by the EMCDDA is published and disseminated. With regard to work scheduling, there is insufficient coordination of the management tasks of the director and the heads of department. The administrative procedures are burdensome and inappropriate for such a small organisation and this generates manifest problems in terms of administration, management, planning assessment, development, recruitment and training. The current accounting system will have to be revamped so that the real costs of activities can be traced. Too many staff and too great a proportion of funds are dedicated to the purely administrative function of the EMCDDA. </p>
<p class="contents">These are the conclusions of the evaluation carried out independently by an external consultancy firm commissioned by the European Commission. On the basis of this evaluation, we must now decide whether to allow Norway to participate in the work or not, taking into consideration the fact that the work is completely inconsistent with the mandate and far from exploits the Centre’s potential. Having said this, our committee unanimously considered that the draft agreement between Norway and the Centre, together with the proposal for a Council Regulation aimed at adapting the regulation governing the Centre with a view to the participation of candidate countries in its work, is therefore an opportunity to stress the need for a comprehensive overhaul of the regulation governing the Centre in order to ensure its effectiveness and reliability.</p>
<p class="contents">I urge the Commission to give us a tangible response regarding the amendments adopted by the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Coelho (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to congratulate both rapporteurs on their contributions, which represent another step forward in our fight against the scourge of drugs. We have no doubt whatsoever that drugs are an evil that must be fought, through eradicating the trade in them and through efficient work on prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="contents">As the recent report on the assessment of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction emphasised, that institution has made an enormous contribution to European drugs policy, as it has filled in the gaps in our information and knowledge about this issue. The same report concluded that the Monitoring Centre has undertaken an impressive number of projects since its inception, and these have provided added value for the European fight against drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The very existence of this agency has helped ensure that drug-related issues remain on the political agenda, and has given the European Union and its Member States greater visibility and credibility in the international debate on drugs. The work undertaken on synthetic drugs has stood out for its efficiency and timeliness. The consumption of drugs is no longer limited to the old products and we are concerned at the emergence of new markets for synthetic products, which are cheaper and more easily produced, thereby creating greater profits for those who make a living from trafficking, and more harmful consequences for those who take drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">The Monitoring Centre carries out its duties in the area of information, under the terms of its regulations. The information that it produces is designed to help the Community and the Member States to develop an overview of the drugs situation, so that, under the terms of their respective areas of competence, they can adopt measures or take action in this area. This demonstrates the essential role of the Monitoring Centre as a support mechanism for the decision-making process. </p>
<p class="contents">The same report, however, highlighted problems in the Centre’s operations and delays in creating some of the structures that are crucial to its activities. It is therefore understandable, for the sake of the efficiency of this instrument, that we should be advocating its overhaul and improvement instead of cooperating in the dismantling of activities which might violate its fundamental purpose. Whilst agreeing in essence with the two reports that we are discussing today and which we will be approving, the PPE will certainly register its disagreement with proposals, which, in our opinion, will not contribute to the objectives I have just referred to in the special vote. Enlargement of the European Union to cover new countries is essential to the Union. It will unite us with States with very diverse political cultures and, in many cases, with new and relatively untested constitutions and structures. The action undertaken by the Monitoring Centre will be crucial to these countries, particularly to those amongst them that are fighting to end the scourge of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Union’s pre-accession strategy provides for the option of candidate countries gaining Membership of certain agencies, such as the Monitoring Centre, even before they become full Members of the European Union. We welcome Norway’s membership of the Monitoring Centre, following its stated desire to do so, particularly given the very close cultural, commercial and social relations that have historically united the European Union and Norway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The committee took into particular consideration the 1999 report on the Centre’s work and the difficulties encountered, and the outcome of the interinstitutional conference on drugs which took place in Brussels late last February. These sources showed that some of the constraints on the activities hitherto carried out by the Centre, which also restrict Union activity in this field, are caused by the wide range of differing information gathered by the various national centres linked to the Centre, with the result that it is difficult to draw conclusions from this information which would be useful in terms of prevention or damage limitation measures and operations to fight illegal trafficking.</p>
<p class="contents">The various amendments, including those dealing with the Centre’s Management Board, are therefore intended to ensure that the Board uses genuinely effective data-gathering methods which are capable of interpreting the data in the light of unit criteria and provide useful indications regarding the efficiency of the various national anti-drugs policies. Indeed, it appeared to many members of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs that both the annual reports of the Centre and those tabled and adopted by Parliament fail to take into due account the analysis of the results obtained in the various countries, whose anti-drugs policies differ, moreover. The European Union needs to decide on its policies and recommendations to the governments of the Member States by means of a comprehensive assessment – which is not, as all too often happens, purely moralist – of the various strategies being followed in the various countries, especially with regard to prevention, damage limitation and consumer safety in the face of the constant emergence of new synthetic drugs. </p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the agreement on the participation of Norway in the work of the Centre, which, we hope, will pave the way for other enlargement initiatives, provides a major opportunity to revitalise the activity of this technical and scientific body, for the EMCDDA must become an increasingly important reference point in the development of a European policy to fight the illegal sale and distribution of drugs which are harmful to the health of the citizens of our countries.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must make the fight against drugs an absolute priority. Last week, I was confronted on my home territory with the fact that a study conducted at the weekend revealed that one in three young people use drugs. This is staggering news.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, policy-makers at every level should be far more attentive to the situation. The role of the European Union is first and foremost to bring about harmonisation. We need to develop new initiatives to this end without delay, the hallmark of which must be decisiveness and vigour. We must not be content with paper exercises. What I find difficult about this report is that the Commission is required to submit a report on the setting up of the Monitoring Centre, as well as on any adjustment or extension of the tasks only every three years. This is far too long a period to my mind. We must be able to make adjustments on a continuous basis. If you want to achieve something your goals need to be more short-term.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The drugs policy will only be effective if the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction is accorded a fundamental role. It is certainly not enough for the Monitoring Centre to act purely as a database, and I am only too pleased to support the rapporteur when he says that under no circumstances must the Community decision-makers be allowed to limit the mission of the Monitoring Centre to such an extent that it becomes a data bank with no critical dimension whatsoever. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like the increasing number of centres that are being set up in order to conceal our differences, this one, in its five years of existence, has done nothing to justify the millions of euros that are pumped into it each year. If you compare the amount of money which it is allocated with that available to national bodies, one would expect to see in-depth studies leading, as stipulated in the definition of its aims in Article 2, to the provision of objective, reliable and comparable information concerning drugs and drug addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">This Centre ought to be in a position to establish definitions and uniform indicators with a view to carrying out an evaluation of the various anti-drugs policies implemented in the Member States, from both a health and socio-economic as well as a law-and-order perspective. When will we get to know, for example, what the consequences have been of the prohibitionist policy adopted in France or of the regulatory one adopted in the Netherlands?</p>
<p class="contents">The independent assessment of the activities of the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the conclusions of which were published in March 2000, is very specific regarding the serious mismanagement of the board of directors and of the REITOX network, which gathers information on drugs and drug addiction.</p>
<p class="contents">The reports that we are looking at today are about expanding the Centre to Norway and to the 13 candidate countries. On this issue we must agree, but would it not be better to reform this body beforehand, so that it might finally serve a useful purpose? New members should certainly be welcomed, but with what in mind? Is the idea to reproduce the failure we have witnessed over the past few years, but on an even larger scale? To add to the length of the beautifully presented annual reports which achieve precisely nothing? It is high time that the European Union became aware that, a long way from the Centre’s magnificent premises in Lisbon, thousands of people are directly faced with the health and social difficulties engendered by drug dependence. We are not asking it to deal with such problems, we are simply asking that it should analyse them.</p>
<p class="contents">Hundreds of varying initiatives are being implemented in Europe by both institutions and associations, which focus either on criminalisation or risk reduction. What is the Centre waiting for to evaluate these strategies? How is it that Member States are being so reluctant to cooperate in evaluation? Is it possible that there is a fear that the results may not be that great politically?</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore join the rapporteur in arguing in favour of the idea of a real reform of the Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in respect both of the way it functions and of expanding its activities. This, moreover, is a necessary precondition to taking on new members.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They are also seeking to relaunch the Centre’s work, change the guidelines for action of the Management Board and – it must be pointed out – ensure that Member States cooperate with the Centre as required.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all responsible for achieving this; the Monitoring Centre, our national public institutions and the Member States themselves. The only way to improve the Centre’s work is by ensuring that the information provided by Member States and the regulations governing the Centre are ever more thorough and reliable. Failure to do so would make it impossible to put an end to an evil that particularly affects the youth of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that if we fail to take this opportunity to amend the regulation with a view to relaunching the Centre’s work, we run the risk of creating further problems when it comes to incorporating the applicant countries in this work. In the short term, I think that this is one of the key issues to be tackled, which is why we fully agree with the rapporteur and why I believe the report will be adopted unanimously. Each institution must fulfil their respective obligations and urge Member States to gather reliable information by working clearly and effectively together. What is more, they need to draw up specific action plans to tackle a problem that particularly affects the youth in our countries and implement them more rigorously and with greater enthusiasm.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is therefore our chance – for the contents of these proposals are not in themselves revolutionary for the Centre – to discuss the role and usefulness of the Centre in terms of its function, which should also be our function, of providing political indications and assessments and adopting decisions and initiatives on drugs, although the European Union’s powers in this area are severely limited.</p>
<p class="contents">I would argue that this type of discussion can only be based on an evaluation carried out by an independent body. A number of speakers, including, in particular, the rapporteur, Mr Turco, have stressed that from very many perspectives, such as strategy, functionality and the poor capacity to integrate scientific work, this Centre’s contribution to political decision-making is totally inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">However, at this point I feel that it is necessary for the Commission to assume the responsibility of presenting a proposal for reform to Parliament as soon as possible, for we cannot record each year, if not the uselessness, the lack of usefulness of the Centre in terms of political decisions, and then each year, year after year, leave aside the debate and postpone it until the next year. The Commission must present a proposal for reforming the procedures which are described as bureaucratic and tedious and, above all, failing to focus on the scientific function of the Centre. </p>
<p class="contents">Another important point: each year, the Centre and the Commission tell us that there is a data harmonisation problem because the data-gathering criteria differ from country to country. This is a political issue. At this point, the Commission must table a proposal on how the data can be harmonised, or the whole exercise will be completely pointless. The Centre does not in itself have this authority, but it must provide the Commission with recommendations for data harmonisation and table a proposal – maybe a proposal for a directive – on the subject, because this is a political issue.</p>
<p class="contents">At the beginning of the 1990s, there was a great scandal in Italy because a leak from the Ministry of the Interior and the Ministry of Health revealed that they were hiding the real overdose mortality rate. Obviously, it is more convenient for politicians and governments to say that a young man has died in the street from a heart attack than to acknowledge that his death was caused by an overdose, and the same applies to policy-making. An official DG XIV document on alcohol consumption states that the Swedish authorities talk of there being 2000 deaths per year due to alcohol abuse in Sweden, while the real figure is between 6 000 and 7 000 deaths a year, but these figures serve to cover up the failure of their anti-drugs policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The data problem is therefore a political issue which must be resolved politically, by means of Commission proposals which Parliament may accept or reject.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, the Sousa Pinto report contains proposed amendments relating to the functioning of the Management Board and the REITOX system. This is as a result of the recent evaluation report by the EMCDDA. Although these amendments fall completely outside the scope of the subject and the question arises as to whether such practices benefit relations with the Commission and the Council, I have a certain amount of sympathy for the stance taken by the rapporteur in this case. We must take advantage of an opportunity like this. Unfortunately, his amendments overshoot the mark by a long way in some respects.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">I am unhappy about adding Turkey to the list of candidate countries that are eligible for support from the EMCDDA. In view of the fact that Turkey has just been given candidate status, you could claim it is reasonable to offer the country this opportunity. But precisely because of the specific, politically-tinged drugs problems Turkey is facing, and the fact that it has only very recently been given candidate status, the EMCDDA will have its work cut out.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, I am against making the EMCDDA categorically responsible for the evaluation of data. According to the report, it would then become a data bank without a critical dimension. But the evaluation of data often turns into political opinion, which is exactly what we do not want the EMCDDA’s task or aim to be. On the contrary, it is for the competent political bodies to adopt a position and to frame policy on the basis of objective data provided by the Monitoring Centre.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, in view of the problems that came to the fore in the evaluation report by the EMCDDA and the extension of tasks that is to take place through this regulation, we ought to be extremely pleased if we succeed in setting up a smooth-running data bank from the very outset. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I also have memories of other Community institutions. We have happily set up over the years several semi-European institutions in different Member States. Some of them have matured and grown and become quite effective. But if they do not do that they become flaccid, rot and become totally useless – just another expensive quango, not actually achieving any great results.</p>
<p class="contents">It is appropriate that at the moment we are assessing the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction. We all too often have a tendency in Parliament, I am afraid, when we cannot to do anything more concrete, to set up another institution. That makes us feel good but does not actually change anything. So it is appropriate that we look at the work of this observatory in Lisbon at this stage. We should not kill it off until we are sure it is not being effective. But we have to accept that none of our countries are going to come up with a harmonised approach to dealing with the tragedy of increasing drug addiction and the murders, deaths and all that surrounds this dreadful trade.</p>
<p class="contents">I take this opportunity to say to my dear colleagues from all parties in the Netherlands: your policies have tended to become like a honeypot for the criminal element in many of the accession countries. In the last month alone five young Irish drug dealers – and I admit they should not have been doing it – moved to the Netherlands because it was more comfortable for them to be there. They have all been quite horribly murdered by people coming from some of the accession states to the Community. So it is important that we include them in the work of this observatory. It is very important that we take a very serious look at the policies within Turkey, an accession state, in relation to the provision of drugs and to the criminal activities surrounding it. The observatory in Lisbon cannot work effectively without very close relationships with the Europol agency in The Hague.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank both the rapporteurs. They have done a good, serious job. They have asked very serious questions. The point was made that three years is far too long between assessments. I would like us to have another debate like this next year to really assess how effective the observatory is and how effectively it is using its very considerable budget in this work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I wish to thank Mr Turco and my colleague Mr Sousa Pinto for their important reports which show the essential work the agencies are doing through their investigations into how drugs actually function, their effect, the impact on society and which describe what help and improvements can be made. This is especially important and significant when we look at the whole question of enlargement.</p>
<p class="contents">A previous speaker spoke very eloquently about the evil of drugs, and Mr Beysen referred to the tobacco vote a couple of days ago. There is an element of hypocrisy here, because half the House voted against having stronger measures on tobacco advertising and – I choose my words carefully – there are many Members in this House who are regular users, to different degrees, of alcohol, which is a very powerful drug. I am not teetotal, nor do I wish to be sanctimonious about this, but we have to be realistic about the situation that exists in Europe today. That must be our starting-point.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have to be realistic about what we want from the Centre. I take issue with Mrs Boumediene-Thiery and Mr Cappato on some of their remarks about the Centre as it functions at the moment. For the work of the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon to be effective, Member States have to cooperate fully. As Mrs Banotti has just said, the agencies have to be involved. The Lisbon Centre has to have reliable, accurate information and be able to monitor and involve all the different agencies in as many countries as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland said that we should not include Turkey. If you look at the whole question of drugs and the issues of enlargement of the European Union, Turkey is an intrinsic part of the supply routes for drugs coming into Europe. I know the Turkish authorities are looking at ways of improving the situation and so are the applicant countries and those which would like to be applicant countries. They want to address this problem. In many cases they do not have the civic structures and other organisations in place to properly enforce some of the regulations we would like and some of the monitoring that would take place.</p>
<p class="contents">So we cannot exclude one country because we do not like it very much: we have to open our doors to as many countries as we can and encourage the work that is being done. Of course, there is not enough being done. There needs to be more progress. But if we just sit back and say that everything is fine or just say "no" to drugs and that people should not use them, we are not accepting the situation as it is; we are not giving the tools to those people who want to improve the position.</p>
<p class="contents">I look forward to another debate, as Mrs Banotti has said – perhaps in a year's time – when we can actually start to pinpoint some of the progress that is being made.</p>

As a result, the consensus enjoyed hitherto will be abandoned. The purely information-gathering centre is to be converted into a drugs-combating centre. It cannot be right to bring in the Swedish method through the back door, because this implies working towards the goal of a drug-free society across Europe. But there never will be a drug-free society. Or are cigarettes and alcohol going to be banned too?</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this restrictive policy being pursued with greater vigour, the number of drug-related deaths has not fallen. Last year in Germany alone, there were over 1 800. A drugs policy of abstinence has led neither to fewer addicts nor to less crime; neither has it led to less drug-related prostitution nor reduced so-called organised crime. European drugs policy therefore needs a new guiding principle. This principle is called damage limitation. Damage limitation is pragmatic and based on reality, whereas abstinence is a moral programme which does not work.</p>
<p class="contents">Instead of solutions being sought, however, the mandate of the originally neutral information-gathering centre is now to be extended to cover criminal prosecution. At the same time, in the Commission it is intended that, from now on, the issue of prevention should only play a minor role as a small part of health policy. In addition, the Commission is making life difficult for NGOs working on drugs. For example, their prevention projects are being hindered by the Commission’s disbursing the approved funds several months late.</p>
<p class="contents">Is it the aim of European drugs policy to place more emphasis on criminal prosecution and to cut back on prevention? As far as I am concerned, this is the wrong way forward. That is why I shall be voting against this amendment to integrate criminal prosecution into an extended remit of the Drugs Monitoring Centre. All those colleagues who are interested in having a drugs policy based on people’s needs will, I hope, do likewise.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consequently, any attempt to study this phenomenon must not be contained within the geographical borders of the Member States or even the candidate countries, but must be based on information from as many countries as possible, if it is to help prevent and combat the problem more efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to study in depth why and how more and more young people are turning to escapism and drugs at ever younger ages. Collating, substantiating and evaluating information from a number of countries will only help us carry out an integrated study and find basic answers if we collate and exchange data from as wide an area as possible on a comparable basis.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, in Greece, most of the information obtained so far has been from treatment centres, leaving sources of information from other agencies which might contribute towards a more integrated evaluation of the dimensions of the problem unexplored. The treatment centres house young people who are able to access them because they are helped either by their family or by the wider social environment. But what happens to the large section of the population which has no such access, such as economic migrants? According to information from the Greek Addiction Treatment Centre, 97% of the people using these centres are Greek citizens. However, according to prison statistics, the majority of drug users in prison are economic migrants who, either because they do not speak the language or because of a lack of information and social exclusion, have never set foot in such a centre. Consequently, according to the data collated and evaluated by the Treatment Centre, this category of users is almost non-existent.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, every user should have the opportunity to go to a detoxification centre without being obliged to give his or her full personal details. We all know that using drugs leads to crime, not only because drugs <span class="italic">per se</span> are illegal, but because the high cost of drugs set by the huge financial rings which supply them, inevitably forces all users into crime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, this is a positive evaluation which is consistent with the Commission’s proposal. There are no borders when it comes to subjects such as our present concern of drug addiction and the trafficking of narcotics, and so it is certainly a useful, sustainable initiative to set objectives which include countries which are not currently Members of the European Union but which are in the pre-accession phase, countries taking part in the PHARE programme or Norway, in their prevention or suppression strategies, for this will help us to broaden the scope of our anti-drugs strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, however, both the rapporteur and the Members have stressed that this occasion calls for reflection upon the way in which the Centre operates and upon the results it has produced in recent years, and I feel that we cannot say we are satisfied with its performance up until now. And quite apart from our own reservations, there is also an independent report, which has just been referred to, which outlines all the limits and shortcomings of this action. </p>
<p class="contents">My fellow Member said that these changes will transform the Centre from a statistics office into a drugs monitoring centre. I wish it could be so but I cannot share her optimism. On the contrary, I fear that many proposals and concerns, including those voiced by other Members, will only serve the purpose of rationalising data and making it compatible. I was even somewhat surprised to hear Mrs Ghilardotti mention consumer safety. I would not like the Monitoring Centre for Drug Addiction to be likened to the Monitoring Centre for Food Quality and Safety! Let us be careful, for this is an extremely serious phenomenon which is damaging the whole of our society and destroying entire generations. We must fight against it.</p>
<p class="contents">So, the efforts to make data from the different countries compatible and the call for efficient dissemination of the data are all very well, but if we think we can achieve these objectives, even our information objective, without taking into consideration the contributions made by the individuals concerned, Non-Governmental Organisations, voluntary associations and rehabilitation communities in the different countries, then we are living in a fantasy world. We must involve them, and then the Centre will be able to perform a genuinely effective and productive part – and we must monitor this – in the fight against drugs.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, established 7 years ago, is an important tool for collating comparable data from the Member States. It is used to monitor this serious phenomenon and determine the approach to be taken in a multidimensional policy at national and European level.</p>
<p class="contents">At least two main criteria must be met if we are to achieve this objective: first, we need reliable assessments of the measures taken and, if they are efficient, we need to implement them, not only in the Member States, but also in the candidate countries, the rest of central and eastern Europe and in any third country with the right legal framework under relevant agreements. Permit me to say that the fight against drugs is a prime example, perhaps the only example of an issue which calls for globalized measures and decisions and where globalized measures and decisions will only have positive repercussions.</p>
<p class="contents">The second main criterion which I should like to mention is the need to provide the Monitoring Centre in Lisbon with the necessary economic and administrative resources in order to facilitate its difficult and ambitious objectives. It is clear from how it has operated to date, as documented in the recent experts' report, that we do not need simply to supplement Regulation 302/93, as suggested by the Commission. We need to amend it as described in the amendments tabled by the European Parliament. These amendments refer mainly to the modus operandi of the board of directors, the provision of technical assistance by the Centre to the aforementioned countries and the Centre's help with evaluation procedures at national, European and international level. I am certain that this will guarantee better operating conditions for the European Monitoring Centre and increase the potential for taking integrated and efficient decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to thank the two rapporteurs for their thorough work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is why we agree with those who assert that the European Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction has not performed satisfactorily and therefore why we, like others, are critical of it.</p>
<p class="contents">We endorse the amendments and reforms aimed at enhancing the objectivity, reliability and comparability of the information provided, given that quality information is essential if related policies are to be improved upon.</p>
<p class="contents">As a group, we should like to see the proposal taken a stage further in order to encompass damage-reduction programmes. Lastly, I should like to stress that, as this issue clearly has pan-European public health and socio-economic implications, it requires a strategy at European level. Whether we like it or not, Europe is not confined to the European Union, which is why we must support moves to broaden the scope of this proposal to incorporate countries that do not form part of the European Union and those who at present have the status of candidate countries.</p>

In the North, it is generally believed that any free trade in milder drugs lowers the threshold that makes it possible to move on to using hard drugs. It is important that the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, in the context of the positive climate that exists in Parliament with regard to drugs, also acquires sufficient resources for its anti-drugs activities outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that this is not the case, however. The Centre is being given new tasks without the corresponding resources to carry them out, and the amendments, by the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance in particular, tend in that direction. Resources must be increased via the PHARE and TACIS programmes. The most important drug routes to the European Union area will, in the future, be Afghanistan, Russia, Chechnya and Turkey as well as Kosovo and the other former Yugoslavian regions. All the PHARE countries have to be made to go the way of Norway. And they must be given the technical assistance to do so. Estonia is one of the biggest drugs routes from Russia to Finland, and from Finland to the common markets of the EU. All countries that receive financial aid must be made to go the way of Norway. There are, at present, no conditions set for EU aid. By way of example, Montenegro receives financial and political aid from the EU to pay its police force, but not for the fight against smuggling and drugs, but for its struggle against Milosevic. No such conditions are imposed on the aid by the World Bank or the IMF. The EU should, however, impose conditions for the aid it gives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Monitoring Centre must start functioning better, but it must also be managed effectively. If we are to be well-equipped in the fight against the drugs problem, then it is absolutely essential to extend competences and step up cooperation with candidate countries. The rapporteur has done some sterling work, for which I thank him. I support the amendments. There are two comments I would like to make.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">My first point concerns the gathering of data, which is still a weak aspect. How can we monitor the accuracy of the data? What guarantee is there that the Member States will give their full cooperation? It transpired recently in my own country, for example, that the judicial authorities had estimated there to be 50% fewer so-called coffee shops than is actually the case. How, I find myself wondering, can you take a pro-active stance against drugs on the basis of this kind of information? Would cooperation with Europol – something Mrs Banotti has already touched on – offer a solution here?</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">A second point, Mr President, which I would like to draw your attention to, is that of synthetic drugs. Apparently harmless, but all the more dangerous for that reason, than any other drugs. My country, the Netherlands, has the dubious honour of being the largest manufacturer and exporter of these drugs. I am aware that an ever-increasing number of these designer drugs are now emanating from Eastern Europe and Turkey as well. Therefore I am calling for us to step up cooperation with Eastern Europe, with the candidate countries, in this respect too, and to make the fight against these drugs the new spearhead of the European anti-drugs policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That applies both to citizens down on the floor of the House and to those up in the gallery. Drugs breed crime and social destitution and tear many people’s lives apart. It is therefore a positive sign that we can now see both the candidate countries and Norway involved in the cooperation we already have. </p>
<p class="contents">In order to be able to carry out a credible assessment and produce reliable statistics, we must however have a strategy concerning what information the Member States are to send in to the Centre. Otherwise, the statistical basis will be fairly meagre and not serve any larger purpose. However, it is not only the Centre’s responsibility, but also that of the respective Member States to ensure that the information sent in is also relevant and can be used for some purpose. Responsibility for taking measures to combat drug abuse now lies, in the first place, with the Member States. This ought not, however, to stop us trying to devise common assignments and strategies for preventive work, which is perhaps the most important foundation stone in the fight against drugs. </p>
<p class="contents">It ought, moreover, to be possible for the Union and the Centre to have a role in supervising the domestic production of drugs, as one of the previous speakers mentioned, for we cannot get away from the fact that many of the drugs that are in circulation today, and which young people encounter on the streets, are synthetic drugs, produced in the Union and nowhere else. In view of the open borders we now have, it is a problem if more drugs than we would wish are being produced in a particular place. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say that the definition of a drugs-free society is a good one. It is a goal or vision, just like every other vision the Union has when it comes to social destitution and other phenomena we wish to combat. It is an aggressive approach I should like to see maintained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fight against drug abuse and the drug trade is important. This report has been produced to complement the current regulation concerning the Monitoring Centre. Moreover, it is intended that the candidate countries should be involved in the work. Let me comment on that first of all. It is, in fact, important that the candidate countries be involved. I myself come from Sweden. In recent years, we have developed cooperation with the Baltic countries and with Poland in order to end the drugs trade and prevent drug abuse. The drug trade is not confined by national borders. We must therefore have cross-border cooperation to prevent the trade from developing. </p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to cooperation with Norway. Norway participates in the internal market and is to become a member of Schengen. Norway has much the same problems as Sweden when it comes to drugs crossing the border. It is therefore important that we cooperate and gather information from these neighbouring countries, as well as study how they conduct their policies. </p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur also deals with how the Centre operates at present. I think he draws an important distinction, for the Centre should not be dabbling in politics. Instead, it is we who should be engaged in politics here in political assemblies, as well as in the Member States – in fact, mainly in the Member States, when it comes to drugs policy. However, the Centre should create a basis for political decisions. In this regard, there are at present deficiencies when it comes to collecting statistics. We must obtain relevant and reliable information which can be compared. What is more, the Centre can carry out analyses and assess the objectives which we in the political assemblies establish, so that we might revise policy accordingly. The Centre must become significantly better in this area than it is at present. Analyses must be carried out of the policies which are applied – different types of policy are pursued in, for example, the Netherlands and Sweden. I think it is important for us to analyse what these differences, in the guise of policy, in fact look like when it comes to problems such as drug abuse by young people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that notwithstanding the fact that some of your amendments go further than our proposals, particularly when it comes to the improvements proposed for the functioning of the Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The Commission agrees with Parliament that the functioning of the EMCDDA must be improved. I would remind you that it was the Commission that initiated the external evaluation of the EMCDDA. Naturally, we will take account of the recommendations made by this House and the decisions taken by the Management Board of the Monitoring Centre, which are based on the findings of this evaluation report. </p>
<p class="contents">However, our two proposals are much more comprehensive. The first proposal is intended to bring about an agreement with Norway. There is unanimous political agreement on this and I am pleased that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs is supporting this agreement too. This agreement is of major political significance for the Norwegians. After all, it demonstrates that they are keen to gain a better insight into the drugs phenomenon on the European continent. The agreement is also of significance to the European Union, because, as everyone knows, the drugs problem knows no borders.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Norway has received a copy of the evaluation report about the EMCDDA and has confirmed via the positive opinion issued by the Norwegian parliament that it is pleased to conclude this agreement. The Commission takes the view that we should not upset our Norwegian partners by linking the signing of this agreement with conditions concerning improvements to the functioning of the Monitoring Centre, thereby delaying the conclusion of the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, although the Commission has nothing against the content of the amendments in Mr Turco’s report, it will not be tabling an amended proposal on improvements to the functioning of the EMCDDA.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is the aim of our second proposal to facilitate involvement of the candidate countries in the EMCDDA and to help these countries set up national centres and establish links with the REITOX network. Five out of the 22 amendments in the Sousa Pinto report relate directly to this issue.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It has not escaped our attention that Parliament expressly wishes to cite Malta, Cyprus and Turkey as the designated recipients of this technical assistance. It is our intention – and as I understand it, also that of the Council – to deliver this assistance to all candidate countries, therefore including Malta, Cyprus and Turkey. Accordingly, we intend to adopt the clarification you have introduced by mentioning Malta, Cyprus and Turkey separately, and we will defend it in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">However, the Commission is unable to accept the extension of this provision to include third countries that do not have candidate status. This is because we are not aiming to make the EMCDDA an international centre for technical assistance, rather we want to equip it to transmit the information available to the candidate countries, in light of their future accession.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Like Parliament, we think it is essential to assess the drugs policy of the Member States. In fact this idea features in the drugs action plan 2000-2004, which is due to be discussed at the European Council in Feira. However, we do not think it is for the EMCDDA to assess the drugs policy of the Member States. After all, it is a political matter that should be passed on to the EU institutions to deal with, and not the EMCDDA, which is more of a technical bureau. What the EMCDDA <span class="italic">is </span>expected to do is to develop methodological instruments for assessing national policy. Activities of this kind can be undertaken with immediate effect, and are in fact included in the work programme for the year 2000, for example. The EMCDDA budget has been increased by EUR 500 000 to this end.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It does not seem to us to be the right moment to table a proposal for amending the EMCDDA regulation with a view to expressly including the development of a methodological evaluation instrument, and thereby making this kind of activity more transparent. There are two reasons for this. </p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, following on from the evaluation report, the Board of Directors of the EMCDDA is currently discussing the role and the tasks of the Monitoring Centre, and the Commission feels that we would be well-advised to await their conclusions before drawing up new proposals in this area.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a risk that if we expand our proposal in this way, we will have a long discussion with the Council ahead of us and will be unable to reach a decision before the end of this year. If that happens, we would have to abandon a PHARE project costing EUR two million, intended to help the candidate countries in Eastern Europe to set up or reinforce national centres with the aid of technical assistance from the EMCDDA. It would not be possible to carry these funds over after 31 December 2000.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">The other amendments not directly related to our proposal are mainly based on the evaluation report on the EMCDDA and they are said to lead to a detailed review of the basic regulation. In fact, the point of these amendments is to make it compulsory for Member States to supply the data requested by the Monitoring Centre, whilst hitherto there has been cooperation on a voluntary basis. The distribution of responsibilities between the director and the Board of Directors would change too, as would the way in which discharge of budget is granted. The latter point is a horizontal matter that must be applied equally across the board, and the Commission has submitted a proposal to the Council on this very subject. </p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, these amendments introduce the idea of compiling a report on the functioning of the EMCDDA every three years. The amendments tabled by Mrs Ilka Schröder all relate to the same subject in that they all seek to make the evaluation of risk reduction policy one of the tasks of the Monitoring Centre. What we are talking about here is terms that are open to different interpretations and which therefore have no place in the European Union’s strategy on drugs for 2000-2004. What is more, this topic should not be dealt with separately but as part of a well-balanced whole which also includes such issues as prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and accompanying social measures.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">As I said earlier, Mr President, the Commission agrees with Parliament that the functioning of the EMCDDA must be improved. Let there be no mistake about that. But mainly because now is not the right time, we will not, as I said, table an amended proposal. The Board of Directors of the EMCDDA – on which the European Parliament is also represented – will take a number of decisions at the meeting in September on the basis of the evaluation report, and we think it would be better to await the outcome of this before proposing new amendments to the EMCDDA regulation, such as those concerning the evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">When the Commission attends this meeting of the Board of Directors of the EMCDDA, it will defend the position that the functioning of the EMCDDA must be reviewed, and that the objectives and tasks must be clarified. Depending on the measures taken by the Management Board, the Commission will be able, if necessary, to table a proposal for the amendment of the EMCDDA regulation, which would also satisfy Parliament’s desire for periodic evaluation of the functioning of the EMCDDA. If it comes to that, then we will take due account of Parliament’s opinion when drafting the proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that Parliament would have seriously failed in its most basic political responsibilities if it had not undertaken a thorough review of the Monitoring Centre’s duties and tabled a set of proposals that represents a thorough overhaul of its operations. We believe that the Drugs Monitoring Centre is crucial, much needed and has a useful role to play in the future of the European Union, but not by means of this report, with which, in essence, the Commission apparently agrees. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
