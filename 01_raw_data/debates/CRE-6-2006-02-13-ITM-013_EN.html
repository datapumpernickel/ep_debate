<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Edit Herczog (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur. </span><span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(HU) </span>Globalisation has been present throughout the history of Europe. Let us think of the expansion of Christianity, the discovery of the world, the scientific and industrial revolution. Europe has always found a progressive answer to any challenges presented by globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, however, we have always seen that individuals face further and yet further changes with fear and reservation. This was true in every case, even when the change ultimately benefited Europe and the population of Europe. The same is true today. The sudden democratisation of various geographical areas at the beginning of the 21st century and the information and technology revolution have made us realise that the transformation of the world is irreversible, and global competition will remain with us in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The question we are now facing is how Europe should react to the situation to ensure that its citizens come out winners in the 21st century. I am especially delighted that the members of the IMCO Committee think along the same lines. The debate was constructive and thought provoking, and it made it clear that we cannot isolate ourselves. Not only would it be physically impossible to attempt it in today’s world of the Internet and of circumstances changing by the minute, but this would also mean giving up the competition, and would result in falling irrecoverably behind. With reference to the draft resolution tabled before you, I would like to say that as the report was prepared at my own initiative, it is very important to make use of the means available to us, but we cannot exceed the issue of globalisation and internal market, specified in the title. The European political, economic and civil parties must realise that we can only sustain the outstanding social achievements of our continent with economic growth and increasing employment rates. To this end, we must ensure that Europe is the best possible choice for large multinational companies in the global competition. We must ensure that Europe is a certain starting point and a stable background for large European companies, and provides an opportunity for growth and prosperity for small and medium enterprises. There is no doubt that this endeavour places a large responsibility on European legislation, including us, here in the European Parliament. It is obvious that in some over-regulated sectors we need fewer, better and more efficient regulations, but the opposite is true of other areas, where we must be able to rectify any critical deficiencies and create certain legal frameworks. I am specifically thinking of creating and preserving knowledge, and transforming it into an economic advantage.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a multilayered, horizontal endeavour, which equally involves the support and encouragement of research and innovation, the modernisation of education and the protection of intellectual property. If this is not done, there is no point in referring to a knowledge-based society and economy in the Lisbon Strategy, the Wim Kok report or in any European Parliament decision. And last but not least, allow me to point out that Europe can only be strong and competitive against global challenges if we do not weaken our own unity from within. We need a dynamic internal market and a single European area where citizens cannot only travel freely, but also work freely and utilise their knowledge throughout Europe and for the benefit of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is what I have tried to contribute to with my report. I would like to express my gratitude for the work of those who have helped. I would like to thank the Commission for the assistance provided, and, let me emphasise again my appreciation of all those who supported this work by proposing amendments and making suggestions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Charlie McCreevy, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, the European Commission welcomes the own-initiative report of the European Parliament on the effects of globalisation on the internal market and thanks everyone involved, in particular the rapporteurs Mrs Herczog and Mr Markov, as well as the members of the IMCO and INTA Committees, for the good work undertaken in putting this report together. I know that it was not an easy task as the issue of globalisation is an extremely complex one.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also very useful to organise a hearing on the matter. I appreciated the opportunity to speak about the way I see the challenges, and to hear directly what Members of Parliament and stakeholders had to say. The result is a very balanced and comprehensive report, one which addresses the key challenges in a succinct way. The report is a timely contribution to an important debate. Europe needs to find appropriate responses to today’s key challenges: the steadily increasing forces of global competition, the impact of new technologies and our ageing population.</p>
<p class="contents">As international integration accelerates, the concept of open markets and a globalising economy have come under attack. Of course, there are legitimate concerns about globalisation. There have to be proper structures, which can help developing and emerging economies in particular. There is also a clear need for appropriate forms of governance. However, there are those who abuse these arguments to try to undermine the whole concept of economic freedom. I am not denying that many industries go through difficult and sometimes painful transitions. But it does no good to try to shift the balance elsewhere – foreign takeovers, cheap imports, and migrant workers.</p>
<p class="contents">Protectionism is not the answer. It never was historically – it only ever led to great tensions between nations – and it is not now. Comparing the degree of openness of economic systems with economic growth and development will show that openness pays. It always has done and it always will. For people first. With jobs. With thriving businesses. By releasing human energies, not capping or constraining them.</p>
<p class="contents">I am very glad that in its report the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, as well as the Committee on International Trade, which has given an opinion, takes a constructive and balanced approach towards globalisation. As the report says, we can make globalisation a success if we provide the right conditions, and if we focus on our strengths. And we do not need to be modest about this. Europe has a lot to offer.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make sure that Europe and the internal market remain an attractive place for consumers and businesses; an attractive place to invest, particularly for research and innovation activities in high-value products and services, where our businesses excel. This requires a strong, knowledge-based and properly regulated internal market, using the experience we have gained and the lessons we have learned. This is Europe’s best response to its domestic problems of low economic growth and high unemployment, but also to the challenge of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Priorities in this context are: an effective implementation of the new Lisbon Strategy for growth and jobs; the completion of the internal market, including for services, telecoms, energy, and financial services; ensuring simple and effective regulation, which frees businesses and citizens from unnecessary costs and red tape; and making better use of the existing internal market framework, which includes better administrative cooperation across borders. Most of the relevant work is already under way, and it is important that all players, at the EU level and at Member State level, do everything to make it happen.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report quite rightly stresses, globalisation also has a strong external dimension for internal market policy-making. We need to be much more outward-looking than in the past and to be aware of the external aspects of our internal economic policies, such as our internal market rules. Nothing is simply domestic any more. We need more international regulatory convergence and equivalence of rules. This is particularly important in the area of financial markets, which are leading the way in globalisation. Furthermore, Europe must use its scale to help deliver ambitious and balanced solutions to problems of market access or regulatory issues. A successful conclusion of the Doha Round, including on services, is a key element in this respect. Everyone will benefit!</p>
<p class="contents">Last but not least, we need a new partnership of the EU and Member States. Neither can deliver on their own to ensure that Europe remains the attractive place that it still is. I am confident that the report of the European Parliament will contribute significantly to this important wider discussion on Europe in the globalised world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What, then, did we see as the main points of concern? As a means of compensating for globalisation’s potentially adverse effects within the European Union, the Commission had proposed the creation of a special fund, and we had agreed that this was the right thing to do, going on to say that such a fund would have to be properly endowed.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we had noted that the European Union, despite adverse conditions worldwide, is one of the world’s biggest producers and investors, and that it does indeed, of course, have opportunities to carry on exercising a great deal of economic clout in globalised markets, but we did also point out that – particularly when doing business with third countries – we need to consider whether those countries comply with international standards in labour law, social security law and the environment, and we proposed that preferential trade arrangements should be extended or adapted in such a way that certain preferences would be accorded to those third countries that do so – that is, to those that have ratified the international agreements on the protection of workers and of the environment and have duly implemented them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner has just referred to the Doha Round, and he was right to do so, although assessments of it differ widely. In the opinion that our committee has produced, we said that we call on the Commission to carry out an assessment of the impact of further multilateral agreements on agriculture and services within the European Union, before we continue with these negotiations. There is an interaction here; just as we in the European Union have certain problems that I could enumerate if I had sufficient time, so, likewise, the third countries have their own, and I do believe that the only way that all sides will make headway is for them to accept one another’s problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Given that, in reality, rules around the world differ somewhat from the Union’s internal rules, we stand at a major crossroads. The fate of Europe’s prosperity will depend firstly on how and when we review our social market economy regulations with a view to increasing genuine flexibility, and secondly, on whether Europe is to have a stronger influence on the creation and monitoring of global economic rules that will reflect our values more closely. High social and environmental standards are a laudable outcome of European civilisation, which has declared itself responsible for the long-term sustainable development of the planet. On the other side of that coin, however, are higher production costs and lower competitiveness in a number of sectors that are coming under global pressure, especially from Asian economies unfamiliar with these standards. In third countries, natural resources are plundered, and commerce is characterised by lawlessness. Working and living conditions are at variance with basic human laws. This is something to which Europe must not turn a blind eye.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is a dialogue on how to review European regulation in such a way that it would not be a hindrance to competitiveness and employment, but would, rather, support the drive to make the European market more attractive and to raise living standards. It is also a call for Europe’s foreign policy to be significantly strengthened and for the assertion of a trade strategy that is based on our values. Our natural ally on this path and at the WTO is the United States, with which I would advocate stepping up dialogue. The weak point regarding this path is the unwieldy decision-making in the Union’s internal institutions, which might have been improved with a new Constitution. Finally, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur, who has taken account of the public hearings and the entire debate in both committees. Her report is both well-balanced and thorough, and as such deserves Parliament’s resounding support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Only a competitive economy can survive in a global market.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU's internal market, having been one of the strongest participants in the world market, is losing acceleration and is stagnating. By taking advantage of imperfection in WTO rules, and by not adhering to work safety and environmental standards, Asian countries, China for example, are successfully conquering the EU's textiles, footwear and electronics markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The hesitation of EU states to make decisions, which will influence the long-term outlook for the EU's economic development, also threatens competitiveness in other areas. By this I mean the absence of a common energy and industrial policy, and the growing threat to the EU's labour market and the free movement of services.</p>
<p class="contents">The application of the transition period for the movement of the new states' labour forces, and the adoption of a services directive, which does not embrace the country of origin principle, will reduce the EU's competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I urge the old EU Member States to reject the transition period for the movement of labour forces, and urge the European Parliament to vote for a services directive, which embraces the country of origin principle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, instead of identifying social inequalities and promoting their eradication, it takes refuge in strengthening the players who promote them, in the name of deregulation of the market.</p>
<p class="contents">As a result, I distinguish three basic negative concepts in the report: firstly, the fact that we are calling on the European Union to define a strategy for facing the challenges in question, by making the internal market more flexible. Secondly, the fact that we are calling on the European Commission to monitor the emergency of signs of protectionism in the Member States and to report regularly to Parliament on any such signs and, thirdly, the idea that there is a need to ensure that the large European market players find sufficient support and opportunities in the internal market to develop into global market players.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone might reasonably conclude that, with this report, a call is being made for even greater flexibility in employment relations, the abolition of social intervention by the state and support for large companies, at a time when various studies have ascertained that the social consequences of globalisation are extremely negative; in other words, 50 million of the richest Europeans and Americans have the same income as 2.7 billion people in the rest of the world. Over one billion people on planet Earth do not know how to read and write. The top 20% in the rich countries control 82% of exports and 70% of direct investments. Three billion people in the world have an income of less than two dollars a day, while in the USA the poverty line is calculated to be 11 dollars a day. Therefore, even the official statistics do not give a full picture of economic inequality and poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, a comparison of the years from 1960 to 1980 with the years 1980 to 2000, when markets internationalised further or globalised, shows that progress clearly slowed down over the last twenty years, when markets opened up and companies traded in conditions of unadulterated competition, when small- and medium-sized enterprises closed down for the benefit of multinationals. The report does not identify these effects, let alone address them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe needs sweeping change, and in particular it needs to build a genuinely common market for labour and services. At present, this market remains closed to a great many Europeans. If Europe fails to remedy the situation it will suffer in terms of global competitiveness. If we are honest with ourselves, I think most of us have now lost count of the number of times we have heard statements of this sort.</p>
<p class="contents">Citizens of the new Member States of the Union are only entitled to work in three countries of the old Fifteen. The overwhelming majority of the Union’s Member States still does not believe that cheaper labour and cheaper, more competitive, services are good for the economy, or that they will reinvigorate it, thus generating growth in both employment and income. The more national protection of national markets of labour and services there is, the more jobs and services will be delocalised beyond the Union’s borders. They will move to Delhi and Beijing rather than to Warsaw or Budapest. We need more action and fewer words.</p>
<p class="contents">The first test of our real intentions will come on Thursday, when we vote on the Services Directive. This will be an opportunity for us to demonstrate whether we want a genuinely free common market or whether we will be content with a cheap sham and with empty words, blaming an evil and callous outside world which is fast leaving us behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is regrettable that nothing better seems as yet to have occurred to the Commission than to establish a globalisation fund, thereby transferring more money from the old Member States to the new ones, which were supposed to have used the billions they were given in aid to prepare themselves for accession and can now, on top of the advantage they enjoy through low labour costs, afford a flat tax, while the workers in the old EU Member States feel that the Brussels <span class="italic">nomenklatura</span> have left them in the lurch. The fact is that eastward enlargement and headlong globalisation have resulted in such competitive pressure that some workers and some industries can no longer cope with it. The widespread fear of cut-price competition is therefore nothing to be wondered at. We must, then, cost what it may, stick with the transition periods for the labour market in order – even if only to a limited extent – to alleviate these evils. There may well be export surpluses, and major conglomerates may be doing well, but jobs that pay social insurance contributions are stagnant, and so our social security system is taking a battering. For years, the Commission has been stressing the importance of small and medium-sized businesses as job generators, yet one after another, laws are being enacted that make life more difficult for them. Both support grants and public contracts are targeted at big firms, so these move every couple of years to wherever the highest grants are currently paid. This must change, and change without delay, or else – or so it seems to me – Europe’s small and medium-sized businesses will be thrown to the wolves. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the first place, although we are all aware that globalisation is going on, I do believe, in contrast to Mr Mölzer, who spoke just now, that we have to seize it as an opportunity if we want to take the right action. Secondly, we have to observe what the World Trade Organisation does about it, and strengthen the UN as the world’s ethics organisation alongside it. Ideas about a ‘global Marshall Plan’ in development cooperation are highly relevant in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">My third point is that the Euro was our greatest contribution to this. Economic and monetary union is a response to globalisation, and that is why the Stability and Growth Pact must be adhered to if we are to carve out the scope for more of the kind.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, population change is a headache for us; we need to sort out our social security and pensions systems, and, if we fail do so with a sufficiently lasting effect, we will certainly lose out to globalisation. A few days ago, Jean-Claude Juncker told a gathering of the European People’s Party that ‘the globalisers’ young people are in Asia, and demographic changes mean that the globalisers’ senior citizens are in the West’. We see this as a disconcerting analysis of our necessary response.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, we make the internal market into a domestic market and make the four freedoms a reality for employers and workers. The services directive is part of that.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I will point out that education and research and small and medium-sized businesses need the right sort of financial backup if we are to seize the opportunities in our own back yard and not shrink back from the risks involved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with the rapporteur that if the phenomenon of globalisation is to be positively perceived, it must benefit as many stakeholders as possible, including small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">What should the European Union do to stand up to the competition of the USA and vast, rapidly growing, Asian economies?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, investment in education, research and development must be a priority, because the only way for the European Union to compete is through high added value in its goods and services. Since implementing a knowledge-based economy is not feasible without a proper strategy and adequate financing, it will be necessary, before approving the Financial Perspective for 2007–2013, to reconsider the incomprehensible reduction in education and research spending, which jeopardises such important activities as the 7th Framework Programme. A warning to this effect has also been issued by the European Universities Association, a prominent European academic body that brings together universities and the national organisations for heads of universities.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must focus our support on small and medium-sized start-up businesses, and improve their access to venture capital in the early phases of their development, as they form the backbone of the entire economic system.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, twelve Member States of the European Union must embrace the message from the European Commission that closing labour markets does not pay.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, we must eliminate barriers in the internal market by approving the amendment to the Services Directive proposed by IMCO.

It causes concern and apprehension. I understand these concerns, but I do not share them. We in Europe should have more confidence in our own ability. Globalisation can be a challenge, but equally it is an opportunity and that is how we should approach it.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason is simple. We have no alternative. Seeing globalisation as a threat feeds calls for protectionism. I have stated on numerous occasions that I do not think that closing borders and protecting markets can be the answer. Shielding economies from competition does not make them competitive. Markets only become competitive if companies are forced to compete.</p>
<p class="contents">Remaining in a state of denial, pretending the outside world does not exist, is a recipe for lacklustre economic performance. With poor economic performance, we simply cannot sustain our social model. Globalisation is not something that happens outside the single market; it is part of the single market and the single market is part of a globalised market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
