<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jackson (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, this is a question about the Eighth Conference of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol dealing with the reduction of CO2 emissions. Is an urgent matter because the New Delhi Conference, to which the question refers, is now beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament, and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in particular, are very concerned that we should keep the Kyoto momentum going. In the European Union all is really not well, because some of the Member States that have ratified Kyoto are in the process of increasing their emissions of CO2, notably Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">We have adopted a number of directives tending to decrease CO2 emissions, and the Commission has put forward a very useful programme showing what it has done and what it intends to do. We are particularly interested in the proposals on monitoring mechanisms, which are likely to come forward soon.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to ask three things. Firstly, how important is the New Delhi Conference? The Commissioner would say that it is very important. If so, then my next question is why is she here and is she planning to go? I am sure that if she is not planning to go, it is not a symptom of the downgrading of the status of the conference. We simply want to know what is likely to happen at New Delhi. We have heard conflicting rumours.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it would be interesting to hear how the Commission thinks other countries could be encouraged to participate in the Kyoto process. For example, I recently met with the Australian Ambassador to the European Union. Australia is not a party to Kyoto and is clearly not planning to become one. Australia might not have major CO2 emissions, but it could lead the way in South East Asia – a very important area where increasing industrialisation is increasing those emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we should sort out what the role of MEPs is when they attend such conferences. In the past, my colleagues have had increasingly uncomfortable experiences attending these conferences, for example the Johannesburg Conference on Sustainable Development. The Commission is always extremely helpful and briefs MEPs as much as possible, but our delegations are not part of the meetings held by the EU delegation as such. We cannot understand why we cannot be observers at that process. It is absurd for the representatives of the people of Europe to travel halfway round the world only to be spectators at a conference where the people negotiating on their behalf are not directly elected on a European mandate. We would like to see this changed so that we are at least given observer status in EU meetings at such conferences. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wallström,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Mr President, thank you for those very valid questions on COP 8 as it is called, which I will try to answer as clearly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, after Bonn and Marrakech, COP 8 is an opportunity to reinforce the commitments from developed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and repeat calls on those countries that have not yet ratified the Kyoto Protocol to do so in the near future. The discussions at COP 8 in India will first of all deal with progress on implementation. That is to establish the state of play. The concerns of developing countries relate to adaptation to climate change and the initiation of a process for further action to be taken after 2012, for a second commitment period.</p>
<p class="contents">The progress of the Conference will be detailed in a daily declaration. However, if you ask how important this conference is compared with the others, I can say that no negotiations on major issues of substance are foreseen. So there is a difference between previous COP meetings and this one. This is not to say that it is not important, but it is not at the level of true negotiations as yet.</p>
<p class="contents">We can expect the developing countries to remind the industrialised world of our obligations under the climate convention when it comes to helping them in capacity building and adaptation to climate change. The European Union, together with other developed countries, wants to have an initial discussion on the process for deciding on further action for the second commitment period and to initiate this process in New Delhi. The Environment Council also called upon other countries to engage in a dialogue on this question last week.</p>
<p class="contents">I can anticipate that the role of the European Union will be to try to build bridges between Japan, the United States and other countries which would like to push the developing countries to move towards quantified commitments for the second commitment period, as of now. The developing countries are opposed to that and, of course, argue from a political standpoint that it is our role to lead the way, to show that we are serious about getting our greenhouse gas emissions down, before they will accept anything that could hamper their development. So this debate will probably start, but we in the European Union have said that we should concentrate on establishing the process, because our first objective is for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force. We should not let anything stop us from reaching that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission together with Member States will use COP 8 to emphasise the importance of implementing the Kyoto Protocol and the agreements reached in Bonn and Marrakech. We welcome the various points raised in the European Parliament resolution of 2 October and we will take them on board as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">One issue that we will pursue at COP 8 is also a follow-up to the coalition of the willing on renewable energy that the European Union launched in Johannesburg. We will discuss the way forward with like-minded countries and encourage others to join in.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, the Kyoto Protocol will enter into force once 55 parties representing at least 55% of the emissions of Annex 1 have ratified the Protocol. So far, 95 countries representing 37.1% of emissions have ratified the Kyoto Protocol, representing around two thirds of the world population. The speed of ratification, and this concerns your second question, Mrs Jackson, increased before and during the World Summit in Johannesburg. Such events often trigger this kind of reaction. That is fine, but the important thing is to get the countries to ratify the Protocol and to make progress in implementing it. Canada and Russia said, during the World Summit, that they intent to ratify it, while major developing countries, such as China, India and Brazil, have by now done so.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that what is most important now is to continue to put pressure on Russia, because we know that the ratification by Russia, which represents 17.4% of emissions, is vital to reach the 55% threshold needed for the Kyoto Protocol to enter into force. We are, of course, in contact with the Russian authorities and we are closely following progress on ratification in Russia. My colleague and I have urged other parties, with whom we have bilateral meetings, to ratify the Kyoto Protocol and we are continuing to do so. We have done all we can, travelling around the world talking to Australia and other countries in the everyday bilateral context, drawing attention to this issue and to the importance of ratifying the Kyoto Protocol. So we are continuing to call on the US and Australia to return to the Kyoto process.</p>
<p class="contents">The European climate change programme Mrs Jackson referred to was launched on 8 March 2000 and has identified key elements for a cost-effective EU-wide strategy to combat climate change. Our communication last year outlined a first package of ten measures with a cost-effective reduction potential of between 122 and 178 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent. That is nearly halfway towards our Kyoto target of -8%.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has already presented proposals for a number of these measures, including an EU emissions trading scheme, the energy performance of buildings, co-generation and a strategy to increase the use of biofuels in road transport. Others, such as legislation on minimum energy efficiency standards for end use equipment or the promotion of energy services and on fluorinated gases, are in the pipeline. But is true that some of our Member States will have to take serious steps to deal with the current trend when it comes to greenhouse gas emissions. You cannot afford to be lax in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Transport has been identified as one of the more intractable sectors, with carbon dioxide emissions from transport the fastest growing, despite the progress made through our agreement with the European Automobile Manufacturers Association. The Commission has indicated that changes in current mobility patterns need to be a high priority.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning to the role of MEPs, the MEPs I met yesterday, who will be in the delegation going to India, find it frustrating that often they are in the same group as the NGOs. As observers, they will not have access to the negotiations or to the round table discussions in New Delhi.</p>
<p class="contents">We have had Members of the European Parliament in the European Communities delegation at previous COPs in Bonn and Marakesh. On both occasions I appreciated and enjoyed the outstanding cooperation with the EP delegation. It has been very helpful to have the Members of the European Parliament present and active on those occasions and at bilateral meetings with other parliamentarians.</p>
<p class="contents">In a letter to President Cox, the Commission President, Mr Prodi, recently confirmed that, on the basis of the framework agreement on relations between Parliament and the Commission, the Commission could accept the inclusion of eight Members of the European Parliament as observers in our Community delegation for COP 8. The inclusion of the MEPs in the COP delegation follows the established rules on the presence of Members of Parliament in delegations to international conferences.</p>
<p class="contents">We decided, after our discussion yesterday, that we on the Commission side will do everything we can to see whether some parts of the round table discussions could be made public or opened up to Members of the European Parliament, but we are in the hands of a UN organisation, so we can only ask. You will then need to ask the Council and the Member States whether it would be possible to participate in coordination meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">This issue will have to be raised in a more general context, because it concerns not only the MEPs attending this and other climate change meetings, but also other international fora. It is important to sort out for the future the different roles and responsibilities of the Commission, the Member States and Members of the European Parliament. Now is probably not the time to change all the rules in the existing agreement, but later on it should be taken to a more general level and clear rules established for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I have appreciated enormously the cooperation with Members of the European Parliament. I hope that will continue at COP 8 in India. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And I would say that, in terms of the EU’s new political agenda, there is a set of three objectives in this field that must be achieved in the short term.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, ensuring that the Protocol will enter into force. In order for this to happen, Russia must ratify the Protocol. The problem, however, is that Russia has already promised on several occasions that it would ratify the Protocol and this has not yet happened. I ask the Commissioner, what type of concrete political and diplomatic initiatives are being and will be adopted in conjunction with the Russian Government to ensure that the Protocol is urgently submitted for ratification in the Duma?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I believe it is important not to give up – and in fact we cannot give up – attempting to convince the US administration to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol. The directive on emissions trading will help the European campaign to persuade the Americans to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol. Let us say that, with emissions trading, we will be able to demonstrate that it is possible to comply with Kyoto at less economic cost. I do feel, however, that on this issue too, embarking on a charm offensive is not enough. We must take Kyoto to the next round at the World Trade Organisation. And I wish to ask the Commission, is it prepared to submit an initiative to the next World Trade Organisation round, that guarantees the elimination of competitive and legitimate advantages that American products will gain as a result of their economy not being covered by the Kyoto Protocol?</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, Mr President, I believe it is important for the European Union to strengthen its international leadership on the basis of action rather than words. On this matter, I wish to congratulate Commissioner Wallström on the excellent work she is doing in this field. The Commission has demonstrated its ability to take the initiative, not least in its directive on emissions allowance trading and in the European Programme on Climate Change, but I do feel that this is a serious political problem: where the Member States are concerned, we are seeing real paralysis. I believe it is crucial, for the sake of the credibility of our leadership, that the Member States also start to take action. With regard to the role of Parliament’s delegation in New Delhi, I would emphasise the words of its Chairman, Caroline Jackson: the parliamentary delegation must be allowed to attend the daily meetings held by the EU representatives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These issues need nonetheless, in the future too, to go on being given a high profile. It is not acceptable for there to be certain Member States that do not really take the issue seriously and that, instead of reducing emissions, are tending to do the opposite. Almost the same situation applies too to the candidate countries that wish to become members of the EU but that have still not ratified the treaty. We must continue to exert pressure and say that we require ratification if membership is to become possible. What we expect first and foremost from the New Delhi conference is political leadership and the maintenance of a strong political message from the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">The most important issue, even if we are now beginning to understand that it will probably not be possible to concentrate on it, is about what will happen during the next commitment period. What, then, will happen after 2012? What shall we do? What are the objectives? I should also like to put these issues to Mrs Wallström. What is it intended should happen during the forthcoming period? Does the Commission already have plans as to how matters need to proceed? What demands are to be made, and how are we to make progress in solving the problem of climate change?</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to our role in relation to the developing countries. We quite often point out the need to ensure we help the developing countries fulfil what is required of them by the Kyoto Protocol. How are we to do this in purely practical terms?</p>
<p class="contents">We have today voted on the EU budget at first reading. There will of course be a second reading, but it is difficult to see where climate issues in particular fit into the picture.</p>
<p class="contents">To repeat Parliament’s old demands, it should soon no doubt be time to incorporate shipping and aviation into these talks. That has still not happened, but it is no doubt desirable that it should. Even if these issues cannot perhaps be among those raised in New Delhi, it is nonetheless important that we make these demands.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I want to repeat the principle on the basis of which I think this discussion ought to proceed and which, in actual fact, gave rise for once to some discussion at the most recent meeting of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. I mean that we must seek equal rights for all citizens of the world. The committee certainly adds the rider that this is to happen in the long term, but what is nonetheless required is for all citizens to have the right of access to good, renewable energy on equal terms. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, we must correct recital C of the motion for a resolution we tabled, because this recital states that 83 countries have ratified the Kyoto Protocol but – as the Commissioner so rightly said – at the beginning of October, 95 countries had ratified it, which equates to 37.1% of CO2 emissions.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe we are going to repeat ourselves; I believe we all agree that some matters should take priority – as the Commissioner said – succeeding in persuading Russia, by means of all the necessary diplomatic steps and pressure, to sign the Protocol would mean exceeding 55% of emissions, which would enable us to consider the Kyoto Protocol implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I must say that, sadly, my country is no example when it comes to reducing emissions, but rather the opposite. We need to put pressure on the various countries so that they continue to fulfil the commitments we have all undertaken, and there is no doubt that renewable energies will play a very important part in this direction we are taking, in addition to transport, despite the poor result achieved in Johannesburg with regard to renewable energies.</p>
<p class="contents">The need to instigate a debate in New Delhi on objectives beyond 2012, on means and mechanisms for sanctions and on conflict-resolution mechanisms, could be of great importance for the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I shall end by referring to the role of the Members of the European Parliament in these summits which – as the Commissioner so rightly said – should be substantial, but not because we want to be present in every single discussion, but because I believe we can be of help to the Commission and to those who are determined that the Kyoto Protocol should become reality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">So, ladies and gentlemen, how should we interpret this debate, which is being held after the opening of the Conference, if not as a sign of political and psychological immaturity in the face of the reality of the threats to our world posed by the upheaval of climate change? We must ask ourselves whether the latest UNEP report, which revealed that USD 150 billion is spent on environmental damage each year, escaped the scrutiny of certain European visionaries. Do not worry, ladies and gentlemen of this House. I do not mean you.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, how do you intend to convince your fellow Commissioners of the urgent need for practical measures? In New Delhi, what we actually need to do is to increase the international reaction to the threat of climate change a little more. This momentum, which the European Union harnessed to implement the conclusions of the last Earth Summit as fully as possible, must be maintained with a view to the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol, as defined at Bonn and Marrakech.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must continue to be a driving force in combating climate change. At New Delhi, we must also pave the way for the second period, as you have said, and prepare to address requirements which are more pressing because of the gravity of the situation, and we know that time is of the essence.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three essential points we must uphold in New Delhi. Firstly, as regards carbon wells, which distort the true environmental picture, scientific rigour and objectivity exclude this simple solution, this expedient. Secondly, it is imperative that the surge in air traffic and its impact on the increase in greenhouse gas emissions are included in the process. What is the Commission’s current view on this? Thirdly and lastly, the COP 8 must not fail to condemn the attempt to include nuclear power as a renewable energy, for nuclear power is limited and even obsolete. For example, Amendment No 15 to our resolution, seeking to reinstate it, must be rejected.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no more urgent subject for us and our debates than the potential future impact of climate change. There is nothing more essential in politics than the very essence of all politics: the continued survival and proper functioning of the Earth itself. We must act now to give ourselves the chance of a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Now that we are preparing for New Delhi, the Kyoto Protocol is still not in force, however. Obviously we cannot have complete control over the world just like that. Certainly not when we consider that man has limited influence over CO2 emissions. Technically speaking there are vast sources of CO2 emissions and CO2 wells. It is therefore only to be expected that emissions caused by man have only a limited effect on the overall amount. However, we still have a duty to limit CO2 emissions as far as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">A glance at the conference programme shows me that specific matters relating to the implementation are up for discussion. The emphasis being placed on wind energy, cooperation with third countries and emissions trading schemes is a positive development. In my opinion the European Union can make a substantial contribution towards projects for clean development in developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU already has a pioneering role to play with regard to emissions trading schemes. Parliament has chosen to implement an unambiguous and well-thought-out system to be introduced in 2005. Economies can be made by businesses being more frugal with energy and the link with the overall energy policy is of course very important.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to CO2 wells I would like to point out the danger that we might overestimate in our accounting for CO2 wells in, for example, the ocean. As the water warms up, its capacity for absorbing CO2 will fall again.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union ratified the Protocol six months ago. Let us hope that the New Delhi climate conference will result in ratification by the Russian and Canadian Governments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is, though, a pity that, realistically speaking, no serious political progress is expected in New Delhi because people are in fact hoping for something else. After the dreadful floods in Germany and neighbouring countries, people expected the climate problem to be resolved once and for all in Johannesburg, only to be told that it had a different agenda. The same appears to be true of New Delhi, but we must continue to be tough negotiators, even if we cannot always make rapid progress.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also remember that Kyoto is, of course, just the first step, which is why we reiterate quite clearly in our resolution that all citizens must end up with the same rights, which basically means that per capita emissions should be the same the world over. For the developing countries, this implies a great deal more than we promised in Kyoto. In view of the recent debate on emissions trading in Germany, we have to keep reminding ourselves that all the parties in Germany are in fact agreed that we need to reduce emissions in the long term by 80% – I repeat 80% by 2050 – and if we are already arguing so energetically against it now, when first steps need to be taken, then I do not hold out much hope for this long-term objective. Nonetheless, we must stand by it and our resolution reaffirms this.</p>
<p class="contents">Ratification by Russia, Japan and the USA is still very, very important. As we have been told on numerous occasions, all we can do is keep on making demands and ensuring that every meeting, at whatever level, between representatives of the European Union, be it the Commission or the Council of Ministers or us here in the European Parliament, between the EU and the USA, between the EU and Russia, addresses this issue. It must be our top priority in our dealings with these countries. We must not relax in our efforts and I expressly endorse what Mr Moreira Da Silva said about the WTO. We must get the WTO to agree to allow us to keep certain products off the European market if they have been manufactured using processes that cause additional climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The credibility of the European Union is, of course, vital. We have to clean up our own act. Parliament has, by a very large majority, taken a clear stand on emissions trading. I am sorry that the Council of Ministers has postponed its decision yet again and I am sorry to hear from initial reactions that important amendments which we adopted, for example on the CAP or on 1990 as the base year, may not meet with the Council's approval. The Council needs to adopt a clear concept, and quickly, and we, the European Parliament, need to be tough negotiators. That is all I have to say. Three minutes is too short a time to expand on the whole issue but I think it really is important for us to keep clarifying our position here in this House.</p>

I have something to say to the members of the parliaments. We have more and more global processes, not just now with Kyoto, but on other issues – I am thinking of the International Monetary Fund, financial policy, worldwide credit policy, environmental policy and trade policy – which are in fact decided solely by the executive. The parliaments rubberstamp them, they have no choice. The question is: surely, with increasing globalisation, parliaments could be more involved in the opinion-forming process? This question is directed both to us and to our parliaments. We need to find new ways of working together instead of just taking recourse to the executive – in this case the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Kyoto must be ratified and that will be our main job in New Delhi. We must convince our counterparts, especially our Russian counterparts, that this makes sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, when we talk of reducing CO2 – and other greenhouse gas emissions, but mainly CO2 – we always mention renewable energy in the same breath. And so we should. I have no wish to contradict that. It is just that, in New Delhi, we will be in a country that generates well over 50% of its electricity from coal. If they could bring their coal technology up to current European standards, we would save much, much more CO2 throughout the world than with all the other very costly reduction measures put together. This is a fact and we must face it. In other words, if we want a climate policy, we need an active coal policy and we should mention that in the same breath as renewable energy, because 80% of the world's energy is still generated from fossil fuels.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that climate policy also gives us a chance to foster a new relationship with developing countries, in the form of emissions trading. The Commission itself conducted a very interesting study in its institute in Seville, with a time frame of up to 2030, when, it states, emissions trading with Asia will be worth around EUR 80 billion. That implies a capital inflow of around EUR 80 billion for these countries. Know-how will be transmitted to these countries and the advantage to us is that the reduction in emissions will be entered against our account, meaning that both sides will benefit from the trade off. We should be thinking more along these lines. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A worldwide discussion will immediately arise – how and when will the US and the developing countries participate in this issue? Europe has to take the lead again in this discussion. Much greater reductions are to be implemented in Europe after 2012, for example minus 30% in 2020 as proposed by the German Government. How do the Commissioners feel about this? On the other hand, as has already been stated, equal rights to emit CO2 per world citizen at a sustainable level is also written in the Parliamentary resolution. How does the Commission feel about this idea? That will mean that India will be allowed to emit double its current amount, China must stabilise, Europe must reduce its emissions by 80% and the US by 90%.

I should like to reiterate what Mrs Annelie Hulthén said, namely that we must make sure that future Member States of the European Union understand that this is one of our priorities.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important issue -– and at this time and at this conference, which should not be taking place anyway, this probably has less to do with specific negotiations and more to do with thinking up a strategy and enumerating its features – is how we can convince numerous developing countries to join the fight against climate change in the future. This will of course depend on our own credibility when it comes to climate change. In other words, Europe and the European Union must deliver satisfactory results here. Our success or failure in achieving this credibility with our partners in the developing countries – for whom I realise, Commissioner, this will not be easy – will not depend solely on our environmental policy; it will also depend on whether we have coherent policies in other sectors, such as European agriculture.</p>
<p class="contents">One point, which has not yet been raised today but which I consider very important, is the question of monitoring. I think that, if we want the Kyoto Protocol to be a success and deliver demonstrable results, then we need a reasonable, reliable monitoring system. In other words, we must ensure that the Member States deliver reliable figures on their emissions and on the flexible mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need reliable data on what Europe sees as the very negative question of planting, in other words reforestation and similar activities.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point, which numerous members have raised, is of course the question of what happens after 2012, at the end of the first period, and it seems to me that we can make good use of COP 8 if we avoid getting embroiled in finer points and negotiations in order to table this problem and start thinking now about what must and will happen in 2012. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to comment on some of the points that have been raised.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, what can we do to influence Russia and to push for ratification from the Russian side? It is difficult to talk to the Russians. We have for some time now been planning a troika visit to Russia and we are continuing to plan for that visit because we want to meet the right people. We want to have it at a high political level in order to have a meaningful discussion. In all bilateral talks, including those between Commissioner Prodi and Prime Minister Putin, climate change and the Kyoto Protocol have been on the agenda. Of course we raise this issue in all our bilateral contacts.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also aware of a study that has just been published by the Russian Government on the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. We are currently analysing the results – hopefully we will be able to use some of them in our ongoing debate. We are keeping a close eye on what happens in Russia, in order to be able to use the positive forces that exist in Russia. In the end, I suppose that it is Prime Minister Putin who will decide.</p>
<p class="contents">What about a WTO initiative? That has not yet been included in our plans at all. Maybe that is a good idea. I have not though about it enough to give you a really considered answer today, but I am worried about anything that could complicate or halt the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. We should be very careful not to raise the issue in such a way that we create more stumbling blocks in the debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol. I would be happy to come back to the debate on the WTO and the links between these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">What happens in the second commitment period? First of all, we are interested in establishing the process in Delhi and COP8. It is too early and in view of the risk of complicating the whole debate on the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol, we want first of all to establish the process and decide how to get to the second commitment period. It seems a little pointless to go into the details on that before the Kyoto Protocol has even entered into force. So first things first. We have to stick to that strategy at COP8 as well.</p>
<p class="contents">There was one question on air traffic. Of course the Commission and the European Union are working within ICAO, because this is clearly an international issue. I am sure we would all agree that the work in ICAO has not been satisfactory when it comes to speed and commitment, but it also has a UNCCC mandate to work on the climate change issue. This is an area where we can hopefully do more, but we will have to continue to work in an international context.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what about equal rights per world citizen? The ultimate goal is to stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels. Remember that. We need to reduce emissions as a result. I believe this will lead to convergence of per capita emissions internationally. Whether equal rights is the right target, I cannot say. I do not want to say to the European Parliament that it is a ridiculous idea, but my personal opinion is that it might not be the most sensible approach. It is a moral concept rather than an environmental measure.</p>
<p class="contents">Our main objective is to protect the environment. That, I believe, is how we should formulate it. We emit eight times more, on average, than an Indian citizen. How do we create equal rights for citizens throughout the world? I would like to approach it from an environmental point of view, so that we make sure that we stabilise concentrations in the atmosphere at harmless levels. I hope you understand my argument. Perhaps this is something which requires further debate. We have an important role to play in New Delhi, in the COP8 discussions, because we can definitely work with the developing countries. We will probably be the bridge between G77, China and the developed countries in the debate on how to deal with climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
