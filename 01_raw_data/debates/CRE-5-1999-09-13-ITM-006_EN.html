It is rather disappointing that the Member of the Commission responsible for this issue is not here and that someone else is here who is not responsible for this portfolio. It makes a laughing-stock of the debates in this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Marine pollution, accidental and deliberate, is one of the major threats to the marine environment of Western Europe. This region represents one of the most intensively industrialised areas of the world where chemical, radioactive and hydrocarbon materials are routinely discharged into the marine environment and carried by cargo ships. The region also contains one of the highest concentrations of shipping and includes several of the busiest shipping lanes in the world. There are several tragic examples of accidental pollution from tankers and from other ships carrying various forms of dangerous cargoes. More by good fortune than by good planning there has not yet been a major accident resulting in radioactive spillage with a ship carrying radioactive materials although there was an incident some years back where a ship carrying uranium hydrofluoride from France to Riga sank but it is recorded that the containers apparently were recovered without any spillage.</p>
<p class="contents">Historically the marine environment has been used as the ultimate dumping ground for much of our industrial waste. Although industrial and radioactive discharges continue from a range of sources, the practice of direct dumping with little thought to the future is now widely regarded as unacceptable. However, the legacy of the years where materials were simply dumped remains and has sometimes returned to haunt us, often with severe consequences. It is a lesson which tells us that when we attempt to throw things away there really is no such thing as “away”.</p>
<p class="contents">This report acknowledges the need for establishing cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Furthermore there is a need to broaden the definition of accidental marine pollution to include operational historical and radioactive and other harmful substances, accidental and operational marine pollution. Although much attention is rightly paid to the impact of marine accidents, in terms of the chronic pollution it is the operational spills and discharges of hydrocarbons, radioactive materials and other harmful substances which, because they go largely unnoticed, are a cause of major concern. In terms of the environment whether a substance is accidentally or deliberately discharged is of no real consequence, the environmental impact remains.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, although the direct dumping of industrial materials, including military dumps of redundant munitions, is largely a practice which has been abandoned by Member States, the sites of such dumps continue to present a real threat to fisheries and in some cases, for example not far from my own coast, the Beaufort Dyke, a threat to human safety. Often fishermen’s lives are at risk, as are the health and welfare of the public who either visit the coast or live by the sea. Furthermore, as the sea is the ultimate sink for much industrial material from the shores and rivers these sources must be included within the definition.</p>
<p class="contents">The transboundary nature of the marine environment, which means that pollution in one area can impact on a wider region, leads to the need for a Community-wide framework for cooperation in the field of accidental marine pollution. Sharing information regarding hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances carried at sea and discharges into the sea which have been dumped as part of historical dumping regimes is a vital prerequisite in facilitating the preparation and coordination of any response necessary to mitigate the environmental and human health impacts of pollution incidents.</p>
<p class="contents">Effective mitigation requires a rapid response. The longer an incident is allowed to go unchecked the wider the impact, as we have seen. Hence it is too late to begin trying to get the required information after a serious pollution problem has occurred. We need to take action before. Knowledge about the type and extent of potential pollution problems is also a prerequisite for correct preparation in terms of techniques, personnel and equipment at appropriate locations. It is also necessary to be clear about the risks to the public and the environment and to alleviate justified public concern with accurate assessments of the risk. The public’s trust in the authorities is important to ensuring adequate responses. Furthermore, the public have a right to know what preparations are being made, what types of materials are threatening and what impacts may be expected. To this end, publication of information is a vital component as it establishes a route through which the general public can obtain information, for example emergency phone contact numbers. Such information can be easily made available and updated on the Internet as well as through established channels.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, it is a truism that once the marine environment has been contaminated or polluted it is impossible to fully clean up and repair the damage. However a rapid, efficient, adequate and effective response coordinated across national boundaries is needed to mitigate the impacts on the environment and public health in the case of a pollution incident. A prerequisite is the necessary information sharing with all parties. The database and information technology exists to establish the necessary communications between national and regional authorities, emergency response experts and the public. The dissemination of information about the range of marine pollution threats – hydrocarbons, radioactive substances and other harmful substances – will serve to ensure that the best possible mitigation measures are in place and have the full public trust and confidence of the public. On the issue of radioactive substances, during the debate in the committee the Commission representative said that it was “implicit” but we want it to be explicit. It is quite clear that it should be explicit<span class="italic"> </span>and if it is already implied then I do not see what the problem is about ensuring that it is explicit<span class="italic"> </span>because as time goes by radioactive substances are going to pose an even greater danger and – as I have already said – we are very lucky that there has not already been a serious accident.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lund (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, accidental marine pollution is in reality a rather odd expression. It is an expression which I do not think sounds alarming enough in relation to the problem we are confronted with here and which does not at all convey the seriousness of the matter. It includes oil spills, serious instances of which we are all aware of. We have all seen pictures of thousands of birds covered in oil. But it also includes all other possible examples of sea pollution which cause damage to health and to the environment and which often lead to extensive damage to, and real catastrophes for, the environment and animal life.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, the responsibility lies with the Member States, but I also think I am right in saying that there are two reasons why cooperation at European level is required. Firstly, we are talking here about what is definitely a cross-frontier problem concerning pollution and the environment. And secondly, we derive a lot of benefit from being able to exchange experience and expertise with one another, so that we can make use of each other’s experience and support each other in taking measures to prevent and combat damage. That was recognised in the EU as long as 20 years ago with the first initiatives involving cooperation in this area, and the proposal we now have before us is in fact one which, in reality, extends and implements the cooperation established at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to indicate four areas where I think it is a question of really useful innovations, especially when the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on the Environment are included. The first is a matter which Mrs McKenna has been much exercised by, namely the question of providing a broad definition of both “accidental marine pollution” and “harmful materials”. It is not only oil spills we are talking about. It is just as important to make clear that we are also concerned here with leaks from dumped munitions. It may be a question of leaks from radioactive materials or of leaks which can cause people’s hormonal balance to be upset. I think it is important that we do not set limits here but that we define things broadly. Any measures taken ought to relate to all these materials.</p>
<p class="contents">The other thing I want to refer to is the information system itself, which I think is very important. It is simply a key tool for efficient cooperation in this area so that we might quickly exchange information and so intervene early on. It also means that we are able to track down the polluters and so both assign liability and establish the relevant penalty to the extent that that is necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The third thing I want to mention is the reference in the comments to the Directive concerning harbour facilities for receiving waste from ships. I think it is very important that we also call upon these particular facilities in our efforts to prevent damage to the marine environment. It is important that ships should easily be able to dispose of their waste.</p>
<p class="contents">The final matter I want to refer to is the question of involving neighbouring non-EU countries in Eastern and Central Europe and in the Mediterranean and Baltic areas. If cooperation is to be effective, then it is enormously important that we involve these countries. In this connection, I also think it is important that reference should be made in the proposed amendments to the fact that we ought to be giving economic support to these countries so that they have a real opportunity to participate in the process.</p>
<p class="contents">After emphasising these four points, however, I would say that we are very glad to support the proposal, together with the amendments proposed by the Committee on the Environment.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is about monitoring pollution of the maritime environment. The Commission’s proposal concentrates primarily on oil spillages at sea. It is an important problem but there are other issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on the Environment was right to have the report include dangerous chemical substances and radioactivity. European Commission officials say that this is already implicit in the text. Would the Commissioner, Mrs Bjerregaard give explicit support to this as well? In any case, why is she not here? Mr Kinnock was right to criticise us for the fact that we MEPs do not turn up, and what is more, neither do those who put the questions. But we want information from the European Commission. With all due respect, I do not believe that Mr Marín is responsible for this area.</p>
<p class="contents">If the great work, the framework Directive on water, is to succeed, then it is very important to monitor the pollution of the maritime environment effectively. This report makes an enormous contribution in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">Even those in favour of nuclear power and chlorine chemistry would be able to vote for this report for it only concerns itself with information relating to radioactivity and chemical substances. It does not deal with closing down or developing chemical factories or nuclear power stations. That is why I appeal to all my colleagues to vote for this report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, as a Member of the European Parliament who represents the east coast of Ireland, this is an issue which is close to my heart.</p>
<p class="contents">It has come to my attention that British Nuclear Fuels Ltd. has applied to the British Department of the Environment for authorisation to discharge high levels of technetium 99 into the Irish Sea in the near future. If BNFL is successful with this application, while it will result in halving the levels of technetium 99 that are dumped in the Irish Sea, this will still be 15 times higher than the levels which existed in 1992. If BNFL has problems in discharging radioactive products such as technetium 99, it should store such waste materials on land in Britain as opposed to dumping them in the Irish Sea.</p>
<p class="contents">It is quite timely that BNFL is making applications to the British Government to deal with how much radioactive materials it can discharge into the Irish Sea. I say this because 15 September – Wednesday of this week when there will be a lot happening – is the deadline which has been given by the Radioactive Discharges Commission of the Ottawa Convention for the British Government to come up with proposals as to how best it is going to substantially reduce the discharge of radioactive substances into the marine environment.</p>
<p class="contents">One must remember that the Ottawa Convention on Marine Pollution has at its core the principle of substantially reducing the use of radioactive substances. A clear plan in this regard must be implemented by the year 2000. We know that the British Government has done nothing to implement its obligations under the Ottawa Convention to date. I await with interest to see how the British Department of the Environment intends to comply with its legal obligations under this important convention. As the British Government addresses the final details on this issue, it should be remembered that there is no safe level of radiation. The Irish Sea must not be used as a soft option for the disposal of radioactive nuclear materials by BNFL. Ever since the opposition to the THORP nuclear plant in 1993, the level of radioactive discharges from nuclear operations in Cumbria has substantially increased.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I support the proposals in the report. From the Irish perspective, we will have more confidence in the British regulatory authorities if they reject this application in its totality. It is up to the British Government to force BNFL to come up with alternative technological methods to deal with the discharge of such materials. I congratulate Ms McKenna on her report.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that you will all agree with me in confirming the importance of this Community framework for cooperation with which we are trying to back up and finalise the work of the Member States in the field of accidental marine contamination, in order to make it more efficient. This framework has proved to be very useful when, in cases of severe spillage, it has been necessary to coordinate the work of various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can completely or partially accept 20 of the 29 amendments proposed, which obviously improve the proposal. Amendments Nos 3, 6, 8, 9 and 13 and part of Amendment No 15 would be acceptable in principle, although we would like them to undergo another rewrite. </p>
<p class="contents">The 9 remaining amendments pose difficulties for the following reasons:</p>
<p class="contents">– Amendment No 1 and, in part, Recommendations 5, 15 and 24 make specific reference to contamination caused by radioactive substances which are already regulated by implication in the proposal. Furthermore, prevailing international agreements on the protection of the Mediterranean, Baltic and North seas, to which the Community is partially bound, all follow the same approach of not making mention of any specific substance. </p>
<p class="contents">– Amendments Nos 10, 11, 12, 17 and 18, and the first part of Amendment No 22 have as their objective closer cooperation between countries taking part in the PHARE, TACIS and MEDA programmes. The inclusion of these amendments may make managing it difficult, given the differences between the decision-making processes and the proposed Community framework.</p>
<p class="contents">– Amendment No 22, in the Commission’s opinion, does not conform to the recent decision on the amount of time spent in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">– Amendment No 23, in our opinion, contravenes the Commission’s right of initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of these observations, I am sure that Parliament’s contribution and support will facilitate the rapid adoption of this proposal, so that continuity between the way in which the Community currently works and the programme which is due to be implemented on 1 January 2000 will be guaranteed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
