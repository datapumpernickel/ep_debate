<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Redondo Jiménez (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report unanimously approved in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development on 25 April on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever proposes an early diagnosis system and maintenance of the Community method for controlling the disease and slaughter, since not enough progress has yet been made on marker vaccines.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason for applying a policy of non-vaccination is based on the fact that in the event of infection vaccinated pigs may become carriers of the virus, especially pregnant sows, which may not show signs of the disease but may transmit it horizontally to the other pigs on the farm and vertically to their progeny, which may include persistently infected piglets.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, as regards the differentiation of animals that have been vaccinated or have had the disease and generated antibodies, this differentiation between vaccinated and infected animals is not yet reliable. Research will have to continue into this until these marker vaccines are effectively reliable and we are able to use differential methods that indicate whether the animals have been vaccinated or have had the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">This legislation improves certain prophylactic rules, clarifies definitions and proposes the inclusion of the ‘Diagnostic Manual’ as an annex to the Directive. In addition, the amendments introduced refer to animal welfare standards on the farm and during transport, and emergency solutions are proposed for cases of serious health crises which prevent animal movements for long periods, such as buying-in schemes, which the Commission has certainly never done before.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also proposed that this health legislation should extend to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and that they should be included in the plans to control classical swine fever. Several amendments to this document have been tabled which your rapporteur feels deserve some comment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one amendment, No 34, tabled by Mr Mulder on behalf of the ELDR Group, which seems logical, but given that the health control authorities are national, trying to divide up the European Union into regions that belong to different countries and do not coincide with national borders seems unfeasible. I would ask Mr Mulder, who is present, whether the Dutch will be able to control German farms or whether the Germans will control Dutch farms. I do not think either side will agree to this.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 35, tabled by Mr Mulder, goes against both my feelings and the spirit of the report. If the animal is not eliminated, vaccination will not eliminate the virus and the marketing of meat from vaccinated animals in the European Union would mean less safety for our consumers than for those of third countries. We would in principle be unable to export, and anyway this news in the press would ruin the industry. Fresh meat from vaccinated animals carries the virus and may infect healthy animals that feed on swill containing it. I therefore cannot accept Amendment No 35.</p>
<p class="contents">As for Amendment No 36, also tabled by Mr Mulder, we again come up against the subject of co-financing, and I am also against it.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two other amendments: Nos 33, tabled by Mr Böge on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, and 37, tabled by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. These two amendments go a little beyond what I could have imagined, since in my country the use of swill has been banned for more than twenty years.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, in this very House, Amendment No 102 in the Paulsen report, reviewed in this very part-session, was approved and I do not want to go against the feelings of this House. I therefore understand that both Amendment No 33 and Amendment No 37 are acceptable because they may lead us to a more realistic solution to the animal feed control problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The House might be interested to know that Mrs Redondo very kindly accepted my invitation to come to London during the formulation of this report to take evidence from representatives of the UK pig industry and senior officials from the National Farmers Union and the Ministry of Agriculture. We happened to be in one of those meetings on Tuesday 20 February this year, the very day the first outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK was reported. As you can well imagine, this brought our meeting to an abrupt halt.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, it is partly because of foot-and-mouth disease that I wish to direct my remarks to the question of feeding catering waste or pigswill to pigs. I know that my colleagues from Germany and Austria have serious reservations about the proposal to ban such material from being fed to pigs throughout the EU. As Mrs Redondo has just said, Amendment No 33 seeks to permit controlled swill feeding, subject to stringent exceptional arrangements, if it can be guaranteed that the pathogens which cause epizootic diseases have been destroyed by treatment. Amendment No 37 seeks to achieve a similar objective.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask the House to reject both these amendments this evening. In the UK we had stringent controls of swill feeding in place. We ensured that pig farmers only used the most appropriate and up-to-date equipment for boiling catering waste to the correct temperature to destroy all pathogens and we ensured that regular inspections of the farms using such equipment were carried out. Of course you cannot legislate for human behaviour, however. It now seems almost certain that infected catering waste was delivered to a farm in the north-east of England, which for whatever reason, was not properly treated, or perhaps was not treated at all. This simple error, whether deliberate or just a mistake, has led to the destruction of over six million animals in the United Kingdom and tens of thousands of animals in Ireland, the Netherlands and France. We have now banned swill in the UK entirely. I urge the House to do the same across the whole of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Kindermann (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo, for her work, which is unexpectedly topical following the most recent outbreak of foot-and-mouth. The parallels between swine fever and foot-and-mouth are obvious; in the case both of foot-and-mouth and swine fever, the Community decided in the past to pursue a policy of non-vaccination. However, the scale of the foot-and-mouth crisis has demonstrated that an unreserved policy of non-vaccination belongs on the test bench. I do not mean that we should resort to blanket vaccination in future. Killing infected stock, stamping out, must continue to be the mainstay of the strategy to combat these diseases. However, greater importance should be attached to vaccination. We should not, in my view, stand still on the question of vaccination; instead we should develop a strategy of comprehensive zoonosis prevention mainly for use during disease-free periods. This could include stricter controls on third country imports, controls at airports and quarantining new additions to livestock.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important point is the principle of regionalisation. The Commission must act very quickly here and negotiate with EU trading partners in order to implement this principle. We cannot expect all the Member States of the EU to put up with import restrictions in third countries every time a disease breaks out in one or a few Member States. The European Union already applies this principle to third country imports. Now third countries must return the favour. Marker vaccines are very important here, as the rapporteur has clearly highlighted. More must be invested in these vaccines and in developing discriminatory diagnostic techniques, so that it will soon be possible to distinguish between vaccinated and infected animals and then make economic use of vaccinated animals.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on one more very specific issue, namely swill feeding, that is, using leftovers from canteens etc. These leftovers have been used as animal fodder for years and we must still be able to use them in future. As with meat and bonemeal, I support a conditional ban here, as formulated in Amendment No 37 by the Group of the Greens, that is, it should only be possible to use leftovers if a suitable sterilisation process is used. I think that if proper controls are carried out then, as we have seen in the past in numerous Member States, we will still be able to use this valuable source of protein. We should support the proposed amendment by the Greens which still allows leftovers to be used but subject to stricter conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In addition the report points out the necessary modification of the guidelines. Of course we must bring swine fever under control, but extermination methods that require mass slaughter are no longer really accepted by public opinion. That is a problem.</p>
<p class="contents">I myself come from Flanders. It is a densely populated region and there are even more pigs than people. That means that we ourselves are dramatically confronted with that problem. Therefore I agree that the combating of swine fever is important but should like at the same time to point out that this animal disease, unlike others, presents no danger to human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that culling because of the disease is one thing, but it is difficult to distinguish from culling for economic reasons, for example because sties become overfull or because animals become too heavy for sale. That is why it is always rather hypocritical when mass slaughter is being considered, since it is not very clear whether the culling is taking place to prevent disease or for economic reasons. I must honestly admit that in that respect I do not trust the industry.</p>
<p class="contents">The report has nevertheless convinced me that there has been a remarkable development in marker vaccine. Therefore in my view it can easily be declared ready for use so that it could be used on a much wider scale than solely in emergencies. If it is not reliable, for example because the disease can still be transmitted via the placenta, then it would seem sensible to me that it cannot be used with sows but that it can still be of use in other cases. If it transpires, as is argued in the report, that the diagnostic method is still not reliable, then I believe that we must do our utmost to develop good diagnostic methods, so that a distinction can be made between vaccinated animals on the one hand and animals that have developed antibodies because they have had the disease or have had contact with the disease in some other way. This is why I believe that culling must be rejected as a method of combating this animal disease and that we must concentrate our attention on the development not only of marker vaccine, since that already exists – but of good diagnostic methods and the refinement of the vaccine so that it can also be used for sows. In any case the guidelines should provide regulation that makes mass culls unnecessary. I agree with the conclusions of the Commission, namely that mass culls cast a slur on the agricultural policy and the health policy that we wish to pursue as a European Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Unfortunately the discussion of the Redondo Jiménez report is ending in an anticlimax. On Monday the Swedish Minister spoke on animal welfare, including tightening welfare regulations for animal transport. This morning we voted on the Busk report, in which we are trying to improve the living conditions of pigs in great detail. We now have a report before us in which we are supposed to simply agree to the destruction of thousands of healthy pigs if there is an outbreak of swine fever.</p>
<p class="contents">This Parliament speaks with two voices! One for the consumer and his feeling for animal welfare and one for the economy and trade, which must not be allowed to suffer from the outbreak of a disease. I have requested a roll-call vote on this report and on Mr Mulder’s amendment, so that the public can see from Members’ voting behaviour the double tongue of this Parliament on animal welfare.</p>
<p class="contents">It is astonishing that Mrs Redondo Jiménez has learned nothing from the combating of foot-and-mouth disease as it has developed in recent months, particularly in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. As part of the preparation of this report I should have like to see Mrs Redondo driving around the Oene region, the foot-and-mouth triangle in the Netherlands. It would have struck her that almost every field carries a poster reading: ‘EU, vaccinate now!’ I have argued more than once in this Parliament that animals are more than production units. They are creatures made by God, for whom we have responsibility. Norms and values apply not only in church but in the sty too.</p>
<p class="contents">Until 1980, vaccination was commonplace in the European Union. In order to meet the trade, the non-vaccination policy was implemented. In the 1997 outbreak of swine fever in the Netherlands, thousands of healthy pigs had to be destroyed and then too there was a call for vaccination. When will this Parliament start listening to its citizens? There is a vaccine available that makes it possible to distinguish vaccination from infection. There are still some drawbacks associated with those vaccines, but are there none associated with the mass destruction of animals? No one less than the International Bureau for Infectious Livestock Diseases (<span class="italic">Office international des épizooties</span>) recommends that in serious outbreaks of swine fever, countries that previously did not vaccinate should consider emergency use of a marker vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">Infectious animal diseases, like swine fever, show the weaknesses of current agricultural policy. It is wrong that organic farming and extensive animal husbandry should be proposed as <span class="italic">the </span>solution. These forms of agriculture are not less susceptible to livestock disease, on the contrary. Because of the high level of enclosure in intensive livestock farming, these businesses are precisely less susceptible to infection. That is not to say that organic farming does not have desirable aspects – its small-scale nature has many advantages. A combination of the small-scale structure of organic farming and the enclosure of intensive livestock keeping is a key for the future. For production we must abandon large-scale mobility and switch to more enclosed operations, no longer with international, but with regional circuits. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Swine fever, like foot-and-mouth, does re-emerge from time to time in different Member States throughout the European Union. Unfortunately, the only way of controlling it, at the moment, is by large-scale slaughter of animals, many of which are free from disease. To date, we have not been able, as has already been said, to develop a marker vaccine capable of controlling the disease.</p>
<p class="contents">I find it very hard in this modern day and age to understand why we have not made greater progress. You need only look at everything we have at our disposal, and at the costs incurred in this senseless slaughter of thousands of innocent animals. We heard this week that in the United Kingdom for every one proven case of foot-and-mouth, animals have been slaughtered on five or six farms around that case. The cost, not only to the Exchequer and to the European Union, but the real cost of the loss of these animals, is enormous.</p>
<p class="contents">The agriculture industry certainly does not need anymore bad publicity and I support Mr Stevenson's position on the amendments put forward by Mr Mulder. It is all very well to speak of stringent controls, but you cannot guard against human failure. You cannot prevent a failure by a single individual and it only takes one person not to follow those controls and the feeding of swill creates a real problem as seems to have been the case in the United Kingdom with foot-and-mouth.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that it will be very difficult and take time to secure agreement between all the parties involved – our trade partners and everyone else. But we must begin and we must put down a marker now. We must never again go through what we have just witnessed, be it with swine fever or with foot-and-mouth. There has to be a better way. The people of the European Union are demanding this. Many farmers demand that there has to be a better method of control. It is incumbent upon us to find a better way rather than witness the senseless slaughter we have recently seen.</p>
<p class="contents">No one can convince me that we have got it right at present. I do not believe we have. We have made mistakes and we should recognise those mistakes and put those mistakes right sooner, rather than later. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Byrne,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – Thank you, honourable Members. I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Redondo Jiménez and the Agriculture Committee for the report on the proposal for a Council directive on Community measures for the control of classical swine fever. The main purpose of the Commission proposal is to update the existing control provisions on swine fever, so as to take into account the most recent knowledge and experience acquired in controlling its agent. The proposal also takes account of the development of new diagnostic tools and vaccines, and of the opinions given by the Scientific Committee on these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">This House is well aware that in 1997/1998, a major outbreak of classical swine fever occurred in several Member States. This crisis led the Commission to review Community legislation on this issue and to look at the possibility of introducing provisions on the use of the so-called marker vaccines as an additional tool against the disease in case of emergency. The urgency for this review has been added to by the worrying outbreak in the United Kingdom last year, and today there is confirmation of an outbreak in the region of Lérida in Catalonia, Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has immediately taken a decision, in full consultation with the Spanish authorities, to impose restrictions on exports from this region. This decision will be reviewed at a meeting of the Standing Veterinary Committee, scheduled for this week. The decision taken today has immediate effect until 30 June and will be reviewed in the meantime. Before standing up in this debate, I had a brief telephone conversation on this matter with the Spanish Minister for Agriculture. A single farm is concerned, and I am happy to say that he informed me that all of the animals moved from that farm before confirmation had been slaughtered. However, we must remain particularly vigilant in relation to this issue. The situation will need to be followed up very closely, and I will be happy to keep Parliament informed of developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the current proposal, and marker vaccination in particular, the Commission financed specific trials and research projects. By means of this research very valuable information was obtained. It has been essential for the Commission in drawing up its proposal and cautiously paving the way for the potential use of these vaccines. Clearly, their use can only be envisaged in an emergency situation and once laboratory tests are available to discriminate between vaccinated and infected animals. Here I must emphasise the importance of the efficacy of the tests, as distinct from the marker vaccinations themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Encouragingly, Parliament's Agriculture Committee, the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions and the Member States, largely support the Commission's approach to this sensitive issue. This contrasts with the situation a few years ago, when quite different opinions were expressed by the experts themselves. This reminds us of the importance of scientific investigation, so that informed answers can be given to technically complex matters such as this. Indeed, I am aware that in preparing her report, Mrs Redondo organised an interesting and important hearing in the Agricultural Committee attended by swine fever experts from different Member States to better understand the progress made on this issue after the outbreak from 1997/1998.</p>
<p class="contents">The report of Madame Redondo largely supports the main aspects of the Commission proposal and of course, I am obviously very pleased about this. However, allow me to address in detail the amendments, which have been proposed. I will begin with the amendments the Commission cannot accept. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2 to 5, 26, 28 and 30, as they go beyond the scope of this directive. I understand that the recent FMD crisis has prompted Parliament to raise some horizontal problems related to animal health, which certainly need to be addressed. The report deals for example with the implementation of controls on imports of live animals and products, traceability, financing of costs related to animal diseases and future animal health problems, which may emerge in relation to enlargement. I share the concern of the Parliament. But these complex issues cannot be addressed in this directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already informed this Assembly that the Commission will address those issues before the end of the year in a separate legal framework. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 6 to 8, 12, 16 to 18, 22, 24, 25 and 29, which contain certain technical details of relatively minor importance, for which the Commission considers the text of its proposal more suitable. Amendment No 15 concerns the establishment of Community financed market support measures, in case of prolonged standstill of pigs in holdings kept under movement restrictions due to an outbreak of swine fever. The Commission cannot accept this amendment, as such decisions must be taken on a case-by-case basis. The legal basis for doing so already exists in the framework of the common market organisation for pig meat. This mechanism demonstrated its efficiency and there is no need for further legal provisions in this regard. Amendments Nos 20 and 21 concern the role of different authorities in the control of classical swine fever in wild boar.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission cannot accept these amendments, as it is for the Member States to ensure that all authorities potentially involved in the control of the disease are given a proper role. Their co-ordination must be guaranteed to ensure proper eradication. Amendment No 23 concerns the introduction of an article on the potential use of marker vaccines. As I have already said, the Commission and Parliament agree on this important issue. The Commission however cannot accept this amendment, as its proposal already includes comprehensive provisions on marker vaccines. However, we will take into account Parliament's remarks in a new recital.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 20 and 29 concern the legal status of the classical swine fever diagnostic manual, which the Commission intends to adopt. After the adoption of this directive, following the opinion of the Standing Veterinary Committee, the report suggests including this manual as part of the directive itself. The Commission feels that this could create confusion from a legal point of view and thus cannot accept these amendments. However, some modifications will be introduced in the text to reinforce the concept but the manual must be an essential part of Community legislation on swine fever. Amendments Nos 24 and 25 note the need for some transitional provisions on contingency plans, which are indeed already in Article 28 of the proposal. While the Commission shares the views of the Parliament, it cannot accept these amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the Commission can accept entirely or partially, a number of amendments. In these cases, drafting changes are also needed. These concern not only some technical aspects of the directive, like disinfection of holdings, or other contaminated materials and sampling of suspected pigs, but also some more substantial and sensitive issues, like marker vaccination and the introduction of a ban on feeding pigs with catering waste. On this last issue, I can only add to what I have already said in this Chamber last Tuesday, during the debate on the regulation of animal by-products, that the Commission is committed to ensure consistency between this directive and that regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">In summary, the Commission can accept the following amendments in full or in part and subject to necessary drafting changes: Amendments Nos 1, 9-11, 14, 19, 27, 31 and 32. The Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 2-8, 12, 13, 15-18, 20-26, 28-30 and 33-37. To conclude, ladies and gentlemen, I wish once again to thank Madam Redondo and the Agriculture Committee for the excellent report and their support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
