And rest assured: I shall be brief and to the point.</p>
<p class="contents">This European Council in Ghent was, in fact, already the second meeting under Belgian Presidency, and was, like the previous meeting on 21 September in Brussels, overshadowed by the effects of the attacks in New York and Washington. That was, of course, to be expected.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of 11 September will be etched on our minds forever, and the international community and the international alliance have meanwhile taken concrete action against terrorism. Originally, as you know, the Ghent Summit was conceived as an informal platform for exchanging ideas about the Union’s enlargement and particularly the Laeken Declaration, which is to structure and launch the debate on the future of Europe later on in the year. In addition, it was our initial intention to carry out a final assessment of the introduction of the euro.</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, in my opinion, it was up to the Council, as a kind of benign father figure, to carry out a final check to ensure that all preparations were in place for a successful introduction of the European single currency. However, as is often the case – that is, in any case, what I have gleaned from people who have far more experience as Presidents of the Council – the news has somewhat played havoc with that agenda, and with good reason, in my view.</p>
<p class="contents">The events of 11 September are of unprecedented and immense significance, and I think that as the days go by, it is becoming increasingly clear that the world after 11 September will never be the same. A new, global order is upon us. It is a new, multipolar world within which the European Union will need to play a more prominent role. Yesterday, I was able to give my initial views on this in Poland to mark the start of the academic year of the Europe College. However, to have major views on something is, of course, one thing, yet to involve the Union in this crisis as a united front, is quite another. A month ago, on 21 September exactly, we managed to persuade the Union to adopt one clear, unambiguous and common position. At the same time, we rubberstamped a far-reaching and detailed action plan against terrorism. From the Council’s final declaration last Friday in Ghent, it appears that we have managed to sustain this unanimous approach fully. Three elements are essential in this unanimous approach and I should like to outline them briefly. The military action which started on 7 October receives our unqualified support. The action is justified by resolution 1368 of the UN Security Council and we attach the greatest importance to protecting the life of civilians in the process. After the conflict, we also want a normal government to be established in Afghanistan, a stable government, a representative government that respects human rights. A government of this kind will be able to count on extensive European aid for the reconstruction of that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Meanwhile, we, along with the Union, will – more than ever before – commit to granting humanitarian aid to the many millions of Afghan refugees. Our commitment in this respect is to ensure that no country in the region becomes the victim of this conflict as a result of the influx of displaced. In fact, the presidency received from the Council the mandate to visit that region to obtain political support for the replacement of the Taliban regime.</p>
<p class="contents">The prompt and comprehensive implementation of the action plan against terrorism is the second element that I wish to underline briefly. With regard to the creation of a European arrest warrant, I believe it is safe to say that we have reached a break-through. The abolition of dual criminality was now accepted by everyone in the Council, not only for terrorist acts, but also for other serious crimes. As far as the list of terrorist organisations is concerned, it was decided that that should be completed and laid down by the end of the year. In addition, we discussed the proposals submitted by our American partners in the Council, and it was agreed in the Council to reinforce our action plan, if necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">At the end, the Commission and the Council were also commissioned to draw up a programme of cooperation among the Member States to fight terrorism involving biological and chemical weapons. In that programme, a European coordinator for civilian protection will be appointed, among other things.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the Union has a more active role to play in the prevention of, and fight against, hotbeds and conflicts. Mr Javier Solana, Mr Louis Michel, myself and the Commission, of course, will try to crank up a new dialogue in the countries of the Middle East or at least try to create the conditions for resuming the peace process. In this connection, the Council sent a clear message on Friday that it takes at least two States for peace to be possible. Moreover, we, along with the Council, have once again warned against the risk of the Islamic world embracing terrorism. We should instead intensify the dialogue between Europe and the Arab and Islamic world. Allow me to say, Madam President, that last Friday’s clear-cut decisions immediately put the ‘incident’ surrounding the preliminary meeting of the French President, the British Prime Minister and the German Chancellor into perspective. The impression of a triumvirate in the making, one which would probably not have been around if the meeting had taken place elsewhere or at a different time – was reduced to its true proportions after the three people involved assured me that the consultation was one about purely technical-military matters. I have accepted that explanation, partly to prevent this issue from dominating the European Council in Ghent, and I have repeated in the Council that it is the fifteen Member States who establish the positions jointly in the European Union.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, last Friday’s discussions were not restricted to current international events. The work session on Friday afternoon also dealt with the economic situation and the imminent introduction of euro notes and coins.</p>
<p class="contents">The slowdown in growth, which, we must reiterate, had already started before 11 September, and the longer-term uncertainty tell us that we must be careful. The foundations of the economy, however, remain healthy, which inspired both myself and the Council to be cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential that Europe – which has no budgetary surplus – observes the Stability and Growth Pact. Low inflation and permanent wage moderation are enabling the EU to make room for manoeuvre on monetary policy. We must, however, intensify our efforts in terms of structural reform and accelerate the Lisbon process in order to strengthen the growth potential of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the physical introduction of euro notes and coins, preparations are well underway. We have, however, identified a few problems, particularly concerning preparations by local authorities and small businesses. We do not want consumers to experience any negative effects.</p>
<p class="contents">The introduction of euro notes and coins must not bring about price increases. The European Council additionally asked the ECOFIN Council to adopt a regulation before the Laeken Summit to ensure that the costs of cross-border financial transactions are reduced and brought into line with national rates.</p>
<p class="contents">During the second part of our meeting, we discussed the issues relating to the future of the European Union and the Laeken Declaration. I think it is true to say that we made significant progress. There is now broad consensus, also at the specific request of the European Parliament, on the principle of a convention. This Convention will be able to begin its work in March of next year. I believe that we have agreed on this approach. We also agreed that the candidate countries would fully participate in this Convention. However, they will be unable – and I think this goes without saying – to question the proposals on which the Fifteen have already unanimously agreed. I also believe that the key to the success of this Convention lies in it having a very small leadership and a limited number of delegations. Furthermore, in the near future, I plan to invite the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs of the European Parliament, in order to have a frank and detailed exchange of views with them on the future of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, I do not believe that the Laeken Declaration must be a conventional declaration, and it must, above all, be a source of inspiration. First of all, it must be based on a critical analysis, in order to reveal the true challenges facing an enlarged and competent Union, which include the redistribution of competences in both directions – in other words, towards the European Union as well as towards the Member States – a solution to the proliferation of instruments in the European Union, institutions that are more democratic and which ensure, amongst others, a full co-decision procedure involving the European Parliament, the first steps of a process that leads to the treaties being divided into one fundamental treaty and several executing treaties and, lastly, a new position and a new role for the European Union on the world stage. In my view, there are no taboo subjects as far as this Convention is concerned and no stone can remain unturned.</p>
<p class="contents">At Ghent, we also – and lastly, because this was the final topic we dealt with – gave an update on the progress made in the negotiations with the candidate countries. The President of the Commission, Mr Prodi, presented a positive report to us on this issue. There is no reason to fear, in my view, that the proposed schedule will not be observed. In any case, I intend to send an additional message to the candidate countries in my speech at the Laeken Summit. I met the new Polish prime minister yesterday and urged him to step up efforts so that Poland can once again take up its rightful place in the negotiations, because, following the events of 11 September, enlargement is needed now more than ever before.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to give a general report on the Council meeting. The streets were calm. Ghent has, however – this is the truth, and I know as I live there – a rather turbulent history. The reason for this may be because Charles the Fifth was born there! Whatever the reason, my overriding desire is to continue dialogue with the anti-globalisation protesters. I think it is true to say that the term ‘anti-globalisation’ is, in fact, inaccurate. We must take a different approach – not towards blind globalisation or anti-globalisation, but rather towards a well-defined globalisation. This is a different kind of globalisation; it is an ethical globalisation. Madam President, I am organising a debate on this subject at the University of Ghent on 30 October 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the next European Council will meet in exactly 50 days. Ghent was an informal Council in the true sense of the word, which will certainly help us to make great progress in Laeken, in other words, to develop a common policy on asylum, immigration and justice, to declare operational the common foreign and security policy, to move closer towards enlargement and – which I think the most important thing – to adopt an ambitious declaration on the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission will follow the consolidation of the reconciliation process in Northern Ireland closely, not least through our Peace programme.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Following the attacks on 11 September against the United States – our longstanding allies – the European Union has publicly committed itself to doing all it can to help bring the perpetrators, organisers and sponsors of these acts to justice, and to holding accountable those hiding, supporting or harbouring them. We thus pledged our complete solidarity with the government and people of the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the days that followed, I was very pleased to see this declaration of solidarity translated into swift, concerted action at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Patten, the Belgian foreign minister, Mr Michel, and Mr Solana went first to Washington and then on to Pakistan, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria to help build a global alliance against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">European authorities began rapidly stepping up intelligence and police cooperation, both within the EU and with third countries, especially the US.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of emergency legislation agreed at Community level, the European Union froze over EUR 100 million of assets of people suspected of terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">It drew up uniform, Union-wide standards to improve security for air travellers. It tabled proposals for a common definition of terrorism, for a system of EU-wide penalties for terrorist offences and for a European arrest warrant. These proposals were firmly supported by the European Council at its extraordinary meeting on 21 September.</p>
<p class="contents">On that occasion, the Council called upon each European Union country to ‘contribute according to its means’ to the new global campaign against terrorism, and this is, indeed, what has been happening, with some countries mobilising or offering troops and others providing intelligence or making available air bases.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the importance and success of this joint action, the fact is that media attention has largely been focused on what individual countries have been doing. This has somewhat obscured and tainted the ongoing debate on the specific role Europe as a whole should be playing on the international stage. That is precisely the issue I want to focus on today.</p>
<p class="contents">From the very start of my term of office, one of my Commission’s objectives has been to consolidate Europe’s influence in the world. This has become even more urgent in the light of the new world situation.</p>
<p class="contents">If the European Union is to be a leading actor on the world stage, it must speak with a single, clear, dynamic voice and it must support its words with unified action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union has made progress in this direction, it cannot be denied. You only have to compare, for example, the disparate attitudes of our Member States to the Gulf War, a decade ago, with our recent united stance on the situation in the FYROM and our present coherent response to terrorism. I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Belgian Presidency for the excellent work it has done to promote this process and for the courageous and intelligent way in which it has maintained support for the Union’s common, shared goals.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we are still a very long way from achieving the genuinely common foreign and security policy we so badly need. I am therefore very glad that, in the Union’s declaration of 14 September, we publicly committed ourselves to developing our common foreign and security policy and to ensuring that the Union really can speak out clearly and with one voice.</p>
<p class="contents">A common policy is not, of course, the same thing as a single policy uniformly adopted by every Member State. No, a common policy pools the different strengths of the individual countries, enabling them to pursue shared goals using shared instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Has Europe been ‘absent’, as some people allege? My answer is ‘No’ although we need to make a certain distinction here. Europe is taking very specific, effective action in those fields where integration is a possibility or a practical reality. This is not at all surprising, since the Community method has, for the last fifty years, ensured that Europe can act effectively, rapidly and visibly in all the fields in which this is possible.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in areas where Europe is less integrated, where the Community method is virtually or wholly absent, that the European Union seriously lacks effectiveness. This hard fact should make us even more resolute in our preparations for the major future political developments in the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">A common policy ensures that the different national policies are co-ordinated within a Community framework according to the Community method so that they serve the interests of the Union as a whole. In the field of the common foreign and security policy we have not yet reached that point because the necessary consensus has not yet been achieved. We are in a transition period, so to speak. However, that must be our objective. We must lose no time in establishing a policy that builds on our experience of Community action and makes full use of the tools available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Our first priority must be to be united in our action. In my view, individual action taken by only a few countries is in the interests neither of the Union as a whole nor of its individual Member States, be they large or small. At Ghent, I noted that no Member State wants to move in that direction, but the Commission will remain vigilant, on behalf of us all.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we need specific institutional mechanisms for taking policy decisions. That is the kind of common foreign and security policy we must develop, building on the progress we have already made, and we need to develop it fast if we are to make any useful impact on the world now emerging after the tragedy of September 11.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to note that Parliament's Committee on Constitutional Affairs has discussed at length and with great care the implications of the common foreign and security policy for the functioning of the institutions and, in particular, of the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the proposals put forward in the Poos report and I commend Mr Poos for his achievements in addressing these so very delicate and sensitive issues. I call upon this House to endorse them fully today and upon the Council to undertake to implement them as soon as possible. The Commission is ready to play its full part in this necessary process.</p>
<p class="contents">The statements issued on 14 September have important implications for the Union’s foreign policy priorities.<span class="bold"> </span>In the short to medium term, we must focus even more on our dialogue with the Arab and Islamic worlds, on the Middle East peace process, for the Middle East is at the centre of the current world events, and on exploiting the full potential of the Barcelona process – and this is where our task lies.</p>
<p class="contents">The time has come to make new moves in our Mediterranean policy. The results we have achieved so far have not been altogether satisfactory, though this has not always – or rather has often not – been our fault. We must now take full advantage of all the opportunities open to us to ensure genuine progress. The Euro-Mediterranean region must aim at genuine economic integration and at setting up institutional mechanisms for taking common decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also widely expected to play a new role in the Middle East. We must take practical, joint action to respond to this challenge which, although tough, is within our capabilities.</p>
<p class="contents">Further afield, we need to review our policies on trade and co-operation with Pakistan, India and Iran as well as with Saudi Arabia and the Gulf States. Tangible progress has been made with regard to Pakistan in recent days.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe we should be ready to respond to the renewed signs of interest in joint action on shared goals – such as the fight against AIDS – coming from countries like Libya. This is a completely new development. Once again, Europe is in an excellent position to respond to these political signals and to help such countries join our alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to work energetically to develop a consistent, active policy in relations between the Union and all its neighbours. Partnerships with specific goals, institutions and resources, particularly in our relations with Russia and the Ukraine. Partnerships that will ensure lasting stability in our continent. This time of change is also the right time to boost these policies.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, world wide, we have to build fresh confidence, and one key way we can do so in the immediate future is to successfully launch a new round of world trade talks.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we must work harder to offer the world’s poorest regions a genuine chance of sustainable development. I have said it before, and I will say it again: we must guide the process of globalisation so that it works for the good of all, poor as well as rich.</p>
<p class="contents">We Europeans must be proud of the policies we have been pursuing as we prepare for enlargement, for they are the only democratic globalisation policies thus far developed in the world, and I would stress that: the European Union project is the only democratic globalisation process in existence.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore have to tackle, energetically, boldly and imaginatively, the global issues that breed resentment and discontent such as poverty, widening gaps in income and the now intolerable economic and social imbalances.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the things that sow frustration and tension in relations between the developing world and the West. The anti-terrorism alliance must advance hand in hand with a development alliance, with the Union leading by example.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the Extraordinary European Council Meeting of 21 September asked the Commission to analyse the economic impact of the terrorist attacks. We did so immediately, and the Commission presented its report to the Ghent European Council.</p>
<p class="contents">The European economy was clearly slowing down even before 11 September. The immediate consequence of the terrorist attacks was a further loss of consumer confidence and a widespread sense of uncertainty.</p>
<p class="contents">However, there are several positive factors to bear in mind, factors that enable us to face the current shock much more calmly than in similar circumstances in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the fundamental aspects of our economy. The European economy, unlike that of the United States, is free of trade imbalances and Europeans still have a very strong tendency to save. Moreover, unlike in previous crises, the Union has been largely protected from possible shockwaves of devaluations and counter-devaluations of currencies by the existence of a solid, reliable single currency, the euro. Just think what would have happened if we had not had the euro! The events of recent weeks should make us even more proud of the quantum leap forward that the euro has allowed us to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, our programme. We are undertaking structural reforms, following a strategy carefully defined at Lisbon. The reforms are far from complete, but the present crisis should strengthen our political resolve to see them through. I therefore call upon this House and the Council to stop hesitating and to speed up the approval of all the decisions taken at and after Lisbon to make the European economy more efficient.</p>
<p class="contents">Only if we meet the Lisbon objectives and targets will we be able to minimise the extent and duration of unemployment and maximise growth potential in the medium and long term.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, our instruments. We have achieved significant control of taxes that will still give us some room for manoeuvre during the slowdown. However, the problem of coordinating our economic policies arises at this stage in all its severity, and it arises because, in this sector too, we continue to have difficulty in applying the Community method.</p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of this, I conveyed to the European Council two messages. Firstly, the information currently available shows that our economy is genuinely resilient. If not an optimistic message, this at least gives no cause for concern. Secondly, however, we need to continue to monitor economic trends closely, not only in the Union and the euro zone but also worldwide. If the situation changes we must be ready to act using the instruments available to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Once again, let me stress the importance of co-ordinated action. With the current degree of integration, all action must be properly co-ordinated at Eurozone and European Union level. In the present uncertain situation, we must show that we are acting in a co-ordinated manner and that we have the will to use all the available instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, Prime Minister, ladies and gentlemen, this is a time for the greatest possible unity, determination and resolution. We must ensure that lasting hope comes out of the evil of 11 September.</p>
<p class="contents">Our peoples’ reactions to the recent events show that Europe needs to be more, not less present. If Europe is to fully live up to its pledge of solidarity – solidarity with the United States but also the safeguarding of global solidarity – the Member States of the European Union must genuinely act as one Community. The Commission will continue to work tirelessly to achieve this.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poettering (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, our group supports the Ghent statement on terrorism, but, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we also say that words must now be backed up by deeds. It is not acceptable that this is the second time that the Heads of State and Government have made recommendations which are then not promptly put into effect by the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice. We call upon the Ministers of the Interior and of Justice to act with speed. We also say, above all, that cooperation merely between States cannot continue as at present. Important issues of home affairs and justice policy must also be dealt with on the basis of Community law, and the Commission must have a central role in observing the situation and implementing Community law. Continuity is not achieved by the Presidency of the Council rotating every six months. Continuity must also be ensured by the European Commission and the European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I ask you also, in your capacity as Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium, to resolve the issue of the security of the European institutions, including the European Parliament in Brussels, with a solution that will be satisfactory both in principle and in practice.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We have to make Europe's voice heard more. It was surely right for prominent individuals from the European Union to go to visit the American President, but I find it no longer acceptable that, for example, the situation arises where the American Secretary of State appears before the television cameras with three prominent Europeans alongside him. We will have to learn lessons for the future from this; a crisis is always also an opportunity. We need one European face to represent us to the world!</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We now have a coalition against terrorism. Our group supports it unreservedly. We now, though, also need a coalition to rebuild Afghanistan. I welcome the position you have taken on this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council. Afghanistan has been suffering for twenty years. We must make an effort as a Community, also at an international level, to give Afghanistan a good future.</p>
<p class="contents">You and the President of the Commission have spoken rightly about the Middle East. Our group rejects the deliberate killing of people, be it in Palestine or in Israel. We call on the parties involved to at last give a signal for peace. We want there to be cooperation, we want there to be a Palestinian state and we want Israel to be able to live within recognised and secure borders. We urge all those involved to take a step away from the policy of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth and towards one of cooperation, peace and mutual understanding.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">We see the Mediterranean dialogue as an important challenge. It is for that reason that we have proposed the Euro-Mediterranean Meeting in Brussels on 8 November. I wish to thank Mrs Fontaine for promptly implementing our joint decision in the Conference of Presidents. We hope that this will send a message about cooperation with the Arab and Islamic world.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, we are in broad agreement with you as regards Laeken, but please ensure that the Convention does not only have the task of enumerating options. Its task will be, rather, to present a majority proposal. There may of course also be a minority vote. This must not lead to negotiations without binding effect. That is not what we expect of the Convention, but rather a proposal which can then go to the Heads of State and Government for discussion. We also expect this Convention not to have too large a bureau. It is crucial that five persons should be represented in it: the chairman/chairwoman and the representatives of the four institutions involved. This body must exercise real leadership, taking the Convention into a better future. We would like to see this Convention's work timetabled in such a way that it can conclude a Treaty in 2003 under the Italian Presidency, a Treaty that we hope will lead to the fundamental treaty of which you have spoken.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me make another observation, a very practical one. In Ghent, you discussed transfers between bank accounts in different countries of the European Union, a question which one might think not to be so important. Our Parliament, though, has put forward a proposal by means of Mrs Peijs' report. We have made clear that the high costs incurred in bank transfers are not acceptable. I think that the Heads of State and Government have done the right thing in taking this issue on board.</p>
<p class="contents">Please permit me one final observation: there has been a certain amount of friction between the Presidency of the Council and the Commission, which is very regrettable in view of the Presidency of the Council being held by Belgium. At issue was our common presentation of ourselves to the public – who said what, and when. There was a certain annoyance because three Member States had met together. I want neither to play that up nor to ignore it. I would, though, like to point out to all the European institutions that our Europe is so complicated that it must not be a Europe of vanities or a Europe of dominance, but all the institutions must meet each other halfway. It is important that we understand each other and work together, for our common European future is at stake.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the crisis in which the world currently finds itself will bring the European institutions together and lead them to common action for Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, following the European Council in Ghent, my group feels both hope and concern. Hope, because in Northern Ireland arms are being entombed in concrete, and concern, because we are facing a long fight against global terrorism, which we must pursue with conviction, perseverance and courage.</p>
<p class="contents">This fight is not limited to what appears in the television pictures, whether they be from Al Jazeera or from CNN. We must deal with the response measures authorised by the United Nations, but we must also make a significant effort in the humanitarian field and in terms of reconstruction and stabilisation, both in Afghanistan and in many other parts of the world. The European Union can play an important role in this context.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to what the President-in-Office of the Council said about the Ghent meeting, I would like to point out that in Helsinki the European Council decided to create a rapid intervention force which is still not operational. The prior meeting of certain Member States was inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe – and I address this to both the President-in-Office of the Council and the President of the Commission – that we must show unity at all times and it is highly significant that, after a European Council, the President of the Commission should appear shoulder to shoulder with the President-in-Office of the Council to announce the decisions adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the relationship between the European Council and the specific Councils, I would point out that the European Parliament is making an effort to speed up the negotiation of the measures you have proposed, but this is not being treated in a corresponding fashion by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would recommend that, before the meeting of the European Council in Laeken, you read in detail the report by my group colleague, Mr Poos, who is the person with the most historical experience of the Council. It may help you to present interesting proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to our relations with the Islamic countries and the Arab world, we believe that the forum we are going to relaunch at the beginning of November may be positive. My political family is also trying to re-establish links and the new tour of the Middle East which you have announced is very important, with an active approach by the Union to the resolution of this absolutely key conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the economy, please allow me to make a brief point: inflation is decreasing, there are margins, but the European Union’s policy must be active and anti-cyclic, and we still have a Central Bank which takes decisions and a Council which makes recommendations. The Union needs economic leadership. And since you have said that you are going to the University of Ghent for a debate on globalisation, I would also ask you to take the European Parliament’s report on the reform of the international financial system. With regard to the Tobin tax, your political friends have voted against what was proposed in ECOFIN and what my group presented as an amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the future of Europe, I would like to point out that the Convention is not a war of opposing positions, but must be a joint effort. We are making progress and you are gradually retracting, and that is not good. I am grateful that the Chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the rapporteurs have been convened. On behalf of my group, I can tell you that we have two concerns: one, that there should be balanced representation between European parliamentarians and those of the Member States, both in the Convention and in the Presidency; secondly, that the Convention should make a difference and not just be a talking shop or a debating club, and should make coherent proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, the proposals should lead to a decision by the Intergovernmental Conference before the 2004 elections in order to honour our commitments in the field of enlargement. And in relation to enlargement, I must say, Mr President-in-Office of the Council – and here there have also been some interpretation problems – that the final exam will be taken at the end of 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that you were in Poland yesterday. I was there on Saturday and I would like to say that I am surprised that the conservatives of the Union are beginning to say that Poland is becoming a problem because a party of the Left has won. Poland was a much bigger problem before, because it did not have a solvent government and I believe that, although there always has to be a degree of political competition, we must support Poland, which now has a strong government with a clear desire to take part in the future of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cox (ELDR).</span></span>   – Madam President, I should like to begin – as other colleagues have done today – with a reference to the milestone event in Northern Ireland. The verified decommissioning of IRA weapons has been a necessary and required act for a considerable period of time. It was long overdue, but now that it has happened, it is hugely welcome. Particularly since 11 September it has been increasingly inevitable that such an act should take place. I hope it represents a new dawn, a rebirth, a renaissance for the peace process in Northern Ireland and that all the political actors will now seize this moment to ground and root the peace in the institutions of that agreement. I add my voice to those who have asked all the institutions today, in the clearest terms, to welcome what has happened on behalf of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to say to Prime Minister Verhofstadt, with regard to the Ghent Council, that my group totally supports the clearest and most unequivocal assurances you have given of total solidarity with the United States. That is an important act of solidarity, and an important point of departure. I reiterate, for my group, that we totally support this. If I do not dwell on this, it is simply because there are one or two questions I should like to raise with you, Mr President-in-Office.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, we have had rather a long debate about the potential humanitarian crisis. Clearly for areas within control of the Taliban, we cannot blame the world community for Taliban unwillingness to engage with the United Nations, NGOs and others. But I would like to know what specific initiatives we, as the European Union, with our commitment of resources in this area, are now taking to urge Pakistan to open more space for refugees. I appreciate the enormous difficulties. I appreciate they already have two million or more Afghanis within their territory, but can we not, with our financial and organisational capacity, reassure those authorities that if the borders are opened to cope with this crisis they will not be left alone or have to pick up the tab on their own?</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn to the question of the role of the Council of Ministers in following up on the action plan to fight terrorism. In particular, I note the strategic leadership which you offered through the Council at the extraordinary meeting on 21 September. There you made a clear plea to the institutions to seize that moment and act. Here I congratulate the Commission for taking the European Council at its word and bringing forward with extraordinary speed a comprehensive measure to freeze the assets of terrorist organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you in this Parliament that within 24 hours of receiving that, and with the proviso that we should review it in the lifetime of this Parliament, we too seized the moment. That had no precedent ever in European law making. It was with some regret then that one noticed that, if there was a delay, it was among your ‘line managers’ from the European Council down to the Council of Ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a number of questions: What is the Council doing on the freezing of assets? But I have an important question around it. Can you explain to me, Prime Minister, what does this mean about the quality of governance in the European Union? After all, the Council is there to give a strategic lead. You gave it, the Commission followed; this House followed. The question is: Why did the Council of Ministers not follow with the same alacrity?</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to pose one other question in relation to the Convention. The Prime Minister has explained to us that the candidate states will participate. I very much welcome that. I ask the Prime Minister to clarify, in the light of the agreement at Helsinki, that all candidate countries will be treated on an equal basis. Does that invitation extend to Turkey? It is important that Turkey should be included, based on the principles clarified at Helsinki. I know it is not a negotiating state, but Helsinki established a clear principle of equality of treatment for candidate states.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise: What will we do with Pakistan and humanitarian aid? What does the example of the freezing of assets tell us about the rather dysfunctional quality of governance? Will Turkey be a participant in the process?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am glad to see that the President of the Commission and the President-in-Office, today at least, are sharing a platform in the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the grounds for satisfaction is always the number of well-intentioned declarations, and one of the grounds for disappointment is usually the way these are implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall restrict my comments to the chapter on the follow-up to the 11 September attacks and the fight against terrorism and I would like to give my views on this on behalf of my group. We welcome the statement that humanitarian aid for Afghanistan and neighbouring countries is an absolute priority, but unfortunately, we do not welcome the specific actions taken.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to take specific action and provide vital and essential food aid to the civilian population at risk, we must respond to the appeals by numerous key figures and NGOs and suspend the bombings. We have had enough indications and warnings, spelling out that a humanitarian catastrophe is imminent, as winter in Afghanistan is approaching, which is usually extremely harsh.</p>
<p class="contents">We now know that the civilian population is paying a high price for the war, and the Council, in declaring its staunchest support for the military operations, is turning a blind eye to this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The pre-summit meeting between the Heads of State and Government in Ghent, other than the fact that, to my mind, it is a failure compared to the real summit, demonstrated that the Heads of State and Government give military cooperation with the United States priority over a concerted political approach at European Union level. It also relegates the humanitarian, diplomatic and all other types of initiatives to the background.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the commitment to fight against terrorism and to protect the population against these acts of terrorism, it goes without saying that the commitment made by the Council is to be welcomed, but an unambiguous definition of terrorism is clearly needed as far as legislative initiatives are concerned in order to avoid any confusion and the criminalisation of any anti-establishment behaviour or activities, which are, however, political in nature and legitimate nonetheless.</p>
<p class="contents">Our group has a number of concerns regarding the declaration in which the European Union states that it is willing to undertake reciprocal initiatives with the United States, particularly to facilitate judicial assistance and extradition. Regarding extradition, we are aware that the death penalty is still in force in the United States and therefore this poses a huge problem for the European Union. Regarding judicial assistance, we are concerned about ensuring that civil liberties are protected and that personal data protection is not diminished as a result of this cooperation with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the important chapters concerns the protection of the population, and we welcome the joint efforts made with regard to non-proliferation and export controls on weapons and chemical, bacteriological and nuclear substances capable of being used for terrorist purposes. Therefore, intensifying our joint efforts is a very positive move, but we may wonder why the important question of industrial activities has not been mentioned at all, particularly with regard to nuclear power stations and re-processing plants, where large quantities of radioactive and fissile substances are stored, which could cause an ecological and social catastrophe in the event of an aircraft crash, intentional or otherwise. The Council statement does not contain a single reference to this issue, and I think that this is a serious oversight.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Prodi, I think that it is true to say that we are particularly disappointed by the outcome of this Summit. I do not wish to have to relive this disappointment at the Laeken Summit, and I am pleased to note that Mr Verhofstadt is determined to give the European Union a new role and to open up genuine dialogue on a topic that has been slightly overworked in recent weeks, in other words, globalisation. I am pleased that he has changed the vocabulary he was using to refer to this matter, since he has rejected the term ‘anti-globalisation,’ which was essentially inappropriate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Wurtz (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Madam President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, President Prodi, the four weeks that passed between the Extraordinary European Council of 21 September and the Ghent Summit of 19 October were filled with events of strategic importance. In what ways did the Fifteen analyse these events?</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, the targeted response, for which the Member States had already declared their support the month before, has escalated into real war, causing wide-spread devastation, civilian casualties and distraught people heading for the borders. On numerous occasions, targets have been missed, with refugee centres, hospitals, residential areas and even Northern Alliance positions being mistakenly attacked.</p>
<p class="contents">The ultimate goal of these operations, which are being stepped up, is becoming increasingly blurred as each day goes by and their vague strategy is startling. There are growing protests…there is mounting criticism…the feeling of unease is spreading, including amongst fervent supporters and key allies of a consistent fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">What is our objective?</p>
<p class="contents">Do we sincerely believe that this is the way to win the necessary fight to close down these criminal networks and deprive them of their fertile breeding ground? How does the European Council view this development, that is worrying to say the least, particularly in the wake of the announcement that American soldiers will soon be deployed on Afghan territory, and even more so because both Ramadan and winter are almost upon us?</p>
<p class="contents">Well, the European Council – and I quote – ‘confirms its staunchest support for the military operations […] and […] notes that these targeted actions are in accordance with the conclusions of the Extraordinary European Council meeting on 21 September 2001.’</p>
<p class="contents">In some ways, therefore, there is nothing new in this statement…I am saddened and concerned by this attitude, as it almost puts Europe out of the running altogether, at a time when much is expected of Europe, of a political Europe, not of a military Europe, and of a Europe which, admittedly, has expressed solidarity with the United States in tracking down these terrorist networks, but failed, however, to provide unconditional support for the unilateral choices made by those in Washington.</p>
<p class="contents">In the weeks before the tragic events of 11 September, the European Union had, in fact, begun to play a role on the international stage, in the Middle East, in Macedonia, at the Durban conference on racism, and the EU knew how to make a mark on events. This was also true on the day after the attacks, when Europe supported the most realistic and responsible movement within the Bush Administration, helping to do away with the worrying concept of a crusade in order to set up a global coalition on an unprecedented scale.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, since military operations got underway, the European Union has been acting as if it were paralysed. The new global situation means proper intervention by Europe is more pressing than ever on some crucial issues that are at the heart of the current world crisis, and most importantly, on the Middle East question.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Verhofstadt briefly touched upon this point and Mr Prodi came back to the issue: the European Council statement rightly reiterates that the UN resolutions must be respected in order to find a lasting solution to this conflict; the US leaders themselves now seem to agree that Mr Sharon’s policy is feeding the spiral of violence and is a fundamental barrier to peace. Now then is the time for straight talking before things once again spiral out of control and thus give another chance to those who fish in troubled waters.</p>
<p class="contents">No one is better placed than Europe to give fresh hope to the forces of peace in the region. I believe that this should now be our overriding ambition. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Collins (UEN).</span></span>   – Madam President, Mr President-in-Office, President Prodi, firstly, I would like to express my very sincere thanks for the comments that have been made by colleagues here this morning and by you, Madam President and President Prodi on the good news from Ireland on the decommissioning of arms. I very much want to put on record once again the important part Parliament and the Commission played in helping the peace process at a time when this help was very much needed. We have had a dramatic breakthrough in the last 24 hours, but let nobody here take it for granted that the road to peace – a just and lasting peace – is going to be easy. Of course, the great majority of people on the island of Ireland are genuinely in search of this just and lasting peace, but, regrettably, a small minority will do their best to try and derail the process. We must all be on the watch for that.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much welcome the fact that the European Union leaders unequivocally stated their full support for the action that has been taken in the fight against terrorism in all its aspects and reaffirmed their solidarity with the American government. They have agreed that the fight against terrorism must continue within a United Nations framework. I believe that the United Nations has a very important and leading role to play in this regard. Present and future actions in the fight against international terrorism should and must emanate from the membership of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all concerned that civilian populations must be shielded from the attacks which are taking place in Afghanistan at this time and, in a war situation, there is nothing more sickening than one hearing commentators refer to civilian deaths as 'collateral damage'. We are dealing with lives here and human lives must always be protected. Humanitarian aid for the Afghan people must be a priority and such aid must cover the needs of the Afghan population and Afghan refugees, EU governments are fully committed to ensuring that such aid reaches these people in need. We want to ensure that this is done. Winter is due to start very shortly in Afghanistan, and these winters are exceptionally cold and difficult. I believe that the international community, including the European Union and the United Nations, must estimate the humanitarian needs of the Afghan people over the next few months and ensure that all the necessary humanitarian aid is delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also, remember that the war against terrorism is being fought on many different fronts. Within the Union, there must be formal adoption of the EU directive on money laundering. We must be able to confiscate the financial proceeds of terrorism so as to help cut off the money supply which is the financial oxygen for its evil operations. We can confiscate the financial proceeds of drug barons in Europe and we must be able to extend these powers of confiscation to other financial proceeds of crime.</p>
<p class="contents">There must be a speedy ratification by the Union's Member States of the United Nations Convention for the suppressing of the financing of terrorism. EU governments at Ghent supported the implementation of a common European arrest warrant, and our EU Justice Ministers are due to meet on 7 December 2001 to put in place the final terms governing the operation of this warrant. It is very important, in my view, that there is a clear definition of terrorist acts, as a national cannot and should not be extradited from one country in Europe to another unless the specified crime is a crime in his or her host Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we live in challenging and uncertain times and the political situation in the Middle East is very volatile. The present instability and violence cannot and must not continue indefinitely. I believe that the Israeli troops must withdraw from the territories of the Palestinian Authority. I would appeal to the Israeli and Palestinian authorities to do everything possible to negotiate a settlement based on the recommendations of the Mitchell report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The preliminary meeting between Great Britain, France and Germany suggests a model that is as far from the federalists’ vision, or illusion, of a democratic federal State as it is from the Eurosceptics’ more realistic desire for a Europe of democracies. Cooperation between the big three is engaged in on an intergovernmental basis, behind closed doors and without democratic control. In this way, the big three decide what the others are to think. For the small countries, intergovernmental cooperation between the big countries may come across as supranational dictates. The summits are also conducted behind closed doors and without democratic control. European integration is now modelled on the way in which private holding companies operate. A minority of the largest shareholders is able to make decisions on behalf of the majority. Cooperation can thus be intergovernmental and supranational at one and the same time and combine the defects of these arrangements with the maximum lack of openness, democracy and proximity to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">The summits must be transformed into well-prepared meetings in which small and large countries and all parliaments have an equal part to play in the preparations. Summits must be opened up to elected representatives so that representatives of the national parliaments are able to exercise democratic control by being present there. Summits should also be opened up to the press whenever prime ministers discuss legislation and other issues which, in our Member States, are dealt with openly. Mr Verhofstadt is still a young prime minister from a country that has traditionally opposed the big countries’ dictatorial way of thinking. Have nothing to do with this, Prime Minister! Invite elected representatives to the next summit in Laeken. Do not make a decision to begin a constitutional process without its first having been discussed with the electorate in our countries. Let the next treaty be formulated through the input of grassroots contributions instead of its coming like a thief in the night to limit our democracy. Make sure, too, that the 49% of the electorate that voted against Maastricht in France and the majority of the electorate who recently voted ‘no’ in Ireland and Denmark can feel they are properly represented in the forthcoming convention. Promise, above all, that the next treaty will be subject to referendums in all the countries. In that way, you will be obliged to design a treaty that can be adopted, that is to say, a treaty characterised by openness, democracy and proximity to the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We welcome the European government’s support of the United States institutions, although we hope that they will manage to continue to resist the anti-American, anti-capitalist and anti-imperialist instincts which are so powerful within the political groupings in Europe. However, we would criticise the delays in presenting a humanitarian aid plan and its lack of practical content in the face of a potential humanitarian disaster. On a more general note, it is not right to focus on the difficult nature of the European Union’s political role without addressing the issue of the democratic nature of the institutions themselves. We have talked about how important it is for the Fifteen to act in unity and with all speed and to assume a common position. In our opinion, unity between the Fifteen is valuable when it is achieved through public – and therefore accountable, democratic – debate. It is of much less value when it is reached in closed meetings held in secret meeting rooms which are inaccessible to democratic scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">An example of this is cooperation in justice and home affairs. We are all in favour of the European area of justice and police cooperation, but these are extremely sensitive areas which involve fundamental rights and freedoms and the 15 penal codes of our Member States. It is unacceptable for any democratic debate to be dispensed with, either in the national parliaments or the European Parliament, on issues relating to rights guaranteed by constitutions, in the name of the need for rapid action. That is the real obstacle: the real obstacle is the democratic nature of the European Union! We would make this clear, in particular, to Mr Schröder and Mr Chirac, who publicly lamented the lack of rapid action. Be careful: fundamental rights and freedoms are involved! The democratic nature of the institutions of the European Union is at stake. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What went wrong in Gothenburg and Genoa did not in Ghent. That is undoubtedly linked to the changes since 11 September, but also to the sound preparation, the sensible approach by the police and certainly also to the open dialogue that has led to a different atmosphere.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Verhofstadt has already underlined, the original intention of this informal summit was to prepare for the Laeken Declaration. The Fifteen defined the parameters and the timeframe for the convention. As the European Parliament, we should be able to recognise that this was a true <span class="italic">tour de force</span>. Six months ago, this would have been absolutely unthinkable.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive development is the fact that the Union has taken a unanimous and firm stand in the fight against terrorism, has emphatically confirmed its solidarity with the US, but at the same time, has highlighted its own political role. Strictly speaking, Ghent has thus fulfilled the expectations. But the way in which European unanimity was brought about has once again exposed the cracks in the European edifice.</p>
<p class="contents">Ghent has also painfully accentuated the fact that Nice’s two areas of tension, namely that between the large and small countries, and that between the intergovernmental and community approach, is still heavily mortgaging the European Union’s future. This applies first and foremost to the CFSP. The French President is right, strictly speaking, when he states that the European Union is not authorised to deal with military matters. However, the question is whether we are prepared at all to change this.</p>
<p class="contents">The three largest Member States should realise that they cannot continue to be only half-committed to the cause. This ambiguity cannot remain concealed behind fine sounding final declarations in which attempts are made to keep up appearances of European unanimity.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us hope that 11 September and the need to reform the institutions prior to enlargement will encourage Member State governments to look beyond their own national policies and return to the roots of the European Union, namely to promote peace and security in Europe and in the world by intense cooperation between the Fifteen, rather than just three, Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that this European Council was worthwhile, and was acting perfectly within its powers, in other words, in the role of providing guidance. I would like to make three points in relation to this. The first point concerns the issues that are called JHA in our jargon. These issues involve a great deal of intense and difficult work, and the Ministers for Home Affairs and Ministers for Justice of each of our Member States will not be able to make progress on these, unless they have before them bold proposals such as those that Commissioner Vitorino made, and unless they are constantly reminded of the political direction favoured by the European Council. These are difficult subjects, which require will and political determination in order to make progress. Thank you, Mr President, for giving these conclusions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the economic situation, I think that the European Council worked hard to point out where the room for discussion between the economic and monetary authorities must be. If we really want to put in place a policy to support growth, and this is, without doubt, necessary for the European Union, we need everyone to shoulder their responsibilities, to fully utilise the room for manoeuvre in the Stability and Growth Pact and in the monetary policy, to mobilise the European Investment Bank, so that we finally get across the idea that this is a major undertaking, even if it means going back to square one. This is also the direction that you described, in relation to the launch of the WTO negotiations. We must not, however, forget our responsibilities, the contribution we can make, for example, to a subject as important as that of cancelling the debts of developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The third area on which you gave some guidelines, and I would like to thank you for doing so, is that of cross-border payments. Mr President, I would like to draw your attention to the delicate issue of cheques. At a time when we are changing over to the euro, we know that these cheques are used primarily by vulnerable sectors of society. So, let us stop creating obstacles and let things take their course, as, for once, we are not in a great rush.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, Mr President, you stated that you hope the question of Europe’s position on the world stage will be discussed openly at Laeken. And Mr Prodi, you asked if Europe was absent from the world stage. No, Europe is not absent! Europe did everything it could do and everything it should have done. The only difficulty is that Europe is not always heard that is the problem. At Durban, we made ourselves heard, but when it comes to having a real influence on the political, diplomatic and military situation, we still lack the support from the European Union. We are expecting a great deal from the Convention in this respect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Ghent European Council showed that the Union enjoys both the capacity, and the will, to provide an increased sense of European security, solid in support of American self-defence, and sharing in the campaign to combat terrorism. This is a European Union increasingly active in its civilian role and far more present in the Middle East peace process. For us to succeed, we need to put aside our petty squabbles and the interinstitutional rivalries.</p>

<p class="contents">We were able to catch our breath in peace for a while. In fact, Ghent was a ghost town. When I protested there along with the so-called anti-globalists, Ghent had been totally stripped of its character of a bustling city. Nevertheless, I am pleased with your statement about the dialogue with the world of the anti-globalists, which is an incorrect way of saying that a growing number of people are concerned about the direction that the world is taking.</p>
<p class="contents">We want to move away from the privatisations and liberalisations which are plunging large parts of the world into <span class="italic">de facto</span> exclusion. What action will the Belgian Presidency be taking in order to reform the WTO, for example? We are looking forward to your efforts, for the introduction of the Tobin tax is a promise which I may have heard in Belgium, but of which I have seen little evidence on the international forum.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the spectacle involving the European institutions was not a pretty sight, and I am very disappointed about this. The Council was overshadowed by the triumvirate of the United Kingdom, France and Germany. Is that what other countries can expect from a Council? The Big Three running the show – is that the kind of Europe we want?</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is failing to get a grip on events and the frustration in that respect is culminating in a row about speaking times and the threat of an empty seat in Laeken. Does the President of the Commission fear that Laeken will be a failure? The European Parliament is still feeling marginalised, and I am uncertain as to whether a convention can have any real effect in this. Many people have witnessed the start of the war in Afghanistan, but we do not know where it will take us or how it will end.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing an economic crisis. We cannot afford failure at Laeken. Europe simply has to succeed, and the three large institutions must cooperate with that goal in mind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

You, Prime Minister, announced that the Laeken statement on this theme would not be a classic statement but an ambitious one that would acknowledge the EU's weaknesses and its citizens' fears and would clearly point out the way to be taken by the enlarged EU in the world of the future. I am convinced that the Belgian Presidency will do everything possible to bring about a resolution in December that really will live up to this high aspiration.</p>
<p class="contents">In my judgment, there is an absolute need for the following to be taken into account when calling a Convention to prepare the next Inter-Governmental Conference: First, the balanced proportional composition of the Convention with representatives of the national parliaments and of the European Parliament analogous with the Convention to draft the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, members of the national parliaments and representatives of the acceding countries’ governments must be involved to the full in the Convention's work and have at least observer status.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the composition of the Convention must ensure that the principle of political pluralism is guaranteed. Political debates need arguments on both sides which alone ensure that the debates come alive and are interesting, and only if the most diverse political forces from the Member States really work together can a politically sustainable result be achieved which will then enjoy popular support.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, there must be complete transparency in the Convention's work, both as regards the conduct of its debates and discussions and also public access to its documentation, which must be guaranteed by all means available.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, fifthly, a need for a purposeful and structured dialogue with civil society, and I hope that the Presidency's proposals in this regard will find support among the various governments.</p>

It was revealing in the sense that it, to a fault, confirms the objections on grounds of principle which we Eurosceptics and opponents of the EU have been entertaining. The very procedure is, of course, based upon its being the big countries that decide. A secret summit is held in which an agenda is set, effectively preventing the small countries from independently making known their opinions of the political decisions, and that naturally applies first and foremost to the decisions made in the light of the events of 11 September. Unconditional support is declared, a total acceptance of the United States’s arrangements. In that way, the objections and reservations that are undoubtedly entertained among the small countries and that find expression in growing opposition to the American strategy are successfully stifled.</p>
<p class="contents">The summit’s reference to resolution 1368 is absurd. As if it legitimised anything! We are concerned here with a war of aggression contrary to international law. That is something to which the United States’s allies should be alerting people. The resolution does not legitimise any intervention or any armed attack upon a foreign state. As for the crucial issue here, namely the interventions and follow-up provisions where policing and the law are concerned, we are being faced with a demand to implement the most far-reaching infringements of legal rights we have seen in the history of the EU, and they are to take place almost overnight without any preparation. I would thank the architects of the summit. It has been an eye-opener. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On this issue, I can only reiterate what I said on 3 October 2001 in this Chamber, when I called on the Council to give priority, from now on, to security, to review the former strategies that have become inappropriate, to recognise that the controls do not restrict freedom of movement, that they restrict criminals and protect the freedom of our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">At the time, I called for a review of the disastrous Article 62(1) of the Treaty establishing the European Community, introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which demands the systematic abolition of controls on third country nationals, when crossing the internal borders of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In response, Mr Michel told me that my ideas – and I quote ‘would lead straight to a society which restricts freedoms’. In my view, this unjustified accusation – which I naturally refute – illustrates the reservations and the obstacles we can encounter in our fight against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Fortunately, the Council appears to have overcome these obstacles, at least partly, since in the road map published by the last Justice and Home Affairs Council, there is a discreet proposal for the Council to study ‘arrangements for coordinated recourse […] to Article 2(2)’ of the Schengen Convention. So, ladies and gentlemen, what is Article 2(2) of the Schengen Convention? It is, as you may have guessed, the safeguard clause that my friends and I defended so staunchly, which will be so useful in the future and which enables internal border controls to be re-introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">Mentalities are now changing, so all is not lost. Obviously, we must differentiate between withdrawing freedoms and controls, particularly at borders, which, within the framework of our democratic values, seek to preserve our freedoms. This distinction is essential. I hope, and I want to believe, Mr President, that the Council understands this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The coalition against terrorism will not function properly if the central player, the United States, is surrounded by only fifteen satellites. Unfortunately, the European Union has in certain ways still not outgrown the satellite stage. That particularly applies to the second and third pillars, which are precisely pertinent when we consider international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">Wherever matters are regulated well at community level (the first pillar), things are much better. In other words: Europe is good at paying, but not good at making decisions. That was evident in Bosnia and is now again evident in the fight against international terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">The Union is often not very visible, and I am also delighted that Mr Verhofstadt has explained how seriously he has taken the irregularities that have taken place on this score in Ghent. That is why we are happy to encourage the Council to give Europe a clear profile in terms of foreign and security policy as soon as possible. Moreover, the willingness to make the necessary Community changes in terms of justice and internal affairs is also leaving something to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased to hear from the President-in-Office of the Council that there is wide agreement among the Heads of Government about the fact that measures must be taken. Reprehensible, however, are the improper objections which are being lodged by some Ministers for Justice, for example, the Minister in the Netherlands, about Europe’s interference in major issues at national political level, such as, in respect of, the policy of tolerance with regard to drugs, the policy on euthanasia and such like. That is not at issue at all. Mr Vitorino, too, has made it abundantly clear that he is closely monitoring subsidiarity on this score.</p>
<p class="contents">If the aim of the Ministers is to protect their own official or ministerial scope, then the public will not be served by that. I would therefore like to warmly congratulate the Council with its statement that our policy to the outside world, also in the framework of globalisation, must be ensconced in ethical, social and ecological standards and must take account of Third World interests. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have experienced the murder of Israel’s Minister for Tourism as a new low. Subsequently, Israel invaded the autonomous Palestinian regions, which was, of course, an unacceptable violation. We are all justified in asking for immediate withdrawal. At the same time, the spokesmen for Mr Sharon, on the one hand, and the Palestinian Authority, on the other, mete out relentless and draining rhetoric of black and white thinking. The others are 100% responsible, they are to blame for everything. The representative of Mr Sharon has almost stated that the tanks which enter the Palestinian regions are a kind of peace dove. Conversely, Hanan Ashrawi lays all the blame with Israel. Neither of them leave room for concern or take any steps towards bringing the conflict to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">It appears that, for the time being, there is no chance of returning to the Oslo Agreements or the Mitchell report which is before us. Needless to say, the neighbouring states play their part too. Countries such as Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi-Arabia are all very important players who have often used the Palestinian issue to their advantage to keep enemies out, but not to do anything of any consequence at home. There is now scope for Europe, the Commission and the Council, in tandem with the US, to take a very unusual new step and simply to combine our economic and diplomatic power, and our UN responsibility and military power and to say: we are tabling a firm, fresh peace proposal. For we as the world community, in the light of 11 September, can no longer afford to be dragged down in this continual downward spiral. As we are well placed in Europe, we can also use intense diplomacy to persuade the countries in the Middle East to take part in the peace accord. We have money. We have trade. We have the UN. We have resources in that region. We can be of real significance there. In this respect, my suggestion would be to adopt a reasonably hard-handed approach towards both parties, for we need to table such a proposal now.</p>
<p class="contents">That is my first plea. My second plea concerns Afghanistan. The Socialist Group gives the UN resolution, which is very clear, its 100% backing. The aim of the resolution is to trace both the perpetrators and the sponsors, as well as the countries harbouring them, and to bring them to justice, but also to ensure that we come out alive. The EU has no military presence in Afghanistan. That falls within the remit of other bodies: the UN and NATO. However, we are the body that has the diplomatic power to unite the surrounding countries in that region that play a key role, namely India, Pakistan and Iran, so that they, together with us and the US, give the different parties in Afghanistan plenty of room.</p>
<p class="contents">Afghanistan’s key problem is that we will not reach a solution with the Northern Alliance, nor with anyone else. History has taught us that. What we need is a conference, wherever that may be in the region, involving the different forces – and I particularly refer to the social forces, such as the women’s organisations – which, together, will shape a new broad government, in exile and only as a first step, if necessary. However, we must take that political direction. It is the only way to get rid of the Taliban. It is the only way to catch Bin Laden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do not, therefore, take any notice of people who say that a meeting of three of your colleagues immediately before the summit was a put-down. Such a meeting is, of course, never pleasant for a presidency, but it proves at the same time how desperately we need a European framework within which external security, conflict prevention, our diplomacy, but also our internal security, legal and police cooperation can be regulated. That is important for small Member States such as ours. However, it is apparently difficult for everyone to understand that if one considers the Union after 11 September, it is, in fact, only small EU Member States that have taken any individual action. You did not get sidetracked in Ghent. I would ask you to ensure that this convention – the mere fact that we now have an agreement on this is already quite an achievement for the presidency – is given the appropriate assignments in Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to say this about Afghanistan: humanitarian aid is only possible if the Taliban regime is removed from power and unfortunately, we need war for this.</p>

They know that Europe has a weak foreign and security policy, and at least two of these Member States believe that this is to be welcomed. And even if you cannot say it here and now, you also know full well that exactly the same disputes between those who are in favour of a political union and those who are against it, are raging over the Convention. I know that there is no definitive decision, but we understand what is being said.</p>
<p class="contents">The lessons learnt at Nice are likely to be of no value since the Council is being forced to choose from limited options without being able to come to an agreement on a strong proposal, on who will be part of the leadership, which makes a mockery of the parliamentary dimension and strengthens the intergovernmental dimension, or on a long period between the end of the Convention and the IGC. Unless we change our method, we are going nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">If the Convention is reduced to nothing more than a ‘talk show’ or a pre-IGC, 2004 is going to be a complete failure.

The same applies to European solidarity in the campaign against international terrorism. The next thing to do is to achieve a speedy halt to the fighting, above all to protect the population of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="contents">The world is still in shock from the attacks on New York and Washington. Two things strike me as being of particular importance, quite independently of the steps taken to date. The first is the complete explanation of the background to these crimes and the publication of the results. Without these, there is the risk that the attacks will give rise to legends which could poison many people's minds. This would represent an enduring victory for terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">What strikes me, secondly, is that the future reconstruction of Afghanistan presupposes, importantly, knowledge of the events in that country over the past twenty-five years. As we know relatively little about this period, I propose that this Parliament should set up a group to look into the region and comprehensively document the past three decades in that country. We could perhaps thereby take the first step towards a peaceful solution and a forward-looking outlook for Afghanistan. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When I see, for example, that the troika not only made a very successful contribution to the creation of the coalition against terror in the Middle East but is also responsible for this happening at all, this is important evidence for the truth of this.</p>
<p class="contents">So I regret all the more that individual Member States have an ever-increasing tendency towards bilateralism. For example, the troika was in Washington at the same time as the President of France, the German Foreign Minister, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain. I do not find that the right way to go about presenting a clear picture of the European Union as a whole. I also think that the meeting of the three Heads of Government in the run-up to the summit can only give rise to suspicions that we are moving towards an outcome managed from the top downwards.</p>
<p class="contents">All the European Union's Member States are basically equal. The European Union can only exist as it does now in so far as competencies reside in the supranational institutions and the smaller countries do not feel that they are controlled by the larger ones. We will get into serious difficulties if this principle is not accepted.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me raise another point. As the Chairman of my group has already observed, there is the danger that, in the realm of internal security, good decisions by the Council will be ground down in the mills of national bureaucracies. I would like to suggest that the Belgian Presidency, which has done such excellent work in the past few weeks, should take a look at the Treaty of Amsterdam and tell the Council that, if the Council of Ministers so decides, decisions on legal and home affairs policy may be reached by majority voting – a legal possibility provided for in the Treaty of Amsterdam – so that we can come to the necessary decisions at a European level and can meet the challenge of combating terrorism, a phenomenon that knows no frontiers.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office of the Council, please permit me one more observation and a request. I wish to put on the record my thanks to you that the Convention will be possible. If possible, though, Laeken should be founded on a procedure that offers the possibility of the Convention coming up with a unitary proposal. It must be a Convention which can serve as the basis for the consultation of Heads of State and Government. There is still a lot of concern about it, and I ask you to bear that in mind.</p>

The Convention’s decision is extremely important and mention must be made of the Belgian Presidency’s firm undertaking to achieve these results. However, in a world political and economic climate which is changing rapidly in the wake of the tragedy of 11 September, and in the face of the new demands from democratic States – primarily for terrorism to be combated, of course, but also for an area of peace and respect for human rights to be created in Asia and the Middle East and, moreover, for economic growth and employment to be boosted – we would like to make quite clear the need for a better coordinated European Union initiative which can speed up the institutional reforms, which are still far from completion, and thus empower the European Union to enter the field as a world political entity, an initiative which is able, that is, to speak with a single voice in Washington and Islamabad alike, as President Prodi advocated.</p>
<p class="contents">To give some concrete examples rather than limiting myself to describing vague needs, we would point out the urgency, in particular, for an incisive, coordinated action from the Commission and the High Representative laying the foundations for an – economic and social as well as political – agreement which will lead to the creation of a reunified, coherent, manageable State of Palestine while fully safeguarding the security of the State of Israel, together with an explicit international guarantee, as Mr Van den Berg said just now.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we would point out the urgent need for a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to reach long-term agreements with the oil-producing countries in the Middle East in order to secure the continuity of oil supplies and the stability of oil prices in Europe with a guarantee in euro. This would be a huge political boost to consolidation of peace in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we feel there should be a Commission and Eurogroup initiative to create the conditions for revitalising economic growth and employment in the Union, both by promoting forms of open coordination in the research and development and training sectors,<span class="bold"> </span>thus setting the Lisbon project in motion, and by transparently inviting the Central Bank to join this effort, using the room for manoeuvre for monetary policy rightly recommended at Ghent, and further reducing interest rates. After that, Mr President, everyone will be able to assume their responsibilities transparently, in full respect for the independence of the Central Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the rather modest compromise resolution drafted by an all-party group which, if I were a member of the forces serving currently in Afghanistan – and I think particularly of the British forces – would give me very scant comfort.</p>
<p class="contents">The other message comes from the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Verhofstadt, and deals with a rather more robust approach to the current operations in that area and also his more forward thinking approach towards the future of Afghanistan. Of course this House must have compromise resolutions and must, so far as possible, be united.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe must not act at the level of the lowest common denominator but accept that in politics, as in war, there must be room for leadership. Today, our resolution does not reflect the sort of leadership which is available for the people of Afghanistan through their exiled king. Our resolution does not reflect the fact that in Peshawar today there is an enormous meeting taking place of those seeking – including the moderate Taliban – the restoration of democracy in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe – as do many of my colleagues – that the king, whom I had the pleasure of meeting on 21 September and whom Mr Solana met only last weekend, does have a role in the future of Afghanistan. He introduced democracy to that country in 1964: free elections, a free media, universities, hospitals; he introduced women into politics. It is that hope of the restoration of democracy in Afghanistan and the ending of international terrorism which must be the focus of our attention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Mr President, justice is a key word on the European and international stages following 11 September. The creation of a European area of justice is the best contribution the Union could offer at this time. We are not talking about a European criminal code; that is not what we want. Neither are we talking about establishing emergency laws. We are talking about something more fundamental: mutual trust between Member States and between their legitimate judicial systems.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Cappato, I sincerely believe that the proposals which the Commissioner, Mr Vitorino, produced calmly and at the request of this House, and which are of the high quality we normally expect from the Commissioner, deserve our support and must be approved by the Justice and Home Affairs Council. In no way will they violate the freedom and rights of the citizens. On the contrary, they protect them, making justice more efficient and putting judicial cooperation in the hands of judges, and not of governments, within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">I am grateful for the information on the elimination of double incrimination, because – as the Chairman of my group, Mr Barón, said – this House feels that the effort we make to keep up with circumstances is not always reflected in the Council. We would also be grateful for more precise information on the debates in the Justice and Home Affairs Council and for broader involvement by Parliament. In this respect, given the speeding up of certain procedures, I wonder, Mr President, if this is not the moment to move cooperation in the criminal field to the first pillar.</p>
<p class="contents">I am slightly more sceptical about what has been said about progress on immigration and asylum in the Union. I believe that not even the greatest will in the world would allow a positive assessment of this issue at Laeken. There is just one proposal approved by the Council which may be of use today. Why do we not implement the measures laid down in that one measure adopted in the Directive on the temporary protection of displaced persons? It seems to me that the situation of the borders of Afghanistan and support for the refugees and the neighbouring countries, issues which the European Union has to deal with, provide us with a perfect opportunity to test this directive, to test the solidarity between the Member States in the European Refugee Fund and to implement what is laid down in it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Little has been achieved thus far and more needs to be done, and here I endorse what President Prodi said regarding the common foreign and security policy. In the fight against terrorism, a great deal has already been done. Europe has decided to take action but the political support and military support too from many of the States of the Union – Italy announced yesterday the amount of troops and resources it is making available for anti-terrorist actions – will not alone suffice: the crisis in the Middle East needs to be defused.</p>
<p class="contents">It may be that what has been termed the Marshall Plan for Palestine has not received enough attention – although it was certainly discussed at the Council. The population of Palestine has a <span class="italic">per capita</span> income of USD 800 per year, whereas the <span class="italic">per capita</span> income of the Israeli people is USD 18 000 per year. There is therefore a substantial difference and I feel that capital and enterprise investments are a way of ensuring lasting peace. The economic growth of the Palestinian people, who must have a State, will certainly contribute to calming a volatile situation. We will never win the war against terrorism if we do not first resolve the Middle East question. I feel that the course embarked upon by the Commission and the Council is the right one.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also concerned – as President Prodi himself said – by the economic crisis. I regret to say that the United States has had to invest USD 150 billion to revitalise the economy. Europe appears to be concerned but is not doing enough, in our opinion, to support the economy and enterprise: this is not a question of State aid, it is a question of enabling many firms to stay in business, of preventing redundancies, particularly in the airlines sector. In the case of Alitalia, there is talk of around 5000 redundancies but all the airlines have been affected. From this point of view, if we are to safeguard employment and make it possible for a large number of firms to stay in business and grow, I feel that Europe, the Council and the Commission must increase their efforts even more. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Monetary union is, after all, not only for large businesses but also for every citizen. I very much hope that this will be taken as a positive signal. I would like to underline again that the position taken by the Heads of State and Government with regard to the Commission's proposal on charges for trans-frontier money transfers is surely a step in the right direction. We, the European Parliament, will, no doubt, also take this step in the next plenary session.</p>
<p class="contents">The current situation as regards employment and the economy, that is, the state of the labour market, as well as consumer confidence, should surely be seen in a very critical light. I welcome the Commission's report to the Council on the appraisal of the economic consequences of the terrible events of 11 September. It is, I believe, important that we agree on a Community-wide approach. Not everywhere is there evidence of one. I believe that, in this situation, we must, now as in the past, stick with structural reforms and the advances they have achieved, particularly in the financial markets but also in the markets for goods and services and that we at the same time must not only underline the need for sound finances in the European Union and adherence to the Stability and Growth Pact, but should also make use of the flexibility for which this Pact provides, for we need more investments in the European Union. Now as before, the Lisbon way is the right one, relying as it does on growth that is supported by investment and creates jobs and, above all, on mutual support in economic, employment and social policy. Only when all the macro-economic actors have played their parts can our policy in the European Union be successful.</p>
<p class="contents">In these times of crisis we must hold fast to this, and the European Investment Bank, too, must be strengthened even more than previously in its task of helping public investments towards breakthroughs in the area of infrastructure. By this I mean trans-frontier infrastructure measures in the EU itself, but also such as will connect our European Union with the states of Central and Eastern Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr President, I am talking about terrorism in all its forms, because there is no legal or moral basis for distinguishing between forms of terrorism, just as there is no such thing as a good murder or a bad murder.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the action plan against terrorism, which the Belgian Presidency and the Commission are promoting vigorously, includes measures which we had argued for before 11 September. In fact we must remember that the proposals in this area presented by the Commission are not the result of improvisation, but they conform to a mandate received at the European Council in Tampere, whose implementation had suffered considerable delay, which was condemned by the European Parliament on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">We are still awaiting the final approval of the Regulation on the freezing of assets, incorporating, it is true, as the European Parliament argued for, a list of European terrorist organisations, taking into account the financial operative support and propaganda framework of the terrorists. I therefore believe that we must welcome the Council’s commitment to approve a package of measures at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 6 and 7 December. I am sure that the European Parliament will rise to the occasion and approve its consultative opinion before that.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I will end by saying that none of these instruments being provided to the judicial administration of the Member States imply the least restriction of the civil liberties of European citizens, but quite the opposite: they provide additional means for protecting the freedom which those who use terrorism to try to impose their ideas take away from the individual. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At a time when unity of action is vital, Europe is divided. I should like to make three observations.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Kingdom, Germany and France have lent their full support to the United States. In fact, the UK is even granting active military support. I welcome this. Other EU countries that are also members of NATO are providing more passive support. The EU countries that are not NATO members lend political support via diplomatic channels. These are three different kinds of support without any clear interrelation for the citizen. And then the EU President asked for an evaluation. So you, in fact, put a seed of doubt into our minds as to whether that support would last.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this backdrop, it is hardly surprising that the United States is seeking support from countries outside the European Union, including Canada, Australia and the Pacific Association. I would call for more coordination in Europe’s support for the actions against terrorism in the coming months, so that the image of division will soon be one of the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to comment on cooperation in the field of internal security. Commissioner Vitorino has tabled the proposals extremely promptly, and these include one about a European regulation against money laundering, one concerning arrest warrants and one harmonising penalties. In fact, those proposals had already partly been tabled.</p>
<p class="contents">Last week, the Council of Ministers for Internal Affairs failed to reach agreement. That was also the case for the European Council in Ghent. Why did the Heads of Government fail to make those executive decisions? Surely it is hardly justifiable vis-à-vis the citizens for the EU to be undecided about anti-terrorism measures at home.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the convention, which receives my support, because the Council has adopted the wish of the European Parliament and my group for a convention with a broad parliamentary basis. We are less happy about the proposal to ask the convention to supply options. That is the type of question you might ask a consultancy bureau, but not a parliamentary body. Let the convention determine its own working method and submit its own proposals. That worked for the Charter and, in my opinion, will work again now. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Under other circumstances, without the shadow cast by terrorism, this would be an occasion for looking optimistically towards Europe's future. We are, however, concerned with a situation in which we ask ourselves whether, with the euro, Europe's capacity for integration has already been exhausted.</p>
<p class="contents">A common currency, a common foreign policy and a common defence policy would give the EU that credibility in the eyes of its citizens and create that identification with it, whose absence we often regret. It has been, above all, in respect of foreign and security policy, that the Ghent Summit has brought us down to earth. Bilateralism, if you want to call it that, or undeclared intensified cooperation, laid bare the weaknesses that still handicap the European Union's effectiveness vis-à-vis the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Reviewing the international analyses following the Ghent meeting shows how the shock at the terrorist attacks on the USA has revealed the divisiveness within the European Union. It is not only a reaction to the behaviour of the USA, which prefers to deal and negotiate with governments direct, but also the consequence of the inherent military weakness of the European security and defence policy, in which there is a yawning gulf between ambition and reality. It is no secret that there are doubts as to whether the training of the European Rapid Reaction Force of 60 000 men is actually going to be completed by the 2003 deadline.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union needs an energy boost, not only to unite it more closely with its citizens but, above all, in order that it might fully meet its responsibilities within Europe itself and as a partner of the USA. The process of enlargement must be seen from this point of view, as must the post-Nice order, involving a Convention which should not be content to fritter away its time but, as the European Parliament has recommended, should work out a coherent basis for a decision on a constitutional treaty.</p>

Is the European Union perceived as being able to act in the context of efforts to deal with this international crisis, or is it not? To ask the question is to answer it in the negative, because the ones taking action are the Americans and, alongside them, partly the British and their allies, but not the European Union as such. Nor should the British allow themselves to be deceived. They too are only a small junior partner in the business and have nothing like the weight that Europeans could have if they acted together.</p>
<p class="contents">Only as a community will Europeans acquire capacity to act – they will not do it bilaterally, trilaterally or multilaterally. So it was a gross error for the ruling Big Three to set off before Ghent. Far from demonstrating European capacity to act, that is a trip down a one-way street, showing considerable lack of awareness of how Europe works. Those who have acted in this way had better take good note of that. We need capacity to act as a Community. So we need the European Rapid Reaction Force. Without such an instrument, Europeans will not be taken seriously in the world. That is why it is ridiculous for us still to be arguing about how this instrument should be financed. In this respect, the Community must prove its strength.</p>
<p class="contents">We also, however, need an instrument at home. We need the capacity to combat terrorism across national frontiers. Police work goes on in the Member States, but it must be clear to all that international terrorism can only be combated with any prospect of success by units that are in a position to operate without regard to national boundaries. Action as a Community is what Europe lacks, and it is on that that we must concentrate.</p>

I think that, except for two or three speeches, a predominantly positive evaluation has been made of the outcome of Ghent. Such a positive evaluation from the various groups encourages us, of course, to continue our hard work in the coming weeks, for we have another important summit coming up, namely the Summit of Laeken.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to respond, as follows, to a few oblique remarks that have been made about the cooperation between myself and Mr Romano Prodi: our cooperation is excellent. In fact, we have just decided to come to the next press conference on a tandem, so as to rule out any further misunderstandings. Since we both are accomplished cyclists, this will undoubtedly be appreciated by Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I should in any event like to react to three points. First of all, a few times, the question has been asked: so where exactly is the Union’s foreign policy now? I think that Mr Romano Prodi has already entered into more detail on this and has, actually, made very valid points. Last time we had an international crisis, the Gulf War, Europe had fifteen different opinions on the stance the Union should adopt. Each Member State had its own opinion on the matter. In today’s international crisis, we have, for the first time, displayed a united front on two occasions, on 21 September and last Friday in Ghent, in a matter which is, actually, very complex.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, to what does the stance of the fifteen Member States regarding the attacks in Washington and New York bear witness? A joint vision and a joint approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, what is the stance now after 7 October? After all, things changed on 7 October, since the reaction from the United States and the international coalition. Again, we have a joint stance.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important in my view to underline this, for there was a time in the European Union when this was different. Mr Romano Prodi reminded us that each time there was an international conflict, there was not one stance, but fifteen stances within the Council. Now this no longer holds true. However much I am of the personal view – which I share with many of you – that we should take things further still, for example that, certainly in the field of European defence, we should have made much more progress by now, I still believe that we should underline this positive development. At long last, little by little, piece by piece, a common foreign policy of the European Union is forming, something which, say fifteen years ago, was almost unthinkable.</p>
<p class="contents">From that point of view, I believe, in fact, that Mr Van den Berg is more than right in emphasising the role we are to play now. For our role is different from that of the United States. The EU’s role is mainly one of political, logistical support, and diplomatic action to be undertaken. He is right in highlighting the importance of the mandate which we have received from the Council with regard to the Middle East. We, that is, Mr Romano Prodi, Mr Javier Solana and myself, are considering a date when we could undertake this important mission. Possibly the third week of November. For I believe that it is up to the European Union, especially the European Union, to take an initiative in this respect. However, we must be realistic and not foster any illusions. We cannot solve matters with just one visit – there have been many already – but perhaps by gaining momentum in one particular area, this could ultimately lead to an initiative. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(FR)</span> The second point I would like to make relates to what several Members have said and particularly concerns Mr Poettering’s comments. Mr Poettering said that the Presidency was doing a good job. He mentions the work on the single European arrest and extradition warrant by the ministers of the specialised Councils, amongst others.</p>
<p class="contents">But when will this come about? It is obvious. This very specific task was given to the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers and they must finalise the practical details before 6 and 7 December 2001.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Poettering, I have already said – not today, not on 19 October but on 21 September – on behalf of the European Council, that the specialised ministers were given the task of finalising the details.</p>
<p class="contents">The only thing that I have done, with the help of the Commission and all the Member States of the European Union and the European Council, is to go further at the Ghent Council and to obtain approval of the principle of abolishing the double criminality system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(NL)</span> At the most recent Council, we at least managed to reach agreement on this, for that is the most important point. It is easy to proclaim that a European mandate must be obtained, also for extradition. The most important point had not yet been reached, namely an agreement on the principle of the abolition of dual criminality, not only for terrorist acts but also for other serious crimes. We must indeed challenge a reductionist attempt to render the provision only applicable to terrorist acts. That was not the conclusion reached in Tampere. The Tampere conclusions were in favour of broadening the scope, in other words for other, serious crimes to fall within its scope.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore personally optimistic with regard to 6 and 7 December. I am addressing Mr Poettering and also Mr Cox, in particular. But have no fear, if the Ministers for Internal Affairs and Justice fail to come up with the goods, then I will be taking the dossier to the European Council of Laeken on 15 December where the Heads of State and Government will decide. However, I am convinced that the Ministers for Justice will not let things get so far that ultimately, the Heads of Government will have to solve a technical problem which is predominantly concerned with modality.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I also should like to briefly comment on the third point, namely the Union’s future. I believe that we are all agreed that 11 September has shown that a more integrated, more progressive Union is needed, a Union with greater ability to act, which has better instruments at its disposal, and which – certainly as far as the foreign and defence policy is concerned – has greater powers. To pave the way for this is exactly the intention of the Laeken Declaration. Therefore, I can already give very concrete answers to the generally positive evaluation based on that convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The convention is a fact. Yes, Mr Poettering, the presidency is a limited presidency in line with the request of all groups, comprising five people including the president of the convention. Yes, the Member States and MEPs are proportionately represented, although exact numbers will need to be discussed in due course. Yes, civil society is involved, not by setting up a new body but by creating a network around the convention whereby groups in society can refer to the convention and whereby, conversely, the convention can also seek advice from European affairs study centres, trade unions, any other organisations which exist in our society, as well as civil society. A flexible network around the convention therefore seems preferable to the organisation of a special forum.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to respond to the most fundamental question which has been repeatedly raised here. Indeed, it is related to that text. If that text originates from that convention, how will the Council then relate to it? Will it be considered a report that can be dismissed and need not be taken into consideration? A discussion has therefore arisen as to the question of whether that is now a consensus text or a text providing options.</p>
<p class="contents">The answer is very simple. That will, at any rate, be my reply in a few weeks’ time when we are all meeting in Laeken. If everyone is agreed, then we will have a consensus text. In other words, it will then be quite clear that this is an important – if not the most important – contribution to the Intergovernmental Conference.</p>
<p class="contents">If no consensus is reached at the convention, then I obviously believe that options should be given, not in a neutral manner, but in such a way that the majority and minority options are clearly indicated, as well as the individual option of one member of the convention, if applicable.</p>
<p class="contents">It was also my intention to talk this over with the chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Napolitano, and the two draftsmen of opinion on the future of Europe. I cannot see the sense of unleashing a holy war among ourselves as to the exact significance of that text.</p>
<p class="contents">If consensus is reached, then we have a consensus text. If we cannot have a consensus text because we failed to reach consensus, options must be indicated, but not in a neutral manner, not in a way as if we were supplying a list without any significance. Instead, we should highlight the majority and minority options, in other words, the wishes and trends which originated at the convention and which have been brought forward.</p>

<p class="contents">I would just like to focus on a few issues which appear to have remained unresolved. Firstly, the issue has been raised, starting with Chairman Poettering, of the amount of aid granted to refugees. I would like to say that the immediate appropriation has been decided of EUR 315 million, but the problem is not now, at this time, I regret to say, financial, but the enormous practical difficulties of getting the aid to the people concerned. We are working through the NGOs and many other organisations. I would stress that, as things stand now, sufficient funds have been transferred in practical terms. When further funds are needed, then we will come back here to request them and discuss the matter together: the present problem is the difficulty of implementing these operations.</p>
<p class="contents">I will now turn to another debate, taken up by a number of speakers, including Mr Tajani and several others, who linked this major phenomenon of the world being divided into two parts to peace in Palestine. This is an issue of fundamental importance, in which regard I would point out to Mr Tajani and the other speakers that what has been termed the ‘reconstruction plan for Palestine’ is something which is very much on our minds: I have discussed it many times with Mr Peres and we are well aware that we should concentrate on taking action in certain sectors such as water, energy, infrastructure and revitalising industry. This is our duty and the Palestinian and Israeli citizens know that the Commission is focusing its efforts in that direction. As soon as the political conditions allow, we will be here, requesting the necessary resources. However, I believe that the knowledge that we are taking practical action and are all ready to work together is in itself conducive to peace.</p>
<p class="contents">Then, Prime Minister Verhofstadt spoke about the decisions adopted in the field of justice and the fight against financial crime. I agree with what he said, but we must be careful. We have adopted decisions here: if we do not implement them we will lose all credibility. Therefore, the ministers responsible must speed up the implementation of these decisions or else they will be taken again at the summit.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point related to the Convention. A general agreement has been adopted on the board, the executive structure and so forth. I would, however, like to focus on one point, touched upon by Prime Minister Verhofstadt, which is the duration of the Convention. Parliament and the Commission have guided and supported the Convention’s creation: they must support its work and they must support its conclusion, and so the work must reach its conclusion before the start of the electoral campaign for the European elections. This is a genuine deadline, not a theoretical one.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Many speakers have brought up the issue of the Community method in this debate. Well then, on this matter I would simply like to borrow a vivid picture painted by Mr Duff. He said: “When the two planes crashed into the World Trade Centre they demolished more than the twin towers. We also saw the destruction of the European Union's three pillars contrived at the Treaty of Maastricht.” This is, in my opinion, a correct, responsible, practical observation. Mr Duff has fully understood the political meaning of the Commission’s efforts to achieve unified Union action by applying the Community method, which is the only effective way of ensuring success.</p>
<p class="contents">A further point, mentioned by all the speakers, is the issue of the institutional reforms. The Commission and Parliament are working on the practical aspects of this matter: we have argued and helped each other, and I think we are making progress – painstaking progress – in our joint work. We have not yet finished but we are working, so to speak, on the bricks and mortar, on the concrete facts. At this point, although I do not wish to interfere with the internal organisation of the Council, I would point out that our reform will not be sufficiently effective if it is not accompanied by a reform of the Council’s working procedures.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">My intention in saying this is not to interfere in other people’s business but to stress the need for effectiveness. We need to bring all our work out into the open and achieve more transparency, accountability and democracy in our governance. The Commission has already addressed this point in its White Paper and we and Parliament expect to debate it with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the economy, everyone has stressed the difficulty of implementing the Lisbon decisions. However, this is an area in which there has been a vast difference between the general decisions taken and the implementation of the decisions in subsequent individual Councils, with regard to liberalisation and market reform, speeding up innovation, and projects ranging from the creation of the single air space to the establishing of the Community patent, areas in which we are still extremely behind schedule. Our economy will only become dynamic if we rectify these shortcomings.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly – and, in this respect, more great progress has been made – we have undertaken to support the introduction of the euro with the indispensable backup measures such as the single market in cross-border bank transfers. We have committed ourselves to this and it is an absolutely crucial point.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, one last point on the subject of the Convention. I will go back to Mrs Maij-Weggen’s comment on the actual definition of the Convention: we cannot consider it to be a consultative body, as some have described it. It cannot be a body which just gives advice and is then disbanded and no longer involved. We are making the Convention as transparent as possible but also giving it as much democratic authority as possible, and we therefore expect it to produce major, incisive results. I would add, moreover, that the presence of the Convention is a breath of fresh air amongst the closed doors of secretive diplomacy. The air of democracy is nourished by the oxygen of transparency and accountability, and the Commission therefore fully supports the commencement of the Convention’s work so that dialogue will, at last, be opened between the institutions and between the institutions and the European citizens.</p>
