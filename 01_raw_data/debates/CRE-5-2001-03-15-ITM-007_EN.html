If we consider that in South Africa 50% of new AIDS cases are young persons under the age of 25, that means that a 15 year-old in South Africa today has a 50% risk of infection, and if we consider the effects of that situation – that the most active section of the population is affected – on those young people and also on the country’s development, then I think it is long overdue that we say something on the subject and send a signal in the right direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We wish to encourage and create fair access to medicines and vaccines. We therefore greatly welcome Commissioner Lamy’s position and that he will give his backing to the developing countries and their right to a protection clause in the WTO and TRIPS Agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">We must press for these life-saving drugs to be made available as cheaply as possible. For Europe, this means supporting the transfer of technology and local production capacity. If we are serious about global development, these are important demands and important steps that must be taken by Europe and all concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this, preconditions, such as a sound local infrastructure and stability play a crucial role in the approach to health care. Drugs have an optimum effect if continuity in dispensing and expert supervision in treatment are guaranteed. Otherwise there is a real risk of incorrect or inadequate treatment. The combating of AIDS requires the structural improvement of local health care conditions and support from the World Health Organisation, and the work of the European Union directed to that end is therefore of the greatest importance. Only these factors will guarantee long-term development. In the short term many people are already dying, and for that reason a priority choice for affordable drugs now is advisable, as is rightly argued in the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution refers to a greatly impoverished Africa. The Caribbean region and South East Asia, where the problems are also considerable, must not be forgotten in this discussion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a fundamental problem and I am doubly delighted that the main groups in Parliament have agreed on a joint text which sends out a very strong message. The first message is directed at the pharmaceutical industries, calling on them to withdraw their case against South Africa, which is important, and the second message is that we want a clear interpretation within the framework of the TRIPS agreement on intellectual property, or even for the agreement to be revised. We must certainly welcome the fact that the European Commission, represented by Mr Lamy, has undertaken to pursue this course and I therefore subscribe to what the previous speakers have said.</p>
<p class="contents">One last figure to conclude: as far as AIDS is concerned, patented drugs cost about one hundred times more than generic drugs, which have the same effect but which are manufactured in countries where patents are not yet the norm. This applies to India in particular. This should make us seriously aware of the advantages of having a system to protect intellectual property in an area such as this, where it is vital for people to have access to medication. I think that this process will re-launch the debate, as will the interesting position to be taken by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A duty to revolt for the 34 million people with AIDS, most of whom – over 4 million sufferers – live in South Africa.</p>
<p class="contents">What could be more normal, in the face of a catastrophe which everyone agrees is a humanitarian, health, demographic, economic and social catastrophe, than to want to do everything to save one’s own people. Must we reiterate that, thanks to various treatments, we have considerably prolonged and improved the life of patients in the west, while in Africa and Brazil AIDS sufferers are dying because only 5% of them can obtain treatment due to the excessively high cost of drugs.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why South Africa passed a law in 1997 so that its sufferers could benefit from suitable care. I think it is irresponsible for the pharmaceutical industry to block this legislation. During this period, 400 000 South Africans have contracted AIDS.</p>
<p class="contents">In using the WTO to attack Brazil, which – by using its own treatment – has almost halved its AIDS epidemic, the United States have demonstrated an equally unfortunate cynicism. Not only should these proceedings be abandoned; more importantly, we should urgently help revise international trading rules so that they benefit human health. Mothers of families with no access to AZT are bringing babies into the world who already have AIDS and are condemned from the day they are born. Is that the humanitarianism and solidarity which inspires our resolutions? </p>
<p class="contents">I think, Mr President, that we need to retaliate against the indifference of the 34 pharmaceutical companies and affirm the principle of exemption for reasons of health. If this principle is not applied, we shall call on the Commission to suspend the investment aid granted to all the European companies until such time as they withdraw their complaint against South Africa. And then we should push for a World Solidarity Fund to be set up and cofinanced by the pharmaceutical industry. Because, faced with their indifference and given the huge profits which they make, we should force them to invest in research and invent a vaccination as a matter of absolute priority.</p>

A tragedy because the scale of the problem in South Africa, where millions of people suffer from AIDS, is almost impossible to grasp. South Africa is one of many countries contending with this problem. Ninety-five per cent of those infected with HIV live in developing countries. Africa has over 25 million AIDS patients, and South Africa 4 million. By 2010, life expectancy in Africa will fall by 20 years. In South Africa, half of all young people already run the risk of dying from this disease. It is a tragedy that all these countries have to cope with.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the dilemma of the pharmaceutical industry, which has meanwhile developed drugs that have reduced the number of deaths from AIDS in Europe and the US by 75%. But those drugs are so expensive – in Dutch terms, NLG 30 000 a year per patient – that they are out of reach and unaffordable for African AIDS patients. Hence it is understandable that these African countries should look for solutions, for instance imitation drugs and parallel imports. After all, the lives of millions of people are at stake. The price varies from NLG 30 000 to NLG 450.</p>
<p class="contents">In our view a court case is not the right way of solving problems. Solutions must be sought through discussion, as has happened meanwhile in Senegal, the Ivory Coast and Uganda, where five pharmaceutical companies are working with three governments on considerably cheaper drugs. For that matter, the pharmaceutical industry often exaggerates its costs: after all huge profits are also made in this sector, especially on cosmetics and on products like tranquillisers and vitamins. AIDS drugs constitute only a fraction of sales. We therefore advocate the dropping of the court cases in South Africa and the finding of an acceptable solution, and therefore ask the Commission to retract its previous letter to the South African government in which the case brought by the pharmaceutical industry is supported, and to do its utmost to ensure the application of the TRIPS scheme in the WTO. Europe must opt for solidarity with the AIDS patients and not for the rights of the strongest and wealthiest.</p>

You need funding for infrastructure, to test the patient, to diagnose and to monitor his progress. Then you have the access to medication. Of course price is important. The pharmaceutical companies have brought their prices down. But what is important, even if it is USD 10 for medication, do we have the will to fund the procurement? We are getting too emotional about this. Let us be sure that we have a strategy for funding the purchase. Governments in these poor countries do not have the funds, even if it is only USD 10 for treating a patient.</p>
<p class="contents">The good news is that the prices have come down and they can come down even further if we get the pharmaceutical companies on our side. The bad news is that we need the funding to be organised. I hope, as rapporteur, to devise a package that is deliverable and will benefit the poorest who are suffering, without being emotive, without recommending a solution that requires billions in funds, which I know will not be forthcoming.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corbey (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, AIDS is one of the gravest tragedies in the world. The fight against AIDS in Africa must therefore be given the highest priority. Essential drugs for AIDS and other serious diseases, such as malaria and tuberculosis, must be made available in developing countries free or at very low, and hence affordable, prices. For that reason I wholeheartedly support the resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, we must lend our urgent and unambiguous support to the South African government in its battle for cheap drugs. But we cannot combat AIDS with cheap medicines alone, I agree completely with the previous speaker on that point. Medical infrastructure is required, so that drugs can be dispensed in controlled conditions. Many more laboratories with competent staff must be set up. In addition, simple things like refrigerators are needed. But that is still not enough.</p>
<p class="contents">The social infrastructure must also be called upon: women’s organisations, trade unions, schools; we must involve these much more in the battle against life-threatening diseases. So a great deal of money is needed, and also a new initiative. I propose the setting up of a European partnership, financed with European and national funds made up of public and private contributions, a combination of research money and funds for development aid. The research money must be used for scientific research, the development aid money on the construction of social and medical infrastructure. This concerted effort will make it possible to take decisive steps forward.</p>
<p class="contents">This topic will remain on our agenda for some months to come. I look forward to broadly based cooperation in this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would first like to speak as a doctor and as a lecturer in the Faculty of Medicine, and point out that we embraced medicine and science not in order to make money but in order to save human lives through health. Secondly, I speak as a European, to say that Europe has a huge historical debt to Africa, as it is behind an age-old process that has impoverished the African continent. We must therefore help to solve the very serious problems that we triggered. Thirdly, I am a leftwing man, and from this point of view I would like to say that when the welfare and needs of the people come into conflict with the monopolistic interests of a small proportion of companies, the people should be defended and the interests of both need to be reconciled. I would also like to point out that the structural adjustment funds from the International Monetary Fund have helped to make the situation worse. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am basically referring to what my colleagues, Commissioners Nielson and Lamy, have already said at previous sessions.</p>
<p class="contents">For more than a year now the Commission has been strongly committed to addressing the urgent need for action on communicable diseases which have a dramatic effect on the lives of so many, in particular those most vulnerable living in the poorest countries or regions of the world. The Commission agreed one communication on HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis in the context of accelerated reaction in September last year and recently adopted the subsequent programme for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The new Community policy framework is being discussed in many international fora and also at national and regional level with the developing countries, civil society, industry, the European Parliament, Member States, UN agencies, the US government, G8 and many others. This process of consultation will continue for some time until the Commission formulates specific work plans with all the partners involved.</p>
<p class="contents">In these discussions the issue of affordability of key pharmaceuticals often takes the most prominent position. This may be at the cost of the urgent attention still needed for prevention, for strengthening the health systems in developing countries and for long-term solutions to the problems, which means the development of an AIDS or malaria vaccine.</p>
<p class="contents">In our new policy framework we tried to combine the different levels of intervention needs in terms of both prevention and care, and even cure in the cases of malaria and tuberculosis, and in terms of country, regional, international or global level.</p>
<p class="contents">Addressing the issue of affordability of medicines should never exclude the focus on prevention efforts, nor negatively affect the debate on research and development. All these areas are complementary and we will continue to address them in a complementary, comprehensive manner, not allowing one to be played off against the other.</p>
<p class="contents">We strongly support the international commitment to tier pricing as the most efficient way in the short term to increase affordability of medicines. The Community will support, through its technical and development assistance programmes, the reinforcement of pharmaceutical policies and global production capacities in developing countries as a medium-term means of increasing affordability.</p>
<p class="contents">We would insist on keeping the debate on a broader level, including targeted action in favour of those millions who suffer and die from malaria and tuberculosis, and who, like those infected by HIV or living with AIDS, simply cannot afford to pay for medicines.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, treatment for malaria and tuberculosis – however problematic – exists. It costs between USD 10 to 25 to treat a malaria patient and USD 11 to treat a patient suffering from tuberculosis. HIV/AIDS involves medicines which are priced way above the potential of the poorest and most vulnerable.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would urge Parliament not to lose sight of the need for the development of an AIDS and malaria vaccine. The crisis will continue to prevail and become even worse if prevention efforts are not sustained. It will take some time before vaccines are developed and available. However, we are on the right track and we urgently need to make progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
