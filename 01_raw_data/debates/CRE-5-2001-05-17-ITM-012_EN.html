This report has not had any amendments, and this is evidence of the solidarity we felt over the proposal. I hope the solutions proposed may find a broad consensus in Parliament in order to give greater strength to the arguments of all those in the Council and the Commission of the European Union that share them. A common area of justice will only make sense if, within it, the court decisions of one Member State are effective in all the other Member States. In concrete terms the intention is to allow the execution in one Member State of a final decision issued by the competent authority of another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Until today, the recognition of decisions among the various Member States has been achieved through the request mechanism, a slow, complicated process with an even more uncertain outcome. In addition to the obvious aim of legal certainty inherent in the rapid and effective implementation of the law throughout the territory of the Union, mutual recognition seeks to achieve not only the social rehabilitation of those sentenced, who are no longer uprooted from the country in which they have chosen to live, but also the protection of victims’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to set up a mutual recognition mechanism, two possible solutions could be put forward: either moving towards harmonisation of the legislative and judicial systems in the Member States, or basing the mechanism on mutual trust in the adequacy of the laws of individual states and the proper implementation of those laws in specific proceedings. We have opted for this latter solution, both because it is more feasible and because we are faced with legal systems which, although diverse, are based on a system of procedural rules that guarantee criminal decisions which are reliable and hence amenable to being enforced throughout the territory of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We are, however, aware that, at least in the short term, it will be difficult to reach an agreement on a procedure for automatic recognition, since no Member State will ever be willing to associate itself with recognition of any final decision that does not respect certain essential common guarantees. The question is, precisely, that of the identification of these essential guarantees, such as respect for the principle of <span class="italic">ne bis in idem</span>, or respect for the right to an effective and not simply a <span class="italic">pro forma</span> defence, or respect for victims’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It will also be necessary to have common rules on jurisdiction and competence in order, above all, to prevent duplicated proceedings, just as there must be common rules for the application of penalties for re-offending or for the accumulation of penalties. It will, however, be necessary to remove some obstacles that today prevent full recognition of final decisions in criminal matters, and among these obstacles are the requirement of dual criminality, which often allows the competent authority in the enforcing state to re-examine the decision issued by the authority of another Member State in both form and substance.</p>
<p class="contents">The dual criminality problem must be put into perspective since, in all Member States of the Union, the acts that arouse the greatest social condemnation are subject to criminal sanctions. There is still the option – favoured by many of us – not to apply mutual recognition to a limited number of crimes, such as euthanasia, on which it would be difficult to reach an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This report signals a first step towards the creation of the common area of justice, freedom and security. The course has been traced out; now we need to find the will and the political strength to press on to the end, elevating the guarantee system to the highest possible level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I am standing in today for Mr Wuermeling, who drafted the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs, in which he says that it is important to make progress in relation to the recognition of final decisions in criminal matters. However, he also warns against overhasty and hurried centralism and considers that the Commission needs to define exactly what this means. Most importantly, the Commission should work out precisely what disadvantages have arisen so far because this system has not yet been developed to the extent called for in the Commission communication.</p>
<p class="contents">We must admit that this is a very delicate subject. Because one thing we do not have in Europe is uniform criminal law. In my personal view, we never shall have uniform criminal law. That need not be a bad thing because even the United States of America, which are basically more centralistic than we imagine the European Union will ever be, even in the final stage of its development, have very different criminal laws. There are states which have the death penalty and there are other states which do not. In this respect, the EU is far more uniform. There is no place here for countries with the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">Even England and Scotland have very different criminal laws and legal traditions. This means that not only must we be very careful in furthering unification and harmonisation while respecting diversity, we must also be very careful in how we recognise final decisions in criminal matters. We talk a great deal about a European community of values. And what complicates matters still further is that this European community of values is in fact drifting apart. One specific recent example is the euthanasia legislation in the Netherlands, with which the Netherlands have taken leave of the European legal culture hitherto, as has Great Britain on the question of cloning. So we are drifting apart in fundamental areas which are also relevant to criminal law. This will make mutual recognition more and more difficult. This too is a question which has to do with the different systems of values and with the different legal cultures. So we welcome progress in this area, but are very sceptical and simply see the problem of our drifting apart here, which is why we urgently call on the Commission to proceed carefully here, give precise definitions and simply say exactly what the need for unification consists of or what the disadvantages of the present system are. Of course we know that there are considerable problems today. However, the cases which I have quoted – and I could also have cited drugs policy as an example – show that, as far as criminal law is concerned, the European legal systems are drifting apart rather than moving together on particularly sensitive issues subject to intense public debate.</p>
<p class="contents">This shows how important it is to continue our work on the area of freedom, security and justice, concentrating on the points which are really important to Europe and on the points where there is also real agreement between the Member States as regards standards in criminal law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is your report, rapporteur, but all of us, and of course the Group of the European People’s Party, see ourselves in it, which is why I want to highlight two major issues.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is that, if the European Union faces one challenge at the moment, if we really want to move from a market-centred Europe to a Europe of values and of citizens, that challenge is to build this area of justice. And if this is a big challenge, what can be more important, in this context, than for a rapporteur to take up the great tradition that has built Europe? This great tradition that has led to men and women from different origins, different political ideologies and different parties, placing this general vision, this European vision, this constructive vision, above their individual interests, and combining their efforts in pursuit of a goal.</p>
<p class="contents">We have before us one of those reports, and I think that this House should be proud to have produced a report which will be the point of reference over the months and years, for the work that awaits the institutions: the Commission, the Council and Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a report that, like all great reports, combines vision, realism and ambition. The rapporteur used the word ‘vision’, and I am going to do nothing more than repeat what he said, but this is the essence of the report: it firmly backs mutual recognition. Mutual recognition, which is also based on the principle underpinning the European Union, namely mutual trust between States, which is in turn based on the Member States providing an equivalent level of protection of human rights, and in which they are seen to share the same procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">Obviously, there are differences, and there are differences that need to be preserved; and that is where the rapporteur’s experience, realism and knowledge of the field come in.</p>
<p class="contents">I could quote many examples. I have personally learnt a great deal from his thoughts on the scope of dual indictment, which he very rightly extends to dual criminality, and I hope that this will be a subject for discussion in the work that follows.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the rapporteur mentioned the principle of <span class="italic">ne bis in idem</span> or double jeopardy and the solution that it offers to this considerable problem. I would also cite Paragraph 22, which refers to the need for common minimum standards for certain aspects of procedural law. As he said, we cannot expect them to be automatically recognised tomorrow without any controls or filters, but we need to move towards the recognition of some common minimum standards that will allow acceptance by means of a very rapid procedure. In other words, the rapporteur says ‘no’ to harmonisation, ‘yes’ to mutual trust and ‘yes’ to mutual recognition, but on some points there will have to be harmonisation, if not unification.</p>
<p class="contents">I could also quote the comment made by Mr Posselt, that in Europe some conduct needs to be kept outside this context of mutual recognition, because it is based on very different cultural roots, such as euthanasia for example.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that we have before us an important report. I am sure that it will receive overwhelming support in Parliament, and I hope that the two or three institutions take good note of this report, which without a shadow of a doubt, will be a milestone in this area in which we need to make progress.</p>

The excellent report by Mr Di Lello deals thoroughly with all the important aspects of a complex problem which, however, needs to be solved swiftly so that the European Union can become an area of freedom, security and justice. The problem of mutual recognition of final decisions in criminal matters arises of course from the irreducible – at least in the short term, and here I agree with Mr Posselt – diversity of the legal and judicial systems of the various countries in the European Union. It can therefore be solved only if on the one hand we start from precise, shared definitions of the notions of final decision and criminal matters, which can apply to all the various systems – thorough definitions that are fully satisfactory are given in both the Commission communication and the Di Lello Finuoli report – and on the other hand if mutual trust is created among the Member States regarding the adequacy of each other’s systems of laws and the correctness of their procedures. Now, this trust may be founded on the shared respect for fundamental rights, ensured by, amongst other things, the supervision by the European Court of Human Rights, which may be further guaranteed by common minimum standards that may be adopted on specific aspects of procedural law in matters of respect for the right to a defence or victims’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, to overcome the irreconcilable nature of certain ideas of principle as regards the punishability of controversial acts – the examples of euthanasia or abortion have been given here – one simply needs to exclude mutual recognition in relation to a few limited and exceptional criminal acts. In this way we can overcome the traditional requirement of dual criminality and avoid the slowness and difficulties of having to decide on recognition for every decision in every country, which, I can personally assure Mr Posselt, is a slow process that really hinders the proper application of penalties, as my former experience as a magistrate can testify.</p>
<p class="contents">Well, having thus properly set out the solution to the basic problem, the Di Lello Finuoli report then deals with technical and sensitive issues regarding the various ways of carrying out a sentence, the costs of carrying it out, and the system for calculating penalties in the event of multiple sentences, since they cannot always be simply added together when the crimes are connected, and suggests appropriate solutions, which can all be fully shared. I too therefore invite Parliament to approve this important and thoroughly well argued report without reservation.</p>

I understand the importance of the objective of the report, but am unwilling to join in the general rejoicing because I see a whole series of inconsistencies. This applies, for example, to the somewhat blurred use of the terms recognition, which has already been implemented in Europe to a considerable degree, and execution of final decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">The discussion of certain definitions appears to be random rather than systematic, as far as I can see. I fail to understand why, when there are several decisions which violate the <span class="italic">ne bis in idem </span>principle because they deal with the same fact, the decision that is most favourable to the offender should be applied.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fail to comprehend why the call for the dual criminality rule to be waived is, unfortunately, gaining ground. A criminal justice system which – hopefully – feels bound by the principle of legality, that is, the <span class="italic">nullum crimen sine lege </span>principle, cannot accept the consequences of deeds which are not punishable in its area of jurisdiction. Otherwise this principle would be broken and procedural convenience would take priority. And then it would be curtains for the rule of law! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As he knows, despite our political differences, we are pleased to point out the high quality of the work he has produced and the legal rigour of his proposals. In this debate, as in the one we had this morning, we are taking steps along the path traced out in Tampere to create the area of freedom, security and justice. In a Union where there is freedom of movement enjoyed by all the citizens, including those who act outside the law, it is important to prevent the possibility of there being penal countries. In relation to this legal framework on judicial decisions in criminal matters, the report deserves our applause and gives a very balanced view. Allow me to highlight the precision of the final judgment concept, the register of pending procedures, the idea that nobody can be judged twice for the same crime, but, on the other hand, the fact that a sentence in one Member State should be taken into consideration as a case of recidivism in another Member State, the solution in which the implementation of custodial penalties should be governed by the State that implements the sentence, whereas pardons, amnesties and declarations of the existence of the penalty or of the offence should derive from the law of the State which delivers the judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mutual recognition, ladies and gentlemen, is only effective if it can be achieved without great administrative obstacles. A degree of mutual trust is therefore required between Member States concerning their judicial procedures. We also know that the recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters is a matter of great sensitivity that raises delicate questions and reaches to the core of values protected by law in our various societies. There are differences between our Member States, despite their extremely substantial, noteworthy common cultural and legal heritage. We must therefore recommend that the Commission should be cautious in this matter and adopt a policy of taking small steps. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to start by offering Mr Di Lello Finuoli my warmest thanks for and expressly welcoming this remarkable report. As the European Council in Tampere stressed, the concept of the mutual recognition of decisions by the courts and judicial authorities is an important cornerstone in the area of freedom, security and justice which we hope to create in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The concept originates from the internal market. It is based on mutual trust in the various systems of the Member States and a number of common, underlying legal principles. Which is why it cannot be considered in isolation and must be complemented by other measures, such as greater harmonisation of substantive and procedural criminal law in the Member States, better mutual understanding and better training and further training.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tampere conclusions called on the Council and the Commission to present a programme by the end of last year. The most important contribution by the Commission was last summer's communication on the mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, in which we set out the Commission's approach to this section of the more comprehensive area of mutual recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">As this is a new and complicated issue, our communication does not aspire to find final, binding answers to the questions raised, it simply tries to point the way to possible solutions. What we tried to do was ask the right questions and offer possible options as to how to proceed.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that Mr Di Lello Finuoli's report basically shares the Commission's view and calls on the Commission to keep on the same track. Implementing the principle of mutual recognition in judicial cooperation on criminal matters is an ambitious task which entails a fundamental shift in perspective from traditional forms of cooperation to a cooperative division of tasks.</p>
<p class="contents">This new attitude will result in a series of substantive and practical initiatives, as cited in the joint Council and Commission programme of November 2000. Some of the projects proposed in the programme have already been started. The Commission undertook in its programme of work to present proposals on facilitating extradition, including the idea of a European arrest warrant, before the summer recess.</p>
<p class="contents">We are also considering whether joint standards could be implemented to protect individual rights in criminal proceedings. I cannot go into all thirty points of the motion for a resolution here and now. Although the Commission's attitude towards it is very positive overall, I should like to mention one point on which we have our doubts and which was also addressed during the debate. The resolution calls for full application of the <span class="italic">ne bis in idem</span> principle. The Commission supports this, especially as this principle is included in our new Charter of Fundamental Rights. However, the Commission entertains some doubt as to whether it makes sense, in cases in which there are in fact several decisions in various Member States, only ever to apply the decision that is most favourable to the offender.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Council in Tampere adopted ambitions plans in the area of justice and home affairs. We must face the fact in our daily work that the devil is in the detail. Numerous details illustrate that mutual trust in the various judicial systems of the Member States has not yet developed to the point needed in order to exercise mutual recognition. Obviously it would be helpful to push this development forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure that we shall achieve the necessary political momentum if Parliament comes out clearly in favour of developing the principle of mutual recognition. This would perhaps add the political weight which we need, and which is lacking, in order to tip the balance in favour of more comprehensive recognition of decisions. It is time we put flesh on the bones of the theoretical concept of mutual recognition.</p>
