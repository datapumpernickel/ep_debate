<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lambert (Verts/ALE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">–</span> Mr President, I would like to start by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs and the draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Foreign Affairs for their interest and their commitment with regard to this report. I am sure that we would all have liked more committee time, not least to have debated the amendments presented in committee and the overall content more thoroughly, as I am aware that certain difficulties still remain. But there is a great deal on which the majority of us from the committee agree and I trust the Council and the Commission will remember that.</p>
<p class="contents">We welcome the Commission's two communications as an important step in the development of a common asylum policy. We support the stress on measures such as the resettlement programmes, protected entry procedures and support in the region as being additional and complementary to the existing rights to seek asylum within the European Union, and agree that those internal asylum systems should be of high quality.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that we do not view the outsourcing of internal EU responsibilities to camps in countries such as Libya as offering any sustainable solution, or even a short-term solution, to those seeking asylum. As regards the single procedure, we recognise that it is better both for the asylum applicant and the authorities if all relevant information is examined at one time, and we welcome the fact that the Commission has laid out a common order of decision-making. However, we also recognise the possible protection gap in those Member States that only employ full refugee status and have no practice of subsidiary protection, compared with Member States using both categories.</p>
<p class="contents">I recognise that this is a difficult issue for some Members and that paragraphs 37 and 38 of the report may seem to pre-empt the reconsultation process on the procedures directive in which we hope Parliament will be involved very shortly. I would welcome the views of Members on the possible loss of those paragraphs. Parliament, however, fully agrees with the need to frontload the decision-making process. We support the need for the better use of in-country information by better-trained staff. It is appalling that someone's life should depend on an opinion that was never tested for its veracity. This is the situation facing Ramzi Isalam, a homosexual Algerian man who may be deported from the UK to Algeria as he is deemed not to be in need of subsidiary protection. This is due to a line in a Canadian diplomat's report some years ago, which is still included in the country information the UK uses. All the other opinions of that diplomat have been deleted over time. The EU has to do better than that in terms of the quality of the information we use to decide on people's lives. </p>
<p class="contents">More controversially, the majority view in committee was that we need to have in place some form of monitoring or report-back system on what happens to those who are returned having made unsuccessful claims for protection. Then we might know if it is really safe to return others.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee fully supports the need for a better coordinated approach to support in the region for the vast majority of the world's refugees who never even try to come to the European Union, contrary to many newspaper reports and some politicians' views. We recognise that such coordination is a challenge, but a piecemeal approach creates confusion. We want to know how the Commission proposes to improve such coordination in future. We also agree that we need new money, not a reallocation of existing aid budgets, to offer any long-term support to help improve capacity and the quality of response in the regions of origin in full cooperation with the countries concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">What else do we agree on? We agree that resettlement programmes can be of great value, especially when they cater for those most at risk in an already precarious situation; that these programmes can be used within the European Union to help develop a public understanding as to why refugees seek protection; and that this understanding can help to combat all forms of discrimination, not least racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">We also agree that we need a common foreign and security policy that commits the EU as a matter of priority to conflict prevention and the resolution of long-term conflicts. In that context we welcome the proposed EU regional protection programmes and wish to be involved in their development and assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">As you can see, there is much that we agree on and that is not in dispute in this debate. Whatever the final vote tomorrow, that is the message I would wish us to convey to both the Council and the Commission. We agree that the Commission's dual approach – to aim for a universally high standard of application of the current directives within the EU and to improve the conditions for the vast majority of refugees within the region they are fleeing – is a reasonable and indeed ambitious programme. Parliament will wish to be fully involved in the development of such initiatives.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the asylum chapter of the Hague Programme the objective of a common European asylum system is fully confirmed and an ambitious deadline of 2010 is set for the realisation of that goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will ensure that the deadline is met and that the European Parliament will play a key role in that task. As of spring 2005 the European Parliament will be a co-legislator in the process necessary to bring this about. The Hague Programme also reflects the fact that the external dimension of asylum is being recognised as increasingly important in the EU. The improvement of the global protection system is something that can benefit refugees the world over and can help to better share out the responsibilities for refugees with those countries that accommodate the greater part of the refugee population. That is also in the EU's interest. I am grateful to the rapporteur for recognising the importance of this work and the financial implications involved. The full support of the European Parliament is required.</p>
<p class="contents">The durable solutions communication explores how the EU can enhance protection capacities in regions of origin and also help ensure more orderly and managed entry into the EU of persons in need of international protection through the setting-up of an EU-wide resettlement scheme. Refugees should be able to access protection as quickly as possible and as closely as possible to their needs. The emphasis here is on burden sharing rather than burden shifting, on exploring with third countries how we can work together to address a common challenge. These plans must be entirely complementary to, and not a substitute for, Member States' obligations under international human rights law, and in particular the 1951 Refugee Convention and the right to asylum in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">The Hague Programme is clear that the implementation of the second phase of the common European asylum system must be based on a robust evaluation of the impact of the measures taken in Member States. Our communication indicates a methodology for taking that evaluation forward and for how practical cooperation should be developed. That collaborative and consensus-driven methodology can also be applied to other areas under the asylum and migration <span class="italic">acquis</span>. For the longer term we should encourage and promote further cooperation among Member States in this field. That is what the Commission intends to do. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cooperation should be sought through existing instruments, including, in particular, the European Neighbourhood Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must not be seen by third countries as – and here you were right, Commissioner – trying to shift its own responsibilities from our shoulders to theirs. To this end we must demonstrate, in a visible manner, our readiness to assist these countries in enhancing their protection capacity, to be better prepared to provide urgent assistance to countries in crisis, and to ensure the necessary budgetary means other than those already envisaged as development aid. Parallel to third countries, we must be seen to be ready to assume our own responsibilities: the creation of a common European asylum system as called for at Tampere, a fully-fledged regional protection programme by December 2005, and a resettlement scheme based on the absorption capacity of individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, enhancing protection capacity in creating protected entry procedures does not mean abandoning the existing right of application for asylum on spontaneous arrival in an EU Member State. I am firmly of the belief that the more the EU succeeds in enhancing protection capacity in the regions of origin and the more it assists third countries in bringing protection capacity up to standard, the more the protected entry procedures from outside the EU will be enhanced; the fewer spontaneous asylum claims will be presented directly to Member States; and the less lucrative the trade of trafficking in human beings will become. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Today, and with our sights set on 2010, the date established in the Hague programme for completing the second phase of the common asylum system, we are faced with the fortunate fact that the European Union has already adopted important rules, but there is still a long way to go and we are committed to doing so. Our actions should be characterised by responsibility and rigour. When we are talking about human beings who need our help we cannot act in any other way.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dealing with an important report which I believe has the fundamental merit of offering a clear and decisive view of certain issues: firstly, Parliament is saying a firm ‘no’ to the proposal to create reception camps in countries outside the Union. The responsibility I spoke about a moment ago cannot be evaded; we cannot deal with those people looking to us to respond to their despair by looking the other way. Keeping asylum seekers outside of our borders is not the best way to demonstrate the validity of the values on which the European Union is based.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we ask that assistance for refugees be based on the principle of solidarity and a fair distribution of responsibility. Once again, we can see that only solidarity and joint action by the Union can provide viable and lasting solutions. Once again, the Union has the opportunity to demonstrate its commitment to a genuinely common asylum system.</p>

I agree with Mr Moraes. My Group fully supports the report. Most of what I would like to say has already been mentioned by Mrs Lambert in an excellent way. However, I should like to point out that there are tensions between the two directives. The Qualifications Directive sets standards for refugee status and subsidiary protection. There is a need for the directive on minimum standards on procedures to be adopted to come into line with the other directive. That is not the case at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Second, the issue of resettlement should be supported because it is aimed at the most vulnerable. It is not another path of economic migration. It gives hope. At the moment only six Member States take advantage of the possibility to take refugees under resettlement schemes, but voluntary deals with the refugees will help both them and the UNHCR, which warmly supports resettlement.</p>

Allow me to assure them of our solidarity.</p>
<p class="contents">While I endorse most of the content of the Lambert report, I am duty-bound to state to this House the objective fact that, while improving, simplifying and standardising application procedures for asylum seekers is a definite step forward, as long as we spare ourselves the trouble of conducting a real comprehensive debate on the type of immigration Europe needs and on the economic development policy it must pursue towards poor countries, we shall achieve nothing, and this forum of ours will be the scene of regular debates on the plight of these latter-day nomads.</p>

It is said that setting up such centres would lead to difficulties in complying with international human rights obligations, but I do not know on what assumptions this statement is based. I wonder whether the rapporteur has already ascertained that the leaders of such countries or the NGOs, including the European ones, operating in the countries of origin and transit of immigrants are not willing to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that this preconception is based solely on ideological grounds, since reception centres could certainly play an important role in meeting both the need to carry out the necessary controls and that of humane treatment of migrants. In fact, the refusal to create such centres leaves the situation unchanged, and hinders the welcome involvement of countries of transit in the management of the migration process.</p>
<p class="contents">The centre that was recently set up in Africa, thanks to important intervention by my country through the Tripoli agreements, has already managed to prevent, at least so far, the Mediterranean crossings by desperate people in the traffickers’ old tubs and the resulting tragic shipwrecks. Its creation has thus made it possible to achieve a positive outcome in the fight against the despicable trafficking in human beings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It needs to be recognised for what it is, namely a political and social issue. For the past few decades, the Member States of the European Union have given little thought to asylum policy, particularly regarding individuals from other continents. The disastrous consequences of this approach are now evident. Racist and political extremism has become rife, affecting both newcomers and local people. In addition, this inappropriate asylum policy has weakened the confidence of many societies in European integration. Rightly or wrongly, this integration is linked to an excessively liberal policy on asylum. Clearly, such a state of affairs cannot be allowed to continue. The right balance must be maintained between human rights, democracy and the safety of citizen. I am pleased to note that in the second point of its resolution, the European Parliament emphasises the need for ‘measures to step up protection capacity in the regions of origin [of potential asylum seekers]’. This is entirely appropriate. In conclusion, Mr President, I should like to emphasise that the problem of asylum is bound to increase, given the relative wealth of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Union this Parliament is the only institution elected by universal suffrage. In so far as we are the vehicles for direct consensus and have a mandate from the people, for certain issues we must succeed in casting off the political ideologies to which we subscribe. Immigration ought to be one of these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">History teaches us that the greatest misfortune for human beings is to be uprooted from their place of origin, and that immigration arises for countless reasons, not all of them voluntary. A developed social system – and the European Union is a collection of developed states – cannot rule out some aspects of this phenomenon <span class="italic">a priori</span> and focus solely on the emotive part. The Union must safeguard the fundamental principles on which its existence is based, but it must do so in a way that benefits everyone, both its own citizens and those of third countries. It must do so through a common policy, with choices that are mutually agreed upon and maintained, and not by means of ineffective initiatives which isolate certain Member States.</p>

Such a system should be organised and mutually agreed on and, if added to economic aid and incentives in the areas of origin, could provide positive results for all.</p>

We have, in fact, reached a critical juncture in the formulation of a European asylum policy. It is observable that the first phase of European harmonisation of national asylum policies has resulted in a levelling-down of standards.</p>
<p class="contents">In November of this year, the Council adopted a new set of priorities for a European asylum policy in the Hague Programme. Among the provisions of this programme for the second phase of harmonisation is the development of a common asylum procedure, and our main message here is that Europe is a place of refuge and that we must preserve that humanitarian tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the foremost aim of the report before us is to remind the Member States that the Geneva Convention and the role of the High Commissioner for Refugees must remain at the heart of our asylum policy. In order to preserve Europe’s humanitarian tradition, we formally reaffirm our opposition to any moves to outsource the application process and to create transit camps beyond the frontiers of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">European asylum policy must be based on the principle of solidarity, of shared burdens and responsibilities, not only inside the European Union but also with non-EU countries. A European asylum policy must also reinforce the fundamental rights of asylum seekers. The primary aim of the single asylum procedure must be to guarantee a high level of protection for refugees. It must also provide scope for improved decision-making. The European Parliament, democratically elected and accountable to the peoples of Europe, must affirm the right of asylum seekers to a dignified reception. We want more accessible, fairer and better organised asylum systems, and we must rectify the defects in the present systems. We must protect refugees, and we must also work on our own populations, explaining to them the distress that drives people to seek refuge in Europe and, by this means, fostering a better understanding of the situation. It is, of course, desirable that refugees return to their own countries. To that end, it will be necessary to deal with the underlying causes of their plight. In the meantime, however, it is our duty to focus on the local integration of refugees and on their accommodation in host countries while upgrading protection capabilities and developing a programme for the development and adoption of sustainable solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, there seems to be a problem with the interpretation of Amendment No 1 in several languages. Let me therefore make it clear that the word ‘based’ refers to the premature repatriation of refugees, not to the safeguards designed to strengthen the protection programmes. I felt it was important to clarify that point. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are faced with a very harrowing problem for which a solution is required as a matter of urgency. That solution should, however, be a real and permanent one rather than a makeshift attempt. What is really required in the long term is, of course, legal immigration in the European Union; from that point of view, the Council has missed an opportunity by deliberately excluding legal immigration from qualified majority voting. It would appear that the Member States find it easier to reach agreement on how to keep people outside of the EU than on how we can properly allow them in. Over the past few weeks and months, the EU and Parliament have discussed European values and human rights at great length, particularly in the debate on the Commission, but also again today in connection with Turkey.</p>
<p class="contents">Our civilisation’s standards are measured against the manner in which we deal with our fellow human beings and translate our values into practice.

<p class="contents">Mrs Lambert is to be strongly commended for her report and for the focus that it gives to the humanitarian and the civil rights issues which lie at the heart of the asylum debate. I echo her call for the highest possible international standards and human rights to guide EU policy. Her rejection of the so-called 'holding centres', even as a short-term solution to the issue of dealing with asylum applicants, is to be welcomed and strongly endorsed.</p>
<p class="contents">The emphasis in the report on speeding up asylum requests and ensuring efficiency and transparency in the decision-making process is also welcome. Conflict, poverty and socio-political instability affect millions of people across the world. We therefore need to shift the emphasis towards promoting conflict resolution and prevention under the auspices of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The long-term solution to issues of asylum is to reduce conflict and poverty globally. The EU has a major role to play in this regard. We must get the policy right. We must demonstrate to the world that when it comes to human rights, justice and equality, the policy implementation of the EU is as good as its rhetoric. I also strongly support the amendments.</p>

One of the ways of combating it is certainly by knowing how to recognise those who deserve help among those who turn to us for assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">Not long ago, 75 Eritreans were arrested by the Libyan authorities; they had to undergo a long period of detention and were subjected to inhumane treatment. They were then put on an aeroplane to be taken back to their country of origin. Seized by despair, they hijacked the aeroplane and forced it to land in Sudan. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees was able to interview 60 of the 75 Eritreans, since the others were in prison for the hijacking. All those interviewed were entitled to asylum, but Libya does not have a law recognising such a right, is not a signatory to the Geneva Convention and does not guarantee respect of human rights in prison.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, even countries such as mine – Italy – do not have a law on the right to asylum, and therefore reject migrants indiscriminately, without examining applications and without fair, just and individual assessments. Even legal immigrants are humiliated and forced to wait for years for the rightful renewal of their residence permits. It is clear that these persons are considered an enemy within, to be treated badly and thrown out.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe itself, though, should examine asylum applications, at the same time helping the Maghreb countries to progress along the path of respecting rights. We should ensure that Europe, by using the highest criteria for assessing and protecting refugees, transforms these waves of people into legal immigrants, and this plan is both beneficial and possible. For this reason it is necessary to set up a single European agency for refugees and European reception centres to examine individual requests, providing legal and linguistic assistance.</p>
<p class="contents">The refugees will be our foremost allies in promoting economic, civil and democratic growth in their countries of origin, since the world will be more secure only when it stops being so unfair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
