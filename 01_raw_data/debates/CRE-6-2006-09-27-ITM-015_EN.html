<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Rosa Miguélez Ramos (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span><span class="bold">.</span> – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Madam President, without taking up any of my speaking time – since this has nothing to do with the issue we are dealing with, but is more a point of order – I would like to put a request to the Presidency of this Parliament arising from an incident in which I have just been involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Barely a quarter of an hour ago, I left the Chamber for a moment and went into the aisle behind us here and found myself happily looking at the waters in the canal, when I found myself quite literally swept aside by an entourage, which I then discovered was surrounding the President of Lebanon. So far, it was nothing we have not seen a million times in this House. The thing that shocked me, President Borrell, was the attitude of the two people, parliamentary staff, who were leading the entourage.</p>
<p class="contents">First they made gestures at me. Then they shouted at me: ‘Mettez-vous sur le côté! [move to the side]’, they told me, and I do not know whether you are aware, but the ‘<span class="italic">côté</span>’ behind us here is made up of boards with holes in which women’s high heels can get caught, and it is therefore very easy to fall over. I tried to avoid going ‘<span class="italic">sur le côté</span>’. I pointed out to them – I must put it like this – that I was a Member of Parliament, but I can assure you that it did not do me much good. They practically swept me aside until I was where they wanted me to be: ‘To the side immediately!’.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, since we are talking about staff of this House, and given the unfortunate timetable for these night sittings, I would ask you whether it is possible to find other ways to treat Members or, perhaps, other routes by which visitors can leave.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, Madam President, I shall move on to the matter in hand. I shall move on to fish belonging to the taxon Elasmobranchii, which are generally highly vulnerable to exploitation given their life-cycle characteristics.</p>
<p class="contents">The practice known as finning, involving the removal of fins and disposal of the body, is prohibited on board Community vessels, both in maritime waters under the sovereignty or jurisdiction of Member States and in international waters and those of third countries. Nevertheless, given that these species are often caught as by-catch, on 26 June 2003, the European Union adopted a Regulation on the removal of fins of sharks.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation allows sharks to be handled on board the vessel, with fins separated from bodies, provided that that is designed to achieve greater efficiency in the use of the entire shark, with the fins and the rest of the animal stored on board separately. In order to ensure that <span class="italic">finning </span>is not practised, the quantity of fins must correspond to that of bodies and, to that end, a ratio or proportion compared to the total live weight is established, and in 2003 that ratio was set at five per cent of fin compared to live weight. This five per cent was decided upon on the basis of United States legislation designed for a different reality and for species of shark that are coastal and have different presentations.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific reports of the ICES and the ICCAT indicate that that ratio is not applicable to the pelagic species caught by the Community fleet, whose fins are far larger than those of coastal sharks.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to point out that the current 5% in the regulation in force and the 6.5% that I am proposing for a single species – in this case the Prionacea glauca – are in line with the most recent scientific reports. In any event – and I address this to the Commissioner – the main objective of the Community legislation must be to reinforce the prohibition of <span class="italic">finning </span>but – and I say this to him too – in order to ensure that the rules are effective and accepted by all of the parties, they must reflect the specific characteristics of fleets, the morphology of the different species and calculation methods that include cutting techniques and presentation methods used.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, Commissioner, this is a very specific and identifiable fishery and, therefore, the recognition of these issues would enable us to prevent situations in which the European Union’s longline fleet is prejudiced. That fleet is currently obliged to throw away a proportion of the fins in order to comply with the rules, since more than 80% of the catches are of a species that I have already mentioned, Prionacea glauca, whose ratio, as we have said, is 6.5%.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say to the Commission that not using realistic conversion factors poses a risk to the European Union since it leads to errors in the estimates of catches, estimates that are obtained indirectly from the international market in fins in Asian countries, where they appear as being of European origin. At the same time – I address this also to the Commissioner – the updating of this percentage, I would repeat, on the basis of the data and the scientific reports, would enable the Community immediately to lead the review that, in accordance with the recommendation of the Community’s own Scientific Committee, is going to take place within the ICCAT and that will probably be followed by other RFOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I would stress that the increase requested in no way implies an increase in the catch of sharks nor a relaxing of the measures intended to prevent the practice of <span class="italic">finning</span>. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am pleased to note that the rapporteur praises the clarity and conciseness of the Commission’s report and shares the view that this regulation is achieving its objective. Let me assure you that the Commission is committed to monitoring the application of this regulation to ensure its proper implementation, including of Member States’ obligations regarding control and reporting.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also continue to promote the prohibition of shark finning in international forums. In addition, the Commission will continue in its endeavours towards the adoption of measures based on scientific information and other considerations within Regional Fisheries Management Organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also recall that the prohibition of shark finning practices is not the only way to ensure a sustainable fishery for these species. A more comprehensive set of management measures is required. We have already taken some measures in this respect. I refer, in particular, to special efforts to improve scientific knowledge and data collection, to establish catch or effort limits for certain species, including deep-sea species, to prohibit drift nets that may catch some large pelagic sharks and to control and limit fishing capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">As rightly pointed out in Parliament’s motion for a resolution, the Commission has identified numerous actions to halt the loss of biodiversity by 2010 and beyond, including Community plans of action for sharks and sea birds.</p>
<p class="contents">My department is currently looking into the request for the presentation of a Community plan of action by mid-2007. While it is too early to have a clear overview of the detailed work programme for 2007, it is clear that a formal, complete and detailed plan of action requires a comprehensive assessment of the situation and of the possible measures, together with an early consultation of all interested parties, which will take time and resources. The desired timeframe seems rather too ambitious, and setting too short a timeframe for preparation and consultation could even be counterproductive. I would prefer to be less prescriptive in terms of deadlines. However, I can assure honourable Members that my department will undertake to complete the plan of action at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p class="contents">Returning to the report’s core concerns, I have taken good note of the proposed calls for the Commission to present amendments to the Shark Finning Regulation, especially with a view to reviewing the 5% fin weight versus live body weight ratio on the basis of a species-dependent approach, and to revise the possibilities for separate landings of fins and carcasses, as well as to report again on the operation of this regulation within two years.</p>
<p class="contents">When deciding on this regulation, the Council did not consider it appropriate to adopt a species-specific approach regarding the fin to body weight ratio. I think the reasons mentioned in the debate then are still valid now. A single 5% fin to live body weight ratio applicable to the whole shark-catch of a vessel is a realistic, feasible, controllable, simple and proportionate method of preventing shark finning practices from spreading. The Commission’s report also confirms this.</p>
<p class="contents">I am not, therefore, of the opinion that amendments to the regulation should be proposed at this stage. Firstly, because the regulation was only recently adopted and is working well overall. Secondly, because the Commission believes it would be unwieldy to start revising the fin to body weight ratio or introducing some species-specific approach to the Shark Finning Regulation without new measures to ensure sustainable shark fishing.</p>
<p class="contents">The much broader exercise of preparing a Community plan of action for sharks will necessarily include a reassessment of developments under the Shark Finning Regulation and its possible need for review, especially on the basis of the national annual reports, which are available for all those interested. It is at this point, therefore, that we will be able to consider once more the situation with respect to body-fin ratio and make any recommendations accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Parliament’s necessary full involvement in a proposal for a plan of action will also provide another opportunity for Parliament to be informed about and to play a role in developments on shark finning matters. The Commission will continue to monitor the situation. You can rest assured that I am always ready to act and to present all supporting evidence if new information becomes available indicating significant changes in the situation. I am committed to advances in the area of shark conservation and other aspects of marine biodiversity, and will inform you in due time of the progress made.</p>

First and foremost, it should be clarified and highlighted that the practice of finning has been regulated by the EU since 2003, meaning that sharks cannot be caught solely for their fins.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, this type of fishing is centred on a species, just as any other, which means that sustainability is just as important for this species as for any other. The issue of encouraging more catches does not therefore form part of the objective of this report but falls instead under the scope of quotas or perhaps recovery plans on the basis of the usual scientific reports.</p>
<p class="contents">What is under discussion here is the fact that the Commission communication has acknowledged the positive effect of the 2003 regulation and compliance with it. A more contentious issue in this debate, however, is the weight of fins as a percentage of the total weight of the shark. According to ICCAT reports, the total use of the fins by the Community fleet differs, for example, from the US fleet’s partial use. We must therefore look into the possibility of changing the percentage, on the basis of these reports, which have proposed an increase from 5% to 6.5%. This is the crux of the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">To ignore this issue would be to confuse the total use of fish with the preservation of a fishing resource. We must indeed preserve the resource, but that must be done by other means. The nub of this debate is that, by ensuring that rates of use reflect reality and scientific reports, we will be able to plug all gaps. The compromise reached between the three main political groups implies that Parliament realises that this is the way to proceed, in line with the existing studies carried out by recognised bodies, to which the EU belongs, and in accordance with the law, thereby contributing to genuinely sustainable and regulated fishing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The regulation is designed to prevent shark finning, where shark carcasses are thrown overboard after high-value shark fins have been removed. You could call this ‘slit and chuck’. Without their fins, the sharks suffocate to death.</p>
<p class="contents">The practice of shark finning is known to endanger the survival of several shark species. Only today American researchers using fish auction records from Hong Kong have calculated that the trade in shark fins kills 26 million to 73 million sharks a year. Against this background, I am appalled and disappointed that this report threatens an increase in shark finning.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 5 of the report requests an increase of the 5% fin- to live-weight ratio to 6.5%, particularly for blue sharks. Paragraph 3 of the report incorrectly implies that ICES and ICCAT support an increase in fin- to live-weight ratio for the blue shark. A paper was submitted to ICES in 2005, but ICES has not considered this paper or issued an opinion. The same goes for ICCAT, where scientists have reviewed fin to carcass ratios but have not recommended an increase of the ratio.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment 1 is placed first on the voting list, and I recommend support for it. I fear that the European Parliament may not give its support to any of these amendments, a retrograde step, and I ask colleagues to say no to ‘slit and chuck’. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have no doubt that an increase would be wrong, but no doubt the Spanish and Portuguese fishing interests would argue the other way. I hope Parliament will be able to support my proposal for a study based on best scientific evidence before any decision is made. I hope it will do that not simply because it represents a compromise in those positions but because it is the most appropriate way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">So far as I am concerned, the whole shark fin regulation has always been too weak. It was far too weak when we introduced it. Enforcement is problematic to say the least and, as in so many aspects of fishing, varies from one Member State to another. It certainly needs to be reviewed at regular intervals. The idea that we should just have one review and that is the end of it, as originally intended, is simply nonsense. I hope the Commissioner will support the idea of more regular reviews, just as I support him in opposing the idea that quotas should be set for long periods of time.</p>
<p class="contents">The real issue here is so much bigger. We face the prospect of the extinction of many shark species – slow-breathing creatures that have lived on this planet for many millennia longer than our own species. The risk is that with this particular regulation we are simply playing at the edges.</p>
<p class="contents">We are killing too many sharks. We have to stop that. We need the Commission to come forward with a shark management action plan. We have heard from the Commissioner why it will take time to do that, but I seem to remember joining with other Members of Parliament in calling for this some three years ago. I hope that the Commissioner will be able to finish this debate by telling us exactly how much work has already been done over the past three years in preparing the groundwork for publication of the shark management action plan. My impression is that absolutely nothing has been done. I hope the Commissioner can correct that impression. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

With this proposal, sharks may be even more threatened than they are already.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the scientific studies, it is not at all clear how far the ratio should be increased; there is even one study by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature that restricts the ratio to 2%. We must seek out all of the scientific information available, because this amendment is intended to change the rules in order to increase the percentage of weight of fins compared to the bodies of sharks, and in that way more and more catches would be thrown back into the sea.</p>
<p class="contents">Sharks are being wiped out in the oceans in order to satisfy the Asian whim of making soup from their fins, and that is not a good thing. It is difficult to monitor what happens at sea, and there is sufficient evidence to suggest that many Member States are not controlling compliance with Community legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">To besiege an animal even further, when two thirds of its species in Europe are already on the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s Red List, is not a good idea. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They received wide support in the Council. Spain and Portugal now appear to be the only Member States pushing for an amendment to the regulation in respect of the 5% ratio of fins to live weight of shark catch. They say that the current regulation is unrealistic, particularly for the blue shark, which is the main target of their fishery and which they claim is in great abundance in EU waters. I think the strong international market for shark fins, mostly as we have just heard for the Asian shark fin soup market, coupled with the relatively low value of shark meat, has motivated Spain and Portugal to support this drastic amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">It remains a fact that the 5% ratio of fins to live weight contained in EU legislation is the weakest in the world, as Mr Davies told us. The proposal in this report for a 6.5% ratio would quite simply allow more sharks to be killed. It would send all the wrong negative signals to the international community. The higher the ratio, the more likely it is that the illegal practice of finning will recur. That is why I have tabled an amendment which proposes that the figure be lowered to 2% of live weight. That would ensure the protection of sharks in EU waters, increase that protection and fall in line with international standards.</p>
<p class="contents">The IUCN, the World Conservation Union, has confirmed that the blue shark is endangered and will be placed on its red list as a vulnerable species when that list is updated later this year. In such circumstances, it would be madness to permit more of these sharks to be killed. Indeed, we should be seeking to impose a strict regime of TACs and quotas on blue sharks to offer the species additional protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The corresponding Commission report is clear in reiterating that finning is prohibited within the Community, and in its conclusion that the percentage equivalence ratio of shark fin to body weight does not need to be altered. The rapporteur disagrees with this percentage ratio figure, and she is of the opinion that it should be increased from the level of 5% to 6.5%. This is the main issue of disagreement with the Commission report, and with some of us.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Miguélez Ramos argues that some scientific evidence favours her 6.5% ratio position, but let me say respectfully that other scientific evidence supplied by at least equally reputable sources supports the view that the 5% figure is in fact more than adequate. The latter scientific evidence further supports the view that if the ratio is indeed increased, this will result in the enhancement of the very practice we want to stop, i.e. finning. Such a practice, coupled with the general failure of implementation of the relevant Community regulation, will, in my view, lead with mathematical accuracy and in the not-too-distant future, to the endangerment of the very existence of certain shark species. In this respect, please note that an increase from 5% to 6.5% may seem small at first glance, but in reality it is not. It in fact represents an increase of 30%. In other words, potentially 30% of the shark catches could end up in finning.</p>
<p class="contents">Much as we wish to help increase the profits of our fishermen, it is our primary concern and duty to prevent the extinction of any shark species. I therefore urge you to support Mr Davies’ amendment tabled on behalf of the ALDE Group and aimed at maintaining the ratio at 5%, as proposed by the Commission and as supported by the Commissioner in his speech here tonight. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that legislation that is not good must be updated.</p>
<p class="contents">That is precisely what the 2005 Report of the ICCAT says about ratios for sharks. According to that report, the ratio applied to Prionacea glauca is wrong. Furthermore, the scientists of the ICCAT argue that it should be corrected. There are two reasons for this: the first is that data on landings based on an incorrect coefficient may lead them to make the wrong estimates; and, secondly, that the inconsistency in the ratio hinders the work of controlling the fleet, since, because it is impossible to comply with the rule, the control makes no sense.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, this is demonstrated in the report that you have sent to this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, Mr President, I wish to ask that we update and correct the legislation once and for all, because otherwise we are creating a serious lack of confidence in the sector as a result of having rules with which, as I say, it is impossible to comply.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like one of the people who have spoken here, claiming that there are scientific reports, to tell me of at least one, supported by the international scientific community, that contradicts what the ICCAT said at the last plenary meeting of the Regional Fisheries Organisation that regulates all of these very species.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask that we act rationally, that we do things properly, that the coefficients be reviewed and that we choose those that can be fulfilled by the fleet. I must also say that the problem of over-fishing will not be resolved by means of ratios. It will be resolved by means of quotas for sharks. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe – along with Mr Stevenson, and we have tabled an amendment to this effect – that instead of leaving it at 5% we need to reduce it to 2%. To take it up to 6.5% would only encourage the catching and finning of more and more sharks. Over 70 million sharks are taken each year and we really need to reduce the number. To increase it to 6.5% would be crazy.</p>
<p class="contents">We in Europe very much want a sustainable fisheries policy. We also want high welfare standards. If you increase the percentage of shark fins that can be landed, the chances of increasing the number of sharks caught and of finning are greater. We need to set an example to the world. In most parts of the world the percentage of fins that can be landed by fishing is lower. I therefore urge the Commissioner to go further and reduce the percentage of fins that can be landed.</p>
<p class="contents">However much more valuable shark fins are than the rest of the body, it is absolutely right that the whole of the body should be landed and used.

The only problem that has been raised substantively relates to the whole issue concerning 5% versus 6.5%. In this regard, I should say that the ratio between fin weight and body weight varies significantly depending on the shark species concerned. Scientific information was already available at the time the regulation was adopted, especially as regards the blue shark. The Council, however, did not consider that a species-dependent approach was appropriate, and the maximum 5% fin- versus live body-weight ratio set in the regulation was certainly not presented as being based on scientific considerations alone.</p>
<p class="contents">The 5% fin- to body-weight requirement represents the only current restriction on a number of shark species caught in fisheries, notably the blue shark. This should not be reviewed, at least until other management measures are in place to reduce their fishing mortality. I have no problem with further research, but this has to be done before any amendments are proposed. Again, I have no problem with regular reviews. I have made reference to an overall consideration of a Community plan of action for sharks, when we will have ample time to discuss this and other issues concerning conservation of sharks.</p>
<p class="contents">On the point raised by Mr Davies concerning the plan of action, the EU has not yet formalised a plan of action for sharks. Nevertheless, many of the actions that would constitute such a plan of action are already incorporated into Community legislation or other initiatives under the CFP. The EU has taken considerable management action with regard to sharks, for example the improvement of data collection for large pelagic shark species, the establishment of catch limits for certain shark species, skates and rays in the North Sea, deepwater sharks in the north-east Atlantic, prohibiting trawl fisheries within littoral areas in the Mediterranean, banning the use of driftnets that may catch large pelagic sharks, prohibiting shark finning and establishing specific conditions under which only the removal of fins of sharks may be authorised – which is what we are discussing today – and the control and limitation of fishing capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to note that many of these measures apply to EC vessels, irrespective of whether or not they operate in EC waters. Such measures should also be promoted in the international context, especially in other FMOs where we support measures to ensure appropriate management in respect of high-sea fisheries.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s departments are currently reflecting on whether a formal plan of action for sharks should be developed in the very near future and I am favourably inclined to doing so. However, considering the importance of the work to be done, the necessary collection of information, reflection and consultation and assessment of possible measures, it would not be realistic to set the finalisation date of any comprehensive Commission proposal for a plan of action for sharks within the time limit indicated in Amendment 8. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
