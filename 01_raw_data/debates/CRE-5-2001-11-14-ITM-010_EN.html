Furthermore, it could represent an invitation or a stimulus to the Koreans to extend their unfair practices to other sectors of economic activity such as automobiles, electronics and steel. Of course, this invitation may not only extend to Korea itself but also to other countries, principally in that region.</p>
<p class="contents">Transparency suggests a challenge: free competition in a free market. But a free market means the same laws for all, and given that this does not exist at the moment, our transparency in a world and at a time when we do not have the other elements necessary for the existence of that free market, as well as naivety, may result in a clear risk of disaster and also a lack of solidarity from the European Union towards the Member States and the cities of those States. This is the case with a city such as mine, Vigo, in the North East of Spain, where companies and families have made an enormous effort and a difficult sacrifice in order to be competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Solidarity therefore demands measures in defence of a sector which is also strategic for Europe; measures which impose the extension of the scope of the defensive support mechanism to all categories of ship built by the Korean shipyards and which also impose an extension of the period the defensive mechanism is in force until 31 December 2003, which is also the period in force of Regulation (EC) 1540/98 or, alternatively, until the WTO procedure against Korea is concluded.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, our future, the future of our States and the citizens of Europe are at stake. Twenty years on will be too late. I believe that solidarity demands, and leads us to hope, that the Commission and the Council will act in the way I have mentioned. These are the reasons given by the companies and workers in the sector in the parts of Europe where shipbuilding is important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That does not mean that I do not recognise that some of this public aid makes sense and must continue if it contributes to the objectives laid down in the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite this, and precisely because this is one of those cases, I would like to express my total support for the Commission’s proposal and the amendments presented by the competent committees, which propose a defensive and temporary mechanism in the ship-building sector in order to confront the unfair practices of South Korea. In this section, there is no room for solutions such as that proposed by the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, which, by taking an extremely orthodox position in opposition to public aid, would have disastrous consequences for the European shipbuilding sector.</p>
<p class="contents">There is absolutely no doubt that the Republic of Korea is practising dumping in the sector, and for this reason the European industry cannot compete. It is true that the Commission has begun proceedings before the World Trade Organisation to combat this unfair competition, but it is also the case that, while this procedure is under way, the European ship-building industry could disappear, with significant repercussions for employment.</p>
<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that there are two elements to this aid which make it worthy of support: firstly, it is transitional, it will only be granted until the WTO resolves the dispute in question, and secondly, it is defensive, it is a response to aggressive unfair competition by the Republic of Korea, and for these reasons it is perfectly acceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the amendments approved by the competent committee are acceptable, since they include certain types of ship which are also affected by these unfair practices on the part of Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has been informed of the existence of a possible legal report by the services of the Council which opposes these measures proposed by the Commission. While we do not know what these legal arguments are, we must be content with the legal reports of both the European Parliament and the Commission, which speak of the suitability of the aid as proposed by the Commission, which is neither substantially distorted nor modified by the proposals which have been approved in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is unacceptable that we, as a Parliament, do not have access to the same information as the Council. It is unacceptable discrimination between the two institutions. I should like to have seen us in Parliament postponing the debate on the proposal until we had received the Council’s legal evaluation. Unfortunately, that is not what the big two political groups wanted. The usual demand for transparency is transparently not so important when money is at stake and national interests to be looked after.</p>
<p class="contents">I have, however, received an answer from the Commission regarding the regulation’s compliance with the WTO rules. The Commission sees no problems. There, I disagree. The Commission says that the regulation will not have any negative effect on third countries. That is incorrect. In future, a Japanese shipyard, for example, will compete with European shipyards that receive State aid. In that way, the regulation will have a negative effect on third countries, for example Japan. The Commission also says that the proposed regulation cannot be regarded as biased action by the EU against South Korea, something that would be contrary to the WTO regulations. The regulation states quite specifically that European shipyards can only receive State aid if they are in direct competition with Korean shipyards. Korea is mentioned specifically, then. A more biased course of action cannot be imagined.</p>
<p class="contents">With this proposal, we, in the EU, are doing something that is downright illegal. I urge that what was adopted in Parliament’s committee be rejected, just as I should ideally like to see the Commission withdraw its proposal and instead concentrate on taking WTO proceedings against the Koreans. What is the Commission trying to do with all these amendments to extend the period of the regulation and to increase the number of types of ship that are eligible for aid? Will the Commission confirm that it will on no account comply with Parliament’s requests today? Will the Commission confirm or deny that it has plans to table an altered proposal that includes LNG tankers? I very much hope that the Commission will answer these questions.</p>

Finally, and after so many complaints about it, the Commission has presented an initiative, with the acquiescence of the Council, and has proposed certain provisional measures to us, which consist of a temporary defence mechanism, specifically designed to counteract Korea’s unfair practices, putting a complaint procedure before the World Trade Organisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the Commission, in its proposed aid to ship building, only includes container ships and oil tankers. We believe that it should also include special ships for the transportation of gases derived from oil and liquefied natural gas, as well as ferries, bulk carriers and roll-on roll-off car ferries, all of which are included in the complaints presented to the WTO.</p>

Now that there are serious problems in the industry, which is of strategic importance to the European Union, particularly to ensure the security of supply on appropriate terms and to prevent excessive dependence on external sources, it has become necessary to support the European shipbuilding industry against unfair practices by Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission proposal is important for the moment, it is only temporary and partial, and in the end, is on the same level as Korean unfair practices. In any event, it is important that the proposals that the rapporteur has made should at least be taken into account, including the extension of the expiry date of this 6% operating aid, in special cases up to a limit of 14%, and also the enlargement of its scope to other vessels. We therefore back this report in order to prevent the short-term aggravation of the economic and social problems that already exist in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It was made clear in the past that the subsidies for the shipbuilding industry would be discontinued in mid-2001. The re-introduction of a temporary subsidy scheme goes against the agreements made and is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">The granting of subsidies to the shipbuilding industry is both unnecessary and undesirable. It is unnecessary because shipbuilding in Europe focuses on the construction of technologically advanced ships and not on the simple conveyer-belt production as is the case in low-wage countries. It therefore offers not a single solution to the problems in the industry. The granting of aid is undesirable because financially unhealthy companies remain in production thanks to subsidies, and efficient production is impossible as a result. The industry does not benefit from non-generic support. Structural solutions to the problems European shipbuilding is facing lie in healthy competition and structural reforms. The Commission proposal, however, will undermine these prospects for a long time. The internal market will be disrupted since the Member States will step in to implement the Regulation, and non-generic support will lead to unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">With this proposal, Europe places itself in an untenable position. Lodging a complaint at the WTO is absurd if the Commission adheres to temporary support measures as suggested. We therefore share the overwhelming concern expressed by the original rapporteur, Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, with regard to this proposal. In fact, I cannot imagine that the duty Commissioner Bolkestein would think any differently about this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has now approved a strategy, according to which the matter will be taken to the WTO dispute settlement procedure. I support this decision and would like to thank all those Members of the Commission who actively contributed to this decision. At the same time, however, the Commission issued a proposal to the effect that operating aid could be allowed to individual shipyards temporarily during the WTO procedure. According to the Commission proposal for a regulation, any arrangements for subsidies would be exceptional and temporary measures and would concern a limited number of ship types only.</p>
<p class="contents">At first glance the Commission proposal may seem justified, but in reality it distorts competition both in the world market and even within the EU and lacks any valid legitimate reason. The link between the subsidy mechanism and the WTO procedure is totally artificial. These matters have no natural connection and therefore these questions should be dealt with separately. All of us who are involved in politics understand this: this is politics, not a legal process. If we want to lean on the WTO, we ourselves must act according to the rules set by the WTO. By allocating subsidies, the EU itself is guilty of distorting actions of which it is now accusing Korea. This will bring discredit on us and will weaken our negotiation position within the WTO.</p>
<p class="contents">I said that the Commission proposal distorts competition also inside the EU. Even if only certain ship types would receive subsidies, the subsidised shipyards would always benefit from subsidy monies and would therefore have an advantage over other shipyards. In particular this will impede the position of the high technology shipbuilding industry, which for very good reasons has responded to fiercening competition by concentrating especially on products representing more demanding technology. Among others my home country Finland has from the very beginning, as agreed, reduced shipyard subsidies, and we have invested strongly in the building of cruise ships and other high technology vessels. Consequently, through these actions Finnish shipyards have achieved world-wide competitiveness, which the Commission is now trying to take away from us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are all already aware of the difficulties that this sector has faced for years as a result of unfair competition from Korea. We are also aware that Korea continues to set prices below cost, that the Korean authorities provide their shipyards with subsidies, both direct and indirect, that bankrupt shipyards are kept operational, that South Korea’s production capacity increased by 170% between 1988 and 1997, whereas, during the same period, European production fell by 30%. And yet, during this time, European subsidies were ended. All attempts to resolve the matter amicably have been in vain and a case therefore had to be lodged with the WTO. I am pleased that this case has now been supplemented with a proposal for a defensive mechanism. The WTO procedure will probably last three years. It would be absurd to leave European shipbuilding unprotected for this time and the Commission has proposed a defence mechanism in the form of subsidies. I support this measure but I would add that Korean competition also affects oil tankers. One Korean company, with USD five billion’s worth of losses that have been absorbed by state banks, nevertheless won half of all industrial tonnage in 2000 – by dropping prices. At a time when the consequences of the 11 September attacks have led to a pause in orders for cruise ships, a sector which does not need subsidies, orders for oil tankers are much needed, which is why we must include this sector in the defensive mechanism. This is my contribution, ladies and gentlemen, to this very important debate on shipbuilding. I too wish to see Parliament give massive support to the Commission’s proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The rapporteur knows something of which other colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the Commission ought to be aware: State subsidies of any kind damage the economy, impair the operation of the market and harm consumers. Subsidies make for inefficiency and increase costs. What is depressing is that fellow MEPs now want to make a bad proposal still worse.</p>
<p class="contents">I come from Sweden. In the seventies, Sweden was the world’s second largest shipbuilding nation after Japan. I had my first job in what was at that time one of Sweden’s largest shipyards. We built the largest oil tanker in history. When competition increased from countries such as Portugal, Japan and South Korea, the Swedish state invested a total of EUR 2 billion in an attempt to rescue the shipbuilding industry. No industrial investment in Sweden has been so ill-starred, cost so much and resulted in so little. The necessary restructuring of industry came to a halt, and no new jobs were created.</p>
<p class="contents">If we in the EU now want to show real solidarity with the shipyard workers and their families, the Commission’s and the committees’ proposals must naturally be rejected. That would be an investment for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our group supports the Commission proposal with amendments. Of course, we question the way in which we put up defensive mechanisms when there is talk of opaque, unclear and unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">The rapporteur has suggested that we should not take any generic measures, as is now the case, namely according to types of ships and possibly a broader concept thereof, but has favoured measures according to regions and shipbuilding yards instead. Separate support must be granted within the agreements we have concluded in this connection. The question then actually arises as to the way in which people who, let us say, want to uphold the liberal principles, need to act the moment damage is being done. I will quote one example. At present, the Commission has instituted proceedings against the Schelde-Damen construction, that is to say, Damen, has taken over the company Schelde for 1 Guilder. Questions have been raised as to whether that is acceptable. My question is whether, in the spirit of the directive which is now being proposed, it could be possible that the Commission, let us say in an oblique way, is now also turning a blind eye to constructions which are being used in this context and in the above example. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is a general consensus that the crisis is affecting the European Union’s shipbuilding industry. There is a general consensus that this crisis is due, amongst other things, to unfair competition on the part of the Republic of South Korea, which, according to Mr Caudron, consists of three elements: prices which are lower than costs, aid to shipyards and the maintenance of bankrupt shipyards.</p>
<p class="contents">I have also stressed that the crisis is serious. Over the last 10 years, Korea has increased its capacity by 180%, while we have reduced ours by 30%. What have we done so far? So far, we have signed an agreement with South Korea which that country has not respected. We have lodged a complaint which is yet to be dealt with. And recently, a twin course of action has been decided upon: firstly, to take the case to the WTO and, secondly, to establish the defensive, selective and temporary mechanism which we are discussing.</p>
<p class="contents">It is as if Commissioner Bolkestein, faced with the non-compliances of Korea, had used the words of Cicero to Catiline: "<span class="italic">Quousque tandem abutere Catilina patientia nostra </span>[How long now, Catiline, will you abuse our patience]<span class="italic">"</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I would remind those Members, almost all from the North, who have spoken against this decision, of a military aphorism which says that ‘the mission of the artillery is to bomb the infantry, preferably that of the enemy’. In this case, the weapons of the North are aiming at European positions, bringing to mind in many cases the situation of Japan or that of other industries.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the European Parliament want to do? Support Mr Bolkestein whole-heartedly and ask him to be more generous. To be more generous in relation to the field of protection: that is to say, as Mr Ortuondo has stressed, that it also be extended to those vessels which suffer from unfair competition, those which transport gases, car ferries, etc. and that he be less stingy in terms of the date of application. That he extend this temporary and defensive measure until 2003. May God bless you if you do this, Mr Bolkestein. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Korea it is not even a question of protectionism: it is a massive violation of WTO rules. We should like to believe that the complaint that has been made will have some effect and bring some discipline to this sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has revealed, however, that it knows the proposed mechanism is not enough, and that it is only one step, and a step with all the negative baggage that stopgap measures entail, once we get beyond the deficit and crises of the shipbuilding industry, some of which have already been mentioned here, so I shall not repeat them. But while it is true that the Nordic countries support investment and alternative technology, and thus achieve added value and still manage to keep active in the market without great social upheaval, this is not equally true for other European Union regions, such as southern Europe, regions where this sector is the largest employer and supports employment in a number of services and subsidiary industries. It is often the only activity that generates development in these regions, and so the disappearance of this activity would be a social tragedy for certain regions, particularly in my country, in Spain and in Greece. But while we hope that the Commission will implement this regulation at least by 2003, we hope for a lot more for the future and a different attitude towards the sector. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was for two reasons: State aid had not proved to have had any major effect on the industry’s ability to survive, and there was a conviction on grounds of principle that State aid should be reduced as much as possible and preferably cease. Parliament shared this view as recently as last year.</p>
<p class="contents">State aid to shipyards is, moreover, contrary to international trade agreements, a fact crystallised by the Commission’s attempt in the autumn of 1999 and the spring of 2000 to reach a negotiated solution with South Korea to the problem of their having violated current trade agreements by providing extensive State aid. Now that that attempt has failed, the Commission is instead tabling a proposal for a so-called temporary defensive mechanism for the shipbuilding industry, involving aid of between 6 and 14 per cent. According to the committee’s proposal, this is to continue right up until the end of 2003, at the same time as dispute settlement proceedings have been instituted before the WTO against South Korea as a result of the latter’s having violated current trade agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">The reintroduction of extensive State aid within the EU would scarcely increase the prospects of solving the dispute with South Korea. It would make more sense to reject the Commission’s proposal and put every effort into the WTO proceedings against South Korea.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to put the following question to Commissioner Bolkestein: how does he think this proposal stands in relation to the EU’s competition policy through which we are trying to minimise, and preferably remove, State aid to industries in order to create fair and healthy competition between companies? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, on Mr Monti's behalf, to thank Mrs Riis-Jørgensen for her hard work and considerable input into this report. We are extremely grateful for the rapid handling of this file by Parliament. I also wish to take this opportunity to explain to Parliament the Commission's position on this report.</p>
<p class="contents">Ideally, there would be no need for the Commission to present this proposal. I stress that operating aid is a particularly distorting form of aid, because it provides no incentive to improve efficiency and delivers no benefit in terms of competitiveness of the yards by, for example, encouraging training or research development. Nor, indeed, does it help the environment. For those reasons and after many years of operating aid being granted to the shipbuilding industry, the Commission finally decided to prohibit it as from the end of last year.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to quote a well-known philosopher, we do not live in the best of all possible worlds. That being so, it is only right that the Community should take action against any unfair competitive practices, and it is within that context that the proposal for the temporary defensive mechanism should be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal is one part of a two-pronged strategy against Korean practices and is designed to support the Community's action against Korea in the WTO. It is an exceptional measure, and is only taken in the light of a situation which led one representative rightly to quote Cicero saying: ‘<span class="italic">Quo usque tandem abutere, Catilina, patientia nostra?</span>’</p>
<p class="contents">It is, as I say, an exceptional measure, whose purpose is to put pressure on Korea to bring it to the negotiating table with the Community and to force it to bring an end to its unfair commercial practices.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, it is not in any way the beginning of a new, possibly open ended regime of operating aid. That emphatically is not the Commission's intention.</p>
<p class="contents">I note that the proposed amendments to the Commission's proposal relate to three main issues. Firstly, there is the scope of the mechanism. Secondly, there is the information to be made available to the Member States and also to third parties through Member States. Thirdly and finally, there is the matter of its duration. I should like to respond to these points in that order.</p>
<p class="contents">So, firstly, on the extension of the scope: the amendments proposed in the report would considerably widen the scope of the mechanism, which covers only those market segments that the Commission has identified, in its report on the trade barriers regulation, as having already been considerably injured by unfair Korean practices. The proposal strikes a balance between a high maximum aid ceiling of 14% on the one hand and limited eligibility on the other hand. It is therefore specifically designed to counter unfair Korean practices. Any enlargement of the scope would risk changing the nature of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw Members' attention to Article 2(6) of the proposal, which provides that the Commission will keep under review the market segments eligible for aid in the light of evidence clearly proving that a specific market segment within the Community has been directly injured by unfair and opaque competitive conditions. The Commission will, accordingly, monitor the situation and keep Parliament informed of any potential review under that provision.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point relates to information provided to Member States and third parties through Member States, that is, the removal of the name and address of the applicant shipyard and prospective purchaser. That is the intention of the amendments put forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The information that has been specified in Article (2)(a) of the Commission's proposal is the minimum necessary to allow third parties to submit useful comments to the Commission and to ensure the effectiveness of the transparency procedure. The purpose of that provision is to speed up the procedure. The alternative option would be to open the formal investigation procedure in all cases where the Commission has doubts about the compatibility of aid. That would entail the full publication of detailed information relating to the notification.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there is the extension of the expiry date until 31 December 2003. It has been argued by some Members of Parliament that the expiry date of the mechanism is too early. But by the end of 2002 we will have a good idea of how the WTO action is proceeding. It would be a timely opportunity to take stock of the situation and to reassess whether special measures for shipbuilding are still considered necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission can, at that stage, propose an extension of the defensive mechanisms to the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to what I have just said on behalf of my colleague Mr Monti, I should like to reply more specifically to two or three questions that were put to the Commission just now.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, Mr Blokland claims that there is a need for structural changes and not for more aid to ailing industries. I would agree with him that ideally subsidies should support structural change. Let us hope that in this case that is true.</p>
<p class="contents">Various Members have raised the issue of compatibility with the WTO. In the Commission's view the proposal on a temporary defensive mechanism is fully compatible with WTO law subsidies, provided they are not prohibitive, are not drawn to cause so-called adverse effects and are legitimate national policy instruments as far as the WTO is concerned. Therefore the European Community has the right to grant aid to its shipbuilders. In fact the EC has been granting such aid to its shipbuilding industry for many years, up to 31 December 2000. Insofar as subsidies are not sanctions in the sense of the dispute settlement procedure, they are permitted policy measures. Therefore the recourse to dispute settlement can in no way be seen as limiting the normal rights and obligations of Members under the WTO agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, in reply to Mrs Riis-Jørgensen's question, as to whether the Commission would submit a new proposal for the reasons explained, the Commission does not see any reason to modify the proposal. Therefore the Commission has no plans to put forward a new proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is grateful for the support Parliament has so far shown for this proposal. For the reasons that I have outlined, the proposed amendments are not acceptable to the Commission. Nevertheless I very much hope that we can count on Parliament's continued support in this matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My view is that from the point of view of the working of the Members of Parliament it is very unsatisfactory that reports are continuously moved to entirely different time slots on the agenda. Mrs Peijs’s report was originally due to be considered at the afternoon session, then we were informed that it has been moved to the session starting at 9 p.m., after that a notification suddenly appeared here at 5.15 p.m. that in actual fact its processing is starting now. This kind of tossing the ball back and forth is not acceptable with regard to getting the Members’ time schedules organised.</p>
<p class="contents">Another matter I would like to draw attention to is the absence of the Council. The Council question time is starting now. Surely they would have been able to arrive half an hour earlier to discuss, for example, this matter which is very important to the shipbuilding industry. The Council, however, is again conspicuous by being absent. I deeply regret that this is happening. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We must give them the floor. Having said that, although our debates are programmed into the agenda, it is impossible to predict exactly how long they will last, give or take a few minutes or a quarter of an hour, not least because the Commissioners and the ministers sometimes take up much more speaking time than the sitting staff plan for. This is why I would ask you to show some understanding and flexibility. We have two or three minutes left before 5.30 p.m. and I therefore suspend the sitting until Council Question Time.</p>
