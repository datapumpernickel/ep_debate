<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Diamantopoulou,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission.</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Ladies and gentlemen, the Michelin case has once again brought the key issue of the restructuring of industry to the fore. We are living in a time of radical changes to industry and to companies in general – changes which have come about for a number of reasons, the main one being the complex phenomenon of globalisation. The deregulation of the capital markets, the abolition of economic borders, changes in various models as a result of high technology and the information society and global competition are all factors which often precipitate drastic changes and restructuring in industrial production.</p>
<p class="contents">What is certain is that this restructuring can be predicted and effected in many ways. The Michelin profit figures, together with the announcement that it is to shed 7,500 jobs over the next three years, has created considerable disquiet with which I sympathise. This disquiet does not relate solely to this particular company, but to what is happening and what will happen from now on in all small and large businesses in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">It would be quite realistic of me to say that no restructuring can be a smooth operation without its problems. However, restructuring can either be “intelligent”, in other words, it can take account of the social and economic cost, or it can be short-sighted by taking account of the economic cost today and paying the social cost at a much later date. Any company which fails to take account of the social dimension will have to suffer the negative consequences. </p>
<p class="contents">Our goal is most certainly “intelligent restructuring” and there are three distinctive factors which many companies already take into account. In the past, we have witnessed cases throughout the European Union which adopted both methods of restructuring. Intelligent restructuring consists primarily of a plan to address the issue of the employability of the persons concerned. Clearly, this is both a right and an obligation of the company itself. Companies should draw up strategic plans which, first and foremost, address the issue of the employability of the persons concerned. Secondly, there is no excuse for failing to give adequate notice to employees, for not giving them detailed information and for not consulting them on alternative forms of restructuring which could be just as effective but at a lower social cost. </p>
<p class="contents">The institutional framework to date in the European Union has consisted of two directives: the Directive on collective redundancies and the European Works Council Directive. These two directives constitute a minimal framework of specifications within which a company wishing to restructure can operate.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards today’s discussion, there has been no proof to date that the company in question has contravened any of the rules. We have plenty of time ahead of us to monitor its next moves. It is, however, quite clear, and so it appears in today’s case, that with the changes that are taking place around us, the way in which we deal with these changes will also need to be changed. In other words, existing rules may well need to be improved and amended or new rules may be needed. That is why, in November 1998, the European Commission submitted a directive on information and consultation of workers. This directive has, to date, been endorsed by Parliament, and I believe that today’s discussion on Michelin will spur us into further action in support of this directive. However, what is certain is that, at present, legislation alone or this particular piece of legislation cannot address the major problem of the restructuring of industry when European industry can only compete within its own borders. European industry must engage in and be able to successfully withstand global competition. </p>
<p class="contents">In previous cases, such as that of Renault, the Commission had entrusted experts to approach the issue of restructuring from the job losses perspective. The Gillenhammer report, which is well-known to Parliament, contains relevant proposals which we could follow. The first is that of the Observatory. In January, we will have the final proposal for the Observatory, which I would like to discuss with Parliament in order to decide whether or not there should be an Observatory for small and medium-sized businesses to keep them informed of imminent changes. It will be connected at national level to the local Observatories so that firms are better equipped to deal with changing times.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point concerns social dialogue. Social partners bear the responsibility for social dialogue and they could initiate special action plans within the context of the social responsibility incumbent upon all of us. The first action is to address the employability of workers. This is not only a matter of national policy; it also concerns the workers and the company itself. Companies are responsible for maintaining the employability of their workers and workers are responsible for participating in continuing training and for updating and developing their abilities and skills. Negotiations between companies and workers on lifelong learning mechanisms is one of the most serious issues of social dialogue. At the beginning of November, I shall be having my first official meeting with the European social partners and one of the key issues under discussion will be precisely this.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, and again I am borrowing ideas and proposals from the Gillenhammer report, I intend to send a letter to every company in Europe with over 1,000 employees, asking them to draft a voluntary report entitled “managing change”; this kind of benchmarking between these large companies will help us to make provision for restructuring without creating acute or major social problems. </p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, I feel it is important to touch on a number of measures which have been taken so far at European Union level in connection with the restructuring of firms. I would like to mention very briefly the decision taken just a few days ago to implement the draft on risk capital and high risk capital investments approved by the Commission last week; this will be a very important tool, particularly for small businesses. Measures include promoting cross-border innovation, promoting the mobility of wage-earners by transferring their rights and pensions, special training programmes and, of course, the exceptionally high amount, in the order of EUR 24 billion over the next 7 years, to be channelled to Objective 3 via the Structural Funds, to which all the countries belong. Objective 3, the Structural Funds programmes and, of course the employment strategy can be used to structure national and associated policies at European level on employability, entrepreneurship and the adaptability of firms and workers. </p>
<p class="contents">We have before us today a special case which is not a model worth following. This is a special case whereby there have been two announcements made by the same company; one announcing mass redundancies and the other announcing huge profits. Quite clearly, the European Union will and, in fact, must make every effort at every level to support free competition and create a free and healthy competitive area in which European companies can operate. It is also clear that Europe must primarily support what it has been proud of for centuries – the European social model. There must be no victims in the restructuring and modernisation of firms. As I said earlier, restructuring is not a smooth operation but it can be both foreseen and managed, and true, it may indeed cost us provisionally but there must be no victims. I believe that the proposals on a legislative level, and more importantly proposals resulting from the cooperation between the social partners are a good starting point from which to address these pressing issues of our time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Pronk (PPE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, we are talking about restructuring today. I want to start by offering the Commissioner my sincere congratulations. I believe that today is the first time she has been involved in a debate on social affairs. I think that we will see a lot more of her here on a variety of different occasions. But this particular debate is in fact bringing out something that is fairly essential in all debates on social and employment affairs, namely restructuring and globalisation </p>
<p class="contents">I think that it is a good thing in itself that we should discuss this subject again in this new Parliament. It is clear that restructuring is taking place on a continuous basis. That is sometimes forgotten. People tend only to consider restructuring if there are job losses. Of course jobs are often created as well but much less is said about that.</p>
<p class="contents">This debate has taken something of a strange course. That is why I would just like to make a comment about a resolution that is evidently still in circulation and is still in my name. It is a resolution that was submitted in connection with the original subject of the debate: the Michelin affair. The Presidents decided not to include this subject in today’s agenda but to talk about restructuring in general. I believe that was a very sensible decision on the part of the Bureau. But my first resolution had to do with the original subject and that is why the PPE has replaced this resolution with the Menrad resolution, which has therefore become the official PPE resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately we also succeeded in producing a compromise resolution, which replaces a number of group resolutions. The only point, and we must not beat about the bush here of course, is that it was the Michelin affair that gave rise to this debate. I do not intend to talk about this a great deal myself. I believe that it is not the place of Parliament to involve itself in decisions concerning individual companies. My group is firmly convinced of this; all the more so since there has been no mention of government funding in this concrete decision and the decision is also being dealt with in its entirety on the territory of the Republic of France. The French government, which as we all know, consists of socialists, greens and communists, has not intervened in this affair. It would therefore be extraordinarily odd if we were the ones to do so. That is another reason for not getting involved here.</p>
<p class="contents">But our fundamental position is that as a general rule we ought not to do so, particularly now that we have a European Works Council whose responsibility it is to solve these types of problem. I would like to add that consultation and information are things that can make it much easier to resolve restructuring problems. Far and away the largest section of my group is absolutely convinced of this. This was also evident from the figures. It is much easier to solve problems if there has been extensive consultation. The Commissioner said the same. But if there is an instrument, and the European Community is fortunate enough to have such an instrument, then surely it makes no sense at all to start talking about each specific case at European level. We must leave that to the consultation system within the company concerned. Even if a national government feels that it has to intervene, that is a matter for that particular national government. It is certainly not for the European Parliament to raise this but that does not alter the fact that a debate of this kind always has its place of course.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I have a brief question for the Commissioner. I have not heard government assistance mentioned. That has always been something that has played an important part in debates on restructuring, as in the case of the Hoover debate amongst others. Might the Commissioner be prepared to say something more on this issue? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Caudron (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, as the representative of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, I wish to begin my contribution to this debate on the restructuring of firms by repeating the message of the Michelin employees, a message which I understood to consist of a thrice-repeated “no”, whatever Mr Pronk might say.</p>
<p class="contents">No, ladies and gentlemen, in a balanced and prosperous Europe, it is no longer acceptable to have a firm announce a 17% increase in profits while at the same time making 7,500 employees redundant. No, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a moral situation where the share price of this firm can increase by 12% following this announcement, thus creating added value for shareholders without creating any sort of additional wealth, quite the contrary. No, ladies and gentlemen, employees can no longer be content with the incomplete and twisted, if not actually false, information issued by the Michelin bosses in attempting to justify their decision.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, this new and serious scandal which shook the media and the political milieu in France, demonstrates, if proof were needed, the urgent need for strong and appropriate action in Europe to finally reconcile economic performance and social guarantees, growth and employment, freedom to do business and the defence of wages. The European Socialists are demanding such measures and this is why they have drawn up, among other things, a number of proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, a direct link between public aid and agreements, including a reduction of working hours, with financial penalties for firms which do not respect their commitments even though they may have received public monies. The Socialists are also asking for a report on the application of the European Directive on collective redundancies, to be accompanied by proposals for improvements intended just to make it effective in defending jobs and employees. The European Socialists are insistent, finally, that the European Directive on the establishment of a European Works Council should be reviewed, so that employees can receive proper information, in the normal course of things and at the right time, and so that there can be real consultation, which presupposes that employees are given adequate resources in terms of time and independent experts.</p>
<p class="contents">Without these minimum measures and some others, accompanied by concrete measures against the relocation of firms within the European Union and other measures against social dumping outside the Union, the European social model, so dear to some of our politicians, including those on the right wing, will never be anything but empty words, and this will contribute to exacerbating the anti-European feeling pervading our countries and many employees.</p>
<p class="contents">As is often said, progress is worth nothing unless it is shared, and for us this means that, in a world of constant change, we should stop placing the main burden of effort and sacrifice on employees in order then to let the most wealthy and most powerful be the first to benefit from the positive results of this effort and sacrifice. It is more than time for action at Council and Commission level, and I would even go so far as to say, in conclusion, that this is of course a matter on which the consistency of our societies, industrial peace, the very survival of the European ideal, but also, of course, the interests of enterprise as a whole and thus of the soundness of the European economy, depend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

For this reason it is sometimes inevitable that companies will have to reorganise or introduce painful measures such as transferring or replacing employees, or if the worst comes to the worst, making them redundant. As my group sees it, neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission have the authority to intervene in the operational management of European companies. Companies ought to be free to take management decisions which will lead to growth and thus to more jobs being created. That is what Europe needs.</p>
<p class="contents">It goes without saying that my group believes that the restructuring of companies must take place following thorough and timely consultation with the works council. The right of employees to consultation and information as laid down in various European directives should be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition we should also see to it that measures taken at national and European level improve the economic climate in Europe. After all, inappropriate social or economic commitments for companies lead to more unemployment instead of more jobs</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to say, Mr President, that a number of companies in France have also reached the conclusion that there is a need for reorganisation. Better late than never because all companies must be primed for the 21st century. That will be good for Europe and will guarantee jobs in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I was born in Clermont Ferrand and live there still, Michelin’s birthplace and headquarters, and it is for this reason, amongst others, that they have been my guests here on several occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">The concomitant announcements of the axing of 7,500 jobs, the enormous increase in its profits, and the closure of the Wolbert-Michelin factory at Soissons, described as a PR mistake by the company’s directors, show to what extent cynicism and lack of respect are the driving forces behind this multinational’s industrial strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">Other identical examples are still fresh in our memory, Renault Vilvorde, the French banking system and the large distribution companies, and let us not forget Daewoo. All these companies who implement redundancy plans year after year have benefited from European and national subsidies without at any time being held accountable for the way in which they use those funds. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that our institution is duty-bound to be involved with the concerns of millions of Europeans who live in unemployment or in the fear of becoming unemployed. We must therefore be firm and clear on three points. We must work out whether the allocation of sums to large companies will result, above all else, in guaranteeing the permanence of jobs. On the eve of the opening of the WTO negotiations, we must remind everyone that any business strategy, including that of multinationals, must take the human figures into account, in the same way as the economic and financial figures, so that millions of European employees may keep their jobs and their dignity. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, at a time when a European-wide Michelin works committee has just come into being, Community legislation must be amended so that employees, or their representatives, who are concerned at the plans for collective redundancy on economic grounds can take their case to the competent local court, without waiting for the redundancy to be announced, and challenge the grounds for the decision. </p>
<p class="contents">This is the thinking behind the resolution that we are proposing and it is only if these conditions are met that Europe will maintain its political role whilst facilitating the truly sustainable economic development of businesses and protecting the rights of employees who are, let us never forget, the Union’s lifeblood. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">My Group had expressed its desire to do so at the time of the “Michelin” affair. In other words, and this has just been reiterated, the simultaneous announcement made by the management of this huge company to financial analysts of achieving substantial profits on the one hand, and the decision to shed 7,500 jobs in Europe on the other. Although this initiative was immediately welcomed by the stock exchange, where its share value immediately rose, it also caused great indignation in large sectors of public opinion, particularly in France but also in other countries, as I have seen myself. </p>
<p class="contents">To some extent, the cynicism of the “Michelin” method has had the effect of increasing tenfold the phenomenon of rejection which this modern capitalist strategy is itself bringing about, the strategy known as “share-holder value”, the creation of value for the shareholder which consists of subordinating everything, especially employment costs which in their eyes are intolerable, to the bulimic demands of the shareholders who finance business. </p>
<p class="contents">Michelin is unfortunately far from being the exception in this area. Its provocative announcement fits into the context of a veritable gangrene which we cannot allow to develop without reacting to it, unless we ourselves renounce any control over economic and social development and, as a result, the ambition to promote a European Social Model in the midst of globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to Olivetti which, having found the capital necessary for its lucrative take-over bid for Telecom Italia, arranged to shed 13,000 jobs. The same applies to Alcatel which, in order to regain the confidence of its financial shareholders, at the same time announced a net profit of FRF 15 billion, that is EUR 2.3 billion, and 12,000 job losses. The same thing applies to the banking sector where the arrival of the euro gave a veritable boost to the mergers and acquisitions which eat up jobs and which shifted the emphasis of banking towards financial and even speculative activities. The sad record is held by Renault which is gratifying its shareholders with its swingeing job cuts at Nissan even if it means exporting the most horrendous image of Europe to Japan whilst, as an indirect result, shedding several thousand jobs within the European Union itself. </p>
<p class="contents">But what can we do? Governments have some responsibility in this area, particularly in the reform of the laws on so-called “economic” redundancies. In no case should a flourishing business shed staff, let alone make employees redundant. Then there is the responsibility of the European Union. In January last year, our Parliament amended the Directive on informing and consulting workers. We are still waiting for the Commission to adopt these amendments. </p>
<p class="contents">But I think that today we must go further. To give some examples, a six-month delay for any restructuring plan should be imposed on businesses in order to allow an independent assessment by the unions. If the company has received public funds, as has already been said, including European funds, non-compliance with the rules as laid down should entail the funds being paid back. By the same token, in the Directive on European works councils, the role of these councils as well as the protection of the staff delegates should be appreciably strengthened. It is therefore up to the Commission to submit two revised proposals for a directive to us as quickly as possible. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the eve of the opening of the WTO negotiations, I want to stress the need for Europe to state its political desires, including those related to industrial policy, focusing on “employment, wealth creation and regional development”. In the face of new technologies and the information revolution, there is room for a new concept of productivity, based not on the rationing of social expenditure but on the promotion of human abilities. Contrary to the current tendency to deregulate everything, the European Union can, if it wants, provide itself with instruments which will allow it to promote just such a policy, from the taxation of speculative transactions to the establishment of selective credit which will stimulate job creation and discourage mass redundancies. </p>
<p class="contents">For its part, my Group will be addressing the main European trade union organisations in order to exchange views and, if needs be, initiate a European petition which will allow our fellow citizens to weigh up the forthcoming decisions. There has been a Vilvorde effect, the scope of which everyone remembers but which has not been reflected in new rules. We hope that the Michelin effect will instead result in concrete changes. I think that this is the standard against which our fellow citizens, faced with the kind of restructuring we are debating today, will judge the real extent of our solidarity. </p>

For my Group, the Union for a Europe of Nations, the context of this matter is rather delicate because there is the danger, on the one hand, of setting the premises for restricted competition and, on the other hand, limiting the actions of the Member States in this field, and this conflicts with the principle of subsidiarity. So a real principle that would justify the Union’s intervention here is the possibility of social discomfort that the restructuring of firms could cause within the Community and within the Member States as a whole. It is, moreover, a principle which is already provided for by the Treaty of Rome of 1957. And this is to prevent future Union policies intended to increase cohesion and social integration being rendered, even only partly, useless.</p>
<p class="contents">Given the hope that the Union will have a joint economic policy and, possibly, a joint industrial policy, in our opinion it seems appropriate in the meantime for the Union to give its opinion, especially on those restructurings which the Member States have been or are involved in, financially or otherwise. Moreover, we must stress the requirement for the Union to subject its interventions in this area to more stringent control and some checking mechanisms, both as regards the involvement with – and in any case, the information given to – trade union representatives, and also as regards the actual positive results – not just economic but also social results – of the interventions themselves. Union aid to firms has not always resulted in stable growth in the firms or protection of their employment levels.</p>
<p class="contents">In these cases, we have to ask for a broad sanction to be implemented until the amounts committed by the Union itself have been completely reimbursed. This principle must also be applied in the event that aid is given to a non-Community firm, when it is considered that a cooperation agreement with the firm’s country – if one does not already exist – might not only better formulate and integrate the Union’s interventions regarding that country, but in this desirable event it could facilitate the implementation of the above-mentioned sanction.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those on the left who are today denouncing the redundancies at Michelin have given massive approval to the ultraliberal economic policies of the European Union, as defined in the Maastricht and Amsterdam Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">You actively support globalisation but you scream at the top of your voices when European companies try to adapt to the damaging regulations that you yourselves laid down, as well as to the economic environment that you are imposing on them. Have the courage then, to face up to reality. The Michelin employees are not the victims of the Michelin management, they are the your victims, created by you, the merchants of globalisation, in the same way that employees in the banking sector, in the insurance sector, in the car industry and so many others whose companies merge, relocate or restructure just to survive are also your victims. Your globalised economy means the globalisation of unemployment and it will ensure that society as a whole goes backwards. </p>
<p class="contents">Socialist or Liberal governments and the European Commission, also under the sway of the dogma of globalisation, are jointly responsible for this situation. They have constantly deceived and manipulated the workers of Europe. They are capitulating at the height of the campaign, before the negotiations of the Millennium Round even open, refusing to fight effectively against social dumping, refusing to force through a necessary social clause and abandoning the principle of Community preference. </p>
<p class="contents">So, in favouring the free circulation of capital throughout the world, in seeking to liberalise investments even further, European governments are transforming Anglo-Saxon pension funds into the real masters of the economic and financial markets. Tomorrow, these stateless multinationals will be the uncontrolled masters of the economy, but also of the new world order that you pray for. The only possible policy for the full employment of the European workforce is to win back the internal market, to protect it against unfair competition, to reject this criminal and antisocial globalisation, and to re-establish the necessary rule of Community preference. In short, it is to produce European, in Europe, with Europeans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Helmer (PPE).</span></span>   – Mr President, let me first of all support the point made by the EPP Group that this debate deals primarily with one company in one Member State and that it is therefore not an appropriate topic for the EU institutions to deal with. In any case Michelin is facing a competitive challenge which absolutely requires it to raise productivity and that means lay-offs. I understand there has been concern about a bicycle tyre factory. But Michelin can import bicycle tyres for half the cost of production in France. No company can go on in those circumstances. The question is, do we want Europe to be a bicycle tyre economy or a modern high-tech economy.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally I want to challenge an idea which is prevalent in this House, especially in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. There is an assumption that we can save jobs and enhance employment prospects by discouraging companies from laying-off workers who are no longer needed. This idea may seem plausible but it is wholly mistaken and counterproductive. If we keep jobs on life support when they are past their sell-by dates, we damage productivity and make European industry less competitive. We keep workers in loss-making situations where they destroy value, rather than freeing them up to take up new jobs in profitable industries where they can create wealth.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the Anglo-Saxon model with flexible labour markets workers frequently lose their jobs but it does not matter because they quickly get new ones.</p>
<p class="contents">(<span class="italic">Mixed reactions</span>)</p>
<p class="contents">Under the inflexible sclerotic European social model we struggle to keep workers in failing businesses and when they finally lose their jobs they may well be unemployable. This is why Europe has much higher unemployment and much higher long-term unemployment that the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we should remember that governments do not create jobs, European institutions do not create jobs; businesses create jobs. Our task, as regulators, is to create an environment in which businesses and jobs can prosper. We should not be asking industry to deliver social protection objectives. Let us have governments deal with social security and leave industry free to create wealth and jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hughes (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, right at the outset I would like to say to Mr Helmer and others that people on this side of the House are not in the business of shackling or hampering the decision-making capabilities of businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">What we would like to do is to encourage them to look after their investors. But when I talk about investors I am not just talking about shareholders. I also mean the thousand of workers in companies like Michelin who invested their time, energy, knowledge, skills, their hopes and aspirations, and those of their families, in the company they have worked for for many years. I mean the investment of the communities that underpin and sustain them. I mean, as well, all of us here and out there in the rest of the European Union as taxpayers. Public money, directly or indirectly, is involved in these enterprises; regional, national and European money and, as Mr Nobilia said a short while ago, it should not come without strings attached.</p>
<p class="contents">A good company will look after its workforce. It will work in partnership with its workforce and it will encourage involvement, partnership and innovation. A good company will not treat its workforce or the community housing it as factors of production to be disposed of lightly in a global game of profit and loss.</p>
<p class="contents">We in this House have become accustomed to the idea of externalities in environmental policy, with the bill for the costs of dirty practices being picked up not by the enterprise in question, but by society more broadly. Perhaps we need to think in similar terms when it comes to the social responsibilities of enterprises like Michelin. Otherwise the danger is that the main burden will only be upon the shareholders.</p>
<p class="contents">We clearly have an imbalance within the European Union. On the one hand, considerable freedom for companies to restructure and move but very few rights for the workers involved. Even where we have rights in European legislation, rights for example to be consulted well in advance about decisions on collective redundancies or other major changes affecting livelihoods, the law is not being properly observed or applied. We need to revisit that.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a number of outstanding issues to tackle at European level. We need to review and improve the law on individual and collective dismissals and on works councils. We need a general framework on information and consultation and we also need a review of the law on transfers, mergers and take-overs – not involved here but in the banking and insurance sector for example.</p>
<p class="contents">The 12% rise in the share value of Michelin in the days following the announcement shows what a cynical and deliberate manipulation of the stock market was involved here. I find that totally reprehensible and I hope all right-thinking people in this House will feel the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on a point of order, genuinely a point of order. Mr President, I would draw this to your attention. I signed a resolution, a compromise text, along with others, two days ago. That resolution contained in the final paragraph a reference to Michelin. The resolution which has now been circulated to be voted upon tomorrow no longer contains that reference. Someone in the sessional services has removed it without any reference back to those of us who signed it. That is a very serious matter indeed and I hope you will investigate it fully and report back to this House.</p>

<p class="contents">What we have all been saying for a while is that, in fact, the goal being pursued by a growing number of companies who are restructuring is to provide their shareholders with more and more guarantees, and to ensure ever greater profitability for their financial investments. That is why the management of the Michelin Group simultaneously announced the axing of 7,500 jobs and fantastic profits. That is why, as you pointed out, announcements of redundancy plans are always followed by a rise in the share prices of the companies concerned. </p>
<p class="contents">This violent expression of scorn for employees and their lives fundamentally contradicts our stated objectives in favour of employment, social and regional cohesion, and the European Social Model. What do you expect the employees who are being made redundant from the Wolbert-Michelin factory at Soissons to think of these objectives and our determination to take them forward? The social desperation that these decisions generate is inevitably transformed into political desperation and this political desperation is a permanent threat to democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">That is why the European Union must make its actions match its words and must uphold its commitments to employment and to the right to live in dignity. How can it do so now, at the moment, when it is confronted with the brutal, unilateral decisions of huge companies? First of all, the European Union must unequivocally condemn this type of decision and support the employees concerned. No, Mr Pronk, huge companies do not have the authority of divine right for their decisions. It is the responsibility of politicians to intervene and to say what they think of these decisions. </p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must also acknowledge the end of a magical formula that all the European Institutions keep trotting out, according to which growth plus competition would necessarily equal employment and development. This is wrong and has been proved to be so! We will have to draw conclusions from such a statement, in order to bring ourselves to reconsider the foundations of our European employment strategy and of our economic guidelines. We must provide for increasing the power of employees and their representatives in order to strengthen their right to contest the basis for the economic reasons behind their redundancy, which we shall call the Wolbert-Michelin amendment and which we shall submit for your vote tomorrow. It is not acceptable for the definition and the management of the general interest to be hijacked by the economic decision-makers.

<p class="contents">I am of course equally disgusted by the plans for lay-offs by Renault-Nissan, by Alsthom, by Rhône-Poulenc, Hoechst Marion Roussel and many other companies. What they have in common is the fact that they are all making considerable profits and are nevertheless sacking workers, or making them redundant, the consequences of which are almost as serious, for every job axed means one more unemployed person. Companies behaving in this way, their customers and their major shareholders are the people mainly responsible for the seriousness of unemployment and for the physical, and even moral poverty that this creates. </p>
<p class="contents">We think that redundancies by all companies who are making profits should be prohibited, subject to requisition. Favouring the enrichment of a handful of major shareholders whilst forcing tens of thousands of men and women into unemployment and into poverty is a criminal attitude, and I choose my words carefully. Company profits are the result of the work of all its employees; those profits should be used to maintain existing jobs as a matter of priority, and to create new ones, by sharing out the work without reducing wages. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, today’s debate has become absurd, given that we are talking about restructuring firms and what should be acceptable profits and what should not, in the great liberal Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">I think that, if many of the opinions we have heard today were to prevail, we would be building a Europe of poverty and unemployment and not a Europe of employment and wealth. What is the point in saying that Michelin’s profits have increased by 17%, without saying whether that is more or less than the profits of Bridgestone, Goodyear or other competitors, and without saying that Michelin is a company with a turnover of 106 dollars per employee, as compared to Goodyear’s 141 dollars per employee. Then there is Renault, in which if I am not mistaken, the French Government is a major shareholder, that went to Japan, bought a company there – Nissan – but to keep it open found itself forced to make 21,000 workers redundant, but as they are Japanese, do we really care? I think that, instead, we should bring into question the European social model which is the social model of the Europe of unemployment and taxes, the Europe where trade unions have enormous power, stifle economic growth and prevent millions of unemployed Italians, French and Germans and millions of immigrants finding work, in order to protect situations which are often nothing more than situations of privilege. </p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Parliament asked President Duisenberg to subordinate monetary policy to the need for growth in a Europe which does not know how to reform itself, how to reform its economies or to liberalise the markets, especially the job market. If this is the Europe we are building, we are hypocrites because we are building a Europe where unemployment will reign and companies will close. But when there are no more firms, maybe there will not even be any tears left to shed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This means that within the Union, we must arrive at a real coordination of fiscal policies and at a definition of comparable social norms for everyone, so that we no longer experience the distortions of competition that are still too marked today. This also means that we must prepare our companies to support globalisation and to adapt to it. We might wish that this globalisation did not exist, but it does. It is up to us to manage it in such a way that its negative aspects can be avoided. In this context, we find ourselves facing the difficult problem of relocation. The problem is difficult because obviously it eliminates jobs in Europe, difficult because the people vilifying relocations today are the same people who are, at the same time, demanding that Europe should multiply its investment in developing countries and should make it as easy as possible for products made in those countries to enter European Union territory. </p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Michelin affair is concerned, since everyone is talking about it, despite our all saying that it is not the subject under discussion, on the day the Michelin redundancies were announced, Pirelli was doing the same thing, on just the same scale, but nobody is talking about that. Michelin today consists of 82 production plants, 48 of which are in Europe. I would be very interested to know how many car manufacturers, including those in public ownership, or tyre manufacturers, including those in semi-public ownership, still have such a major presence in Europe today and have not already quietly relocated, sometimes with the assistance of governments, including left-wing governments.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, we should tell it like it is. Michelin has, it is true, reduced the number of its jobs by 25,000 in twenty years but, I would like to remind some people, these are 25,000 job losses due to levels of productivity which are comparable in all sectors of industry, and particularly in the car and tyre industries. These are 25,000 job losses, only 186 of which have been redundancies. So for goodness’ sake, let us stop trying to find scapegoats for the way industry or restructuring is evolving.</p>
<p class="contents">People are telling us to just look at the profits being made on the stock markets. Well, excuse me. Do look at the profits made on the stock market, but look at all the profits for all businesses for last year or the last two years, and let me remind Mr Wurtz that he, or rather his friends, are members of a government which does nothing to stop profits being made on the stock market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And the Michelin case, which I do not want to talk about in detail because other speakers have already done so, gives us the opportunity for this debate. </p>
<p class="contents">In many Member States – as recent history reminds us – there have been cases of restructuring: indeed, history is full of cases of restructuring, relocations and firm closures – Mr Wurtz reminded us of some – which not only reduce employment, but jeopardise the economic and social cohesion of affected areas, create a climate of social insecurity among workers and create a climate which certainly does not encourage development and growth. The requirement for greater competitiveness of firms, especially in the era of globalisation of the economy must, however, be able to combine the necessary flexibility within companies with the security of workers. These processes, these phenomena which are becoming increasingly more frequent, must be regulated using the instruments available and these must be improved. Commissioner Diamantopoulou, whom I would like to thank for the clarity of her statement, spoke of intelligent restructuring. The existing instruments for prevention and management of the phenomena must be used both at national and European level, because job losses, Mr Pronk, concern Europe. They do not only concern individual countries, but all of us. </p>
<p class="contents">In particular, the case we are discussing today should give the Commission the chance to pledge today, before the European Parliament, that it will make an assessment, a revision of the Directive on redundancies and the closure of companies to make it more effective in terms of protecting jobs. Moreover, we need to speed up the re-examination of the Works Council Directive, strengthening information processes and consultation in particular but, I would add, we must also include in that directive the fundamental issue of sanctions. Rules must be obeyed, and those who do not obey them must pay the price.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The resolution which were are now debating is a mixture of styles, of individual contributions, whose result is an extraordinarily unequal combination. But some of the reflections, especially those expressed by Mr Pronk, seem to me to be particularly important.</p>
<p class="contents">But, allow me to say that those of us who believe that only competitive companies can create employment, and that only by creating employment can the European social model be preserved, have emerged the winners. And those who believe, by means of public intervention, in a type of arbitrary inventiveness, have emerged the losers.</p>
<p class="contents">But, having said that, those of us who believe in the market and belong to this side of the Hemicycle, far from the autarchic temptations of some parts of this Assembly, believe that the principle of social compensation must counter-balance the principle of a functioning market.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I am especially pleased that our resolution opts for social dialogue as a method for resolving conflicts. I am also pleased that it opts to implement the Social Charter, the Social Protocol, by means of specific measures. I am also glad that it refers to the need to review this fiscal set-up, which tempts companies to relocate to areas where there is a more favourable tax system. And finally, I am happy that employment should be a fundamental principle, a principle which underpins all policies, especially with regard to public aid.</p>
<p class="contents">However, to those on the other side of the House, I would say that those people who tried to throw the textile machines into the rivers of Manchester, in order to save jobs, were wrong because we live in an era which is infinitely better than the one which they wanted to preserve. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If it were in fact the case that the market could regulate itself, then we should not today be speaking about Michelin. It is also a spectacular mistake, Mr Pronk, to believe that this is not an issue for this House. We spoke here a number of years ago about Renault, too, and also quite rightly. 7,500 jobs are being destroyed, and that is an especially negative record for a company to set here. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we must talk about this matter here because employees in Europe expect us, the European Union, to direct the process of globalisation and to regulate necessary modernisation and companies’ adjustments to the market in intelligent ways, that is to say in ways which take the social contract into account. The European Union has a number of directives for doing this which, however, are being applied all too cautiously here. It seems to me to be symptomatic of Michelin’s policy as a company that it is only at the end of this year that it has established a European Works Committee. </p>
<p class="contents">There will be further economic changes in the EU but, for us Social Democrats, it should go without saying that employees and their unions are to be included in this process, that they are to be informed of developments in good time and that their proposals are to be examined seriously. If, Commissioner, you will be sharpening the tools available to the EU, we shall most certainly support you and accompany you in the process. I should like to express my thanks to those of Michelin’s employees who are here today. I should also like to have seen that kind of commitment from the owners. A rise in profits for the first six months of over 17% is really excellent, but these profits ought to be invested by the companies in new products, new environmentally friendly production methods and, above all, in employee training too. That would be a contribution to social peace, and the share markets would then have every good reason to see an increase in value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Global players<span class="italic"> </span>in Europe have no choice other than to lay themselves open to competition in world markets. In the opinion of the Group of the European People’s Party, instances of rejection on social grounds are simply to be avoided. None of this is a completely new phenomenon. When I first entered Parliament ten years ago, I was approached by works committees from a cable fibre factory in my constituency. Their company had just been taken over by a large group in France. The employees were hoping first of all to have more secure jobs now. More by chance than by anything else, they learned that the distant head office of the French concern wanted to close the factory it had taken over within three months. It is when sore points like this come up that the Directive on European Works Councils comes in. This has been predominantly successful. We should also let it be known here, as a success story and positive message, that 600 new European Works Councils have been created in the last couple of years. It is still often the case, though, that not enough information is provided soon enough. An amendment to the Directive would definitely be appropriate here, Commissioner. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must also insist that all companies and groups fulfil their now legally accepted duties to offer information and consultation and that there must be consequences if they do not do so. </p>
<p class="contents">I close with the observation by the Christian Democrat Minister of Labour under whose chairmanship the Directive on European Works Councils was adopted. Lack of information results in uncertainty, mistrust and, in the end, only anxiety. Information and consultation mean transparency, which creates trust and does away with losses due to friction in European companies. Employers and employees are then winners in equal parts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This allows us to take up some of the ideas again by way of a conclusion. </p>
<p class="contents">This resolution on restructuring in industry has arisen today because one company, Michelin, decided to make 7,500 people redundant. Of course the situation is tragic, but it is interesting to note today that we are able to talk about restructuring in industry not from a purely economic point of view, but raising the human issues that it involves. I think that it is quite right to link this resolution to Michelin’s situation. To axe 7,500 jobs today, when neither a company’s financial or industrial output allow us to attribute these redundancies to some kind of crisis, is quite unacceptable from the legal point of view alone.</p>
<p class="contents">From the human point of view, this situation is not only unacceptable; it is indecent and immoral. The fact that a simple PR exercise allows a company’s share value to rise by 12% whilst no extra value has been created, no extra tyre has been manufactured or sold, giving the impression that huge sums of money could simply appear spontaneously as a result of the financial markets alone, shows utter contempt for human labour. While shareholders are selling their stock and making a gain, men and women are finding out that they will be the only ones to suffer from the situation. This is the heavy price that European employees must pay so that a few investors can maximise their return.</p>
<p class="contents">In the measures that have been proposed, Commissioner, you talked about social costs and the way we should take them into account in the long term. It is obviously essential, as a matter of urgency, that this measure is complemented by strengthening the directives on collective redundancies and European Company statutes. It is also essential to envisage new forms of social redistribution, financed by the shareholders of prosperous companies that make employees redundant with the sole aim of increasing the price of their shares. Finally we are waiting for an explanation which will enable us to find out if we will be able to vote on this compromise resolution, omitting the word Michelin. In any case, this debate has clearly shown the political division in this House which does not disappear even in supposedly “compromise” resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I say that with real feeling and authority because I have been in that position myself. I have been unemployed and it is no fun.</p>
<p class="contents">But the best way to promote job security is for companies to be successful. The best way for companies to be successful is for them to be competitive in the global market. To disagree with some people opposite, it may not look good in the newspapers but the best time – indeed the only time – to make restructuring plans is when you are strong. If you wait until you are weak, you have to take much greater action and lay off more people. That is very much a fact of life.</p>
<p class="contents">Companies clearly have many responsibilities but their primary responsibility is to survive as an employer and to take the necessary steps in order to do that – and I do not believe it is for us in this House to lecture them on the best way to do it or to comment upon whether that restructuring is “intelligent” or not. Rather it is for us and indeed for governments to see what we can do to help, as far as is possible, avoid the problem in the first place. That means looking to see where we can reduce the burden of unnecessary regulation which adds costs to business and to see how far we can reduce the non-wage costs on business which, in turn, encourage companies to shed labour as the best way of saving large sums of money. That is the real issue which we should be debating today.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally I would say that all too often government intervention can get in the way and make companies less competitive. We must make sure for the credibility of this House that we do not fall into the same trap. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Martin, Hans-Peter (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, this dispute we are witnessing here about which direction to take really is an interesting one. The European company landscape is changing at a pace never before seen, but the pattern which, in our view, these changes follow is always the same. Through restructuring and mergers, new giant companies come into being in their respective branches of industry, and their record on jobs – if it is the big companies you look at – is practically never good. In the German banking industry alone, more than 100,000 jobs are being lost at present. Millions of employees in Europe rightly fear for their jobs and, at the same time, the company reorganisations and restructurings are accompanied by rising share prices, at least in the short term. The fact is very often ignored that only a very few people benefit from this new distribution of profits, for it is a very modest minority who hold any shares at all. And, in contrast to what you said, Commissioner, Michelin is not in fact, heaven knows, an isolated case. Other speakers have in fact already made this very clear. </p>
<p class="contents">Those who carry out the restructuring always argue that they had no other choice. You just have to adapt now; no-one can avoid the growing concentrations of businesses. The result, however, is a very dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy and, in more and more branches of industry, we are heading for dangerous market concentrations. I am certain that, in the future, we shall still be very much occupied with this question precisely here in the European Parliament. We therefore need initiatives for a workable European law on cartels. </p>
<p class="contents">I should also like briefly to emphasise two further aspects. In the course of powerful and radical changes, small and medium-sized companies in particular come under a very great deal of pressure. While large companies are setting their sights on yields of 15% on invested capital, more and more suppliers are seeing their profit margins shrink. In the end, it is the small and medium-sized companies which, in addition to the employees, are having to bear the largest share of the tax burden. Those who come out on top from the mergers and restructurings also understand how legally to avoid paying tax. In this way, Europe is heading for a genuinely dangerous and unbalanced state of affairs. Our social peace is placed in the greatest jeopardy if scarcely more than a fifth of society benefits from developments and the remainder lag behind. Any commitment which runs counter to this development ought now therefore to be persistently supported. We are not concerned here with a law of nature. We must have the courage to demand also of those who profit from the reorganisations that they should make a relevant contribution to social tasks. To that extent, it is important that national tax policies should be coordinated in such a way that transfers of capital and of companies on the basis of tax advantages alone should be prevented. </p>
<p class="contents">However, that is not enough. Never since the Second World War has there been such an imbalance in economic and political power. In this connection, the opportunity for employees, as well as small and medium-sized companies, to organise themselves on a cross-border basis ….</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(The President cut the speaker off)</span></p>
<p class="contents">That is why it is crucially important to strengthen the European Works Councils. I urge the Council, the Commission and the European Parliament to concentrate on these central questions and to put the finishing touches, above all, to the European Works Councils and not only to the issue of offering consultation and information. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Every company, every entrepreneur, is of course out principally to create a monopoly. The entrepreneur himself or company itself would like to have a monopoly. Suppliers and customers are naturally opposed to this so that, here too, there is pressure in the direction of a market economy. I believe – and this is what makes it so interesting – that the market economy is there in the first place for the benefit of the consumer and therefore stands in the way of monopolists. The consumer creates jobs through his decision to purchase products and services which are of use to him. I believe that this triangle of success we have, with the company on the one side with its owners and shareholders, the employees on the second side and the consumers on the third side just has to be successful. Everyone must gain some advantage. We must see to it that there is a win-win situation here and that everyone benefits when products and services are offered which are bought by consumers. What we need as a priority here is a development initiative. We must ensure that we see electronic commerce and many other technologies introduced quickly and efficiently. We need a dramatically strengthened and improved infrastructure. In very many areas in this regard, we are still limping along behind. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, research too. We are discussing minimum amounts for research here. Having new and efficient products, however, is precisely what the consumer values. This is where we also need a new culture at European level. In the European social partnership – and here I should like to support Hans-Peter Martin – we need new emphases which permit a win-win situation arising for all three types of participant: namely for companies, employees and consumers. In Europe too, then, we shall have the chance to live in prosperity in the future. If today we consider the enlargement of the European Union, then prosperity is one of the central and most important questions in connection with enlargement as well. I should like to ask the Commissioner to ensure that, where the European budget too is concerned, we have a situation in which more money is put into budget lines which promote jobs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Quite clearly, the Michelin issue is an issue which is at the heart of the preoccupations of the European Union at this time; that is, the issue of competitiveness on the one hand and social cohesion on the other. Comparisons have been made with other countries and other continents by way of example. I believe that we have a lot to learn from the United States of America on the issue of monetary policy and on the issue of the use of high technology and the fast functions at that level. However, there is, of course, a significant difference in Europe: the cultural, social and historical model of Europe is based on stringent social forces and on the balance between society and the economy. </p>
<p class="contents">It was said that Europe will have to create an environment for our companies. However, we should also have a corresponding environment for our citizens and the two must be created at the same time. </p>
<p class="contents">It is clear from the extremely productive debate which has ensued that this preoccupation applies to both sides. The means may differ but it is clear that both sides have the same preoccupation. Can the European Union intervene? I think the answer must be “yes” because the market does not operate according to natural laws, it is not a natural phenomenon. It calls for intervention by the political powers. And we, the European Parliament and the Commission, form part of the political powers of Europe. At the European Union level, therefore, there should be three levels of intervention. </p>
<p class="contents">The first level is in the area of legislation and institutional intervention. There have already been proposals from the European Parliament on the two directives you mentioned, the Directive on the European Works Council and the Directive on collective redundancies. The initial assessment of these two directives shows that they work well, but at present amendments tabled by Parliament are being processed and in January 2000 we will be able to begin discussions on these two directives. </p>
<p class="contents">The second directive, concerning information and consultation of workers, has, as you are aware, already been tabled for discussion at the Council of Ministers. I believe that it would not be wise at this stage, since we are working on promoting the directive, to begin amending it. It is, however, certain that this will be one of the areas in which the European Parliament will be playing a pivotal role. Again in the area of institutional and legislative intervention, interesting proposals have been made to shift the tax burden away from labour costs, away from the taxation of workers, and on to environmental factors and the directives on employment have provided an initial incentive to move in this direction. </p>
<p class="contents">I consider that at this level, we can, within a general framework of either broad economic guidelines or broad employment guidelines, learn a lot at national level, i.e. we could have a form of benchmarking, an exchange of information and successful models already in place at national levels to address this major problem of restructuring which faces us on all levels. Banking was mentioned, and this is one of the problems which will face us, but of course, Europe has vast experience and a history of restructuring, beginning with the textile factories and shipyards, through to the industries of today. </p>
<p class="contents">The second level is that of institutional operations. I would like to refer here to social dialogue, an issue which a number of MEPs have already raised. Please allow me to refer to an extract from the recent document by UNICE, the Union of Industrial and Employers’ Confederations of Europe. The document concerns the issue of liberating the workforce of Europe and includes the opinions of companies on European social policy beyond 2000. It states that European companies regard themselves as an integral part of society which means that they operate in a socially responsible way. It mentions that European companies view profit as their main goal, but not their sole reason for existing and they prefer to take a long-term approach to strategic decisions and investments. In addition, they are prepared to accept their responsibilities and one of the main challenges which they face is the complexity of the demands made on them by the various social factors (workers, consumers, capital investors, public authorities, environmentalists and other interest groups). </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, when one side of industry – the side faced with global competition and which, we all agree, should be supported and protected since we have a strong interest in European companies being able to compete at a global level – begins to voice its concerns over society and maintaining social equilibrium, we have a very strong argument for developing and supporting social dialogue. Please allow me to make one political remark: these positions are based neither on charitable perceptions nor on socialist ideas. They are based on the completely realistic assessment that, without social cohesion in Europe, which is an area of powerful social forces, social conflict will arise. In turn, this social conflict will have negative repercussions on economic stability, i.e. the environment which competition and companies need in order to develop. </p>
<p class="contents">Enhancing social dialogue is, in my view, of fundamental importance. Yesterday saw the beginning of the technical element of the first form of macroeconomic dialogue in Europe. The political element of this dialogue will begin on 8 November and for the first time social partners expressing their social concerns on the issue of employment, banks outlining their monetary policy, and the Member States, which are the political forces in Europe, will sit at the same table. Supporting and promoting social dialogue is not only essential but it is also a prerequisite on a more microeconomic level for every form of restructuring within firms. </p>
<p class="contents">This brings me onto my third issue: actions and policies. At a European level, we have, and for the first time this is being enforced, a European Employment strategy, with 22 directives which have been incorporated into the Member States’ employment plans. As I mentioned earlier, substantial funding is also available. These broad guidelines and the funding of many of these policies include a lot of the proposals we have heard here, such as special tax relief for workers and for small and medium-sized businesses, financial assistance for the education or further education of those workers facing either redundancy or restructuring, social packages to support the social network in cases of major restructuring, continuing training and providing workers with new skills and qualifications so that they can respond to restructuring. Naturally, at a time when changes are taking place at such alarming rates, enough can never be done. Plans drawn up yesterday will never suffice for today.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention the issue of state aid and how we can combine state aid with company profits. History shows us that companies cannot operate under laws which prescribe employee numbers or profit margins. But the political forces can clearly intervene in how those profits are invested and in how much is invested in high technology, the environment or in manpower in ways which were mentioned earlier. Such guidelines can be imposed and can be adhered to. Therefore, at a time of such rapid change, there will have to be scope for modification and reorientation of these guidelines on a daily basis. There has already been exceptional cooperation and exchanges of views at this level within Europe. I would like to assure you that constant communication between the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and the Works Councils will steadily pilot the Commission towards further and, as far as possible, more flexible and fundamental intervention in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
