<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Halonen,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council. – (FI)</span> Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, first I would like to express my thanks for the opportunity to present the European Union’s first annual report on human rights. My intention is not to repeat the content of the report, but to take a look at the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Developing the EU’s policy on human rights is a huge challenge that requires courage combined with forbearance. To be effective, the EU must be able to achieve cooperation at many levels. Cooperation has first to be enhanced among the institutions of the EU. The EU must also be ready to cooperate more widely with civil society and the NGOs. The EU supports the work of human rights defenders everywhere in the world. For this we need the input of the NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU must also act in cooperation with international organisations such as the Council of Europe, the OSCE and the UN. This will also require a willingness to embrace transparency. On the other hand, the EU’s aspirations with regard to visibility must not lead to a situation where there is overlap or its cooperation with other organisations becomes problematic.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report on human rights must be seen, on account of what I have said before, as part of a process to strengthen the position of human rights in the Union. I believe we all want to develop the Union in such a way that it can act more effectively on behalf of human rights throughout the world than has been the case thus far. Speaking in the European Parliament, I do not have to single out the reasons why this work is necessary. You know this: reports on violations of human rights are common in the media. I am convinced that our work on behalf of human rights will also have the steadfast support of the people of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report on human rights replaces the Council’s former annual memorandum on human rights to Parliament. The purpose of the change is to increase and broaden information on the work and priorities of the Council. In this way we are trying to create a forum for deeper and more analytical discussions on the work done by the EU for the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this connection I would also like to refer to the EU’s first human rights forum which ended earlier today, and which many of us also attended. The forum witnessed an intense debate, and one that looked to the future, on many of the themes of the annual report. The forum was intended as the start of a more regular and broader dialogue than was the case previously on the priorities and challenges associated with the EU’s policy on human rights. This approach also earned the support of those attending. I am myself also convinced that the forum has a future. Feedback on how the forum might be developed further and improved will obviously be welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">But why should the EU publish a report on human rights every year?</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the Council sees it as a way of strengthening transparency with regard to the EU’s human rights policy. The enhancement of transparency has been one of the main areas of focus during the Finnish Presidency, as you know. When we speak of human rights, transparency is of particular importance. It is necessary to reinforce dialogue and cooperation, as we all have our own role to play in this issue. The annual report covers the period from the beginning of June 1998 up to the end of June 1999. This period was chosen so that the EU June Summit meetings could be included in the report. This is the timeframe that we intend to cover in future annual reports as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, through this annual report we are trying to increase consistency in EU human rights policy by means of this annual report. I myself think that the main challenge to the EU policy on human rights is consistency and credibility in different forums. For the first time, the report combines the work of the EU in different international organisations with our relations to third countries. The report discusses the work in respect of the first and second pillars. In drafting the annual report we realised that no corresponding information had been systematically compiled anywhere before. We also learnt that we really had to establish consistency in the work of the Union beyond the boundaries of the pillars.</p>
<p class="contents">The annual report this time focuses on the EU’s external relations. This first annual report, however, already includes a section that discusses EU action to prevent racism within the EU’s own territory. For the work of the EU to gain credibility, we must ourselves observe those same principles with respect to human rights that we demand from others. In future, there will be a need to examine the situation within the Union more broadly, as we said when we were preparing the report. We must be fully prepared for this. For example, in future, greater consideration might be given to the topics of asylum and refugees as they constitute an essential aspect of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The purpose behind the annual report is to describe the work of the EU and its thematic content over a given period. It does not therefore attempt to be a comprehensive depiction of the human rights situation in different countries. It may be that this will prove to be necessary later. It may be justifiable to examine the situation in different countries more closely. However, that would require more developed mechanisms and facilities for coherent monitoring and analysis than the EU possesses at present.</p>
<p class="contents">The first chapters of the report describe the bases of the EU’s policy on human rights. These include the principles of universality and indivisibility. After this we have tried to describe the key players and systems in the EU arena and with regard to international organisations. There is also a section on priorities and questions of human rights according to theme, such as the rights of women, children and minority groups, and opposition to the death penalty and racism. We also, justifiably, attach weight to the importance of economic, social and cultural rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite aware that the content and form of the report need improving although we have already tried to make it concise and readable. Since the annual report was approved in the Council it has also been available on the Internet. In addition, it is to be published in all EU languages in the Council’s series of publications and it will be circulated far and wide. This is because we think it is an important part of the promotion of human rights to ensure that people know what these rights are all about.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Amsterdam and the regulations on human rights that have recently entered into force will improve the EU’s chances of promoting human rights. These increased opportunities must now be backed up by something tangible and meaningful. In this regard, the EU policy on human rights is at a dynamic development stage. Feedback from Parliament on this first annual report and its recommendations will also be most welcome. As a result, we could make headway in the next annual report in a direction that we will have decided upon together.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to mention one point as a separate item. As I said at the start, we need deeper and more analytical cooperation with other European organisations, such as the Council of Europe and the OSCE. This is no mere polite expression of a wish, but a very important area to focus on when the EU contemplates its action in this area. We have to avoid duplicating the work. We will not tolerate the creation of double standards, which would be a problem for the applicant countries as well as ourselves. Monitoring human rights in practice means monitoring the application of these human rights standards. The development of these standards is an area in which the experience of the Council of Europe is greatest. We in the Union should thus make use of the experience of others.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the working party set up to produce a Charter of Fundamental Rights is also now in a very important position. In putting it together efforts were made to take different areas of expertise into account. Hopefully, we will receive sound advice from the group on how we can increase the amount of work the EU does to improve human rights, in such a way that we acquire some genuine added value and it is not just a question of putting our initials to these issues.</p>
<p class="contents">My vision is that human rights will, in future, become more prominent in very different areas of debate. The active discussion on human rights at the preliminary round of WTO talks at Seattle is a good indication of this. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning the outcome of the meeting at Tampere. In the future, the EU has to take more obvious account of the impact all its work has on the implementation of human rights. The European Parliament, you yourselves, have an important role to play in this. I appreciate it that Parliament closely monitors human rights issues and passes comment, sometimes forcefully and using colourful language, on the actions of governments. In so doing, Parliament significantly complements intergovernmental cooperation. I hope that the first annual report on human rights for its part will facilitate the realisation of this welcome development.</p>
<p class="contents">I have purposefully shortened my speech somewhat, as we are behind schedule and, unfortunately, the airline I am travelling with will not delay the departure of my flight just because I am late.</p>

I think that this publication will strengthen the visibility of the European Union in the field of human rights considerably. The Commission was actively involved in the drafting of the report and worked closely with both the German and the Finnish Presidencies. The Commission feels that a stronger balance should be struck between the three pillars of the European Union in future reports, in order to give a more comprehensive overview of the human rights situation at European level. This report concentrates mainly on questions of common foreign and security policy. One way of achieving greater balance in the future might be to take a more thematically structured approach focusing, for example, on particularly vulnerable groups, such as women and children, or specific questions, such as the monitoring of elections. The Commission will, of course, continue to help the Presidency-in-Office to draft these reports.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that my colleague Chris Patten, who is very sorry that he is unable to be here today due to a foreign policy commitment, and Poul Nielson and I shall issue a communication on the promotion of human rights and democratisation in our external relations. This communication will be adopted by the Commission in the first half of 2000 and will supplement the Council report on the human rights situation in that it will detail what specific action the Community can take in order to promote human rights in third countries, so that our declarations are backed up by serious, concrete initiatives and support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I can remember making this request in December 1979 when the Russian troops were getting together to invade Afghanistan. For some reason, over these past twenty years the Council of Ministers or the ministers meeting in political cooperation have been unwilling to put together a document. Now at least we have a document, although I have to say that it is rather thin soup. The careful balance the Commissioner mentioned needs to be made very carefully, but we need facts and details on how the human rights situation throughout the world is being handled. I trust that this first document will be just one step along the way towards bringing us together and helping us to tackle human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been an abominable year after all. We have had war, murder, genocide, racism, xenophobia, and I wish we could have had something a little bit more powerful in this document, which was, I have to say, distributed very quickly. It found itself in our pigeon-holes today and it was there for debate with the human rights forum which the President referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">These things are in need of quick action. At the human rights forum this morning I spoke to one of the President-in-Office’s Finnish colleagues from the Finnish Foreign Ministry, about a particular case mentioned by the European Parliament recently, the case of Alexander Nikitin, a man who is on trial just a few miles away from Helsinki, for high treason. He is facing the death penalty because he reported on the ecological disaster of nuclear submarines in the Murmansk area. I take it this matter is of interest to the Finnish Government, but even though I raised this question with a member of the Finnish Foreign Office, we still do not have any information and the man is on trial today, and tomorrow. I imagine it is familiar to those who are sitting with the Council of Ministers. I hope someone can tell us something about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this is, I suppose, the parliament in Europe that takes human rights the most seriously, and we have great possibilities in dealing with countries that violate human rights. I believe that we have to look much more carefully at this question, to tackle those countries that behave disgracefully; the so-called fingernail-pulling governments need to be taken to task, and the European Parliament must be the institution that takes the lead in making sure that human rights are top of our agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will, I hope, improve the information given to the public on the specific actions carried out between June 1998 and June 1999 and on the instruments and means available to the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">My only criticism is that this report is probably over-optimistic. Inadequacies and grey areas are hardly mentioned. However, the publication of this document encourages me to look to the near future and the preparation of an EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This project, which must be part of the IGC’s work and which could be completed by the end of the year 2000, is of major importance for the Union, for all those living within the Union and for the applicant states.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet we currently have no guarantee that this text will meet expectations. In particular, we fear that the European Council and the Council of Ministers have only very limited ambitions, namely to draft a mere declaration without any legal or binding force. If this were to be the case, the European Union would lose all credibility in its own eyes and in the eyes of the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is a concern about the risks of competition and even contradiction between this future Charter and existing texts which have indisputable force. I am referring, of course, to the Council of Europe’s European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, that the Helsinki Summit will reassure us on all these points. You are personally well acquainted with these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Malmström (ELDR).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, we in the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party have a mainly positive attitude to the present report on human rights. Parliament has been wanting to see a report like this for a long time. We are therefore looking forward with pleasure to the tradition which the Finnish Presidency has now initiated. There is a need for specific detail, further development and more thorough analysis We shall be returning to these questions, from Parliament’s point of view, in the report for which I have the honour of being rapporteur and on which there will be a vote in March of next year. </p>
<p class="contents">I want to take up a number of questions, however. One of these relates to the policy on minorities, of which there is little mention in the report. The EU quite rightly makes tough demands on the applicant countries where policy on minorities is concerned. We have also reacted very strongly when the rights of minorities in the world around us have been infringed. However, we ourselves are not always as good at putting our own house in order. The EU needs to strengthen its own policy on minorities. Quite a few of the Member States (including my home country, Sweden) have not signed the international declaration on the rights of minorities. This is an example of why the European Union must have a credible internal policy if it is to be credible externally.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party also welcomes the strategic perspective offered by the report, together with the ambition it expresses to work for a more integrated policy within the field of human rights. The EU, and especially the European Parliament, in fact has a very high profile and very high ambitions in the struggle for human rights. This Chamber has emphatically condemned the death penalty, discrimination, torture and other acts of cruelty. We know that our citizens care deeply about these issues. </p>
<p class="contents">The problem is that our policy is not always consistent and integrated, and this sends out some odd signals. Measures must be taken to combat this problem and ambitions need to be raised significantly. If it is to be credible, our perspective on human rights must permeate the European Union’s entire policy, that is to say foreign policy, trade policy, policy on aid etc. What is required, therefore, is to raise the profile of human rights. These ought not to be seen in terms of some incidental ad hoc initiative but must be founded upon a well thought-out, consistent, clear and open policy. We must therefore be better at coordinating internal and external policies. This will mean collecting facts and acquiring better data and engaging in analysis and regular follow-up. It will require cooperation between the EU’s various institutions, between the EU and the Member States, between the EU and the voluntary organisations and between the EU and other countries. The failure to bring about a worldwide moratorium on the use of the death penalty is both tragic and deeply embarrassing. </p>
<p class="contents">If this can become a common policy and a common strategy for the years to come, then I look forward to further constructive and fruitful work within this important sphere. </p>

This is the start of what must become a tradition.</p>
<p class="contents">With human rights there is always the question of weighing up different values against one another: ‘horizontal tensions’ exist between the various human rights. Since the end of the Cold War they have manifested themselves more dramatically than before in the balance between classic basic freedoms, on the one hand, and collective rights, such as economic, social and cultural rights, on the other. The development has rapidly taken a direction which will weaken collective rights, which have been characteristic, for example, of the welfare state.</p>
<p class="contents">Of all the human rights, however, it is freedom of speech that holds a special position, as without free and independent communication the other human and fundamental rights cannot be established and even serious violations of human rights, such as crimes against humanity, cannot be effectively exposed. As the President-in-Office of the Council said, reports on violations of human rights are an everyday occurrence. A free and independent media is also a vital prerequisite of civil society. For this reason, it would be advisable to accord greater emphasis in human rights monitoring and reporting by the Union to freedom of speech and to safeguarding, improving and monitoring the rights of journalists and their ability to work, for example, by devoting a special chapter or section to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">As we develop the Union’s own position on human rights we must, as the Foreign Minister, Mrs Halonen, said, be consistent. But we must also maintain a balance. There must be balance between the different types of human rights, the pillars, as mentioned by Mr Verheugen, and the institutions. The European Union cannot complacently and regardless of others develop its own human rights culture in such a way as to upset the balance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The media and the educational world are increasingly obsessed with the tragedy of the concentration camps in the name of interests that have nothing to do with the defence of the victims’ memory.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, there are currently thousands of historians, sociologists, researchers, experts and ordinary people who are being hounded, persecuted, harassed and condemned. Their only crime is to have assessed, in an independent manner, the ever-changing but sometimes hysterical dogmas imposed on them by hired authors benefiting from full official collusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In my home town of Lyons, a young historian with no means of support whom I did not know – Mr Plantin is his name – has been sentenced simply because in the bibliography of a scholarly review which he publishes he included works which correct historical errors which no serious historian of whatever persuasion now accepts. He has been arrested, his computer has been confiscated and each of the usual associations has sued him and extorted large amounts of compensation from him. His former tutors at university have had to apologise, in a show of loathsome cowardice, for the qualifications which they awarded him.</p>
<p class="contents">His printer, a rural craftsman, has also been sentenced. He was charged under the act on publications corrupting youth, which could usefully be applied in other areas, and under the legislative act brought in by the French Communist Gayssot according to which, for example, the Germans must still be held responsible for the massacre of thousands of Polish officers at Katyn, even though the Soviets have admitted to this. The magistrates in Lyons who delivered these judgments have simply participated in a witch-hunt.</p>

The EU practice is obviously that we take a position on the action of the court when a decision has been made. I would like to point out that we have tried to follow the trial in its entirety.

It is therefore a pity that the President-in-Office of the Council left in the middle of the debate. It does not seem right that we cannot have a proper debate when such an important document is presented. All we are going to get now is a continuous monologue without any response from the other party. In that respect, my words are rather pointless.</p>
<p class="contents">However, following on from what was said by the two speakers who came before me – and with whom I disagree – I must say that the fact that Europe, and the European Union in particular, is making human rights its banner – in fact its only banner – is a marvellous thing. This does not mean that everything is perfect and that there is nothing to correct; indeed, the report says as much. The text could be improved upon in many respects – from the internal point of view, for instance –and certain paragraphs concerned with racism and xenophobia provide perfect examples of this. An improvement could also be made by including in the text the EU’s contribution to the fight for human rights in the international sphere. We are faced with a number of challenges and all of this is mentioned in this document which, I must repeat, is an excellent initiative and constitutes a remarkable inventory. I am only sorry that the President-in-Office of the Council is not present to hear this.</p>
<p class="contents">There are various initiatives which we could comment on if we had the time. I will mention just one in which I think the European Union should be actively involved, namely the establishment of the International Criminal Court which would end the current situation in which the judicial instruments available to us are quite incapable of dealing with international requests for legal proceedings. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have been considering, over the course of recent months and years, Article 6 of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the reaffirmation of the importance and role in the European Union of the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, and also the creation of the International Criminal Court and the need we all feel to give greater authority to Article 7 of the UN Charter in order to guarantee respect for human rights, eliminating any humanitarian intervention from rationales which are not based purely and simply on respect for these rights: all of this tells us that a great deal of progress has been made.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, fifty years after the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, we know that no rights are won all in one go and once and for all: I am thinking of Tibet, Burma, Timor and Asian countries where child and women workers are exploited; I am thinking of Kosovo, Chechnya and Africa, a continent that is too often far away and forgotten; I am thinking of the 790 million people in the world who are suffering from hunger or the 300 million children who have to work; I am thinking of the 1625 executions carried out last year in the 72 countries whose legal systems still provide for capital punishment. Finally, I am also thinking of the fate of the Kurdish leader, Mr Öçalan, whose life has to be saved, I truly believe, through all of our efforts. </p>
<p class="contents">The very fact that capital punishment is so widespread is one of the most intolerable breaches of each individual’s dignity and right to life: a breach which we feel deeply and which we want to fight, for example, by pointing out that the actual enlargement process of the Union is proving to be not just a factor of peace and security for the continent, but also the way to make applicant states overcome such barbarity. We know that it will be a long and difficult process; this was shown by the UN’s failure to debate the European Union resolution on the moratorium on capital punishment. It was a serious and painful setback, and it is up to us, Members of Parliament, and the Commission, not to let this commitment lie: on the contrary, we must take it up with renewed vigour. </p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, at the moment, in the United States, in Virginia, the life of a young Italo-American who has been condemned to die but continues to declare his innocence is just one of the many lives which must be saved. I am taking this opportunity to ask you, the President of Parliament, the President of the Council and the Commission, to take urgent action in making an appeal to the United States to suspend the execution of Derek Rocco Barnabei, because the battle against capital punishment is a battle for civilisation which must be fought every time it is necessary and in every way possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This sober fact overshadows, I believe, the unmistakably positive developments in some countries. More than anything, it places in perspective the memorable fact that an increasing number of countries are abolishing the death penalty and are signing major human rights treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">Never before has so much lip service been paid to human rights. Never before has there been so much verbal condemnation without being followed up by sanctions. Human rights violations are a blot on our civilisation, impunity even more so. Nevertheless, we see, thinking of Rwanda for example, that the law is very slow in catching up with those responsible for the most gruesome violations of human integrity – if it does so at all. As such, impunity causes more violations. The truth is that human rights are still too often subordinated to commercial and other interests of Member States. Unfortunately, there is no common strategy as yet. This partly explains why we are so often overtaken by events. Why did disaster have to strike East Timor, Kosovo and Rwanda first before something was done? The international community often watches helplessly. </p>
<p class="contents">Our policy for human rights should be credible. There is no room for double standards. China and – to a lesser extent Russia – often remain out of harm’s way a lot longer than certain African regimes. Some will term this selectivity. I prefer to call it opportunism and a lack of courage. </p>

<p class="contents">There are mainly three reasons why I welcome the publication of this report. Firstly, it is based on a coherent vision, a vision which rejects a hierarchy of types of human rights, but which emphasises their very interdependence. The report also makes a first attempt to create coherence between the external and internal human rights policy of the European Union, especially the latter being a real innovative step. It has to be said that, compared to Parliament, the Council appears to be leading the way. </p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the report does not fall into the trap of presenting human rights as a European achievement but presupposes universality and adopts a global approach with a great deal of attention being paid to the EU’s action within the scope of the United Nations. </p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the report is the product of an organised dialogue with the social organisations involved in human rights issues. The forum held here in Brussels over the past couple of days deserves a regular spot in the Union’s consultative network. </p>
<p class="contents">There are, however, also a few minus points to be noted. The attempt within the EU to include self-evident human rights issues in the report is very biased to say the least. Why does discrimination on account of race or ethnic origin receive preferential treatment over, for example, discrimination against women and homosexuals, which does not feature or hardly features as an issue at all? Could this be a taste of how the Council will handle the package of anti-discriminatory measures which the Commission proposed last week? Why is no attention being given to other human rights issues prevalent within the Union, such as abuse in prisons or at police stations, killings by armed political groupings and the situation of conscientious objectors, to name only the most obvious issues? </p>
<p class="contents">The Council needs to summon up the political courage to spend more time on the internal human rights situation within the EU in the next annual report. In this context, the proposal for a so-called “observation centre” must also be kept on the agenda. After all, experience has taught us that collecting and analysing information is a prerequisite to achieving a sound human rights policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What has happened to these colleagues of ours? </p>
<p class="contents">One contributory and forward-looking feature of this report is the fact that it acknowledges the role not only of political decisions but also of civil society in creating an environment where human rights have the profound and enduring support of the people. The value of this insight cannot be underestimated. The right to life and respect for its inviolability are the basic human rights and therefore both the essence and goal of democracy. At the same time, they express the Christian view of human life which, for two thousand years, has formed a precious part of Europe’s cultural and spiritual heritage and which, as we confront the new millennium, is a valuable asset for Europe to further build upon in the struggle for human rights. </p>
<p class="contents">The fact that the European Union has now started preparing annual reports on the ways in which human rights are respected within and outside the EU’s Member States is something which we Swedish Christian Democrats warmly welcome. With the right to life as its theme, the EU should continue to maintain a consistent line on the death penalty and, especially via the United Nations, to challenge those countries which consider it to be ethically and morally acceptable to defend the State’s right to take another person’s life. In the pressing work of extending the EU eastwards, demands for a moratorium on, and future abolition of, the death penalty have, in our own part of the world too, influenced ethical thinking and legislation in the direction of affirming human life. </p>
<p class="contents">The present report illuminates the frightening developments affecting the smallest among us, who are also those most precious to us, representing our own future, namely our children. The fact that one million children on this earth work as prostitutes at the same time as dark forces disseminate child pornography is deeply alarming and causes a vast amount of bitterness. On the basis of the right which children have to a father and mother and to secure conditions in which to grow up in a family environment, it is our common challenge, in the face of the new millennium, to allow children’s needs to be our guide in all the work that is done in society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One important point which I would like to raise is the human rights clause in treaties with third countries, which has already been implemented on numerous occasions since 1995. Human rights clauses are a fundamental part of these treaties. People and their basic rights are therefore removed by means of a treaty from the powers of disposal of the other party to the treaty, despite the fact that we have always taken the view that insisting on human rights does not represent interference in the internal affairs of a country.</p>
<p class="contents">What is important as far as the practical implementation is concerned, is that both the EU Commission and the Member States have the political will in this particular instance not only to identify violations of human rights and hence of a fundamental part of the treaty, but also to apply the legal consequences provided for, which generally start with consultation and may lead to the suspension of parts or even the cancellation of the entire treaty. But we all know what happens in practice. Time and time again, human rights issues are pushed to one side or even considered to be counterproductive for irrelevant reasons. Either a lucrative transaction hangs in the balance or the agreement or support of some government or other is needed, for example in a particular committee at UN level.</p>
<p class="contents">Luckily, non-governmental organisations working in this area cannot afford to take account of such false considerations and I would like to take this opportunity of thanking them with all my heart for their work. And we Members of Parliament, both here and in our national parliaments, should likewise shun such considerations. Denunciations of human rights violations are not merely sound bites in daily politics. We have seen time and time again that the targets, i.e. the governments which are publicly accused of human rights violations, find such denunciations highly embarrassing and try to prevent them.</p>
<p class="contents">If we were to ensure that neither governments nor individual undertakings were willing to jeopardise the solidarity of the democratic community of states for the sake of concluding a treaty, these governments would have no opportunity of playing one off against the other. A country such as China, to name one example, still needs our technology. We should not ignore the plight of thousands of prisoners of conscience or suppressed national groups such as the Tibetans just so that we can build a new railway or ensure that a State visit proceeds smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">I, too, therefore support the idea of adding another report to the report here and to the numerous other reports on the same subject. I would like to see more details on individual countries in the next report, for example, on which occasions the Council or the Commission approached which government on a specific matter. One might also offer during such discussions to refrain from mentioning the matter if it is cleared up by the time the next report is published. We can afford to be flexible in form, but not in content! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Union should now be focusing on the effective implementation of agreements. Implementation should cover three important areas: the monitoring of human rights, the establishment of human rights and the structures of a policy on human rights. The EU must develop monitoring mechanisms to observe the human rights situation both within the EU and in third countries. Monitoring must lead to a comprehensive assessment of the situation with regard to human rights. That assessment must include an analysis of the human rights situation, a decision on measures to improve that situation, a programme to monitor the impact of the measures on the situation, an evaluation of their success and a public report on the assessment and its results. It is important that we report on the problems within the EU as effectively and openly as on those in third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">In recent years, the EU has witnessed within its borders police violence, which has often been targeted against persons from outside the EU, cell deaths and discrimination against sexual minorities. The lack of protection for refugees is perhaps the biggest human rights problem within the EU. The Union policy on refugees, like that of the Member States, lags behind the standards we could expect from economically developed countries. Matters relating to refugees and asylum are for us primarily matters of security and control. The practice clearly contravenes the obligations of the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">The common EU strategy on Russia should emphasise the importance of human rights. Establishing human rights is one of the greatest challenges in the attempt to increase Russian prosperity and stability. The human rights situation in Russia today is alarming. The aims of security, stability and sustainable development associated with the northern dimension will only be of secondary importance if we neglect the issue of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">It is time we realised the European Parliament’s idea of a monitoring body to be set up within the Commission to promote an efficient human rights policy and report on questions relating to human rights. A respect for human rights and the protection of the rights of minorities are major requirements for accession to the Union. Taking criteria relating to human rights and minorities as serious conditions of membership would require that these criteria and the obligations of applicant countries towards their minorities be accorded the same status as other fundamental criteria in the negotiations on membership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
