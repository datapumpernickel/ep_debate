<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Roche,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Council</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Mr President, I welcome the opportunity to brief Members of the European Parliament today on our plans for the spring European Council. The Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern TD, wrote to heads of state or government on 17 February 2004 and communicated our proposed priorities for the Council, as outlined in the draft annotated agenda for the Council, which Members will have seen. We intend to reserve the morning session of Friday, 26 March for our annual consideration of the Lisbon strategy of economic, social and environmental renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Parliament will already be aware, from the Taoiseach’s address on 14 January 2004, that in its presidency programme, Ireland is giving the highest priority to the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. As presidency we are acutely conscious that we are almost at the half-way point with regard to the 2010 deadline by which the targets set in 2000 must be reached. It is important to note the considerable progress that has already been achieved on areas ranging from energy liberalisation to the implementation of the internal market in the financial services area.</p>
<p class="contents">Notwithstanding the clear progress that has already been achieved, we must equally recognise that more needs to be done to enable the Union to capitalise on the promising signs of economic recovery. We want the European Council to convey a message of determination and confidence, demonstrating that the requisite political will exists to enable us to step up the pace of reform. We intend to call on governments, the European Parliament and the Commission to work together to overcome the obstacles inhibiting the implementation of agreed reforms, so that we can complete the necessary legislative programme and then transpose agreed measures quickly into national law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have identified two overarching priorities for the spring European Council, namely sustainable growth and more and better jobs. We are adopting a holistic approach to the issue of growth, recognising that we need to take action on a range of factors such as competitiveness, innovation, environmental sustainability and social inclusion if we are to make the European economy more dynamic. We need to enhance competitiveness so that our economy can withstand global challenges. It is equally vital that we take specific steps to make the internal market more vibrant. We are focusing, in this regard, on two particular areas: financial services and the services sector more broadly. We believe that an effective single market in the financial services area will enable the EU economy to grow significantly by increasing the provision of more and cheaper capital. We hope that the European Parliament can engage constructively with us in pursuing this objective by helping to finalise the remaining elements of the Financial Services Action Plan, particularly the proposed directives on transparency and investment services, before the end of its current term.</p>
<p class="contents">We are all aware that the services sector has powered the EU economy over the past decade, providing a dynamic motor for growth that has accounted for 70% of the EU’s GDP and of its employment opportunities. We see the full application of internal market principles to that sector as a vital tool in enabling competitive businesses to expand throughout the EU and offer greater choice to EU consumers. Consequently, we look forward to fruitful cooperation with the Parliament in advancing significantly the proposed directive on the internal market for services next year.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy explicitly recognised that for the EU to compete globally, it must make the transition to a knowledge-based economy in which leading-edge technology and expertise will provide crucial added value to EU products and services. However, we continue to lag behind our most important international competitors in terms of our investment in, or the priority attached to, innovation. The number of researchers in the EU accounts for only 5.7 per 1000 workforce, while the corresponding figures are 8.1 per 1000 for the US and 9.1 per 1000 for Japan. Indeed, as the Commission’s spring report has noted, the private sector contributes three times more investment in human capital in Japan and a staggering five times more in the US than in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Each of our institutions, national governments, the Council, the Commission and Parliament will need to see how we can provide dynamic solutions that will foster a climate in business that is more conducive to innovation. As a first step in that process, we have proposed that the European Council should agree that Member States should consider targeted supports and incentives to encourage greater research and development investment by businesses. Equally, if we are to increase the number of researchers undertaking the work necessary to enable our economy to grow, it is important to look at how we might retain our own researchers and attract researchers from other countries into the EU. The Council looks forward, in this regard, to the continued cooperation of Parliament to ensure the early adoption of the forthcoming draft directive on the mobility of third country researchers.</p>
<p class="contents">I am personally committed to the objective of ensuring better regulation within the EU. I firmly believe that better regulation can enable the EU economy to grow significantly by achieving the right balance that will allow the interests of the public to be safeguarded while at the same time easing any unnecessary burdens on business. The presidency has developed a joint initiative with the succeeding presidencies – the Netherlands, Luxembourg and the UK – aimed at giving priority, over the next two years, to the objective of better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Our second priority is that of more and better jobs. Our presidency approach to the issue of employment is informed by the recommendations of the Employment Task Force chaired by Mr Wim Kok which reported to the European Commission at the end of 2003. We welcome the full incorporation of the Task Force’s policy messages into the analysis and assessment outlined in the Joint Employment Report. We are proposing, consequently, that the European Council should agree that, within an overall employment strategy, Member States should give urgent attention to three structural challenges, namely adaptability, greater labour force participation and investment in human capital.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, we set targets under the Lisbon strategy that female labour force participation should reach 60% and that the rate for older workers should increase to 50% by 2010. The Commission’s spring report has recorded the increase in the female employment rate over the past three years to 55.6%, in part because of the progress made on improving the availability and accessibility of care facilities for children under three. If we can maintain that rate of progress, we have a realistic chance of meeting the 60% target for female participation by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">As presidency, we consider that the most urgent issues needing to be addressed, with regard to attracting more women into the workforce, are the continuing pay disparities experienced by women and the importance of more family-friendly work environments. However, we have more serious difficulties with regard to the target in respect of the employment rate for older workers. The employment rate for the cohort of workers aged between 55 and 64 had reached only 40.1% by 2002, meaning that another 7 million jobs would be required to enable us to meet the 50% target by 2010. Conscious of the importance of this issue, the Irish presidency is proposing that the right legal and financial incentives be put in place to retain older workers in the workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">The labour participation issue highlights the reality that implementation of the Lisbon strategy requires the commitment not just of national governments but of a range of actors including employers and trade unions. The support of employers is essential, for instance, if we are to create family-friendly and enabling environments that attract and retain female employees and older workers. Equally, we need the commitment of trade unions to facilitate the necessary adaptation to change that is increasingly essential in a competitive, global environment. We believe, therefore, that it is essential to explore ways of involving the necessary stakeholders more fundamentally in implementing our Lisbon goals.</p>
<p class="contents">The process of change is unavoidably difficult. However, we can build a better future for the citizens of our Union, and of the enlarged Union. We believe that the process of implementing the Lisbon strategy will benefit greatly from the contribution of the new Member States, each of which has had to manage fundamental and wide-ranging economic transformations. While we have much to do, the benefits for our citizens of our implementing the Lisbon strategy effectively will be considerable. The prize is a great one. Our work programme and the potential benefits for Lisbon are well encapsulated in the presidency theme that we have chosen. We, as Europeans, are 'working together' to ensure a 'better quality of life' for all the citizens of Europe by 2010.</p>

We are here to discuss the priorities for economic, social and environmental policy to be dealt with at the Spring Summit.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 2002 it has become established practice for future objectives to be set at the Spring Summit. If we ensure that the summit is effective and successful, we shall in addition be consolidating the emerging economic governance of the Union. I myself am an impassioned advocate of the latter, which is also endorsed by the whole Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The Irish Presidency has just presented its priorities. It has also confirmed its ambition to make the summit a success, and its determination to do so. The Irish Presidency’s ambition and determination are supported by the analysis and conclusions presented in the Spring report. This analysis was well received in the debate held at the time. It received further support subsequently through the many contributions and initiatives by a good many Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The overview provided in the Spring report is very clear. I shall not dwell on it, though I would like to make a few brief comments on the content. The material adopted on 21 January already contained the main political messages and key conclusions. A series of positive results was mentioned, notably concerning job creation. Six million jobs have been created despite the climate of weak growth. The considerable improvement in the situation regarding long-term unemployment and female employment was also mentioned. In addition, there was reference to opening up competition in strategic web markets, and to the increasing penetration of the Internet into schools, businesses, public administrations and homes.</p>
<p class="contents">A recent Commission study confirms that the economic reform process launched in recent years contributed to the additional growth of Europe’s GDP by over half a percentage point between 1996 and 2001. This is certainly a positive sign. It must not, however, lead to playing down the difficulties that have already arisen in connection with the process. These difficulties are particularly striking if they are set against the ambition and objectives defined at Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment and productivity are not contributing enough to the growth of Europe’s GDP. The internal market remains too fragmented and the transposition of directives still leaves a great deal to be desired.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, the overview confirms the validity of the Lisbon strategy. At the same time, however, it reveals the urgent need to recommit to the latter. Most importantly, it highlights the urgency of making every possible effort to implement the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now identify what the Commission believes the priorities are at this juncture. They can all be found in our report. Greater investment in networks and research is called for. So too is greater investment in development and innovation. It is also important to strengthen the competitiveness of the service industry and to introduce the changes needed to prolong working life. I would like to comment briefly on each of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of the slow growth experienced in recent years, it is essential to increase investment in infrastructures and research, development and innovation. In so doing, a more integrating approach involving the European dimension should be adopted.</p>
<p class="contents">Private investors are directly affected. They can and must draw on the potential for growth and medium- and long-term benefits resulting from the operation of an integrated economy without barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incumbent on the public bodies, including European ones, to complete an appropriate regulatory framework at national and Community level as a matter of urgency. At the same time, the opportunity for a more ambitious political and financial support must be created. Strengthening investment in this way will prove more effective if it is in line with an overall vision such as that generated by the projects included in the growth initiative. Through the latter, the Commission and the European Council are seeking to coordinate efforts to overcome cross-border problems. I refer to problems concerning the development of infrastructures for transport, energy and telecommunications, and also for research, development and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">Fostering the development of knowledge and human capital is crucial to this endeavour. Much remains to be done in this regard. Commissioner Reding is here with me today and will take the floor shortly. She will provide a detailed account of the relevant courses of action agreed within the framework of the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Improving the competitiveness of industry and services is the next priority. Parliament and the Council must focus on the adoption of the legislative package to promote competitiveness. The package contains key proposals such as the recognition of professional qualifications, the Community patent, the most recent directives on financial services and the framework directive on services.</p>
<p class="contents">Further strategic reforms concern the review of the guidelines on the TENs and the action plan on environmental technology. It is also necessary to consider how the Lisbon strategy could be improved for the industrial sector.</p>
<p class="contents">The third priority is to promote active ageing, allowing older workers to remain active for longer. The elimination of financial incentives for early retirement could be one way of achieving this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, if I may, I should like to make two further comments on the report on the Broad Guidelines for the Economic Policies of the Member States and the report on public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s recommendation concerning the 2004 update of the current Broad Guidelines on economic policy enabled Parliament to undertake an interesting study. Mrs Randzio-Plath has been largely responsible for the latter. Once again, Mrs Randzio-Plath has cooperated in the analysis of the Lisbon strategy and in developing the policies contained in these Broad Guidelines. She regrets their inadequate implementation and feels that investment is undoubtedly the key issue to focus on in future. The Commission certainly welcomes Parliament’s renewed endorsement of the main axes of the strategy on economic policy contained in the Broad Guidelines. The common broad agenda for structural reform is crucial to increasing Europe’s potential for growth.</p>
<p class="contents">The importance of sound and responsible management in macroeconomic policies should not be overlooked. It is essential for strengthening confidence and a precondition for increasing internal demand and employment. In this regard, my views differ from those contained in the draft resolution. I do not subscribe to the opinion that there is an increasing divide between the aims and objectives set at Lisbon and the current Broad Guidelines for economic policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I also fail to detect any lack of consistency between the instruments as is stated. The current guidelines cover the period 2003-2005. They focus in particular on the contribution by economic policies to attaining the Lisbon objectives over the next three years. Consequently, the aforementioned guidelines are a vital objective in the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Their added value is to be found precisely in that they provide an integrated approach to dealing with the various challenges arising. This global approach is developing thanks to the rationalisation of policy coordination. In this regard, progress has been made in bringing the Broad Guidelines for economic policy into line with the employment guidelines. Overall consistency has improved as a result.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to comment on Mr Bigliardo’s report on public finance within the Union. It represents valuable and useful input. I appreciate the broad support for the Commission’s approach to strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact, and economic governance in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">The current framework for coordination of economic policies is based on clear principles, stable prices and monetary conditions, and healthy public finances. As our main objective is to promote growth, we believe this is indeed the most logical and appropriate framework.</p>
<p class="contents">Nonetheless, experience has shown that there is room for improvement as regards getting the pact under way or into practice. The Commission is undertaking a review. This will include discussion with other institutions and with the governments of Member States. The Commission intends to make more detailed proposals before the summer. I trust there will be an opportunity for me to discuss these specific points with the House.</p>
<p class="contents">The cornerstone of our strategy is the concept that short-term difficulties should not be dealt with in ways resulting in long-term imbalance. Instead, it is essential to tackle such difficulties bearing in mind the current economic situation, possible future challenges, and existing provisions for coordinating budgetary policies. This has helped in improving the budgetary situation and reducing the anticipated level of inflation. At this juncture, the major challenge is how to devote more attention to growth and sustainability of public finances.</p>
<p class="contents">My final remark on economic governance is that the objectives set at Lisbon were both ambitious and realistic. Success depended on the determination and commitment of one and all. It now seems that failure to meet the interim objectives will endanger the achievement of what had been agreed for 2010. Our key challenge is to ensure effective economic governance. Steady progress is being made at European level. The right priorities are being set and the appropriate measures and policies identified. When it comes to taking decisions, however, difficulties and delays abound. In addition, Member States have been unable to integrate the aforementioned priorities effectively into their various national policies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is trying to do its duty by drawing attention to this programme. I believe it is useful to invite opinions on the best solution to the problem. It is important to seize the opportunities offered by the economic recovery and the momentum for enlargement so as to give the necessary boost to the Lisbon process.</p>
<p class="contents">The impetus must come from the European Council. The Irish Presidency has identified this as one of its priorities, hence the opportunity for strengthening coordination of economic policies. The Commission launched its consultation last month for the same reason. The Commission will also prepare proposals for the perspectives for the mid-term review of the Lisbon strategy. It is anticipated that this will be the main issue dealt with in the Spring report next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Reding,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, I am pleased to be able to take part in this plenary sitting along with my colleague Pedro Solbes. The presence of both of us here is highly symbolic, because it signals that the Lisbon strategy is not based solely on economics and finance – although these clearly remain absolutely essential elements – but that crucial importance is also attached to its social and human dimensions. Who can overlook, for example, the fact that almost 20% of young Europeans leave the education and training systems without any qualifications? Who could fail to be concerned by the social exclusion to which some of our population are condemned? How can we respond to the growing need of individuals for lifelong learning that will enable them to keep working or to play an active part in the life of our societies? As I have often said, human resources are the prize asset of the Union, provided we can derive maximum benefit from them. But without high-quality education and training, it is illusory to imagine that we shall achieve our objectives in terms of growth, employment and social cohesion. The fact is that our economic potential hinges on our human capital. Experts have calculated, for example, that an increase of one year in an average person’s period of study would translate into a productivity gain of more than 6%. We are also aware that education is a key factor in civic and social integration. Ladies and gentlemen, the construction of the edifice for which the plans were drawn up in Lisbon must begin with the laying of solid foundations on the bedrock of education and training. </p>
<p class="contents">The spring report that the Commission adopted a month ago contains the observation that, despite some encouraging progress in a number of areas, the Union is still far short of the targets it has set itself. There are several reasons for this, foremost among which are excessive fragmentation of the internal market and sluggish transposition of the guidelines adopted within the framework of the Lisbon strategy. My colleague Mr Solbes has referred to these points. </p>
<p class="contents">An equally important reason for our shortcomings is the lack of investment in knowledge, whether in education and training or in research and innovation. In Lisbon, the Member States undertook to increase significantly the level of investment in human resources. But what is actually happening? Public investment in education, measured as a percentage of GDP, has made little or no headway and is even declining in some Member States. Moreover, private investment in education, especially higher education, is far from adequate in Europe when judged against the standards set by our competitors. Private-sector expenditure on education is four times as high in the United States and twice as high in Japan as it is here in Europe. </p>
<p class="contents">The same applies to research, where there is an alarming brain drain from the European Union to the United States. If we want to become a knowledge-based economy, the fact is that we shall have to generate fresh momentum, one of the key components of which must be research. Indeed, without public and private investment in research, the economy of the Union will stagnate, deprived of its motive force, which is knowledge. This is precisely why the encouragement of investment in research was placed at the heart of the Lisbon strategy. </p>
<p class="contents">April 2003 saw the adoption, after broad consultation, of the communication entitled <span class="italic">Investing in research: an action plan for Europe</span>, which identifies measures designed to increase the average level of investment from the present rate of 1.9% of GDP to 3% by the year 2010, with two thirds of all investment coming from the private sector. This 3% action plan comprises four main sets of measures: supporting the steps taken by European countries and stakeholders and ensuring that they are mutually consistent, considerably improving public support for research and technological innovation, increasing the levels of public funding for research and, lastly, improving the climate for research and technological innovation in Europe. These are not easy tasks by any means. The success of this action plan will depend on resolute and concerted efforts on the part of the Member States and the private sector. But we must face the fact that today’s investments are tomorrow’s growth, productivity and employment. </p>
<p class="contents">It is also imperative to step up the efforts to modernise our education and training systems and equip them to meet the needs of a knowledge-based society. These are matters that the Commission and the Member States have taken very seriously. In February 2002, we agreed on a programme of work designed to make our education and training systems an international standard of excellence by 2010. The Education Ministers have also adopted European benchmarks in five key areas, such as basic skills and lifelong learning. In addition, the Copenhagen Declaration of 2002 initiated the process of European cooperation in the field of vocational training. The first concrete results have emerged, such as the Europass and the work on the recognition of informal training. In November 2003, the Commission presented an interim report on the implementation of the programme of work, and in this report I sounded the alarm by stating that, unless the pace of reform quickened, it would be very difficult, if not impossible, to achieve the objectives we have set for our education and training systems – not only these but also the objectives of the Lisbon strategy in its entirety, which is a far more worrying thought. Deficits in education and training, after all, lead almost automatically to economic slippage and social problems. </p>
<p class="contents">On the basis of these observations, a joint report has been prepared with the Member States and will be discussed tomorrow by the Council of Education Ministers with a view to submission to the European Council for its Spring Summit. This report identifies several priority areas for action. The first of these is investment in human resources, where there is a need for more investment, but also wiser investment, and for the mobilisation of the private sector, particularly for investment in higher education and vocational training. The next priority is the adoption by the Member States of genuine strategies for the promotion of lifelong learning, particularly among disadvantaged sections of society. Today, only one adult in ten has access to opportunities for lifelong learning. Finally, there is a need to nurture a real education and training culture in Europe, particularly through the creation of a European qualification structure. </p>
<p class="contents">The report also highlights the key role of universities in the knowledge-based society. While our universities possess many assets, it cannot be denied that they are confronted by fundamental challenges in an increasingly globalised and competitive environment. As a general rule, they possess fewer resources than the major American universities, for example. Since the eighties, they have also lost their status as the preferred destination of foreign students. What can be done to make our universities world-class centres of excellence? What can be done to attract the best students, researchers and lecturers? Some progress has already been made through the Bologna process, designed to promote the convergence of our systems of higher education, through the Socrates and Leonardo da Vinci programmes, which support innovation in education and training, and, more recently, through the Erasmus Mundus programme, so strongly supported by the European Parliament, for which I thank you once again. Can we declare ourselves satisfied, in this field and in others? Can we stop now? I do not think so. I believe that, at every level, we must continue our efforts and redouble them if need be. </p>
<p class="contents">This, indeed, is the message of the Commission’s spring report and of the interim report. The direct corollary of this message is the Commission’s proposal on the new financial perspective. On the tenth of this month, President Prodi briefed you on the background to the financial perspective and its main features. The discussions will be long and difficult, and many figures and percentages will be bandied about. But before engaging in this debate, let us first concentrate on this project of ours and on our ambitions for the period beyond 2010. As President Prodi emphasised in his address to this House, no European country can meet the challenges of globalisation on its own. The same applies to the entire Lisbon strategy, including the fields of education and training. Oh yes, I know – education and training are subject to the subsidiarity principle. And nobody is questioning that. But we have managed to made significant headway through Community action. A million Erasmus students may seem like a huge number, but they represent only two per cent of our entire student body. That is not enough. We need to go further. The same is true of trainees. And the fact that some two million pupils have been involved in our school projects may seem impressive, but this figure is not even one per cent of the total school roll for the whole of Europe. And so there is truly a need to move forward. Moreover, Community programmes, which are veritable innovation laboratories, contribute to reforms and adjustments of education systems and serve to promote the sharing of experience. The Bologna process, for example, would never have materialised without the Erasmus programme and without the growing demand among students for greater mobility. </p>
<p class="contents">Community action through programmes as well as through political cooperation therefore helps to achieve three fundamental objectives: to make the European construction process and European citizenship tangible and visible, to develop the European dimension of education and training and to support efforts to improve the quality of our education and training systems. Our action at the European level is essential if we want to achieve our economic and social objectives. In this context, in the month of March I shall be presenting to the College of Commissioners a communication on the new generation of programmes for the period from 2007 to 2013. The aim of this communication will be to make education and training a reality for everyone. It will set out the main thrust and the priority measures of the new generation of education programmes. A formal proposal should be presented before the summer. This means, ladies and gentlemen, that we shall have time to discuss it. Given your track record in this field, however, I am already confident that I can count on your support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Grossetête (PPE-DE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioners, today we are discussing our economy. Making our economy the most dynamic in the world means ensuring that the triangle of the Commission, Parliament and the Council will enable the triangle of the economy, employment and the environment to develop in an effective and balanced manner.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me begin with the economic, monetary and industrial issues. At the time of enlargement, firm coordination of the Member States’ economic policies in the spirit of the Stability and Growth Pact is indispensable if we are to become more competitive in the global marketplace. Competitiveness is achieved not only by cutting costs but also, and more especially, by creating conditions conducive to private enterprise and by making labour legislation more flexible. It is vital that we should encourage all investments, private or public, with a view to ensuring that research and development expenditure reaches 3% of GDP by 2010. We must show resolve in this domain in order to halt the steady widening in recent years of the gap between ourselves and the United States and to stop the departure of some of our best brains to other continents. To this end, we must focus our efforts on high-tech sectors such as health and biotechnology, defence and space – the Galileo programme sets a good example in this respect – state-of-the-art telecommunications and renewable sources of energy. These efforts must not obscure the fact that the economic fabric of Europe is woven by our entrepreneurs and our numerous small- and medium-sized businesses. We must take steps to guarantee their sustainability. From this perspective, the creation of a tax structure that does not hinder the transfer of ownership of SMEs is an essential requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">The vitality of an economic area is also measured by the quality of its infrastructure, by the modernisation of its channels of communication and by the development of alternatives to road transport. Recourse to the Structural Funds to finance investments in the infrastructure, in research and development and in innovation will be useful, and indeed essential, to every – and I do mean every – Member State of the European Union. Great importance also attaches to the completion of the trans-European energy networks.</p>
<p class="contents">Moving on to employment, the second point of the triangle, we must live up to the expectations of our fellow citizens, for whom jobs remain the paramount concern. We simply must put an end to these policies of handing out assistance and plastering over cracks, which reappear after the slightest gust of wind, and devote ourselves to real structural reforms. The creation of 15 million jobs will truly depend on innovation, backed by new imaginative and dynamic policies based on private initiative in the framework of the Lisbon Agenda. I note that the President-in-Office of the Council wants to see more jobs and that Mrs Reding has emphasised the need for quality and adaptation in our training systems. In the same vein, let me say that we must engage in intensive deliberations about the problem of the demographic deficit and the need to start pursuing sound immigration policies without delay. We must reflect together on possible solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">Many people are also concerned about the absence of a social Europe, and yet it is everywhere; it is a reality. It is not administered; it is voluntary and serves to encourage equality between the sexes and to curb discrimination. I need not add to what Mrs Reding has said on this matter. Where special efforts are really required is in the domain of minimum European standards with regard to labour legislation and the social security of permanently mobile workers, standards that will prevent any unfair competition based on low pay and poor working conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the environment, we must bear in mind that our efforts to foster growth and employment must be guided by the aim of sustainable development, one of the guarantors of stability. Above all else, we must be strict with ourselves and realistic about the impact of the legislation we adopt. For this reason, I believe it would be useful, prior to the adoption of a piece of legislation, to be able to assess the sustainability impact of all EU expenditure under the bill in question. It was our political group, incidentally, which tabled this initiative in committee.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finish by emphasising the importance of the Sixth Environment Action Programme, which should help us to implement the Kyoto Protocol. These are the points I wished to emphasise. There are many more things that could be said. I simply hope that the Lisbon strategy can help us to move forward for the sake of all our fellow citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Barón Crespo (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioners, we are today taking part in what has become almost an annual ritual, namely the debate on the state of the Lisbon strategy in the run up to the Spring Summit. It is useful to go back to basic principles. These principles include a renewed European social model, based on common shared values, with a sustainable strategy for solidarity and economic and social development. This catalogue of good intentions does need to be given tangible form, however. I believe the saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions is common to all our languages. Proclaiming and restating these good intentions year after year is not enough. What is required instead is a critical analysis of how the Lisbon strategy is being implemented. This has been clearly stated today, notably by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In this election year I should like to highlight certain issues of particular concern. It is all well and good to refer to the internal market and financial services. It should also be borne in mind, however, that the impasse concerning taxation of income from capital and unacceptable monopoly situations needs to be overcome. It is all well and good to refer to the development of services, but it is also necessary to respond to the concerns regarding ever-increasing relocation and the need for an industrial strategy for Europe. We must therefore prove that we are capable of working together to develop our approach to implementing the Lisbon Agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope you will allow me to refer to current developments. Firstly, my group and Parliament as a whole feel that the entry into force of economic and monetary union called for strengthening economic governance. I believe that was the majority view enshrined in our stance on the Convention. The Commissioner mentioned this. One of the meetings of our leaders has attracted special media attention. I refer to the meeting held in Berlin, where the creation of the post of Super-Commissioner for economic affairs was proposed. This is certainly an important issue. It implies agreement to apply the Community method. This is absolutely crucial. It also implies agreeing to what the governments were opposed to at the Convention. Opinions have changed. It is now deemed necessary to strengthen economic union. This can be translated into a corrective approach. Readiness to correct is a sign of wisdom. There is a willingness to amend the draft constitution in this regard. I do not believe the House would have difficulty in offering clear support to such an approach. After all, it does not make sense to discuss the creation of the post of Foreign Minister and not to have an equivalent post for economic affairs. I am sure Commissioner Solbes will be happy to support this proposal, or even to defend it before the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important aspect is involved. Discussion of reform should not be restricted solely to discussion about dismantling social gains and the welfare state. The Irish, Dutch, Danish and Swedish models prove conclusively that it is possible to be highly competitive, have an efficient economy whilst enjoying a high level of protection. Reform must therefore be based on these models. The reform process is not incompatible with retaining the principles that made Europe great.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to make a further important point, Mr President. The Commissioner mentioned it in passing. I refer to setting the forthcoming financial perspective. The Irish Presidency will be responsible for launching that debate too. It is a most important issue, because it so happens that further to that Berlin Summit and to a certain letter, there is talk of wanting to undertake far more activity with far fewer resources. I have in mind for example the Lisbon strategy and enlargement. It is all becoming an issue of blind faith. It does not make sense simply to hope for miracles. Applying sensible economic principles most certainly does make sense, however. Consequently, in order to discharge its responsibility, the Commission made a proposal presented to the House by Commissioner Barnier. The 1.24% of GDP proposed may seem too tight, but we believe it is the minimum worth considering. In France, my home country, and elsewhere in the European Union researchers are out on the streets demonstrating. I repeat, the researchers are out on the streets, not just the workers. It is simply not possible to call for more research and then drastically cut resources.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore essential to give full support to the plan proposed by Commissioner Reding and developed by Commissioner Busquin.</p>
<p class="contents">As I conclude, Mr President, I should like to mention three more issues. Firstly, we continue to have every confidence in the Irish Presidency and trust that in March it will be able to present a viable proposal aimed at moving the Constitution forward. Secondly, we believe the agreement reached in Cyprus must be supported. In our view, it is very important for the future of the Union. Lastly, on the occasion of the visit of an Iranian Nobel Prize winner to this House, I would like to say that I believe the Union must stand firm in its support of democracy in Iran. It must also continue to express its criticism of the conduct of elections in that country.</p>

Your priorities for the Spring Summit have restated that commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe is stuck in second gear. As America accelerates, as a resurgent Asia pulls into the passing lane, Europe is trailing behind. We must not let the recovery fool us. If Europe is picking up speed it has more to do with the slope of the road than with the state of our engine. As Commissioner Lamy said a week ago, we have oversold expectations of Lisbon and we have underinvested in results. Any sustained economic recovery in Europe has to be built on job creation. An export-led return to growth could conceal an American-style jobless recovery that will leave us no better off when the road levels out or when the next climb begins. More and better employment is the key to sustained growth and prosperity and the only sustainable route to social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot allow recovery to be a fig leaf for governments reluctant to reform. A return to growth can only hide the weaknesses of the European economy; it cannot remove them. A failure to use the good times to gain leverage against the bad is the very failing that did for the Stability and Growth Pact. This summit must rebuild that pact around a new order of commitment to financial discipline and debt management.</p>
<p class="contents">Governments must free people to work the hours they choose and keep the flexibility they need. We have to make work pay and open new ways into work for women and older people. We have to end the failures in education and re-education that are limiting the potential of too many Europeans. We have to invest more in research and development and foster more competitiveness and innovation. The only European social model that matters is the one that preserves our common prosperity for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to set attainable targets and concentrate on delivery. We know what needs doing. We need delivery on policy, not wish lists and hand-wringing. Another 'high level group' will simply deliver another expensive tranche of obvious conclusions. While my Group supports job creation and the return of older workers to the employment market, we had more in mind than consultancy positions for retired prime ministers.</p>
<p class="contents">The presidency has rightly identified the need for European governments to act more decisively, not only in Council but at home. In many cases the commitments made in Council have been allowed to stall at the transposition stage. The latest figures from the Commission show that last month 131 internal market directives – that is 8.5% of the total – have not been fully implemented in at least one Member State – in breach of their own deadlines! We need to be tougher on policing the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">This Spring Summit has to be about delivery. Before June, Liberal Democrats in this House expect final decisions on crucial measures to assist European worker mobility, including in the area of the mutual recognition of qualifications; we want real progress on a framework directive on services, and we feel that it is past time for agreement on a financial services action plan that can free up Europe's capital markets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon Agenda gave us a decade to reform. Five years on, too little has been done. We cannot afford to be standing here five years from now wondering how we let Europe get left behind. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In other words, this is the neo-liberal agenda of Europe’s employers, the agenda of the Union of Industrial and Employer’s Confederations in Europe, the agenda of the captains of industry, which has become the be-all and end-all of the EU’s economic and social policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Another Spring Summit will soon be upon us, yet, from what we see in the Commission’s report, the economic recipe will be ‘more of the same’. Support will continue for the process of liberalisation and privatisation in numerous sectors, from transport to energy, from postal services to telecommunications. Blatant bias is shown against the public sector; the struggle of the workers and of others affected by these anti-social policies is ignored; social issues are deemed of secondary importance; and employment policy is based on making work more flexible, on unstable work and on wage restraints. Unemployment has risen and the jobs that have been created are scarce. The number of workers on short-term contracts has risen by four million and of those working part time by two million. Multinationals continue their relocations, which exacerbate unemployment and hamper development in many regions, as is currently happening in my country. The hardest hit are women and young people.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence our insistence that the Lisbon Strategy must be revised and that a moratorium be placed on liberalisations, in order that economies can be revived and demand can be sustained. This is also why we have insisted on pressing for the Stability Pact to be suspended, and replaced by a social progress and employment pact, in line with the objectives of full employment, sustained economic development and economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the only way in which we will see more training, more education, more innovation and more research, which are the prerequisites for sustained development in the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jonckheer (Verts/ALE).</span></span>   <span class="bold">–</span> <span class="italic">(FR) </span>Mr President, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I should like to use the three minutes at my disposal to make a few telegraphic-style comments. First of all, as regards the diagnosis of the current situation, I shall not labour the point that the traditional economic, social and environmental indicators are not very good. The reports from the Commission are fairly clear on this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">There are three points I should like to emphasise which have not featured very often in this debate. The first thing that strikes me is the diversity of conditions among the various countries of the Union. If you look at countries such as Denmark, Sweden or Finland, you see economies which maintain high social and environmental standards and are also globally competitive. These examples should give us food for thought. It therefore seems to me that any sweeping statements about the European economic situation need to be put into sharper focus.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that strikes me about the diagnosis relates to job creation. I never hear any mention of the need for differentiation between strategies adopted for areas of economic activity that are fully immersed in the maelstrom of international competition, for commercial activities that are relatively well protected from international competition and for non-commercial activities. And yet many analyses show us that these last two areas offer the greatest scope for job creation.</p>
<p class="contents">The third and final point, which is rarely heard in this assessment, is an evaluation of liberalisation: are we really sure that liberalisation actually improves the supply situation, that it encourages innovation and that, as Mr Monti likes to repeat, it lowers prices? I am not so sure. I believe it has created numerous oligopolies.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President-in-Office, our concern with regard to this European Council summit is as follows: whenever we read your presidency papers, and when we read the letter from the Conservative and Socialist Prime Ministers and Heads of State who gathered in Berlin, we fear that the progress made by the European Council in Gothenburg is being rolled back, in other words that we are returning to the old ‘either-or’ philosophy which says that high environmental standards and social provisions guaranteeing a certain standard of living are incompatible with competitiveness and job creation. This is an old chestnut. It has surfaced again in connection with the REACH programme, for example. If the European Council wants to make constructive proposals, I would commend to it the adoption of an industrial policy that benefits the environment. How can it be that the Commission presents a good paper on environmental technology but does not accompany it with a road map for the funding and implementation of its proposals? To supplement the funds provided by the European Investment Bank, why should we not moot the idea of a grand European public loan to fund sustainable development, since we are in a part of the world where savings are in great abundance and serve to fund the US deficits?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr Solbes, as regards prices policy or, to be more precise, the redirection of state aid and subsidies, Ecofin was supposed to present a five-year plan designed to phase out the subsidisation of environmentally harmful activities. Nothing has happened. Ensuring that prices reflect the true cost of production, including the social cost, would be another task for the Ecofin Council. Lastly, in order to move the process forward, it would also be desirable to make use of European legislation on public procurement, which permits recourse to environmental technology. I could say a lot more, but three minutes is such a short time for such a broad subject. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all support the goals laid down by the EU leaders in terms of implementing the Lisbon strategy. We all too want to ensure that the EU does become the most competitive knowledge-based economy in the world by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">We have seen advances in the policy areas of research and development, financial services, the liberalisation of energy and telecommunication markets, environmental protection and regulatory reforms; it is now much easier for workers and students to move around the EU to access jobs and education; it is easier to set up and run a small business; consumers are already enjoying cheaper telephone calls; significant strides have been made in terms of equality and social protection; the internal market itself has helped to create two and a half million jobs in Europe within the last ten years alone, and yet, despite these achievements, it is increasingly clear that unless we implement a broader policy reform programme in Europe we will not make the EU the most competitive economy in the world by 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">Negotiations are taking place with regard to the financial perspectives of the EU for the period after 2006 and priority attention must be given to ensure that EU budgetary measures support initiatives to bring about sustainable growth and increased employment in accordance with the Lisbon strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the implementation of the 'action for growth' initiative, which will bring about an increased level of investment in the European energy and transport networks. The financial services action plan must be implemented to ensure there will be an integrated financial service market in the EU by 2005. This will ensure that banks, fund managers and insurers will be able to operate on an EU-wide basis, which is good news both for the future development of the financial services industry and for the consumers of these services.</p>
<p class="contents">A corporate governance and auditing action plan must be supported to ensure that EU business practice operates to the highest international standards. A new Community patenting system must also be implemented within the EU. Our Community customs code must be changed to ensure that we strengthen and modernise the EU customs policies.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the building of a better regulatory environment in Europe. All new EU legislation must be subjected to strict tests for their impact on enterprise and competitiveness. For the EU to remain competitive we must all take advantage of the new and evolving information technologies. The new eEurope 2005 programme must seek to introduce a greater level of broadband to schools and libraries so as to guarantee access to high speed internet services and increase skills development for all our young people.</p>
<p class="contents">The pan-European eGovernment services initiative must also be completed to ensure that the provision of public and government services is available online. That is why I support the implementation of the Lisbon strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In actual fact, the European Union, and particularly Euroland, is the Sick Man of the global economy. Only yesterday, we learned that Euroland had seen its external balance of trade fall by 58% in 2003, a drop that was entirely ascribable to the decline in its industrial exports.</p>
<p class="contents">In all aspects of the game, Commissioner – growth, employment, investment and competitiveness – Euroland is being outplayed by all the other economic and monetary areas, including Japan now. But Mr Solbes and Mr Trichet, in their respective domains, continue to strut the stage regardless and, like Diafoirus the physician and his son in Molière’s <span class="italic">Malade Imaginaire</span>, to fob us off with their wrong diagnoses: ‘The diagnoses are the thing, I tell you’, says Diafoirus Solbes. ‘The diagnoses, I tell you’, replies Diafoirus Trichet. Have no doubt, gentlemen: with this medicine of yours, Europe will soon be a picture of health as she lies in her coffin.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad to say, however, that the Stability Pact is dead and buried, and its demise came at the hands of those who had wanted it but then changed their minds, as they are entitled to do, namely France and Germany. So there is no point, Mr Bigliardo – and I see he is not even here – in penning a tardy hagiography and, for some rather incomprehensible reasons, venting your spleen in aggressive tirades against France. The zeal of the convert, no doubt.</p>
<p class="contents">As for you, Mr Solbes, it seems to me that you would do very well to use your few remaining months in office to put away your wooden sword, which has not served you very well, and to withdraw the action you brought against the Council before the European Court of Justice, which is essentially the sort of thing that could lead to a veritable war of secession in Europe. You would do better to ask yourself some questions about the euro, as the Italian President of the Council did. It is the euro that is obstructing the recovery of Euroland, because it has become the passive adjustment variable of the real monetary and commercial challenge to the United States and Asia. This point can be satisfactorily proved by comparing, even on the basis of the Lisbon objectives, the performances of the Euroland countries with those of their non-Euroland partners within the Union. So for pity’s sake, gentlemen, since we are coming to the end of this legislative term, open your eyes, rub the scales from them and face up to reality! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One reason is because we repeat them in an attempt to convince ourselves that we will succeed in doing things in Europe that we are not capable of.</p>
<p class="contents">We are discussing public budgets, we are discussing the role that European public administration and public administrations in individual States can play in promoting the economies of research and innovation. We are doing this at a time when the European Union Financial Perspective provides for a budget in which agricultural expenditure will still take up between 40% and 50% of the resources. Does the Commission think that spending on agriculture will achieve the Lisbon objectives? If it does not have the courage to discuss this, in terms of the European Union’s budget, then it will be very difficult to make use of a lever as important as European expenditure – to benefit technological innovation and scientific research.</p>
<p class="contents">While discussing the Stability and Growth Pact we have seen major governments – in countries that are essential for the European Union and even more so for the eurozone – hold discussions to arrive at a deficit equal to 4 or 5% of the public budget. I ask myself if it would not be possible for countries such as France and Germany – where public spending is equal to or greater than 50% of GDP – to find the necessary funds in these extremely substantial resources to make infrastructure investments and to develop scientific research and training, in particular, at university level.</p>
<p class="contents">Another major European country provides us with an example. Unlike Mr Abitbol, I do not believe that the United Kingdom’s better economic performance results from the fact that the British have kept the pound and have not adopted the euro. The UK provides an important example in which a committee – not the Blair government but a government committee – indicates that 80 000 civil service jobs might be cut, in order to make savings of EUR 20 billion – in other words 1.5% of the United Kingdom’s GDP – which would be earmarked for schools, health and security. Resources need to be found from within public budgets, and we need to have the courage to take such costly political decisions.</p>
<p class="contents">Two further points are the European Union’s prospects and economic growth. We have read – for the moment just in newspapers – the text drawn up by Commissioner Lamy’s committee of experts – this is not yet about what Commissioner Lamy says – which calls for international trade to be linked to national values in Europe. This means putting the European Union on the road towards protectionism. Is this how we want to grow economically?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, Commissioner Solbes Mira, Commissioner Reding, I would like to focus on the issue of immigration. Just a month ago the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Anna, came here to urge Europe to adopt a more open policy, first and foremost in the interest of Europe itself and its economy. How does Europe respond? It responds by closing the borders of the Europe of Fifteen to workers from the enlarged Europe. Workers from the ten countries that will join the European Union will be second-class workers; we will have workers who are from the Community but who are nevertheless illegal. This is, for example, the response as regards immigration. Even from this point of view, rather than accepting the challenge of enlargement, Europe closes in. The Europe that closes in is not moving towards Lisbon but towards economic growth that is increasingly insignificant compared to the growth enjoyed by the United States and now also by Japan. Europe is, however, choosing its own destiny. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Randzio-Plath (PSE),</span></span>  <span class="italic"> rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, ours is the enormous task of creating a new synthesis of the goals our society has set itself whilst at the same time remaining committed to the ideals that are characteristic of Europe and for which it is known. We have to create a new synthesis between work as a factor in social integration, equality of opportunity and the economic demands of competitiveness and job creation. What I have quoted from Jacques Delors’ 1993 White Paper is no less relevant today, and I believe that the failure to transpose this White Paper, despite the praise heaped upon it by all the Heads of State or Government and by this European Parliament, and despite the endorsement they gave it, demonstrates how important it is that the Lisbon process should no longer be allowed to stagnate, but that, instead, we should do everything possible – which, fortunately, the Irish Presidency of the Council is willing to do – to implement it at national and local level. I regret the failure to make progress in implementing it, and the primary reason why we should all share in that regret is that all the Member States are hiding behind the argument that there is that further progress is financially unsustainable.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this excuse should no longer be considered appropriate, firstly because we now have the investment initiative – even though it is quite modest and will certainly not have the effects that the Marshall Plan, with even less money, did in reconstructing Europe – and, secondly, because we are giving no thought to how better coordination by the Member States can recover lost revenue, not only through the fight against organised crime and the black economy, but also – and primarily – by combating tax evasion.</p>
<p class="contents">From VAT alone, it would be possible to raise an extra EUR 100 billion per annum, with which we would be able to manage to provide far more credible funding. I think it is also high time that we thought, when it comes to raising funds today, no longer only in terms of the European Investment Bank and its contributions to the organising of growth – valuable though they indeed are – but also to reconsider and examine the possibility of the European Union at last applying an instrument we debated as long ago as 1993, and inviting subscription to Eurobonds.</p>
<p class="contents">Although this year’s Spring Summit must indeed create confidence – which is what we demanded that the Thessaloniki Spring Summit should do – it must also make it clear that we, in Europe, can be seen to add value by all pulling together. Vitally important though investments in the computer field and in information technology most certainly are, there are other areas in which we can invest: in the environment, in saving energy, in alternative energies, in order to generate sustainable growth accompanied by job creation, and – as has rightly been said – there is such a thing as investment in people, the European Union’s most valuable raw material, not only in early childhood but also in tertiary education and lifelong learning.</p>
<p class="contents">One thing, though, I do not want to omit, and that is our need, alongside investment in people’s education and training, for investment in social services. To take one example, we will never be able to reconcile work and family life in Europe unless childcare provision is improved. This is where Europe, in most but not all of the Member States, has a lot of catching up to do.</p>
<p class="contents">The World Commission on Sustainability and Globalisation too, backs up our demand in its report, published this week, and I think this shows us that what is needed today is no longer merely prescriptions of what is to be done, but the political willingness to join forces. No longer can Europe wait for growth in the United States; it must pull itself by its own bootstraps out of the swamp of mass unemployment, inadequate investment and inability to coordinate. I believe this to be a challenge for this Spring Summit, and I very much hope that it will succeed in persuading governments that the action they have taken to date will not be enough to prepare us for the future, which is vital to all of us and to generations yet to come.</p>

The rate of GDP growth in the euro zone in 2003 fell once again, from 3.5% in 2000 to 1.5% in 2001, 0.9% in 2002 and 0.5% in 2003, which means that the European economy was close to stagnation. These problems started the debate within the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and have led to the report that I am presenting in this House today. It is a report that takes into consideration some important needs, first and foremost the need to properly understand what the Stability and Growth Pact currently means for Europe. The increasingly pressing question is whether or not there can be stability without real growth.</p>
<p class="contents">We have tried to answer this question because we realised that what happened when the Ecofin Council adopted its well-known position as regards the problems faced by France and Germany is that our Europe has different opinions and was divided on such a significant issue. There is no doubt that keeping the Stability and Growth Pact under 3% is an essential condition, especially today when – faced with enlargement – we must keep ordered and regular budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs insisted on countries from Eastern Europe being called upon to follow Europe’s lead, and balance their budgets and in future present a more encouraging prospect. Nevertheless, I also believe that we cannot continue to treat an important problem, such as that of the Stability and Growth Pact, as a political issue. There are large countries that have invested a great deal and which, in my opinion, also have the right, even the duty, to carry out structural reforms, for which appropriate deadlines are needed, for individual States to put their budgets in order. I am referring in particular to France, which has started to take this route, and to Germany, which has paid a considerable price for its efforts to reunite with the former East Germany. In this situation, we believe that public investment must be used to kick-start the stalled economy and that the value of the euro and the euro/dollar rate must be looked into.</p>
<p class="contents">As has already been stated by Mrs Randzio-Plath, whom I thank for her cooperation in drawing up these two reports, Europe is facing a situation in which it must determine its own precise and unique approach<span class="bold">,</span> independent of all economic links with the United States. In this regard, we must get started on the Lisbon strategy, on which we are seriously behind schedule. The plan is to invest more in research and, above all, to launch a policy that solves the global problems of unemployment and that, with development, allows our young generations to hope for<span class="bold"> </span>a secure<span class="bold"> </span>and fruitful working relationship in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the objectives of the important report that we have adopted and passed in the committee and which we will vote on tomorrow in this House, with a political and economic forecast that is in no way negative but which, instead, makes use of all of the work carried out by the European Parliament in this parliamentary term. We believe that Parliament is an institution that should have a greater say in all types of analysis and economic forecasting. In order to remain consistent, the European Parliament should, in future, play a leading role in major economic analysis forecasting and become involved in the valuable work that the Commission is already undertaking.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank all those who cooperated and I hope that we can open a fruitful debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I think we need once and for all to stop weeping and wailing and apportioning blame; instead, let us for once remember that we have adopted enough resolutions and set ourselves enough targets, that now is the time to at last abide by the resolutions and buckle down to achieving the objectives. It is positively paradoxical that it should be Germany, France and the United Kingdom who have agreed that they want to plant a super-Commissioner in Brussels to handle economic coordination, that it should be they of all countries, one of which is not in the euro zone and is blocking the constitution that will make Europe stronger on the world stage, and the other two break EU law by breaching the Stability and Growth Pact, even obliging the Commission to go to the European Court of Justice. I do not believe that a super-Commissioner can make up for the Member States’ lack of political will, and, rather than allowing him to distract us, we should once and for all put into practice the resolutions we have adopted, which means putting them to work in the Member States. I have to tell Mr Della Vedova that this also applies to the agricultural budget. The fact is that it was these Heads of State or Government who had already decided that, because the agricultural budget was to remain stable and on this level from 2006 to 2013, no change was possible – something that I welcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Continually casting doubt on decisions already made, rather than implementing them, weakens us all. There are those in this House – those on the Left, for example – who say that the Stability and Growth Pact is the reason why the Member States do not do their homework, but I then have to tell you that it is Germany and France – two prominent countries – that are jeopardising the Stability and Growth Pact and failing to abide by it. It is the same two countries that head the list of those who are failing to transpose the internal market directives, and the same two countries that are also foremost in calling for a super-Commissioner. We need stability and growth, for on them competitiveness depends, itself the foundation of growth and employment, without which there is no social cohesion. Let us stop playing the market off against the state, and instead push for our system of the social market economy, which leads to social cohesion. Let us stop playing investments and debts off against each other, and instead stick to that to which we have committed ourselves.</p>

But it is not enough for Europe to proclaim its ambitions; it must also equip itself with the means to achieve them. Budgetary austerity is no such means, even though stability remains an aim that must be resolutely pursued. For all that, balanced public expenditure would be much easier to achieve if the European economy started growing again.</p>
<p class="contents">The Right preaches austerity to us, claiming to defend future generations against the burdens imposed by our generation. But what will future generations say if we leave them a world characterised by gross inequalities, where insecurity and unemployment marginalise more and more of the population? The virtues of American flexibility are extolled to us. And yet the unemployment rate in the United States currently stands at about six per cent of all active jobseekers. This concept of actively seeking work is important, because it has served to remove five million Americans from the unemployment statistics since President Bush took office. Moreover, the country with the Statue of Liberty keeps 2.2 million adults of working age in captivity in its prisons. The American social model is manifestly not to be recommended.</p>
<p class="contents">In the realms of research and of public and private investment, on the other hand, Europe should indeed draw inspiration from the United States. Where Europeans see risks, as in the domain of biotechnology, the Americans see opportunities. While our Union invests some 700 million euros a year in biotechnological research, the United States invests 25 billion dollars a year in its National Health Institutes. Europe has set itself the objective of allocating three per cent of its GDP to research. But where is the cash? In the meantime, 400 000 European scientists are working in America. Major European companies, such as Nokia, are investing more in their research in the United States than in Europe. The same applies to investments in infrastructure. The European Union has just produced a 62-billion-euro plan to revitalise the trans-European networks between now and 2010. The U.S. Senate, meanwhile, is discussing a project to spend 318 billion dollars on improving the motorway network alone over a six-year period after the House of Representatives had originally called for an appropriation of 375 billion.</p>
<p class="contents">When people preach American competitiveness to us, we have to analyse the real facts behind the statistics. Europe will not become the world’s most competitive economy by jettisoning its social model or by getting rid of high-quality services of general interest. Europe must invest more in its human capital, more in research and more in its physical infrastructure. The next summit, Mr President-in-Office, must be the harbinger of a European spring. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

To that extent, results have not been forthcoming. Consequently, the Irish Presidency must be called upon to follow through its own initiative, so that this time we are not left with mere words.</p>
<p class="contents">At what has been termed the Berlin Summit between Chancellor Schröder, Prime Minister Blair and President Chirac, the three gentlemen proposed the creation of a new post of Deputy President of the Commission, popularly known as the post of super-Commissioner, with responsibility for coordinating all the issues relating to economic reforms of the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, there must be greater focus on economic reforms, but I start to get concerned when the ‘three tenors’ talk about the necessary industrial development of Europe. Hopefully, we are not talking about more relaxed enforcement both of the rules governing state subsidies and of competition policy in general. That is the last thing Europe needs. It would remove the focus from what should be done in terms, namely, of real structural reform in many Member States and more investment in research and education. The latter could be financed by bringing forward the badly needed reforms of agricultural policy. Structural reforms are about stopping the trend towards ever increasing taxation, ensuring flexible labour markets and keeping the growth of public expenditure at a sustainable level.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not be like Mogens Lykketoft, the leader of the opposition in Denmark, and propose introducing a penalty duty to be paid by enterprises each time they give notice to an employee over 50 years of age. That would prevent the recruitment of older staff, make the labour market inflexible and cause the loss of jobs. It is no solution.</p>
<p class="contents">We in the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party support the two reports by, respectively, Mrs Randzio-Plath and Mr Bigliardo, as adopted by the committee, but not the proposed amendments to these. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This, in fact, has been a recurring problem since the birth of economic and monetary union, in spite of all the proposals that have been made.</p>
<p class="contents">There is, of course, an issue of governance. Mr Blair, Mr Chirac and Mr Schroeder are proposing a super-minister. And why not? But what use is a minister if nobody knows how to solve the underlying problem? What is more interesting is the observation in Mrs Randzio-Plath’s report to the effect that governance suffers from a democratic deficit. She calls for debates in each country, in each national parliament, debates to which the whole of society should be able to contribute, before the springtime meeting of the Council. I may tell you, however, that such a proposal was carried by this Parliament back in 1996, following my report on public participation in the Union’s institutional system, but it was never implemented, and this Parliament has not pursued the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">In essence, structural reform is something of a magic formula. Reforms are indispensable, but clearly the real issues are their direction and substance and the need to avoid contradictions. If we take the case of the labour market, positive mobility is essential, yet at the same time the Member States are taking decisions designed to prevent workers from the new Member States from exercising freedom of movement within the European labour market. The European Union must therefore create a wider range of incentives, particularly for the much-vaunted development of human capital, an effort that will undoubtedly require a high volume of resources which we are not mobilising at the present time.</p>
<p class="contents">People speak of industrial policy, but that has not been functioning properly since the time of the Maastricht Treaty. As far as funding goes, it has been established that investments of general interest will not be made without an increase in Community resources. And I must emphasise that the authors of the Lisbon objectives also proposed that public funds devoted to priority projects be exempted from the discipline of the Stability Pact. But that is not all. Everyone knows that there are large sums of money flowing into portfolio investments and restructuring but not into industrial investment. One fundamental problem is therefore that credit facilities, the tax system and savings rules provide insufficient incentive for industrial investment. At a time when the falling dollar is strangling our recovery, it is not actually enough for the Central Bank to effect a general cut in interest rates at the risk of deepening the liquidity trap – what is required is a genuine policy of differentiated credit conditions based on the Lisbon objectives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Their focus is on economic reform and flexibility, to the detriment of quality employment, better pay and conditions, greater attention to caring needs, the sustainable use of resources and creating an inclusive society. These issues have to be given priority at this Spring Summit if we are to achieve sustainability and quality in Europe in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">One of the most difficult areas for any government or European institution to deal with is the very rapid change that is taking place in the global economic circumstances. We need to ensure that our policies are flexible enough to be able to respond quickly to those difficulties and upsets.</p>
<p class="contents">It has been our experience over the last number of years, in particular since the introduction of the Stability and Growth Pact in 1996, that by a stringent fiscal management policy, a response to altering currency differentials and an investment – in core human terms – with regard to education, infrastructure, development and so on, we can respond to those changes and difficulties which occur.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the Irish presidency has highlighted the importance of continuing to implement the Lisbon agenda, and I hope that in the next social summit meeting, as well as at the March summit, those ideals will be ensconced into every Member State and that they will all move forward and move away from the old ideology of increasing taxes. That is not only a failed policy; it has also been proved that those that have the highest tax levels within the European Union are the ones that have performed the 'least best' in the changing climate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That leaves us little time to achieve an ambitious objective, which has, so far, been the subject of much discussion, but of little else. When I read the reports by my fellow-Members about the state of the economy today, then there is reason to face that short time with some trepidation.</p>
<p class="contents">In this joint debate, we are dealing with two reports about economic policy and public finances in the EMU and a resolution for the forthcoming Spring Summit. Both reports focus on what has happened to date and what is not going well yet, whereas the resolution for the forthcoming Spring Summit outlines expectations and desires.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, those expectations are, above all, agreements on paper. Economic growth is moderate; the Member States are facing budgetary problems and the economy of the United States is currently growing faster than that of the European Union. We are therefore a long way from being the world's most competitive region.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, in part, support the draft resolution tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. The objectives of the Lisbon process have been pitched too high and defined in an insufficiently clear manner. That is why it is of major importance to make adjustments now.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the objectives should be reconsidered and defined more clearly. We will then perhaps obtain achievable objectives. You will appreciate that achievable objectives will help this House speak out more emphatically about the progress of that process.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is, above all, in respect of the implementation of the Lisbon agreements that adjustments must be made. If that is done, then we will not be bogged down in discussions on how things can be improved, but what is being said here today will also be put into practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At its Lisbon Summit in 2000, the Council formulated the aim that the European Union should become the most competitive economy in the world by 2010. In actual fact, we have tended to decline in every respect since then, with the result that we are now further away from that aim. All the indicators have fallen into the red – especially in the euro area, I might add. Let me illustrate this with a few examples: growth slowing down to 0.4% in 2003, rising unemployment, productivity lagging behind that of the United States, declining public and private investment, worsening budgetary balances and a lack of any clear impetus in the direction of structural reforms.</p>
<p class="contents">Faced with this situation – a disastrous situation, to be perfectly honest – what proposals do we hear? That we should be more resolute in pursuing our present policies, designed primarily to defragment the internal market, to support research and innovation and to increase investment in human capital as a matter of priority. All of these are very admirable objectives, but in fact they may not solve anything, because they do not go to the heart of the problem. The large countries of the euro area are ailing, but their cure can only come from themselves. The Union can certainly assist them, but only by helping to liberate and protect the creators of wealth. ‘Liberate’ and ‘protect’ are the two key words. In actual fact, however, we are doing the opposite. We are not having a liberating effect at the European level, because every day we adopt new regulations, entangling governments and businesses in ever more complex and costly decision-making systems. Every day we add new rigidity. Yesterday it was the standardisation of monetary policy for twelve countries; tomorrow it will be a European constitution which, by its very nature, runs counter to the flexible Europe that we need. Every day we add new taxes, and the European tax proposed by the Commission during the preparation of the next financial perspective is the latest manifestation of this trend.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Union does not afford its economy enough protection. Its competition policy does not take sufficient account of the pressing need to create major European conglomerates. It is selling off the Community preference at knock-down prices in industry as in agriculture. Even now it is in the process of agreeing to the use of European wine designations by producers outside the Community. Finally, it has been instrumental in allowing the entry of unskilled immigrants who do not meet the needs of our economy and who impose a heavy burden on our welfare budgets. In short, we are doing the opposite of what is needed. Mr President, we must not be surprised when we reap what we have sown. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I can, therefore, confirm that Italy is a strong supporter of European unity, without any ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’, and – in my opinion – the single currency will benefit the European economy in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">After this introduction, I would like to congratulate Mr Bigliardo on the report that he has presented, which is an in-depth study into the European economic situation, and also an attempt to interpret the Stability and Growth Pact in a new way, by looking carefully at European Union public finances. The recovery of the economy which began in 2002 showed itself to be short-lived and it certainly did not trigger a sufficiently powerful trend towards economic growth. Amongst other things, the European Union has seen an increase in unemployment and a gradual weakening of public finances. At the same time, the strong euro has created difficulties for exports and the trend of slowly falling inflation has caused consumption to reach a standstill. On the basis of the examination of these problems, we must ask ourselves whether the rigidity of the Stability and Growth Pact might have had a negative effect on the growth in productivity and on the increase in employment. In order to improve the flexibility of the labour market, we will certainly have to remove the remaining obstacles, adopt the recognition of professional qualifications and establish business incentives linked to productivity. Similarly, programmes seeking to modernise production processes must be stepped up, and it is essential that further investment is channelled into the research and development sectors.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore fully agree with the objective to bring, by the end of the decade, spending on research and development to 3% of GDP, of which two-thirds should, as approved by the Barcelona Council, go to the private sector, to reward small- and medium-sized enterprises for their participation in these processes. We will then be happy if, they at least, are not in future included within the total expenditure that balances the budget deficit, which must remain below 3% of GDP. Economic growth in a given area depends largely on the investments that have been planned and made and on the priorities that have been set. Certainly, the transit corridors and goods and passenger transport networks must receive greater attention. In implementing and developing the networks we need to provide for the completion of main routes, the elimination of existing bottlenecks, in particular in cross-border areas, by developing connections and strategic inter-connections.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it should be recalled that when putting infrastructures in place for direct connections consideration must be given not only to the central regions of Europe but also to the peripheral regions of the Community. This would effectively guarantee genuine freedom of movement of people and goods within the European territory and would pave the way for strategic interconnection with the Mediterranean and Eastern European countries. Of course, projects of such scale require extremely substantial financial investments, which cannot contravene the strict provisions of the current Stability and Growth Pact. The Pact must, therefore, be read and interpreted in a more flexible manner, but it must also be seen as a guarantee of stability in Europe. Its existence, which was saved and safeguarded by the prudent and intelligent choices made under the Italian Presidency, must be protected and confirmed, but with a more objectively realistic vision of the European economic framework.</p>

This is all in a world which is already topsy-turvy in terms of international trade and the whole issue of security and so on. The question is, are we ready to deal with all of these challenges? I do not think the signs are good in that respect.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to enlargement, we already see that virtually all states are running in panic to protect their labour markets. We see a situation where the most prosperous of the Member States are saying 'not a penny more'. We have a situation where a self-selected <span class="italic">directoire</span> decides that what is best for the European Union is a 'Super Commissioner' for Economic Affairs. Fine! I have no problem with that, but where is the proposal for a 'Super Commissioner' for a socially-inclusive, cohesive and sustainable European society? Economics are fine, they are very important in terms of developing a single market, but they are a very narrow focus for creating a socially-inclusive and sustainable European society. Our concern is that we have a lot of proposals, many of them very good, but we have virtually no joined-up government in the European Union. I am fearful that we are not going to get that in the current period.</p>
<p class="contents">We are facing a period when we will have a new Parliament and a new Commission within a few months: all of these things will be challenges for our institutions and we still seem to be bogged down in focusing purely and simply on competitiveness – which, of course, I do not deny is important, but it is only one half of the story.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to put social inclusion and social cohesion goals at the heart of our social protection policies when we are talking about reform of that area in the Lisbon process. We need to ensure, however, that when the Stability and Growth Pact is reformed – as it should be – states which invest in education and training are not penalised as a result. We must build a dynamic into the Lisbon process by ensuring that the Stability and Growth Pact actually provides for growth as well as stability, and the best way of doing that is to ensure that there are incentives to invest in what will drive the economy: well-trained, satisfied workers who have good jobs and provide the productivity that we need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Regrettably, during those past four years, the necessary progress has not been made in order to realise those ambitions. It is abundantly clear where the problem lies: the Member States are not pro-active enough in order to make the European economy competitive and dynamic.</p>
<p class="contents">In anticipation of the Spring Summit, President Chirac, Chancellor Schröder and Mr Blair put their heads together in order to breathe new life into Project Europe, or so we were told. Such a get-together rarely benefits our European economy. After all, they do nothing but work out a common denominator based on their own national interests, which the rest of Europe has to accept.</p>
<p class="contents">That our European economy is currently at a standstill is due to the poor functioning of the German and French labour markets. Was it not, in fact, France and Germany that saddled us with agreements about the agricultural budget, as a result of which we are now facing an enormous rise in the European budget following enlargement? And who will be footing the bill? Certainly not Great Britain, for that country is firmly holding onto its rebate. The Group of the European Liberal, Democratic and Reform Party believes that the heaviest burdens should rest on the strongest shoulders, but that involves all of them.</p>
<p class="contents">With this resolution, we are urging the Member States to work on the Lisbon objectives and keep their economies healthy. We, in the European Parliament, however, may not saddle industry with unnecessarily heavy administrative and financial burdens, as is the case with the proposed ‘REACH’ chemicals policy. It is only the Member States, though, that can ensure that Europe remains competitive at world level. It is important in that respect that the Stability Pact should be upheld and that every country should keep its budget in order. That alone can bring prosperity and a rise in employment, which is what the public so desperately need. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In almost every speech, we hear about the low growth rate, falling investments, increasing unemployment and the disappearance of capital and of highly qualified labour etc. It is a tone quite different to that we heard three or four years ago when there was a lot of optimism.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that this set of problems has to be taken very seriously. My own view is that a long-term growth policy is needed, with the emphasis upon infrastructure, the environment, technological development, the development of human capital and such matters as have been addressed by many of the speakers.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue is, which of the prior conditions are the most important. I believe that responsibility for this new policy must lie with the Member States. My impression is that the EU does not have the political strength, unity and economic prospects needed to lead such a policy and to put Europe back on the right road. The Member States must produce the growth package in the form of national policies based on large-scale public-private cooperation. In my own country of Sweden, the strongest periods of growth have in general emerged from national ventures in which public policies have combined with trade and industry to succeed in creating especially favourable effects. I wish especially to indicate the importance and significance of the public sector’s playing an active role in such contexts, both because it is important for employment and because it consumes large portions of resources. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The connecting link that enables the whole thing to function, and allows us to develop the internal market, is the Stability and Growth Pact, and let me say here and now that I urge us all to adhere to it, including the Eurozone’s two biggest countries, Germany and France. We therefore support the Commission in its case before the European Court of Justice, in which it is seeking to prevent the competences under the Stability and Growth Pact from becoming obscured.</p>
<p class="contents">On its own, though, that is not enough; achievement of the Lisbon target is a task not only for the Member States, but also for the Commission and Parliament. It is for the Member States to bring forward the reforms that are needed in the labour market, in the social field, in fiscal policy, in making locations attractive and in promoting forward-looking sectors of industry. That is for the Member States to do, and we cannot discharge them from that responsibility. It is for the Commission to set a sound industrial policy in motion, something we have, over recent years, neglected to institute in parallel with the promotion of the service sector and the phasing-in of the European internal market. Over and over again, considerations of consumer and environmental protection predominated. If we want to stake a claim on our place in the world, then this is where we have to move forward.</p>
<p class="contents">I call upon the Commission to give serious consideration to imposing a moratorium of between three and five years on environmental and consumer legislation. That is the only way in which we will actually reach the Lisbon objectives, for so far we have done no more than prepare for the journey; we have actually remained standing still. Only a moratorium of this kind on the part of the European Union, which in any case leads the world in protecting the environment and people at work, and in the social field, can enable us to become what we decided at Lisbon that we wanted to be – the most competitive region in the world.</p>

I would prefer, though, to concentrate on research, for we need a policy on it if the European economy is to be competitive. The astonishing thing is that this is an area about which we are all agreed, and yet, especially in the Member States, it has experienced cutbacks over recent years. Most spectacularly of all, in France – for the first time in Europe – researchers are even taking to the streets, and their counterparts elsewhere are perfectly prepared to do likewise, so it is not just the farmers who are demonstrating; the researchers are obviously doing it too. I see that as interesting, but also regrettable, for this makes it quite plain how the high-flown utterances of Heads of State or Government contrast with the austerity of their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, along come the finance ministers and tell us that there is no money. The question is, though, whether we cannot do any research because we have no money, or whether we have no money because we are not doing any research. To take just one Member State as an example, Finland shows us very clearly how it is possible, even when times are hard, to succeed by investing in the future. Today, Finland keeps on being hailed as the highest-achieving country in the European Union, and it has not even been a Member State for that long. What this means is that Finland has done a great deal, even without the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">So I would urge us in this House to keep on track in campaigning for the 3% expenditure on research and for the launching of an innovation strategy for small- and medium-sized enterprises. I will conclude by urging Members to this House to be present at the Science Convention that we intend to organise in Brussels for early April, in order to make it clear that this strategy still enjoys support from this House, at least. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Portugal is an example of this slavish implementation of the Stability Pact. The country is deep in recession, with a reduction in GDP that might exceed 1% and the highest levels of unemployment in the EU, which is jeopardising not only economic convergence with the EU, but also, for the third year in succession, the very conditions needed for a swift and sustained recovery. Budgetary consolidation must not be used as a stick with which to beat public services, nor must it jeopardise public investment. It must be a guarantee of high-quality public services. This policy, this Stability Pact must be amended. We must first speak about a sustainable growth and employment pact so that we can respond to the EU’s economic and social problems. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree with Mr Linkohr that it would be useful to open a debate on Mr Lange’s contribution. Unfortunately this is not possible.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to present one example. If Europe eventually takes the decision to actively support and promote clean technology, research and development in that field will become an obvious source of employment and investment in the Union. One of the major challenges currently facing the international community concerns implementing the Kyoto Protocol and meeting its objectives. This has generated heated debate between the industrial world and the administration. In my view, widespread application of cleaner technology is one solution, precisely because it would facilitate the reduction of polluting emissions. The competitive and dynamic Europe we are all hoping for is unlikely to emerge without investment in such technology.</p>
<p class="contents">My second and last point is a corollary of the first. It is absolutely vital to be far more active in promoting the efficient use of natural resources. The reason is, quite simply, that decoupling economic growth and the increased use of resources is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> for ensuring the continuity of sustainable growth. It is also crucial to the creation of a knowledge-based Europe. Such a Europe would be a world leader in terms of competitiveness and full employment. It is the Europe we are all striving for. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">and then, suddenly, masses of jobs will be created. I see that as utterly false. If we take a close look at where, over the past few decades, there have been the greatest increases in growth and employment, they have occurred precisely in those sectors that Mr Langen listed earlier, namely in sustainable development and in the protection of the environment. I believe that it is also in these that investment has to be more vigorously encouraged, particularly as regards urban renewal, both in relation to its social and environmental components, and also transport. Here too, it appears that it is in relation to the social and environmental components that there is the greatest potential for growth, and so it is here that there are, potentially, the greatest effects on employment. As, I believe, an unregulated market cannot do other than result in adverse consequences for the environment, it naturally follows that investment in these areas would help to secure the ecological bases of our existence.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have to be faithful to Lisbon and Gothenburg in our approach and in our seeking sustainable production methods in Europe, which will induce growth and employment, founded upon the ecological bases of our existence. We have, in the past, come up with sound approaches to this, and we should continue on this road in a credible way. Internationally, I believe, we will lose our credibility in many areas if we now proceed to dump our own objectives and what we agreed to in Johannesburg and Kyoto. We have to hold fast to our own objectives and carry on down this road. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The grave economic downturn in many Member States demands more effective action. There is a need for closer approximation between economic, employment and structural policies, without going as far as attempting to harmonise them. Cutbacks in the bureaucracy of the state, improved structures in financial markets and more investment – to which Members have already referred – can promote the creation of more and sustainable jobs, but there is, above all, a lack of coordinated cooperation in the area of lifelong learning and the introduction of European educational marketing. Studies in the EU have revealed that too many young people have been poorly educated. More support for human capital, though, makes them more employable, and so this is something that has to be addressed in schools, work-based training and in universities.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that social dialogue has to be stepped up. I regard it as a key element in handling changes in our society, and it is regrettable that, in many Member States, it tends to take place on the margins. The enlargement of the EU in the coming months means that we have to be consistent in pressing on with joint measures in employment and social policy, of which the European employment strategy was, and still is, one of the most successful features. I might add that the budgetary expenditure for these areas is minimal in comparison with the structural resources for enlargement. The Commission’s insistence on increasing contributions and hence the burden on net contributors can therefore only be repudiated. Both on the European and national level, we need something else, and that is iron discipline where spending is concerned. It follows from this that we cannot support the amendment in which the Socialists dare to warn of austerity budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The last point I want to make is that nothing will come of any attempt at softening up the Stability and Growth Pact or at discrediting it as unworkable. This, Commissioner Solbes Mira, is where the Commission is absolutely right; the budgetary offenders must be brought before the European Court of Justice. That deserves every political support, for the one thing needed by our businesses, by their workers as well as their managers, is guaranteed and long-term stability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Firstly, the summit must ensure there is an increase in investment; secondly, it must ensure that there is an increase in investment, and thirdly, it must ensure that money is better invested. Both in the private and public sectors, we are lagging behind the USA; in the public sector we are behind them by 1%. I absolutely fail to grasp how, in view of this economic state of affairs, Members of this House can manage to come up with two recommendations for us, one being that we should deal with the crisis by leaving more muck in the air, which is what Mr Langen’s proposal in part amounts to; the other, that we carry on stubbornly wrecking the economy with austerity measures, rather than giving it the kick-start that it needs. Bad textbooks on economic policy are legion, but never yet have I found one so bad that it would recommend these courses of action in a phase of the economic cycle such as the one that we are now in.</p>
<p class="contents">Quite the opposite is the case: the situation we are now in demands that we take the action outlined by Mr De Rossa, adopting a dynamic attitude towards the necessary balance between stability on the one hand and efficiency on the other. I am eager to see what the Commission will do with the slogan ‘Dynamic action, balance between stability and efficiency’. We look forward to your proposals, Commissioner Solbes, and hope that we will have a productive debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is my belief that we could achieve the Lisbon objectives in the field of employment if we were to succeed in creating a better labour market for older workers, so I was very disappointed to note that the Commission talks only about abolishing the financial instruments for them. We might as well deny them the right to vote. What the Commission states is wholly unacceptable. We need to create a labour market capable of offering scope, one that will also make such arrangements less necessary than they currently are.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, I should like to turn to the legislation itself. The Commission was right to point out that legislation on the internal market must be introduced swiftly. It too, of course, has come up with its own proposals, although you cannot help wondering whether they will contribute a tremendous amount to employment. I fear that the reverse might sometimes be true. I am also concerned that in the field of financial services, as was the case in the takeover directive, there is the temptation to emulate what we think is happening in the United States. I think we should carefully consider what effect all of this has on employment.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also the environment, of course. It is indeed the case that in the assessment of existing environmental laws, and the drafting of new ones, far more consideration should be given to the employment effects than has been the case to date. It is too easy to trivialise this, as Mr Langen has done.</p>
<p class="contents">My final point concerns productivity, an issue that I think is still very much being underestimated. Productivity ties everything together. If we improve productivity, we can do more, we can obtain better jobs. Often, though, it is the other side of this House that stands in the way of improving productivity because there is too much consideration for old ideas for which there is little sympathy in this day and age. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Council and the Commission share these concerns and rightly insist on the importance of confirming a strategy for a knowledge-based economy.</p>
<p class="contents">I do, however, believe that, in view of the Spring Summit, the Union’s Financial Perspective needs to be considered and questions must be answered.</p>
<p class="contents">The first question concerns the means of achieving a balance between the stability policy which manifests itself in the form of the single currency, and a policy of promoting research, innovation for small businesses and investments in TENs, which will enable the European regions to integrate.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question concerns how to address the globalisation of the markets that is challenging even the most modern businesses that have to compete with the US and Japan – that is to say the countries at the forefront of research – and traditional businesses that have to compete with China and economies that have low labour, social policy and environmental policy costs.</p>
<p class="contents">The third question concerns developing factors for competitiveness, which help to strengthen the Community’s presence in fundamental research, and also in industrial policy. This community commitment is possible if the Financial Perspective is consistent with the objectives of EU enlargement, and also with growth that is increasingly linked to human capital, product quality and the competitiveness of businesses operating in an ever more open market.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the political problem turns, in fact, on the ability to bring about the structural reforms and also to take the budgetary decisions that we believe are necessary to give Europe a future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who engage in lawbreaking at European level, by using a ministerial decision to interfere with the Commission’s procedures, have to be told in plain language that breaching this Stability and Growth Pact will end up undermining the stability of the euro, and that will cause the foundation of growth in Europe to crumble.</p>
<p class="contents">This is where the letter from the six countries with consolidated budgets speaks volumes, and it is my hope and wish that we may recover that awareness with this Pact in mind. What is true of this Pact is true of much else, that if you want to change the law, then find yourself a majority, but you do not change the law by breaking it.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the process of structural reform that the European Central Bank is demanding ought to happen at national level. There is a particular lack of such reforms in Germany. It speaks volumes when we read, as we currently do, of a fall in the per capita average gross domestic product in Germany, and of Germany being fourth from the bottom. It certainly does not indicate that the Social Democrats are making a good job of running Germany. It would also indicate that the mere fact of Commissioner Verheugen’s membership of that party is enough to disqualify him from being the super-Commissioner here in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me close by pointing out that the Lisbon Process does not mean that a large spending programme means that there is money to burn. On the contrary, savings have to be made at the European level too, and so I have no sympathy for the Commission’s demand for a 50% increase in the Budget. That, too, would overburden the net contributors within the European Union. Several Members of this House could do with a thinking and reflection process, and, overall, I believe that a consolidation phase would do the European Union some good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Advances have been made since European leaders declared that they were going to make Europe the most competitive knowledge-based economy within ten years, but there have also been a lot of steps back. It seems to me that a fundamental aim of the Lisbon agenda is to produce economic reform and more flexible labour markets. In many cases, however, we have seen the European Union going in the opposite direction to this aspiration. Labour markets are not made more flexible by measures like the Temporary Workers Directive, which could drive hundreds or thousands of temporary workers out of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also concerned about plans to phase out some of the opt-outs to the Working Time Directive, which give additional flexibility. Of course it is important to ensure that people do not have to work excessive hours, but there are many aspects of the Working Time Directive that just add red tape and do not give proper protection to working people: these measures just make it more difficult for them to run their lives in the way they would like to.</p>
<p class="contents">There are other proposals which I think are overreactions: the intention in the Chemicals Regulation, for example, is that one must control and regulate the use of dangerous chemicals, but this should not give rise to the disproportionate reaction we have seen from that regulation. Many items of European legislation are over-intrusive and simply add to business costs. In the end, that will cost jobs for people in Europe and very often mean that consumers end up getting a worse deal and a narrower range of choices.</p>
<p class="contents">To make the Lisbon agenda a reality we have to cut down on the red tape produced by the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to thank them for the ideas they put forward. Unfortunately, time constraints are such that I am unable to comment in detail on all of the latter. I would, however, like to highlight what I feel are the key aspects of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">There seems to be widespread agreement that the rate of growth needs to increase, and that our present rate is unsatisfactory. Nonetheless, I would caution against simplistic comparisons. For a comparison between the United States and Europe to be valid, their respective starting points must be taken into account. The anticipated commitments of both areas must be borne in mind too. Even a comparison between the Eurozone and the zone beyond it is not straightforward. Essentially, the key issue arising at present is whether the Lisbon diagnosis remains valid or not.</p>
<p class="contents">I am convinced that basically, increased capacity for growth in Europe depends on two factors, namely more employment in Europe and more productive employment. I believe this diagnosis remains valid. If that is the case, the question arises as to what is going wrong in Europe. I do not believe the difficulty lies in the diagnosis. Rather, the difficulty lies in the implementation and practical application of what was decided in Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">It has to be said, however, that the Commission’s report clearly states that progress has been made in certain areas, though there is general dissatisfaction regarding others.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, ground has undoubtedly been gained on the employment front. On the other, rather less has been achieved concerning productivity. Progress has also been made within the internal market, though not on the scale anticipated. A number of obstacles have been overcome, allowing the financial system to become more unified. Unfortunately, unification has not yet resulted in bringing financial costs down to a level comparable with what is the norm in the United States. Certain additional elements have been put in place, and I am sure these will prove helpful. In my view, the growth initiative is an important factor in relaunching other aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals for this year focus on those elements that can facilitate productivity and ensure it increases. Research and development are indeed one of the objectives set. It is, however, important to put discussion of research and development into context. Clearly, 3% of GDP is a figure similar to that of the United States, but if one distinguishes between public and private investment in research and development in Europe and in the United States, the figure for public investment in Europe is higher than in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The question arises as to whether the figure alone is the problem, or whether the problem concerns our ability to work better between ourselves, avoiding duplication of activity. There is also the issue of generating added attraction and promoting private activity. These factors are all crucial, in my view. I certainly feel these priorities are well chosen and appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">It should always be remembered that the Lisbon strategy also has clear limits. All agree that it should be a sustainable strategy. That implies a certain appropriate degree or level of social protection. It also implies a certain level of environmental protection.</p>
<p class="contents">This led to further points raised during the debate. The question arose, for instance, as to whether this was a difficulty related to defining a strategy. I maintained this was not the case. It is a problem of the political will, essentially at national level, to implement agreements reached.</p>
<p class="contents">As to whether the Stability and Growth Pact is a problem or a positive element, I myself believe the latter is the case. I believe sound finances are essential to long-term growth. With regard to fiscal policy acting as a discretionary element to improve growth in the short term, it might indeed serve as such in some cases, at least in theory. In my view, however, it is also important not to overlook certain other fundamental issues. Firstly, the operation of the budgets and automatic stabilisers in Europe. This is far more dynamic here than in the United States. It means that every one-point drop in activity is compensated for by half a point as regards budget deviation.</p>
<p class="contents">There is indeed a limit in place, that notorious 3%. Experience has proved it to be a reasonable limit. I am convinced this is still the case, and that it is useful for the European Union to have a fiscal framework. I also believe this fiscal framework calls for budgetary balance to be achieved in the medium term, given the difficulties anticipated and the ageing population. Further, it seems to me that 3% as a nominal reference is a key factor for that budgetary balance in the medium term. It is essential to the desired efficient system that will make it possible to control activities under way and allow us to cooperate.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore feel it is vital to tackle the problems related to the future of the pact. As I see it, the Treaty remains valid. The fundamental concepts certainly do. Nonetheless, improvements are called for in certain areas. The interrelation between the guidelines for economic policy and the pact is certainly one such area. It is important not to focus on fiscal consolidation <span class="italic">per se</span>. Fiscal consolidation should be perceived as a way of generating increased growth. Clearly, this is closely connected with the Broad Guidelines of economic policy. It presents a second difficulty we have become aware of in recent years, namely that some of the problems currently experienced result from inappropriate action at a critical point in the economic cycle.</p>
<p class="contents">Growth elements have been introduced into the pact by giving more importance to structural deficits. Last November’s communication was along those lines. Some problems do still remain in this crucial area, of course. We are certainly prepared to discuss and debate them.</p>
<p class="contents">We feel the problem of the future is extremely important. With this in mind, the debt needs to become more important in the pact game. So too should all future commitments that are bound to have a negative impact on growth in the long term. Issues like the ageing of the population and the need to fund future commitments are crucial.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one last remark to make. In my view, as some honourable Members have indeed pointed out, the national will to apply the pact is absolutely vital. This could mean improving current budgetary processes. I have in mind changes to ensure national parliaments themselves are more involved in defining their own future commitments and in meeting the commitments eventually entered into.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel the starting point is sound. Increased growth would of course be welcome, and the margin for manoeuvre is indeed limited. In establishing its financial perspective, the Commission endeavoured to achieve a balance between on the one hand, not exceeding the current margin of manoeuvre, despite the additional commitments, whilst on the other hand, not increasing the current financial margin more than absolutely necessary. We are very much aware that at the end of the day the Union’s budget is 1, 1.4, 1.24%. We appreciate that the major element of public expenditure is currently at national level. Consequently, if there is no cooperation at national level it will not be possible to move towards that increased growth we all aspire to for Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I may not agree with all of the analysis, but I found the debate extraordinarily interesting and very constructive. I do not have time to mention each of the points, but there were a number of interesting points made during the course of the debate.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Blokland, for example, illustrated that the Lisbon agenda is running out: we can number the amount of time we have left in days. That was a very interesting point. Flexibility in our approach was emphasised by Mr Crowley, and Mr De Rossa indicated how dynamic a world Europe exists in and how extraordinary the challenges are which arise from that.</p>
<p class="contents">Not surprisingly speakers were very clear as to the need to continuously tackle the barriers that prevent full implementation of the Lisbon strategy. Mr Baron was absolutely correct when he said that the way to hell is paved with good intentions; there are plenty of good intentions in the Lisbon strategy. As presidency we are conscious that as well as expressing good intentions we also need to focus the whole process in very much the way that Mr Watson suggested.</p>
<p class="contents">The strategy does not belong to the European institutions, but to the people of Europe. There are many stakeholders here – a point well made by Ms Randzio-Plath. Somehow we have to engage the attention of all these stakeholders – not just the Member State governments and the institutions, but the people of Europe – and make sure they focus on the agenda itself and what this means in reality.</p>
<p class="contents">Many Members spoke about the issue of regulation. I am not sure that Mr Jonckheer and myself would agree with each other, but he made the point about the concerns that exist about liberalisation and regulation, a matter that was also touched on by many other speakers. We feel very strongly that a significant amount of time and attention must be focused on making sure that regulation is effective, i.e. that it helps the process rather than hindering it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another of the key focuses in the debate was on what is necessary to put in place to create a truly knowledge-based economy. I would agree with Commissioner Reding who at the very outset made a point about the necessary emphasis on education. I would also agree with the points made by Mrs Grossetête and Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo on the need for research and development. There were many contributions throughout the debate about how we deal with the issue of creating a knowledge-based economy and I believe that Members were correct in pointing out that education is key, as is investment in research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">One point that did strike me was the one made again and again about the necessity of creating a research environment within the Europe. Researchers are the seed capital of a knowledge-based economy and the EU and its Member States must recognise this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Lisbon strategy is not some musty academic concept; it is vital to the lives of the citizens of the EU-15 and, as from 1 May 2004, it will also be vital to the lives and wellbeing of 450 million citizens of our Union across 25 states. It is an endeavour that deserves all of our attention, our energy and our ingenuity. Insofar as this presidency is concerned it is a key priority and we are putting a lot of attention and focus on it.</p>
<p class="contents">At the March European Council meeting we intend to use a focused, as opposed to scatter-gun, approach. We believe that we have to focus very carefully on those things that we can achieve and get on with the task of achieving them.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion I would like to thank each Member for their contributions to this very interesting and focused debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European mini-summit in Berlin has once again demonstrated that everyone is agreed on the objectives but not on the actions to be taken, and so we are not making any headway. Replacing the current vague agreements with a timetable with exact objectives should help the Heads of Government find a way to invigorate the knowledge economy and make the European labour market more flexible.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, during the Spring Summit, the Commission should indicate what has been done about removing superfluous legislation, of which, according to the Commission’s promises to European industry, 25% is to be deleted. By reducing the burden of administration, companies will once again have the chance to be enterprising and thereby generate economic growth. A European 'super-Commissioner' for economic affairs is not the answer. Germany’s Chancellor Schröder should have known this, for the German 'superminister' for Economic Affairs and Employment, Wolfgang Clement, has not managed to prevent the German economy from still achieving one of Europe's lowest growth rates. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>
