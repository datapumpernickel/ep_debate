The first of them, the coup d’état of 18 May, was the subject of a resolution, by the Presidency of the European Union, which roundly condemned any type of modification by force of constitutional legality in Paraguay and expressed support for the President of the Republic, Luis González Macchi, who, in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, restored the situation to normal.</p>
<p class="contents">The second event which has been followed with great interest by this Parliament was the arrest on 11 June, of General Oviedo. That arrest can be seen as a response by the Government of Brazil to the appeal from the Paraguayan Government to the neighbouring countries for cooperation, given the threats of attempts to destabilise democracy originating from outside the country. This is a clear sign, Mr President, of cooperation amongst the countries of Mercosur, with which the European Union is negotiating a new, very advanced association agreement which is based on the fundamental principles of respect for political pluralism and the defence of democracy, the rule of law and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, we in this Parliament must, in my opinion, support full democratic consolidation in the Republic of Paraguay and appeal for the correct operation of the rule of law and justice in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, it seems to me to be particularly appropriate to point out that the defence of democracy and the rule of law is the cornerstone of the policy of cooperation with the countries of Latin America. The respect for democratic values is, and must continue to be, the central pillar of political dialogue between the European Union and the countries of Mercosur, both on a regional level and on a bilateral level. Good evidence of this can be found in the ambitious institutional support programmes which the European Union has been developing in Paraguay since 1995. These projects, Mr President, are fundamental in a country whose constitution only dates from 1992, whose first elections took place in 1993, which suffered 50 years of dictatorship and which, therefore, is very much in need of democratic stability and institutional continuity.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context we are concerned about the fragility and instability of the Government of National Union, headed by President González Macchi, resulting from the withdrawal of the Liberal Party from the government coalition, and the growing difficulties which this governmental coalition must face. And, as if this situation were not ominous enough, they have to deal with a coup d’état.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe that both the European Union and the United States, which have expressed their support for the Government of Paraguay, while recognising that efforts are being made to consolidate a certain degree of democratic stability, must also remind the Paraguayan authorities of the urgent need to take measures on institutional consolidation and to begin also to resolve the great economic and social problems in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">Having pointed out the importance of our institutional support and cooperation in Paraguay, I do not wish to end without reminding you that the European Union still has no office in Paraguay.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that a European Commission delegation in Asunción would not only aid and improve our relations, but could also contribute in a significant way to the achievement of these objectives which are so important to all those of us who believe in the democratic clause, which is the foundation of these agreements and our relations with that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">For this reason, we consider it appropriate and necessary to show our solidarity and support for the democratic régime in Paraguay and to reject coups d’état and support democracy. The prosecution of Oviedo, the perpetrator of coups d’état, must be taken as an opportunity to make progress on the road to democracy, but we are also obliged to mention that democracy will not be consolidated in Paraguay unless social justice is improved, the eternal problems of social inequality are eliminated and the problems of unemployment and discrimination are brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">We can help considerably in this field, by appropriately implementing the contents of the European Union’s agreements with the Mercosur countries and in particular the agreement with Paraguay, which is so necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore believe that our action in this area can be decisive and we would also like to express our full support for the joint resolution which we have signed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As is customary in the House, we have tried to agree on a joint resolution. Unfortunately, we cannot put our names to it as it stands.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the situation in Paraguay is characterised not only by a revolutionary tendency in certain sections of the army but, more generally, by very serious human rights violations and the harsh suppression of popular movements. We have tried, in our resolution, to emphasise both these factors simultaneously. Given the very long history of Europe itself, you will be well aware that, in countries where human rights are not observed by a government, generally republican or democratic or claiming to be republican or democratic, this government runs the risk of a military coup d’état. In a way, governments get the coups d’état they deserve, and a weak democracy is vulnerable to military coups d’état.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution before us simply pays tribute to the initiative used by another Southern Cone country to arrest the leader of a military coup d’état and extradite him to his country of origin. We welcome this initiative on the part of Brazil, but to say that and nothing more would mean framing a resolution on Brazil, not Paraguay. We can welcome the progress that Brazil is making on the road to democratic cooperation in the Southern Cone, but that does not make it a resolution on Paraguay.</p>
<p class="contents">We would have liked the issue of human rights as managed by the legally constituted government in Paraguay to be specifically taken into account. We would have liked the European Union to exploit the methods of democratic persuasion afforded due to the aid it provides to all the Southern Cone countries in order to encourage the legitimate government in Paraguay to show greater respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, in the current wording of the resolution, this is not the case, and we consequently prefer to vote against the joint motion for a resolution and, if necessary, maintain our own motion for a resolution.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Fortunately, by the end of the 1980s and the early 1990s nearly every Latin American state had returned to democracy. But in several countries there are signs of a return to the old ways.</p>
<p class="contents">Paraguay is one of the worst examples of this. It therefore makes sense that the European Parliament, which has always regarded itself as the patron saint of democracy in Latin America and elsewhere, should express its views on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point that I would like to mention relates to Paraguay and Brazil. Mr Lipietz has already touched upon this, but with a somewhat different emphasis. I regard it as being extraordinarily helpful that within Mercosur, to which both these countries belong, a code of values has now been adopted under which dictators, or attempts to establish a dictatorship, no longer have a chance of success. Oviedo was arrested in Brazil and I hope that he will be extradited to Paraguay. This is proof that Mercosur is more than just a free trade area – it is a political area in which democracy is protected.</p>
<p class="contents">By the way, I totally agree with Mr Lipietz when he says that what is at stake in Paraguay is not just General Oviedo, but human rights as a whole. There is nothing separating us on that. However, you cannot of course write a whole book in a short resolution. I hope that we will be able to discus this issue at some other point, and I assume that we will also be able to reach a consensus then.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the bad news is that democracy is once again being threatened, but there has also been good news: the democratic forces have resisted and, furthermore, General Oviedo has been arrested in Brazil.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that Paraguay is probably a forgotten country, which has been helped by its integration into Mercosur, and, from that point of view, it is important that our relations with Paraguay should improve the situation, and that Brussels should find a way to help that country and at the same time remind it, as we will surely do later in the case of Peru, of the democratic clause which is the inspiration for all our actions. We also believe that it would be a positive thing for the Commission to take account of Paraguayan civil society.</p>
<p class="contents">Other equally positive signs are the reduction in corruption and the hope that General Oviedo, like Pinochet, will be tried. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The history of Paraguay is one of the saddest and most unjust in Latin America. For those of us who for many years have sided with the resistance in that country, it is painful to remember how, in the 60s and 70s, there were at least three good reasons to feel sorrow. Paraguay was probably the only country in the world whose population had been practically exterminated during wars with its two neighbours, Argentina and Brazil. Only women and some old men and children survived those wars. At that time, Paraguay was the only country which had considerably more population outside its borders than inside, with exiles, outcasts and emigrants of every type. Lastly, Paraguay held the tragic record of suffering the longest dictatorship in the whole of Latin America, headed by General Stroessner. That dictatorship displayed the most extraordinary cruelty in its repression of any opposition, and at the same time its dictator and his entourage was enormously corrupt, with their monopoly on big business and, in particular, smuggling.</p>
<p class="contents">The Paraguayan people never gave in. For decades the fight continued, embodied in the February revolution, and the so-called <span class="italic">febrerismo</span>, one of the brief moments of democracy and hope, which was quickly stamped out, firstly by force of arms, but then kept down at a very high cost in death, prison, exile and enormous suffering.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the harshness of the repression, the internal decay of the authoritarian regime and the growing mobilisation of civil society eventually forced a transition which opened the way to progress and representative democracy. This has been the situation over recent years, although the threat of regression and attempts at destabilisation have not disappeared. In fact there has been constant agitation from local bosses and members of the military who are nostalgic, not so much for power, but rather for the possibility of making money which that power used to offer them. We have therefore witnessed a constant tension between civil democratic forces and sinister personalities, the main example of which is General Lino Oviedo, consummate purveyor of repeated coups d’états, professional destabiliser, shady businessman and even alleged promoter of assassinations such as that of the Vice-President of the Republic, Luis María Argaña.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, and with Oviedo under arrest in Brazil, the resolution we are voting on in Parliament is a great opportunity. It condemns the enemies of freedom and the destabilisers, it asks Paraguay’s neighbours for respect and cooperation, so that the consolidation of Paraguayan democracy may become a reality and, above all, it underlines the European Union’s commitment to the people and democratic institutions of Paraguay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Overall, we have witnessed an impressive success story in Latin America during the last 15 to 20 years in terms of democratisation. That is why, in every single case where these successes are undermined, we must say, in the plainest terms, so far and no further. Paraguay, a country which was in any case a straggler in Latin America when it came to democratisation, appears to be in jeopardy. That is why we really must express our solidarity with the democratic forces in Paraguay, and not only in words, but also in deeds.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has already been active in Paraguay for a good many years. Our attempts to have a concrete influence on the situation there have focused on two areas. The first of these is to develop and strengthen democratic institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to send a very clear message to the current government in Paraguay that this cannot just be regarded as a job for Europeans, North Americans, or anyone else. We can help to develop these institutions, but the political will really to establish them, to use them and take advantage of them has to come from those who are currently in power in Paraguay.</p>
<p class="contents">The support programme for the Paraguayan Parliament has already gone through three stages. There is now a further project entitled “Modernising the institutions”. Because a suspicion may arise that these funds are perhaps not entirely reaching the areas they are intended for, I would like to make it crystal clear that we have seen fit to incorporate very strict control mechanisms both for Paraguay itself and for other countries. There is therefore no question of the funds involved being diverted through shady channels or into dark corners – we are talking about independent codirection under the direct control of the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The more important programme both in terms of funding and of its ultimate impact is perhaps the programme designed to tackle the social and regional causes of democratic instability in Paraguay. This programme deals with people’s living conditions, especially in rural areas. In this case a number of major programmes with significant budgets have already started. The aim of all these programmes is to improve the day-to-day living conditions of residents of rural areas, which still account for 46% of Paraguay’s population, and so to integrate them more securely into the country’s political and social structures. I would like to mention in particular that this includes a special programme supporting the indigenous population of the Chaco region.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, there is no doubt that these EU activities in Paraguay are unusually far-reaching given the size of the country. Nevertheless, it is true that we do not have a permanent representative on the spot. However, I am pleased to inform you that consideration is currently being given within the Commission to reorganising our foreign missions, and that this involves a shift of emphasis, so that this point will be taken into account. But as yet no decision has been taken to change the situation in Paraguay in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude by saying that as far as we are concerned, the key objective of our international work is to defend democracy and the rule of law throughout the world, including Latin America and also therefore in Paraguay. I very much hope that this debate on Paraguay today in this house, here in Strasbourg, will be viewed not just as a sign of European solidarity, but also as a sign that Europe takes its responsibilities seriously!</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
