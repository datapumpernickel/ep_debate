<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, unfortunately I must begin the debate on my report with the sad news of the tragic deaths of eleven immigrants off the coasts of Lanzarote. Too many words have been said, and they have not yet been able to stop this terrible tragedy.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I must say that only a miracle would allow my group and myself to vote in favour of the report with my name on it, since some of the amendments introduced in committee and others which are being presented again in this House make it very different from my initial ideas.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I believe that neither the Socialist Group nor the Liberal Group, which I understand even less, are up to taking responsible, rigorous and serious positions in the face of the phenomenon of immigration and asylum. It will therefore be very difficult for all of us to comply with the objective of implementing the mandate of the Treaty of Amsterdam on the communitarisation of the asylum procedure and, worse still, for Parliament’s views in this area to be taken into account by the Council, since they reflect party interests which do nothing to help resolve the serious problems which economic immigration and asylum pose for European society at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, frivolity, demagoguery and a lack of realism have very negative effects in certain societies which, like France, may leave the path free to parties or persons which, through their radicalism, may lead to dangerous social confrontations.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, it is the case that the current legislative process in relation to asylum is being carried out in an illogical and disordered fashion. This leads to the incongruous situation of our examining proposed directives which, like this one, regulate minimum rules for conditions for accepting asylum seekers, when much of their content depends on others which are still being dealt with in the Council, as in the case of the directive on procedures or the status of refugees, which is beginning to be debated by means of the Lambert report. To put it in a nutshell, we are beginning to build the house from the roof downwards.</p>
<p class="contents">We must, however, move forward in any event, and Parliament accepts this disorder and wishes to cooperate, despite external and internal difficulties, as demonstrated, for example, by the fact that all the groups in committee have agreed to remove all references in the proposed directive to subordinating conditions for acceptance or medical treatment at the different stages of the procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">Amongst the difficulties faced by my group in supporting this report is, firstly, the scope of the directive. My group and I believe that the persons included in the scope must be, as proposed by the Commission in its original text, those refugees defined in Article 1 of the Geneva Convention, leaving to the Member States the possibility that they may, by extension, be given other forms of protection. This makes sense, especially at a time when – and I will use the same words as Anna Terrón in committee – this Parliament is debating the Lambert report, which will give its opinion on the status of the refugee and subsidiary protection. If the Socialist Group wants to be consistent, it should support the thesis of the rapporteur and not be led by the Liberal Group, which, together with the Greens, intends to impose the extension of the directive to other forms of protection.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to schooling for minors, I believe that it should not go beyond what the Member States can guarantee for their own citizens. Certain Liberal and Green amendments – such as Amendments Nos 47, 48 and 50 – propose going further by obliging Member States to provide schooling, to guarantee nurseries and reduce the time limits for access to education. This is not realistic.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, access to the labour market is a point of conflict which I cannot understand, particularly because the Socialist Group accepted in committee, in its own amendment, the period of six months as a time limit within which the Member States must provide access to the labour market. To reduce it to four months, as the Liberal Group has proposed, and as approved in committee, is entirely inconsistent. It is logical that the Member States should have the room for manoeuvre laid down in the original text, and that they should be allowed to assess the situation of the labour market.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the family members of asylum seekers, a compromise with Socialists and Liberals has lead to the agreement of a formula which is a departure from my group’s traditional position, for the sake of global consensus. What we will not accept under any circumstances is Amendment No 115, which the Group of the Greens is presenting once again, which goes much further than those commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite all of this, I would like to end, Mr President, by expressing my satisfaction at the references that appear in my report, thanks also to the opinion issued by the Committee on Legal Affairs, to the effect that the terrorist activity of asylum seekers should be a cause for a restriction of their right to acceptance.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I hope that later on in the vote, and as a result of the views expressed in this debate, the miracle I referred to at the beginning of my speech may take place.</p>

I agree too with the first statement made this morning, when a Member mentioned the refugees who died off the coast of Spain. I am sad to say that such incidents are very common off the coasts of Italy as well. Approximately 150 million people live outside the country in which they were born and the application of human rights standards is inadequate in many situations. The best is the enemy of the good: when we aim too high, we often achieve nothing in practice. Consider the 1990 Vienna human rights convention, which was signed by many countries but ratified by very few because the standards it lays down are too specific.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there are, especially nowadays, parties which have made the fight against immigrants a priority in their programme. Moreover, immigrants are often used as a reserve source of temporary labour, their visas are often linked to a temporary work permit and their social security is reduced to a minimum. I do not feel that any of this has been dealt with adequately in our document.</p>
<p class="contents">Immigration levels were higher in the past than they are now, but the issue was not then on the agenda, or not a priority. Only now has it reached the top of the agenda, as the Commissioner responsible for immigration has stated that there will only be 100 000 refugees entering the Union each year in ten, fifteen years’ time, which means that an average-sized industrialised country will only be receiving 5000 and industry, in particular, will be complaining of the lack of immigrants. I do not feel that this fact has been taken into due consideration either.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case, my view is, if we are going to tackle this issue, we must do so more thoroughly and more competently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In the Committee on Legal Affairs we have taken a generally very positive view of the Commission’s proposal. I believe that the Commission is doing great work in updating and harmonising Community law in this area. I also believe that the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has done great work, led by its rapporteur, by integrating and trying to modernise the new law.</p>
<p class="contents">The report raises an important issue, which is the updating of the current asylum system and the whole immigration system. From the point of view of international law, following the First World War a series of international conventions were adopted with a view to regulating this area, based on what we might call principles of the right to individual protection in the face of political persecution of a specifically European nature. At the moment a radical transformation is taking place of the whole problem of international migration, in the sense that, as well as real political asylum, we are also seeing economic asylum. This is leading to great movements of people for which we probably do not have appropriate legal instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">This morning, in the speech by Mr Nogueira and the last speech by Mr Volcic, reference has been made to the tragedy that took place yesterday on the island of Lanzarote, in which, once again, eleven immigrants drowned trying to reach our continent, the European Union. It is clear that there is no easy solution to this within the traditional exercise of the right to asylum because, even if we had more liberal and comprehensive legislation in this area, we could not prevent these people from leaving their countries nor offer sufficient guarantees so that they could reach their destination without endangering their lives.</p>
<p class="contents">We are therefore facing a new phenomenon. I will repeat that, from the point of view of the Committee on Legal Affairs, the proposal represents enormous progress, but the Commission and the other European institutions will probably have to find a way to regulate the whole problem of asylum given the new dimension created by the enormous economic phenomenon of international migration linked perhaps to the process of international globalisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is this competition which is creating the tragic situations that we are now seeing, on a daily basis, in the Sangatte refugee centre, at Tarifa, in Italy, and in many other parts of Europe. These tragic situations are clearly calling into question the fundamental rights of individuals, the right to asylum and the international commitments to which we subscribed.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for harmonisation is, of course, heading in the right direction, since it is seeking to halt the downward spiral in the conditions in which asylum applicants are received in Europe. It is heading in the right direction and will become fully credible within the framework of a common asylum and immigration policy with a European statute for refugees. We therefore welcome this prospect and the initial work, which will effectively guarantee rights such as the right to work, to education, health, housing, schooling, vocational training and fundamental rights, all of which are inseparable. The proposal aims to avoid a situation that we know all too well: asylum applicants trying to enter countries illegally, reception centres being inundated and, ultimately, the rights that we want to promote being violated. I think that, in this area, we must make every possible effort. We cannot give scope to those who want Europe to be based primarily on xenophobia, the rejection of all that is foreign and the fear of the unknown. In this area, it is the European project itself that we must defend.</p>

They want refugee status. The individual Member States have the most diverse procedures, which, as a rule, take a very long time. We are faced with multiple applications and the associated misuse of social security benefits as well. At the end of the day, 90% of these applications are rejected, and only 10% of the applicants are actually recognised as refugees in accordance with the Geneva Convention. This means that we need European minimum standards for reception procedures, which need to be speedy and safe in order that the 10% recognised as refugees may exercise their rights and get the help they need. We need measures to combat misuse.</p>
<p class="contents">What we do not want is for the right of asylum to be eroded, nor do we want covert immigration by way of asylum. We therefore support proposals by the Commission and above all by our rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar, which take these objectives into consideration, but decisively reject all the unacceptable and bankrupt proposals by the Liberals, the Social Democrats and the Greens. We reject the idea of extending the grounds for recognition far beyond the scope of the Geneva Convention. We reject the idea of immediate access to the labour market for applicants for asylum and all their accompanying family members, which goes hand in hand with total freedom of movement right across the European Union. We reject the proposal for immediate access to vocational training, and, above all, we repudiate their desire to do away with sanctions when the Member States' security is threatened, when applicants for asylum ‘go underground’, claim social security benefits to which they are not entitled or indulge in violent behaviour.</p>
<p class="contents">With these demands of yours, ladies and gentlemen on the Left, you will not help refugees to exercise their rights and get help without delay, but rather, you will be inviting immigration without it being managed or controlled and by way of asylum, which is unacceptable. In Europe, governments of that sort generally get voted out of office. That would not be such a bad thing, but what is, is that very often populist extremists from the Right are then voted in. That we do not want! That is not the policy that we support. We reject what your side is coming up with. We do not want more Le Pens in Europe.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Swiebel (PSE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, as we all know, this Commission proposal concerning the asylum policy forms part of a whole package of proposals. The approach which the Commission has adopted across the board is largely balanced and realistic. My group therefore expresses the hope that the Council and Parliament will summon up the political courage to follow the tenor of this initiative. We should not be thrown off balance by cheap gossip spread by demagogues who seek to make political capital out of the fear of foreigners.</p>
<p class="contents">A European fortress, a large fence around Europe and, in practice, preventing people from seeking asylum are not only undesirable but also unrealistic. Human rights violations and other disasters, together with the unfair distribution of prosperity across the globe are the actual backdrops to the asylum and migration issues, and they are not eliminated by such measures.</p>
<p class="contents">A minimalist asylum policy is a form of social dumping. Instead, we should translate the principles of solidarity, equal opportunities, naturalisation and integration into a practical policy. This is why my group calls for particular attention to be paid to the following four points which would improve the substance of the proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the provisions should not be confined to persons who apply for asylum on the basis of the Refugee Convention. As has been mentioned here before, a proposal has been submitted in Parliament too concerning the recognition and status of refugees and of persons who require protection in other ways. It would therefore make little sense, to say the least, if a restriction were imposed on this proposal. Maybe we should revisit the underlying logic, but this is impossible, of course. Social protection is therefore included.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns education. It is great for children who have been snatched from their familiar surroundings to find respite and a fixed daily routine quickly, and education can help in this. At the same time, they also learn the language and settle in. This is why the PSE wholeheartedly supports the amendments which provide for prompt access to schools and for the observance of the compulsory education requirement.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, it is important for asylum seekers to be able to enter the labour market as quickly as possible. This enhances their own sense of self-worth and independence and provides them with a useful way of spending their days. It also helps them settle in quickly, and we therefore back the proposals as they are now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, I should like to draw attention to the anti-discrimination proposals, especially Article 29. This is of major importance. Day-to-day practice shows that a good relationship between the local communities and the reception centres is important for the purpose of eliminating racism and xenophobia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to point out that it is important for the Netherlands too that the reception facilities are not taken away from those who refer to Dublin, and I hope that this Council proposal will also convince the Dutch Government of this.</p>
<p class="contents">All that remains for me to do is to thank Mr Hernández Mollar for his commitment and willingness to enter into consultation, and I regret that we were unable to reach agreement. We may get another chance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europe has seen it before, but all too often reacted too late.</p>
<p class="contents">What has happened in quite a few of our Member States should give us established politicians pause for thought. What responsibility do we bear for the fact that xenophobic parties are growing in strength in country after country?</p>
<p class="contents">This has a very great deal of bearing upon Mr Hernández Mollar’s report. The EU, which places a high value upon fundamental human rights, must also be able to conduct a refugee and asylum policy based on precisely the same principles. Lanzarote is not the only example. There are many more.</p>
<p class="contents">The refugee policy conducted at present by the Member States is inhumane. The latter are tightening up policy in a vain belief that this should ease the problems, make integration a smoother process and lead to fewer people reaching our borders.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that the Commission’s proposal on minimum standards for the reception of refugees is very significant. I am also pleased that it was possible for the committee to accept a number of improvements from the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, such as better access to education and work and a situation in which greater account is taken of the conditions under which children and families live. Of particular importance is the committee’s proposing that the scope of the directive be extended beyond the requirements of the Geneva Convention. That does not, however, mean, as Mr Pirker maintains, that we are undermining the right of asylum. Precisely the opposite is the case.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to thank Mr Hernández for his constructive cooperation. I had hoped that he might have been able to support the report in its entirety today. In conclusion, I want to emphasise that it is especially important for us to show today that we are not following the Member States’ stricter line. If we obtain broad agreement today, the message to Le Pen and his kind is clear: you will never be victorious. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The first is to lay down rules that are clear, fair and which protect those who are fighting for freedom and all those who are fleeing from dictatorships, persecution or poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is to equate asylum applicants with illegal immigrants, thus turning these people into scapegoats. It is very rare for a Member of Parliament to oppose a positive <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>, as it was affirmed at Tampere that there was a need for common rules in the area of asylum procedures. I am also surprised that, despite the adoption, in 2001, of an initial resolution which aimed to provide asylum applicants with a decent standard of living and to enforce respect for human rights, our rapporteur has attempted to restrict these rights, which flies in the very face of fundamental rights which are also an <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has condemned laws passed by the Danish and Italian Governments that call into question the right to live as a family by limiting family reunification, the right to love the person of one’s choice by attacking mixed marriages and that even seek to limit the number of asylum applicants. Furthermore, France – my own country, as it happens – which has traditionally defended human rights, has just voted a Jean-Marie Le Pen through to the second round of the presidential elections, a politician who has used the subject of immigrants and asylum applicants for his own gains. It is irresponsible to throw ourselves headlong into this matter and refuse to resolve the real problems by making third-country nationals carry the can. No, Mr Hernández Mollar, Europe’s problem is that of unemployment and exclusion, not that of third-country nationals and asylum applicants. But I can in no way accuse you of xenophobia, as last year, we worked together in El Ejido on a fact-finding mission, precisely in order to protect those who have been victims of xenophobic aggression. But how can you, at the same time, fail to mention to the House that those who exploit these victims are, in fact, those who make them work; those who exploit them are, in fact, the bosses who employ them to moonlight; those who exploit them are, in fact, the very landlords that provide their slum housing.</p>
<p class="contents">So, we must have the courage to lay the blame on those who exploit them and we must stop blaming the immigrants by turning them into scapegoats. Today, we must make families more stable and help the men and women who are in dire need of reassurance and support, as their lives are often in danger, even when they live in exile. We must have the courage, therefore, to blame the traffickers in human beings, those who exploit them, and not the immigrants themselves. Lastly, we have a duty to create a genuine policy for cooperation and dialogue between the north and south, because as long as there is poverty and one-party rule in the south, it is to be expected that these people, as we ourselves have done in our history, will try to reach areas where they are better…</p>

It may perhaps serve to stimulate the debate if I state the three main lines of thought behind the Danish ‘no’. A few people here in this House, represented by Mr Camre of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, said ‘no’ out of a paranoid fear that EU regulations would mean our little country being swamped by asylum seekers. Other MEPs, represented by Mrs Frahm from the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left said ‘no’ for quite opposite reasons, specifically in order to secure the safety of asylum seekers in the best way possible. What now takes the edge right off the Danish ‘no’ is the unfortunate fact that xenophobia has in the meantime become the policy of the Danish Government. Fortunately, there is, however, a third and democratic ‘no’ which is not dependent on political trends. Sustainable in the long term, this particular ‘no’ is based on the attitude that problems which deeply affect local conditions should be solved in close cooperation with the local communities concerned and not be forced upon us by EU institutions that think they know better. The EU’s coercive centralism and mania for making rules quite simply contributes to creating the poisoned breeding ground for demagogues such as Mr Le Pen, Mr Haider and Mr Camre. Not that I fail to appreciate the social and economic conditions underlying this shift to the right and this xenophobia, but be in no doubt that the centralised imposition of rules – in which no account is taken of the attitude of the local community – is downright fatal and fosters right-wing extremism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those who wish to extend it – and I refer to those who voted through a large number of amendments to the text proposed by the Commission in the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs – are certainly not doing any kind of service to the principle of the right to asylum by extending it indiscriminately to people who, in actual fact, are not really entitled to it. I refer, in particular, to Amendment No 14, which seeks to eliminate provision for specific penalties, namely the reducing or withdrawing of reception conditions in the event of an observed infringement of the reception system, and also to a set of amendments – Nos 19, 21, 22, 23 and 34 – seeking to extend the scope of the directives to people requesting protection for reasons other than those listed in the Geneva Convention.

What we are also trying to do in this field is to pursue the objective of an area of freedom, security and<span class="italic"> </span>justice which is open to people who, for various reasons, are legitimately seeking protection in the Community. The Tampere conclusions stipulate that a European system of asylum must be established and must include, in the short term, minimum common standards for the reception for asylum applicants. These conditions must provide a dignified standard of living and must respect the individual’s fundamental rights. The intention is to limit the secondary movements of asylum applicants that are prompted by the differences between the reception conditions provided by the various Member States, thereby ensuring that asylum applicants enjoy a comparable standard of living in all the Member States and that there is a fair spread of efforts between the Member States of the Union. I acknowledge that integration into local communities is a complex and difficult matter but this is the approach we must pursue, with its consequences in terms of the right to health, education and employment. With regard to the issue of access to the labour market, freedom of access must be allowed, although it is reasonable for this to be made conditional for a period of six months.</p>
<p class="contents">Our rapporteur, Mr Hernández Mollar is right to suggest that we must address this issue seriously and without resorting to populist rhetoric. An excessively charitable attitude in these matters only helps those who base their arguments on intolerance, racism and xenophobia. This is why it is right, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to send a message to the benches on the left of Parliament: those who go too far in the field of asylum, as in other areas, become the greatest ally of the forms of extremism they claim to want to combat, for they ultimately stimulate it.</p>

The miracle he called for will probably not take place, but that will not be because he has not tried to reach an agreement; he also knows that on some issues I personally was prepared to do so. Above all because, on these issues, nobody listens to this Parliament. Madam President, take a look at the Council’s benches: there is nobody there; take a look at the Commission’s benches: I am delighted to share this sitting with Mr Fischler, but I believe that agriculture and fisheries are not exactly what we are talking about.

The rapporteur is right: this is no longer his report. Proof of this is the fact that it was adopted in committee by 25 votes to 18, but above all the fact that a good 111 amendments were made to it. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats voted for the motion against its will, and it declared its opposition to all these amendments. I therefore urge the rapporteur genuinely to pursue his original position and to treat the report as no longer his own, no longer the work of our group.</p>
<p class="contents">Moreover, just a few days ago, at Valencia, the Council addressed the issue of immigration, discussing matters belonging to the second pillar within the framework of the major field of action – the third pillar – of justice and home affairs. It was pointed out that, after the Montpellier talks in May 2000, a programme should be launched – and the Commission has already put forward a proposal – financed by MEDA, a programme of practical actions in the field of immigration. This means that the Council is still at the analysis and assessment stage. Proof of this is the fact that, at the suggestion of Italy and Spain – the two countries which are certainly most affected by this issue – it was proposed to hold a ministerial conference on migration next year. Well then, while the Council is continuing to pursue a careful and cautious approach, we now want to include measures in a European Parliament report which are so advanced that they consider extending healthcare to all asylum applicants and providing for access to the labour market within four months of lodging an application and admission to school for asylum applicants’ children, under conditions, what is more – and the rapporteur also pointed this out – which are more favourable than those applying to the children of residents.</p>
<p class="contents">Well then, none of this is acceptable, especially not to the countries that are in the eye of the storm as regards asylum applications. The constant attempts to overload a report with too many problems make it unacceptable when all is said and done. I do not feel that this is the way to help those who are entitled to and need asylum.</p>

Let me say at the outset that I support Mr Pirker's viewpoint, to which I refer in order to avoid repetition. The report raises a number of issues which, as I see it, have not been resolved. How will an equal distribution of applicants for asylum in the EU be achieved if standards vary because Member States are obliged to retain higher standards? How is unrestricted freedom of movement for third-country nationals while their application for asylum is in progress to be reconciled with the public's need for security and with concerns that the procedure should be speeded up? How do we explain to our citizens a regulation that ensures applicants for asylum access to the labour market as soon as possible, whilst they themselves may be unemployed?</p>
<p class="contents">If the way the EU worked were as transparent as we would all like it to be, one would end up wondering how our citizens would vote in response to proposals of this sort. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Luxembourg today, the Council has been able to conclude an understanding by taking into account the amendments approved by Parliament. The result in Council will, though, remain in some ways unsatisfactory from the Commission's point of view. The text before the Council contains provisions that have watered down some areas of the regulation we were working towards. I must say, despite this adverse comment, that we still see the adoption of this proposal as a milestone on the road that leads to a common European immigration policy.</p>
<p class="contents">The sole directive covering this area affords only temporary protection. It is applicable only in exceptional cases involving a mass influx of expelled persons into the territory of the European Union. The directive on the reception of applicants for asylum will be the first binding regulation governing the uniform handling of influxes of asylum-seekers in the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to make some comments on the report and on the amendments to the proposed directive that are under discussion today. The amendments may be divided up into three principal categories. Firstly, there are technical amendments which improve the text and which the Commission can therefore accept as a matter of course.</p>
<p class="contents">There are, secondly, substantive amendments that make perfect sense and will form part of the final version of the directive that will be adopted. These are amendments deleting every reference to asylum procedures, and also amendments aimed against reception conditions that differentiate in accordance with the asylum procedures applicable in each case.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, there are substantive amendments that present the Commission with no difficulties but will not get past the Council because they go against the fundamental interests of one or more Member States. Examples of these are amendments deleting every reference to the possibility of Member States making use of a system of vouchers, and, only partially in this category, amendments extending the scope of the directive to other forms of protection not founded on the Geneva Convention on Refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has constantly advocated a solution such as that put forward in these amendments, at least as a target for the second stage of the common European asylum system, but, with reference to this proposal, it had expressed itself in favour of leaving it, at least for the present, to the Member States to decide on the extension of the directive's scope. The Council still has an open mind on how to ensure that the relevant provisions of this directive are adapted following the enactment of the directives on subsidiary forms of protection and asylum procedures.</p>
<p class="contents">I said at the outset that the Commission regards the adoption of the proposal as a milestone on the road that leads to a common European asylum system. Quite apart from that, though, it is of extreme importance that the other three cornerstones of the common asylum system be added without delay, these being the directive on the recognition of refugee status and on subsidiary forms of protection, the Regulation on the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application and the amended version of the directive on asylum procedures. These three will shortly be resubmitted by the Commission and are intended – as the Tampere conclusions envisaged – to complete the first stage in the development of the common European asylum system.</p>
<p class="contents">In several Member States the prospect of immigrants and asylum-seekers flooding in is already giving rise to public expressions of fear. Extremist political movements find a ready audience for their calls for these people to be turned away without further ado, and this makes it high time that we agree on a unitary European regulation to properly manage the flow of immigrants and asylum-seekers. This is, in my opinion, the best way of overcoming these fears and at the same time fully discharging our international obligations in respect of human rights and doing justice to the humanitarian tradition of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in conclusion, also express on behalf of the Commission, our great sadness at the accident that was reported earlier.</p>

This is not an isolated case: in relation to all the issues we are discussing, which are fundamental and very sensitive, relating to justice and internal affairs, in accordance with the procedures adopted in Amsterdam - in other words, we are still within the five-year-period during which Parliament only plays a consultative role – in addition to having little capacity for intervention, the little power we do have is constantly being undermined by attitudes of dubious interinstitutional loyalty on the part of the Council.</p>
