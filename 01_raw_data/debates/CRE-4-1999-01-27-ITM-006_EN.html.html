<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Azzolini </span> <span class="bold">(PPE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (IT) </span> Madam President, Commissioner, I am delighted that ‘my' Commissioner, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, is in the Chamber, especially as I am sure she will understand and listen very carefully to what I have to say.</p>
<p class="contents">I do have to thank my Committee – the Committee on Regional Policy – for entrusting me with this report on regional policy and competition policy just two years on from 1997. My 1997 report was entitled ‘Cohesion policy and culture, a contribution to employment'. These are two very important subjects which definitely add value to other European issues that knowledgable colleagues have discussed in detail here in the Chamber.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies is naturally very well aware of how difficult some Member States find it to transpose directives, legislation and regulations, and it is hardly news to most people involved in the work that, altogether, only five of the fifteen Member States of the Union have had a systematic approach to Community legislation for any length of time. This means that, at bottom, there is no culture of methodology. As Commissioner Wulf‐Mathies has frequently told us in committee, communication is needed, a great deal of communication. But I would say that simplification is also needed because some Member States, obviously out of lack of understanding, are continuing to swim against the tide, and perhaps do not have the determination to act.</p>
<p class="contents">Being an Italian rapporteur, I do not want to confine this criticism to my own country, but it is regrettable that some Member States which could be taking advantage of the benefits of belonging to the Union are, in actual fact, often using no more than about 52 % – when everything is going well, and in my opinion things are not going well – which shows that there is still a gap between the ‘Union' as a body and the ‘Member States' as a periphery. So I do ask everyone to think about this as a real issue. It should not be marginal if it is true – and it is true – that the top priority of the Union is its economic and social – I stress that word – cohesion policy.</p>
<p class="contents">That being so, I must also concur that the rules of competition should represent a guarantee of the correct and transparent operation of the internal market and that exceptions to free competition, claimed by some Member States, are in fact only justified by the need to maintain and strengthen that economic and social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the Commission's statement on the multisectoral framework for regional aid for large investment projects, proposing to limit this type of aid to those projects requiring major inputs of capital which, without seriously distorting competition, have an undeniable impact at regional level, as a genuine source of direct and indirect employment.</p>
<p class="contents">What I would urge, however, is that it should be possible in future – in the near future, Commissioner, not the distant future – to extend this procedure, currently at the experimental stage, to all sensitive sectors still governed by specific rules on control over state aid. I am thinking of sectors like shipbuilding, the motor industry, iron and steel and textiles, all areas in serious crisis and needing to achieve social and economic cohesion even earlier than the rest. But I have to say that certain provisions, like those on the maximum intensity of aid to Objective 1 and 2 regions, seem too strict. Equally, the rules on competition must be applied in way which takes account of the need to strengthen cohesion, precisely to prevent the proliferation of certain substitute fiscal measures which are bound to damage the internal market but which, because of the lack of methodology I mentioned earlier, many Member States end up adopting.</p>
<p class="contents">I have received 25 amendments to this report and I am grateful to the Members who tabled them. I am definitely in favour of some of them, but not of others, because I want to signal very clearly to the Commission that I entirely agree that the content of this communication must not be distorted by ‘interference' of a different kind, which has been discussed elsewhere.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to assure those colleagues that no discourtesy towards them is intended. I am simply determined to keep to what is strictly necessary for a report assessing a communication from the Commission and calling with equal seriousness and rigour for the Commission to adopt our proposals. After the period of great tension between the Commission and Parliament at the last part‐session in Strasbourg, we are now asking that same Commission to pay greater attention to social cohesion, after having clearly made a good start with economic cohesion. So I hope the Commission will not only continue its work with determination but will also take proper account of Parliament"s recommendations.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Riis‐Jørgensen </span> <span class="bold">(ELDR), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. – (DA)</span> Madam President, I am privileged to have been appointed rapporteur for the report on competition policy for the second time during my career in Parliament. I should like to begin by praising the Commission for the excellent work it has done in the area of competition policy. I have very much enjoyed working together with the Commissioner, and I think there has been superb cooperation between the Commissioner and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. In my speech, I would like to concentrate on the five proposals for improvements I have identified in my report, and I look forward to hearing the Commissioner's comments on them.</p>
<p class="contents">The first concerns the democratic control of competition policy. In my first report, we proposed a specific procedure whereby the Commissioner comes to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs every quarter to give an account of policy in the competition sector. We have been very pleased with that and it has worked very satisfactorily. The committee now wishes to create a permanent and more standardised procedure. This procedure makes the same demands, but represents a more formal arrangement between the committee, Parliament and the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns small and medium‐sized enterprises, which are very important when we are discussing competition policy. The committee regards it as important to ensure that SMEs are able to evaluate their legal position and can find out for themselves which side of the competition rules they are on – or in other words, whether or not they are in breach of the rules on competition. I am myself a lawyer by profession, but I have no objection to SMEs being able to avoid paying too much money to lawyers to help them find out whether they are in breach of EU rules. I am therefore calling on the Commission to put forward proposals or guidelines on how to use the so‐called de minimis notice. This is discussed in paragraph 10.</p>
<p class="contents">The third point also concerns SMEs and is dealt with in paragraph 15 of my report. Again, it is a question of how SMEs can ensure that they comply with the EU's rules. Here too, I should like the Commission to publish guidelines and criteria on what the relevant market is and how it is defined. Those are the two points concerning SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the question of state aid. I know the Commissioner agrees with the committee that there is far too much state aid in Europe, but what can we do about it? We should always remember that it is the Member States who distribute the money. So it is not the EU which distributes the money, but the Member States who are the villains of the piece. I think it is important for Parliament to ally itself with the Commission in the campaign against state aid. The committee's proposal is that we should make things more transparent, so that third parties are able to see the extent of state aid. I propose that we set up a register in which the level of state aid is published and that this register should be put on the Commission's website, so that everyone can easily go and find out the level and purpose of the aid, including state aid given under block exemptions, so that all state aid, regardless of whether it is referred to the Commission or simply takes place in the Member States, is publicly accessible. It is important for individual companies, both small and large, to be able to find out whether they are being exposed to unfair competition. Internet access will help, because in that way the company concerned will be able to check the level of state aid for itself. It will also have, or so I hope, the opportunity to complain to the Commission in a simple way via the Internet.</p>
<p class="contents">I have one more proposal concerning state aid. This has been inspired by the Commissioner responsible for the single market, Mr Monti, who has set up a ‘scoreboard' showing the good guys and the bad guys of the single market. We could do the same thing, in other words set up a list of the good boys and the bad boys – or girls – in terms of state aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Those are my proposals for improving competition and some instruments for increasing transparency and improving legal certainty for SMEs. I hope very much that the Commissioner will enter into a dialogue with us on the subject of these proposals. Once again, I would like to express my thanks to Mr Van Miert for the sincerity and enthusiasm with which he takes care of Europe's interests in these matters. And in passing, I should also like to thank him for his excellent work in bringing to an end the tubing cartel in Denmark and Europe and thus creating price freedom and low prices for consumers, because ultimately that is the most important target group for competition policy. The important thing is that consumers get lower prices and more quality for their money.</p>

From a legal point of view it is also becoming more efficient and its administration has improved. This is most certainly due to greater decentralisation of the implementation of certain regulations on competition to the relevant national authorities, and to the reduction in unnecessary notifications. If we continue along these lines efficiency and transparency should improve still further. Decentralisation has, however, come up against a serious obstacle: some Member States lack the legislation needed to implement Community legislation. In other cases, national case‐law does not allow Community legislation to be directly implemented.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to these legal difficulties, other problems have arisen concerning state aid. Legal protection can be reduced, depending on whether national law or Community law is applied. Thus, Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty allow enterprises and individuals to enjoy greater legal protection and therefore greater rights of appeal under national legislation than they would under Articles 92 and 94 of the Treaty. No ruling has been given on which law should take precedence in such cases. The issue has not been resolved, and disputes continue.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to point out that the procedure adopted for the supervision of state aid for regional development purposes ought to be subject to the demands of economic and social cohesion. Further, the method of determining resources must take account of the legal concept of ultraperipherality.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCarthy </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, the Azzolini report on the communication from the Commission to Member States on regional policy and competition policy comes at a very pertinent time, only months before Member States are expected to deliver their list of state aid areas to DG IV and at a time when big decisions are to be taken by Member States on the future maps of structural funds for both Objective 1 and Objective 2. Let us hope that this will be at the Berlin summit in March.</p>
<p class="contents">In this debate I will restrict my comments to the issue of coherence and the linkage between regional policy and competition policy. We know that concentration is the name of the game now in both the Community competition policy and indeed in structural fund assistance. Of course, in the Commission communication consistency is a stated objective. We support those principles, we support coherence and consistency. We perhaps differ on the point of how we deliver that coherence and how we actually ensure some flexibility around the issues. I must say that it is somewhat disappointing that some of the amendments to this report are seeking to look for exemptions for areas under Article 92(3)(a) in my view seeking to secure Objective 1 status by the back door. My group will not be voting for those particular amendments. Parliament is asked to take into account the need for this consistency and we are in favour of ensuring better coherence. This is evident under Article 92(3)(a), Objective 1 areas, and the principle is very strongly adhered to in this area. Nonetheless, there is a need for the Commission to acknowledge in its proposals, as is the case in the communication, and I quote ‘that Member States must have a margin of manoeuvre to pursue regional policy goals specific to their situations in addition to areas designated jointly for purposes of Community and regional policy. The Commission is aware that Member States deploy diverse goals and objectives for national and regional aid policy. We need to respect this diversity and we need to find a balance between diversity and achieving coherence."</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, the context of concentration and consistency, referring to Article 92(3)(c) areas, is somewhat restrictive and let me say why that is so. The timetable in which Member States will produce their maps to DG IV predetermines potentially Objective 2 areas on the future structural fund map. I will give you a very good example of that: in the 1994 to 1999 reforms the then Conservative government submitted a map to DG IV in the hope that those areas would then automatically be Objective 2 areas. I am glad to say, the Labour commissioner, Bruce Millan, spotted this and was very clear about the fact that these areas could not possibly qualify for European Objective 2 under economic social cohesion need areas. This is why we need to have that flexibility and we do not believe they should be, in fact, in the same map, even with the measure of flexibility that the Commission has proposed. In some ways this Commission communication has been overtaken by events and I am delighted to see that in the General Affairs Council this week there has been a victory for common sense.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is important that we have had this debate. I believe Member States must address themselves to the fact that there must be better coherence but we need the flexibility to ensure that we are getting the right areas for state aid and Objective 2. In that sense, the time of change, the time for concentration has come but the Commission must not complicate or impose additional constraints forcing integration of these areas through prescriptive mechanisms. It is wise for the Commission to have chosen the route of allowing some margin of manoeuvre and thereby trying to encourage Member States in their efforts to make these maps more consistent.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Hatzidakis </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – <span class="italic">(EL)</span> Madam President, as a member of the Committee on Regional Policy I will speak on the report by Mr Azzolini, whom I would sincerely like to congratulate on his work, which was exceptionally difficult because there were conflicting interests and – I think I need not explain – the issue of ‘national aid" speaks for itself.</p>
<p class="contents">I also wish to congratulate the Commission on its generally courageous attitude towards this issue. The aid provided by Member States to their various regions can indeed constitute a distortion of competition and consequently impede the normal and effective operation of the internal market. That is why the basic principle must be that when national aid is permitted, over and above the areas covered by the activities of the Structural Funds, such cases should be exceptional and should only be permitted in special cases when justified by the need to achieve economic and social cohesion. In that sense, there is indeed a need for closer links and correspondence between the competition policy and the European Union's regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, I agree with the Commission's intention to reduce the eligible areas, so far as Community aid is concerned, from the present 51 % down to 35 % – 40 % of the population, a reduction completely in line with the corresponding reduction of eligible population which will be entitled to structural aid in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">I also agree that the criteria for state aid should correspond to those for Community aid. However, I must express my concern and opposition to the restriction of the extent of the permitted national aid for Objective 1 areas to only 50 % of the cofinancing for those areas which are below 60 % of the Community average in terms of GNP, and to 40 % for areas above 60 % of the Community average.</p>
<p class="contents">We also ought not to forget that even if 66 % of national aid in total goes to the less developed areas, the considerable economic resources of some wealthy Member States enable them to subsidise areas which, even though they may be less well developed at the national level, are not among the most disadvantaged in the European Union. That, of course, goes against both the principles of competition and the need to achieve economic and social cohesion, because it means that already wealthy regions grow still wealthier, so widening the gap compared to the European Union's less developed areas.</p>

In the context of competition policy a ban on state aid should guarantee the operation of the free market, and it is therefore necessary to regulate state aid and also regional aid in those Member States whose regions are empowered to grant it. When identifying areas where such aid can be authorised – as provided for in Article 92(3)(a) and (c) of the Treaty – care must be taken to ensure compatibility with state aid to Objective 1 and Objective 2 regions.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now turn to the Objective 2 regions known as ‘areas undergoing restructuring". State aid should be targeted at such areas: areas in the process of rural restructuring, with a low density of population, with population loss, and with an aging population. State aid to such regions should certainly be authorised.</p>
<p class="contents">Other areas undergoing restructuring are experiencing an industrial crisis of some sort, with high and rising levels of unemployment.</p>
<p class="contents">In the areas where it is granted, state aid is important in order to supplement and guarantee better economic and social cohesion and also territorial cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I should like to support what Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen said concerning the need for transparency in connection with aid of this nature. I believe such aid should remain available, but the process of awarding it ought to be as transparent as possible. It should also be made clear that in no way will this aid prejudice the freedom of trade and the single market which must prevail within the European Union.</p>

As proposed by the Commission, this involves accepting the increasing and almost inevitable overlap between maps of Objective 1 and 2 regions and the map of regions which may be granted public aid. This perspective does not seem quite right as, in our opinion, public aid must be granted whenever the social sustainability of certain sectors is at risk, particularly because of employment reasons, and also for many different reasons where problems of economic and social cohesion are involved, regardless of the location of the territory where these are occurring. It is obvious that control and monitoring systems will be acceptable and necessary in order to prevent abuses and instances of unfair competition. However, these systems must not be confused with or turned into a comprehensive and universal obstacle to the granting of public aid where such abuses and instances of unfair competition are identified.</p>
<p class="contents">In our opinion, Mr Azzolini"s report, on which I congratulate him, does not tackle this question with sufficient clarity or depth. However, it does deal adequately with the need to make the decision‐making on specific regional situations more flexible. If approved, the amendments, which deserve our support, should extend and increase the degree and scope of this flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">The Azzolini report also emphasises the priority given to the most disadvantaged regions, for obvious reasons of economic and social cohesion, the inclusion in the framework of possibilities of public aid for areas which will fall within the ‘phasing‐out" of the next Community Support Framework and the rejection of the Commission proposal to significantly reduce the state aid to be granted to the regions and sectors which need it and which will become eligible for it.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the plus side, we should note the reference made to the need to monitor and control the public aid granted to transnational undertakings in order to prevent them from relocating and to prevent them from taking advantage of public aid without developing long‐term economic activities in the region.</p>

Competition policy is based on the principle of banning state aid to businesses, with derogations from Article 92(3)(a) and (c) that are restrictively applied in the free competition environment of the single market. As for regional policy, it is based on the principle of providing aid for regional development by redistributing the Community budget, and it provides financial support for projects involving all the socio‐economic actors in a particular region, including businesses, albeit in a minority capacity.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want greater coherence we must draw a distinction between the two zoning systems when the diagnosis for certain regions indicates that it would be to their advantage. The Member States must still be free to define their own business development policies, as if these were to be brought exactly into line with regional policy it would remove the specific benefits of the zoning of regional aid and the regional planning problems.</p>
<p class="contents">Deciding on the level of coherence should be left to the Member States which, in any case, are responsible for submitting proposals for negotiation with the Commission. The Commission must also realise that there is a risk it could harm many still fragile regions with its proposals for drastically restricting the intensity and duration of aid granted under Article 92(3). This is particularly true, as has just been said, of regions which will undergo a ‘phasing out" period.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, as regards the list of regions assisted under Article 92(3), I should like to ask the Commission to reconsider the possibility of including the regions that the Amsterdam Treaty has acknowledged as having permanent handicaps, namely island regions, including those that are not eligible for Objective 1 status.</p>

I would add that transparency must also be a basic guiding principle. Accordingly the Commission has presented a proposal for implementing these principles and establishing broad coherence between the Structural Fund aid and national aid. That is consistent and it is a sensible solution. I hope the Member States also decide to follow that line consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">What it so significant is that this is the only way to restrict competition about standards and the abuse of aid. But we will also find that the different authorisation times in the different Member States will make it very easy to circumvent this. So I ask the Commission to tell us how it proposes to organise the authorisation timing so as to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that the Commission proposal does not deal with one particular problem, namely subsidy shopping. National undertakings can still go on taking up aid unchecked and thereby damage regions. So in that respect there are a few things missing in the proposal. How are you going to resolve this question?</p>

The arguments put forward for this are the ever widening divergences between policies and the overlaps in the various aid maps. But those who support this approach are forgetting that the desired equal cover of national and EU aid areas makes it even more difficult for the Member States and regions to support their own problem areas by using their own resources. That reinforces this policy of positive discrimination in favour of the most disadvantaged regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In any case the objectives of Agenda 2000, namely greater concentration and coherence, already involve a serious cutback in aid to the relatively successful regions. It would be not just absurd but in fact inconsistent with the very principle of subsidiarity to also deprive them de facto of the instrument of national aid.</p>

The public tend to perceive competition policy as essentially an economic issue. They think of it as the system of ground rules governing the relationship between businesses in a market economy. That is indeed what it is. Yet they sometimes overlook the implications these arrangements can have for their daily lives as consumers and workers. In particular, they fail to appreciate the impact of these arrangements on their lives as ordinary citizens. For instance, monitoring concentration of ownership and dominant positions will become increasingly important in view of globalisation and the development of new technologies. This is particularly true in the energy and telecommunications sectors, the information society and the audio‐visual industry. As far as these are concerned, not only is concentration taking place, but enterprises are becoming increasingly interrelated both amongst themselves and with the financial groups which control decision‐making bodies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why public statements such as those made by the Commission Director‐General responsible for energy are so alarming and a cause of such concern to all democrats. I should like to take this opportunity of countering the Director‐General"s remarks. They stem from a reprehensible philosophy of secrecy and confidentiality – in the worst sense of the word – which would confine debate on matters directly affecting consumers and citizens to the European Commission"s offices. Such matters ought of course to be debated instead in the marketplace and with as much exhibitionism as possible. I quote from Mr Benavides" derogatory description of the parliamentary debate taking place in my country.</p>
<p class="contents">It is far easier for the economic and strategic power groups we sometimes euphemistically term lobbies to penetrate the Commission"s offices than it is for the ordinary consumer or for the ordinary citizen to do so. It pains me to say this, as the Director‐General responsible for energy is a Spanish official, but it appears that where the so‐called ‘transitional costs" relating to competition in the Spanish electricity sector are concerned, he has departed utterly and absolutely from the principles of neutrality and objectivity. As the relevant political authority, the Energy Commissioner should immediately relieve him of responsibility for this matter, as this is the second time Mr Benavides has allowed himself to be swayed by external pressure and because considerable misgivings have been expressed in Spain as to his objectivity and impartiality in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not expect the Commissioner responsible for competition policy to comment at the moment. I am confident that a thorough and objective study of the legality of this aid will be undertaken, bearing in mind the needs of consumers and small enterprises. They should, in theory, be the ultimate beneficiaries of the free market and of liberalisation, yet in this instance, they have come out unanimously against this aid – aid which I consider to be illegal. They will be forced to pay for it through their electricity bills, like a modern generation of feudal serfs. Not only will they have to pay for the losses the liberalised companies will allegedly incur over the next ten to fifteen years in a situation of free competition, but this will be covered by a legal argument alleging that the electricity companies have an acquired right to be indemnified or compensated.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe this would mean setting a serious legal precedent in the liberalised sectors, which has in fact already been invoked by Telefónica, the company which until recently held the monopoly over the telephone service in Spain.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, it is consumers and citizens who are the touchstone where liberalisation is concerned. If the European Union cannot guarantee that they will not be crucified by the processes of liberalisation, the European institutions, including our own, will become ever more distant from the citizens.</p>

First, let me unreservedly agree with what is stated so clearly for the first time in paragraphs 17 to 20 of Mr Azzolini"s excellent report: tourism is a good thing! For many parts of Europe tourism is the key to survival. But subsidised tourism is a bad thing, it is unacceptable, because it does not produce sustained structural improvement but simply throws away and wastes huge amounts of European money. When an undertaking that receives a large amount of aid relocates to the next place, it generally leaves far more damage than useful things behind it. So let us put an end to this nonsense as quickly as possible! Let the Commission apply its collective wisdom to finding good solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the second aspect I want to address. We also need good solutions to Agenda 2000 as a whole and to structural reform in particular. We need these good solutions quickly. We have barely two months left under the German Presidency"s new timetable and we have to put this time to good use. The Commission and the European Parliament have done good work together in the past months. Now the Council has to show that it can reach consensus. It will certainly not be easy to accommodate fifteen different opinions on this difficult subject. The Council must now show that it is prepared to cooperate with the Commission, but also and in particular with Parliament, which has been playing a very responsible part in this process so far and sought to find common, rational and objective solutions, but which must now also attach great importance to being included in the final decisions.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Gallagher </span> <span class="bold">(UPE).</span> – Mr President, at the outset I want to congratulate both rapporteurs on the presentation and, of course, the preparation of their reports. I, of course, agree that the internal market for the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital should operate in an even‐handed manner. For an internal market to succeed, all regions within Europe must be able to economically compete effectively in such an arena.</p>
<p class="contents">At present there are some regions within my country and within Europe lagging behind the European Union average for economic performance. It is only right and proper that the poor, disadvantaged and peripheral parts of Europe, namely Objective 1 regions, continue to be entitled to grant aid to the industries setting up within their region to the maximum of 40 % or indeed higher, if necessary. The Commission has already brought out new revised state aid guidelines which have been approved by the 15 Member States of the Union. These guidelines provide that Objective 1 regions will be entitled to grant aid to endogenous and inward investment companies setting up within their localities to a ceiling of 40 %. Non‐Objective 1 regions within the Union will be entitled to grant aid to industry to a limit of 20 % only while those areas within the Union, which are doing better than the Community average, will only be entitled to grant aid to industry to 10 %.</p>
<p class="contents">This may appear unfair competition but it is necessary to bring the less well off regions up to a Union average. I agree with the state aid guidelines and, of course, favourable state aid policies to Objective 1 regions, including my own constituency of Connaught‐Ulster, will go a long way to ensuring the creation of long term sustainable jobs in the region. It is also important that such policies are complemented by a higher proportion of spending under the ERDF so as to guarantee that any infrastructural deficit which exists in our transport network is rectified in the near future.</p>

As regards the Commission's proposal concerning regional aid, I find it both unacceptable and ridiculous. The reason for this is that the Commission is proposing that only those areas which receive EU aid should be eligible for national regional support. This implies that the Commission does not believe that the Member States are capable of conducting a regional policy which is in the interests of the respective countries and their citizens. Instead, everything is to be centralised and managed through the EU and Brussels. Decentralisation and flexibility are conspicuous by their absence. It is not that I am opposed to a policy on regional aid, it is the way in which national regional aid is to be distributed that I find unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Sweden has a long tradition of regional aid, the purpose of which is to achieve a balance and to iron out differences between the various regions. It was implemented in the interests of social solidarity and was an extremely costly process. However, it was worth the expense and was a sound move, in my view. The Commission's proposal rules out this kind of social and economic solidarity, which is a mistake. Consequently, I believe the rapporteur has tried to remedy the worst deficiencies of the Commission document, and that Mr Macartney has also tabled a good amendment which I shall support and which substantially improves the report.</p>

There is a risk in this Chamber of allowing the European Parliament's priority objective of economic and social cohesion to fade into the background and be compromised. The cost will largely be met, so runs the script, by the new Objective 2 regions and, under the Commission's plan, all the benefits and advantages will be enjoyed by the applicant countries. Objective 2 groups together areas with a very wide range of characteristics and needs, but the restrictions announced will further penalise our disadvantaged areas and have negative and indiscriminate impact on all the areas in the new Objective 2, which covers urban, industrial, rural and mountain areas, or areas dependent on the fisheries sector. The chorus of Members of Parliament asking the Commission to modify its position is swelling daily: I hope the increase in volume will at last convince the Commission.</p>

<p class="contents">A Union with huge differences in economic and social development between its various regions certainly can be neither credible, nor viable, nor competitive. That is why the policy of economic and social cohesion, real economic convergence, a reduction of inequalities between the regions, the concentration of resources upon the Union's poorest areas and solidarity between Europeans are the essential parameters for a development which will be the more effective and competitive the more fairly it is distributed.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a fact that the European regional policy has led to great improvements in the development rate of areas which were characterised by macroeconomic imbalances and low competitiveness, such as Greece. However, there are still important regional inequalities which could become more acute, as a general phenomenon, as a result of economic and monetary union and the Union's enlargement. So the policy of economic and social cohesion is a long‐term and continual process which, in any event, must be compatible with competition policy if it is to be effective.</p>
<p class="contents">However, it is known that several Member States are pursuing national strategies and state subsidy policies which are in many respects incompatible with the European cohesion policy to combat regional inequalities. Indeed, if we include all the horizontal branch and regional forms of aid, it becomes evident that it is the wealthier areas which benefit most, and not the disadvantaged areas.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, I think the Commission's proposals, and in particular the efforts by the Commissioner responsible, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies, to achieve a new, fair and efficient regional aid system are on the right lines, and we support them. However, I have a slight reservation concerning the extent of permitted aid for Objective 1, which could have an adverse effect upon the achievement of economic and social cohesion, as Mr Azzolini very rightly and appropriately pointed out in his excellent report, on which I congratulate him.</p>

Flexible operation of the single market can only be achieved, certainly following the launch of the euro, if competition conditions are fair not only in law but also in fact, and if there really is equality of opportunities for all businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission"s efforts to ensure that there is free competition within the single market are thus vitally important. The Commission does good work here, and the fact that its decisions are not always palatable to those Member States which it is forced to reprimand in no way detracts from the value of that work.</p>
<p class="contents">I must compliment the rapporteur, Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen, on the work she has done. I thank her for her fine and constructive cooperation, and all I can really say is that her report sets out what we in the PPE Group wished to say on the subject. So I have nothing more to add, in point of fact.</p>
<p class="contents">I just have one question for the Commission, a very specific question. Last year, in June 1998, the Court of Justice ruled in a case against Italy"s National Council of Customs Agents that people in the professions are entrepreneurs like anyone else and are subject to Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty. I should like to hear from the Commissioner whether that ruling has implications for all the regulated professions. The PPE Group"s view is that account must be taken of the special role of certain professions in the general interest of society. We should have liked to know the Commission"s thinking on this. I appreciate that I am rather springing this on the Commissioner. I do not necessarily expect an answer here and now, but perhaps a written reply? Forgive me, Commissioner, for not waiting to hear your answer now, but there is a group of 100 people waiting for me 50 kilometres away. Unfortunately, I have to leave the Chamber straight away.</p>

The Commission should make its work more effective, encouraging as great a degree of transparency as possible with regard to all public aid. In my opinion it makes no difference whether it is a matter of state aid or regional aid. We should be creating a situation where every citizen and business would at any moment in time be able to acquire information about how much state aid or regional aid has been granted to which project. There should be a page on the Internet where information could be listed on all public aid in order to ensure transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue I wish to raise is the importance of real commitment on the part of business to regional aid programmes. Thus, if a company receives aid it must remain in the region. It must stay there for at least five years and ensure that jobs are preserved. It cannot just pack its bags the moment it has been given public aid.</p>

The Commission plans to reduce the percentage of the total population of the Union receiving state‐funded regional aid over the period 2000‐2006. Geographic concentration is welcome if it serves to improve the effectiveness of this type of aid and create positive discrimination towards the less favoured regions, especially when 85 % of state regional aid for industrial projects today goes to the four richest Member States and only 8.3 % to the least developed four.</p>
<p class="contents">In these lean years for employment, synergy between national aid and Community aid can open up new paths and inspire new hopes. In particular, national regional aid could be granted to provide an incentive for productive investment, paying particular attention to the creation of jobs directly and indirectly linked to the investment. Investment in jobs must then be maintained in the region concerned for at least five years, so that national aid does not encourage relocations.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, while taking note of the guidelines imposed by the Commission, I am perplexed by certain points which do not seem to me to encourage greater economic and social cohesion, as rightly emphasised in the excellent Azzolini report. I refer to the reduction in the maximum intensity of regional aid especially for the new Objective 2 regions, where the maximum intensity of aid is reduced from 30 % to 20 % or even 10 %, in which case these regions will receive less aid than they did in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to that there is also a problem for the ultraperipheral and island regions which, because of their difficult geographic position and their particular intrinsic nature, are already amongst the least favoured regions in the whole Community. As the elected representatives of the citizens of Europe, it is our duty to voice the needs of the people in the least favoured areas and to remain constantly vigilant to ensure respect for the fundamental principle of economic and social cohesion in the policies of the Union.</p>

I want to particularly praise Paragraph 14, where she is asking the Commission to examine unfair practices and also Paragraph 22 which is recognising the need for increased consistency between national aid schemes, Union aid schemes and competition policy. I want particularly to support the amendments from my colleagues Mr Hendrick and Mme García Arias which talk about the possible abuses of dominant positions.</p>
<p class="contents">All over the European Union we are seeing a merging of the ownership of the old, publicly owned utilities: telecommunications with broadcasting, electricity with telecommunications, railway links used as telecommunication networks, gas companies investing in water and over all banks taking a major share in these utilities. This is not, in itself, an unwelcome development but it does exacerbate the risk of an over‐concentration of ownership of the essential utilities. The whole point of the liberalisation process is that it should bring the benefits of efficient, competitive, consumer‐sensitive utility supplies to be widely available to consumers, both domestic and business.</p>
<p class="contents">The reported situation in Spain, therefore, is of major concern. It would be against the whole spirit and letter of European Union competition rules if the costs of the transition to competition in electricity supply were to be met initially out of public funds and this then to be passed on to the consumer. This is a most serious distortion of the level playing field, particularly if the money is then to be used to gain a share in other utility markets. I hope that the Commission will deal with this point in response because it is particularly important that the issue is highlighted and that the Commission response is on public record. The rapporteur in this report mentioned naming and shaming and on the basis of the evidence available, this is a situation of sufficient seriousness to merit a considered reply from the Commission. I am sure that this will be forthcoming. I have apologised to you, Commissioner, because I cannot stay. My colleagues are going to take a careful note of your response. I know that we will want to follow up this issue.</p>

<p class="contents">In the 1960s it was the European Assembly, today the European Parliament, which was concerned about regional imbalances, drafted the plan for regional policy and started the procedure for implementing it. 30 years later, the geographic distribution of economic prosperity, in other words the achievement of economic and social cohesion, constitutes Parliament"s, and especially our political group"s, main interest.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, ever since the Treaty of Rome, competition policy has been an integral part of the European economy as an essential factor in competitiveness for each of the European regions, whether less favoured or developed. Before the Treaty of Maastricht, competition policy and the policy of economic and social cohesion ran parallel, but with the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, currently in the process of ratification, it has become necessary to strengthen the complementarity and balance between them, given that cohesion, which expresses the duty of solidarity between the Member States, has become the priority for the construction of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a danger, which is that aid from the European Union to particular regions may distort work already in progress in the market in favour of certain areas. Here the rapporteur has highlighted the importance of having competition rules capable of guaranteeing the proper and transparent operation of the internal market, bearing in mind that exceptions to free competition, in the form of aid to Member States, are justified for the purpose of preserving economic and social cohesion. While, on the one hand, the European Union"s structural policy has contributed to reducing the existing development disparities, in particular in the cohesion countries, on the other hand it has also led to an ever‐growing number of objectives, programmes and Community initiatives, a fragmentation of subsidies, and a complex and inconsistent approach to zoning.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the rapporteur"s approach to all this is fundamentally correct and I hope Parliament will follow his lead.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">David </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – Mr President, I welcome very much the Azzolini report and I agree with the essential arguments which are put forward. Although the European Union's competition policy and its regional policy have very different roots, there is now an obvious need to have greater coherence and consistency on coordination between, on the one hand, national state aids, competition policy and the European Union's regional policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I have to say that I have one reservation and that is whether we should have virtually total co‐terminosity between the two kinds of maps that we are talking about. I fear that we could be aiming at uniformity for the sake of uniformity. I really believe that there is a real need for a measure of flexibility, that recognises that there are particular situations in different parts of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Flexibility is needed essentially because we are talking about two different kinds of aid. On the one hand, there is aid for developing the infrastructure and human resources of the less prosperous regions. That is done through the European Union's structural funds. On the other hand, there is aid for particular industries and enterprises through national state aids, like regional selective assistance in the United Kingdom. That is national state aid. In many cases, of course, the two will naturally go together. But in some instances we need to acknowledge that to help certain areas we sometimes need to support industries that are adjacent to Objective 1 and 2 areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Why do we need to do that? One simple reason is that people are increasingly travelling significant distances to work on a daily basis. To help people in one area occasionally you have to allow state aid to industries in another area. Often, of course, firms developing in one particular area help the region immediately next to it. There is a knock‐on effect to economic development. Therefore, there is a strong case for flexibility and with that one reservation I support Mr Azzolini's report in total.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">McCartin </span> <span class="bold">(PPE).</span> – Mr President, I agree with Mr Azzolini when he says that regions which are coming out of Objective 1 must not be treated as strictly as the Commission is proposing to do. Regions that have just emerged from a state of low economic development usually suffer from serious deficiencies in their infrastructure.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Ireland where I come from, it is estimated that it would take 10 billion euro to bring our road networks up to the average EU standard, even if we have just enjoyed six years of very generous structural funds. In all the regions of the EU which are just emerging from economic backwardness we must realise that there is still a serious burden of the past to be carried. Until genuine economic equality has been achieved the Commission must be extremely careful not to impose rigorous harmonisation which could lead to a reversal of gains already made.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also be aware that countries that have oppressive tax regimes, which are retarding economic growth and creating unemployment, are sometimes the authors of their own misfortune and it is their national policies that drive some industries to locate elsewhere. Such tax regimes must not be imposed by the Commission as the norm for the EU as a whole. Rather, we must promote as normal for all Member States the tax regimes which have been shown to be successful. The basis for the European convergence model must be the successful tax regimes rather than the ones that are creating difficulties.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to explain to EU citizens that they can only enjoy free trade and the benefits that it brings if they are prepared to have a body to enforce discipline and fairness. There will always be those who will attack the efforts of the European Commission as bureaucratic interference but we must be prepared to explain to our citizens that they can only enjoy consumer benefits within a single market if fairness and equality is enforced. It is also fair to say that levels of preferential treatment, either in the form of tax concessions or grant aid, that are not acceptable within a Member State are also unacceptable within the European Union, whether these are in the form of benefits that come from the EU or from national governments.</p>

When I look at the Commission"s report on competition policy, I find that it addresses many of these new problems and also considers the fact that in an era of globalisation we will have to reckon with an increasing number of mergers, of forms of cooperation and mega‐mergers. However, I wonder whether we always draw the right distinction between strategic alliances and the possible emergence of monopolies, which would be harmful to competition. When I look at the Communities" competition law in regard to, for instance, cartels and subsidies I find, however, that it is in fact being reviewed continuously and as required.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to state aid it certainly needs emphasising that this aid is still needed. But we have good reason to criticise the very high subsidies granted in a few Member States. It is also right to criticise the fact that increasingly few resources are being made available for the aid agreed under the common market rules, in the field, for instance, of small and medium‐sized undertakings, environmental protection, research and development, while more and more aid is being given to individual undertakings. That is certainly not in the common interest of effective, free and fair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">At this moment in time, distortions of competition as a result of tax aids are more important. Not enough cases of this kind are being investigated. More and more Member States want to attract business to their national locations by granting tax reliefs to undertakings, in the financial and insurance sector, as also in other economic sectors. That distorts competition. I believe the aid rules must look more closely into these distortions of competition. The Commission must investigate more of these cases. The list of 85 cases of tax reliefs, some of which are reminiscent of tax havens, currently before us speaks volumes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must also play its part in preparing the next round of WTO talks, for we do need competition law that also works at international level. Here the current GATT and WTO rules need to be supplemented by internationally effective competition rules. I believe it would be important to have national reports on competition, like the WTO national trade reports. I also believe it would be important to try to establish minimum standards for all states in order to prevent anti‐competitive practices, and to set up independent competition authorities. That could lead to effective, international competition rules under which the signatory states undertake also to make their national competition law internationally applicable.</p>

<p class="contents">Moving on to the substance, I want to say right away that the idea that the two maps used by DG IV and DG XVI should coincide might actually make sense if, in applying all its financial and constitutional instruments, the European Union would deal with the geo‐economic problems by implementing Community competition and cohesion policies in the same way. Failing that, it would make more sense to leave the Member States free to act where the Union is not in a position to do so, although within the limits laid down by the regulations of the two separate Community policies, or, alternatively, to support countries or take their place where Community resources and, above all, the European logic dictated by the requirements of the single currency market permit this.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Rome defines competition policy in order to eliminate any form of distortion likely to interfere with the free play of market forces. From Rome to Maastricht it was recognised that we needed a cohesion policy geared to strengthening the less favoured regions of the Union, thus substantially pursuing the same purpose – a homogeneous common market. Between Maastricht and Amsterdam the aim was adjusted, as it was recognised that the free play of competition and market homogeneity could only be achieved through a policy of economic and social cohesion that paid more attention to territorial reality. It is in that spirit that the Amsterdam Treaty adds, for example, a reference to the island regions, so that they can start from a level playing‐field and compete on an equal footing while respecting market forces.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, on the other hand, we are seeing a development in competition policy, which is attempting to take account of cohesion policy by including it in its most important regulations, but all it is really doing is complicating those regulations. In fact, on the say‐so of the Commission and regardless of Parliament"s opinion, only the island regions will be left on the sidelines, and the Commission will have to explain to them why, in addition to losing Community aid, they are also going to lose national aid, or why, faced with the Community"s refusal to take their case into consideration, notwithstanding the Treaty, and for the sake of consistency with what DG IV wants, they will no longer be able to seek the state intervention which allowed them to compensate for the competitive disadvantage they suffer.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Metten </span> <span class="bold">(PSE).</span> – <span class="italic">(NL)</span> Mr President, regional policy and competition policy can be complementary and need not conflict with one another. It is the wealthy Member States which make greatest use of the instrument of state aid, and cutting down on this by a more rigorous implementation of competition policy will definitely help the poorer Member States by creating a level playing field.</p>
<p class="contents">But regional policy can actually lead to unintentional distortions of competition. I am not talking here about explicitly giving preference to the poorest regions, because that is what we are trying to do. What I am talking about is regions which cannot, by any criterion, be deemed still to need assistance, but which continue to receive a great deal of aid and are also able to benefit from discriminatory tax regimes because they did need assistance in the past.</p>
<p class="contents">Our regional policy is too slow to react to change. Part of the reason for this is that we take a decision just once every six or seven years on which regions qualify for aid, and we do that on the basis of figures which are already a few years old. Thus it can happen that Ireland is still an Objective 1 region in 1999, the criterion for which is a GDP of less than 75 % of the Union average. Yet Ireland"s GDP in 1997 was already above the Union average, and the following year it was actually 116 % of average GDP for the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">To say that a country like Ireland has to adjust to no longer being an Objective 1 region under the new financial perspective and that it therefore needs both operating and investment aids for a few more years, whilst discriminatory tax regimes can continue till the year 2010, seems to me too daft for words, because that aid enables Ireland to lure firms away from other Union countries which are now poorer than Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">The statement in the Azzolini report that the provisions are too strict for initial investment for whose who have since become too rich will certainly be too much for some of my group to swallow.</p>

There is no doubt that to date the single market, together with its necessary consequence, economic and monetary union, has been the greatest achievement of the process of building the new Europe. Such success would not have been possible without a policy guaranteeing competition as the best security for economic growth and job creation. Nevertheless, free competition and growth must never compromise social and economic cohesion, key elements of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire</span> , to which the Union devotes a significant proportion of its budget.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to focus on the need to tackle the thorny issue of state aid. According to the existing arrangements, agreements between enterprises, the abuse of dominant positions and unjustified state aid are regulated by constant monitoring to safeguard competition. However, what sort of aid could be justified? This is not a trivial question and has never been clarified, though the Commission attempted to do so in 1975, 1979 and 1988. The interpretation of Articles 92(1), 92(3)(a) and 92(3)(c) still gives rise to a number of problems. As regards the regions with the greatest objective and structural deficits, the only possible interpretation has to be the one that will provide for the greatest development of these areas. Any other interpretation would certainly be branded as eurocentrist, difficult to justify and therefore unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Van Miert is a politician and not a technical expert. He will surely understand that I would be failing as a politician if I did not take advantage of his presence here today to enquire about the current position regarding the problem being discussed by the Spanish Government and his department in connection with state aid to the Canary Islands. I realise this is not the time for him to give me a detailed report, but I trust he will be able to give his opinion on the state of the discussions, and reassure public opinion which is very sensitive to this issue.</p>

It deals with concerns that directly affect the people in the Member States and the regions. The resolution may not have any direct impact on the progress of the regional policy reform, yet it must be regarded as directly linked to it, given that we are talking about coherence between European and national regional aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Some Member States have no problem with the requirement of coherence which the Commission is laying down in order to secure its competition policy aims because almost their entire territory is covered by European aid. But the situation is different in some other countries. Here the dual approach of concentrating the European objective areas on the essential ones, which is right, while at the same time calling for maximum coherence with national aids, sometimes imposes a double burden that is very difficult in regional policy terms. How can we explain to the people living in the regions concerned that both European and national aid is prohibited, despite the imminent threat of unemployment, despite the absence of promising job prospects?</p>
<p class="contents">It is a contradiction in terms for the Commission quite rightly to provide for multiannual transitional periods for phasing out European aid, which ensures that the regions have time to adjust, while using a sledge hammer to reduce national aid and calling for this to be phased out as quickly as possible. The 2 % flexibility margin is not enough, nor is it convincing. Nor is there any justification for it being 2 % rather than more or less. That does not mean that the Commission"s endeavour to bring about greater coherence is wrong as such. In the long term we need a more balanced coverage if we want to avoid distortions of competition. But the Commission is not taking sufficient account of the special problems of the regions when it subordinates everything to the imperative of free competition and tries to cut back European aid while at the same time taking away any means of granting national aid to compensate for this in a flexible manner. That would take away any chance of adjustment for many of the regions.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect I welcome the fact that agreement seems to be emerging between the Council and the Commission on taking a more flexible approach to the flexibility question, on not specifying any target dates and giving the Member States more margin for decision. So the discussion we held in Parliament has had the desired effect.</p>

My colleague Mr Van Miert will then address the many concrete questions raised in connection with the competition report.</p>
<p class="contents">First I want to thank Mr Azzolini for his most interesting and careful report. I am also grateful that we agree at least on the question of principle, namely that we need greater coherence between national and regional aid policies. Let me emphasise again, as others have rightly said, that different problems are involved here. In relation to Objective 1 we already have equal cover between competition aid and regional aid from European resources. So no problems can arise here, whereas problems can indeed arise in areas where we have less competition aid and where the need for concentration – for Agenda 2000 to lead to greater geographical concentration – basically means that the aid must be reduced from two sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless I believe that we must begin by emphasising the logic of our policy. For it makes no sense, given that we concentrate European resources on a minimum number of eligible regions, namely those that have to undergo the biggest structural adjustment processes, for us then to allocate all the resources to these regions, not just European money but also the higher aid intensity. It makes no sense to embark on a kind of division of labour that would mean that European structural policy looked after the less eligible areas and that national aid was then concentrated on the areas most in need of structural adjustment. I do not think that would be logical. What we are in fact proposing is to widen the Member States" regional margin for play, for as a rule national competition aid covers areas wider than those that can be supported through the Structural Funds. That means that over and above European structural aid the national states and the regional authorities have a variety of means of supporting their structurally weak areas.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Randzio‐Plath was quite right when she said that unfortunately far less use is made of aid that is authorised, aid for environmental improvement and technological development, than of aid for individual undertakings, which very often does not offer any guarantee that this investment will lead to integrated regional development. That is why I believe that it does indeed make sense to establish more congruence between Objective 2 aid and Article 92(3)(c).</p>
<p class="contents">A number of Members have pointed out that on 25 January this year the Foreign Ministers" Council reached agreement on a compromise, which I shall briefly describe to you because it is important to your further discussions. Let me take up what Mr Rack said, namely that Parliament can play a careful part in the discussions and in seeking Agenda 2000 solutions only if it also has the appropriate information. I shall therefore read out part of the Foreign Ministers" agreement: ‘In the interests of efficient programme planning, the regions undergoing economic and social adjustment must to a large extent be the same regions that are assisted by the Member States under Article 92(3)(c). Here the Community"s aim should be to achieve better coherence by the end of the period 2000 to 2006, with the Member States making the appropriate efforts – in accordance with their situation at the time."</p>
<p class="contents">As I am sure you will notice, this is not necessarily the most direct way of saying that we want to improve the situation. And I am sure it is no secret either that Mr Van Miert and I myself would certainly have wished to see better coherence. Nevertheless, I believe that the compromise the Council has now reached will at least lead, on the one side, to rather more flexibility, which is something Parliament has always called for, but – and I believe it is important to note this, given also what Mrs Schroedter said – will also impose an obligation on the Member States to contribute through this regulation to a greater concentration. Mrs McCarthy may no longer be here, but I would say that consensus will win the day only if we actually succeed in the end in bringing about greater coherence, not because we are purists or take fundamentalist positions in the Commission, but because that is the only way we can actually achieve the effects we want.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to timing, the problems of competition policy and structural policy do indeed differ. We take the view that the agreement that has now been reached in regard to the common communication will help us find sensible and closely coordinated solutions in both competition and structural policy. Regarding subsidy shopping, let me point out that we are calling for a certain sustainability of investment for both policies, to ensure that once they have pocketed the aid undertakings do not then relocate and then claim new aid, be it national or European.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to structural policy I just want to point out that I believe that if the monitoring committees play more part in the evaluation and are also given a more substantial role, there will be careful discussion about the sustainability of the investments and that the a major criterion for granting or not granting aid will be whether the assisted undertaking really is established in that region. That could mobilise a substantial steering instrument. I hope that in future the monitoring committees will ensure this too.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me return now to the concentration of aid on the most disadvantaged regions. During this debate many speakers have said that this concentration is the crux of the reform and that without concentration any positive effects for poorer regions would be reduced out. That is why I think it is so important that we do not counteract our own endeavours by watering down the 75 % criterion. For the rest, the ultraperipheral regions do not face any problems, because they all fulfil the strict 75 % criterion. In the case of Objective 6 regions we must indeed differentiate, as we must for islands, because there the state of development differs widely and we must all take that into consideration. We would be doing ourselves no favour if we said that exceptions would guarantee everyone their own special rules; instead we must ensure that the level of aid is adjusted to the severity of the problems.</p>
<p class="contents">In that sense I hope we will agree during the further discussions on Agenda 2000, and above all its implementation, on the need jointly to promote the necessary coherence so that the structurally weakest areas can catch up.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Van Miert, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. – (FR) </span> Mr President, firstly I should like to offer my sincerest thanks to the two rapporteurs, Mr Azzolini and Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen. This is not the first time that I have had the pleasure of debating our annual report in person here with Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen. I am truly delighted by the quality of the reports, and also of the debate. As a result, it is rather a shame, Mr President, that there is so little time to respond to the many comments made and real issues mentioned. Therefore, I would like to ask you to forgive me for only responding to a few of the points that have been raised, but this is down to necessity.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I should like to answer Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen"s question about democratic control and transparency. It is a fundamental issue as the Commission has a direct and specific responsibility in this field. It is both logical and necessary that, at any point in time, the Commission should be prepared to appear before Parliament or before the responsible committees to explain the decisions that it is taking or refusing to take.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen, I am fully prepared to commit myself to coming here every month and talking to the responsible committee, which is much more than the three visits a year that were made a few years ago. This is all I ask. I am in your hands. There are plenty of issues and problems to debate. So it is up to you: if you invite me each month, I will be here.</p>
<p class="contents">With that said, I should very quickly like to turn to the report by Mr Azzolini, as Mrs Wulf‐Mathies has already responded to a number of comments. We need to agree on the objectives of this process. Currently, 51 % of the population live in regions eligible for Structural Fund aid, and 47 % in regions eligible for national or regional aid. With enlargement on the horizon, and bearing in mind that all the countries involved will be eligible for such aid, our policy is threatening to become illogical, given that the aim of regional policy is to help the regions in greatest need. Therefore, we, Mrs Wulf‐Mathies and ourselves, must now work together to try to reduce the number of eligible regions. We must make an effort to concentrate aid and try to be as consistent as possible. And I am delighted by the fact that, at Commission level, we have been able to reach an agreement on this.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a rather delicate and at times politically difficult operation because even reducing the number of eligible regions by only 4 % – and reducing them from 47 % to 43‐42.7 % is not difficult – is already causing a great deal of political upset. Even a small reduction spurs all manner of forces into action, standing up to demand that their region remain eligible. But if we do not do this, I feel that we will not be doing our job or our duty given the forthcoming enlargement of the European Union. Therefore, we must work along these lines and accept that our policy will have certain effects.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need to decrease the intensity of aid. On many occasions you have specifically criticised the problem of relocations. Such relocations can be explained by the fact that sometimes, in certain regions, the intensity of aid is such that firms leave other eligible regions to move to regions where the intensity of aid is much greater. You have called on us to do something about this.</p>
<p class="contents">So, in answer to your request, we are reducing the differences in intensity whilst also remaining within acceptable limits as the limit for A regions is 40 or 50 %. For the outermost regions the limit may be even more, but for C regions I believe that an intensity of 20 % is a suitable ceiling and, in certain circumstances, could even drop to 10 %. As a result, I believe that this is a better balance and, what is more, the national authorities will still be able to do a lot for the most needy regions. Therefore, in the future, our policy will be much more balanced than before.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish there on your report as there are a number of questions on Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen"s report also awaiting an answer. Firstly, there is the general question of state aid. Many of you have said that the economically most developed countries award the most aid. This is indeed true, and it is also why we are trying to be much stricter. I can tell you that, last year, we made a series of negative decisions on state aid, as many as 31, compared with only 9 in 1997. This is clear proof that, little by little, we have become far stricter, as should be the case. You know what the consequences of this are, sometimes involving disputes with governments, regional authorities and so on. But that is the price that has to be paid for a more credible, consistent and coherent state aid control policy. There is no other solution. We must be sure of what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, there are grounds for forging ahead with this issue. Mr Metten talked specifically about fiscal aid. Mr Metten, as you know we currently have approximately thirty cases to consider, but I should like to ask you where I can find the human resources to do so. Once again, we have been given an extra job to do, which we are quite prepared to do as there is a need for it, but no one in the Council of Finance Ministers has asked if DG IV has the means to do this job. No one has asked if we have the tax consultants to do it. No one has asked this question. Once again, we have been given an additional responsibility, which we would indeed like to carry out, but for goodness" sake, from now on, there should be more consistency by giving us the means we need to carry out this type of work.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards state aid, I would particularly like to mention the matter of the energy sector in Spain very briefly. I am aware that this issue is gaining extraordinary political proportions. This is how the situation stands. Firstly, the Spanish authorities would like to liberalise the energy sector more rapidly than in other Member States or than stated in the directive, and we can only welcome this. This much is clear. Secondly, it is true that this operation, not only in Spain but in other Member States, will involve what we call ‘stranded costs", but in principle it is a state aid issue. So the Commission and DG IV must be notified of all these cases, as well as DG XVII, so that we can examine them separately but coherently.</p>
<p class="contents">After the contact I had with the Spanish minister a few days ago, the Spanish Government has now agreed that it will also notify us of Spain"s case. This will mean it can be examined by my service as it should be, in accordance with the principle that stranded costs should be classified as real costs linked to public service obligations previously imposed on businesses by the public authorities, and which now, in the liberalisation process, are in danger of causing the businesses involved to lose out. This is the background to this whole exercise. For the moment, I cannot say any more than that. Once we have been notified, we will, of course, attempt to clarify the situation as quickly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Another issue is that of the Canary Islands. We have already approved what we call REF, the economic and fiscal regime. And now, we have been notified about the ZEC, as we call it – the Canaries special region. The fact that the Canary Islands will remain an A region will clearly let us consider allowing more aid than if they had moved from an A ranking to a C ranking. It allows for a broader based approach. However, for the moment we are examining what the government has brought to our attention. At this point, I cannot tell you any more.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I see that I have already exceeded my speaking time. Please allow me, by way of conclusion, to highlight an issue which unfortunately has not been fully debated here today, namely the modernisation of competition policy. Mrs Riis‐Jørgensen, I will take the liberty of suggesting a subject to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and Industrial Policy so we can debate it. You know that we have already taken a series of steps as regards state aid and in other areas such as vertical restraints, and so on. But there are others and, very briefly, I should very much like to have an opportunity to discuss them with the responsible committee.</p>
<p class="contents">So we are attempting – and I will stop here – to ensure that our competition policy is more transparent, more efficient and more credible, but also that it is well enough prepared to face the challenges ahead. Enlargement is one such challenge, and it is an extraordinary one. However, before the end of this Commission"s term of office, we must also ensure that together we can say that we have done everything possible to prepare for the future and to allow the Commission to do its job properly.</p>
