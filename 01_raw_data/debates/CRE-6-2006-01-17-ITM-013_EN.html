<p class="contents">This was confirmed by the Council common position of 24 January 2005 on exchanging certain data with Interpol. It notably concerns lost or stolen passports. It underlined that the conditions of the exchange shall be agreed with Interpol in order to ensure – and I would like to stress the following – that the data exchanged will respect the data protection principles that lie at the heart of data exchange within the Union, particularly with regard to the exchange and automatic processing of such data.</p>
<p class="contents">I should add that the control of personal data by Interpol shall be ensured by the rules on the control of information and access to Interpol’s files. In particular these rules establish a commission for the control of Interpol’s files and govern the composition, role and functions of that commission.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Risk of water shortage in the Mediterranean</span></p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the last meeting (November 2005) of the Mediterranean countries' Environment Ministers portray an extremely alarming situation as regards the availability and management of water resources in the region. In particular, 50% of the wetlands have disappeared, adversely affecting the flora and fauna throughout the region, while it is estimated that only 60% of the rural areas along the southern coast of the Mediterranean have access to safe drinking water.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of this data and scientists' estimates that, in the future, 38% of the population of the Mediterranean will live in areas where water is in short supply, will the Commission take practical initiatives in the context of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation to deal with this phenomenon jointly with the partnership countries, taking as a model Directive 2000/60/EC<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy?

The problem of water shortages in the Mediterranean is intensifying due, on the one hand, to the increased demand for water in certain sectors and areas and, on the other hand, to the repercussions of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards climate change, I would like to comment that, from a scientific point of view, it is difficult to maintain that isolated cases of droughts are directly connected to climate change; nonetheless, we know that climate change contributes to more severe phenomena which are manifesting more and more regularly and over larger geographical areas.</p>
<p class="contents">We requested and have received a report from the EU Joint Research Centre on the links between climate change and water, water shortages and droughts.</p>
<p class="contents">In general, protection of our water resources is one of the priorities of the environmental policy of the European Union. In fact, the European Union has radically restructured its policy in the water sector with the relevant framework directive. In this way it sent a political message well beyond its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the basic principles of the European Union's policy in the water sector is cooperation between the regions in various Member States which share common water resources. For this purpose, the so-called EU Water Initiative was adopted, within the framework of which the European Union and its Member States have undertaken to achieve the Millennium Goals as regards the water sector.</p>
<p class="contents">Following this, the Commission launched a joint procedure between the framework directive and the EU Water Initiative, a procedure which Greece headed for the part of the initiative concerning the Mediterranean. The aim of this cooperation is to facilitate the application of policies of proper administration of water resources in the Mediterranean countries, by adhering to the principles of the Community Water Framework Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, with the Member States of the European Union and third Mediterranean countries working together, working groups have been set up, one of which will address the issue of water shortages, and guidelines will be drafted by the end of this year, which will be addressed both to the countries of the European Union and to the other Mediterranean countries. Measures will also be proposed to prevent and manage water shortages and droughts.</p>
<p class="contents">Water is one of the priorities of the short-term environmental action plan, known as SΜΑΡ, which is being applied at regional level. Monitoring SMAP actions forms part of the programme and there are reports available for most of these actions. A detailed evaluation of the programme will be scheduled this year and the results will be at your disposal.</p>
<p class="contents">So far, evidence from the application of SΜΑΡ is positive and is contributing to the promotion and exchange of experiences and best practices, especially in the water sector. Under the SΜΑΡ 2 programme between 2000 and 2005, two of the eight projects – with a Community contribution of EUR 6.2 million – directly concerned water management.</p>
<p class="contents">The next generation of the SΜΑΡ programme, SΜΑΡ 3, will focus on the preparation of overall coastal zone management plans and will make provision for technical assistance to be provided to the Member States' governments.

Social partners from all sectors were involved in discussions on the resolution, and asked to provide further information in the form of an extensive questionnaire. The latter was also forwarded to the administrative bodies of the Member States, which is the follow-up procedure for all Parliament resolutions. The Commission lent its support to a research project carried out by the European Federation of Building and Woodworkers on the practical impact of the Posting of Workers Directive, which was followed up by a conference. The end result was a draft second report on the implementation of Directive 96/71/EC, which covers the same issues as Parliament’s resolution. The Commission services are currently in the process of finalising this draft report, and it will be adopted in the near future. The Commission has played an active role in both implementing the Directive in practice and improving cooperation in the field of information provision by working together with a group of specialists from the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the outcomes of this group’s work has been a code of conduct, along with guidelines for cooperation and multilingual documents for informal exchanges of information. The aim of these latter is to facilitate communication between contact points and monitoring bodies. In addition, a dedicated website has been launched on the posting of workers, which contains key information in three languages on the legal framework governing the posting of workers and links to related documents and websites set up by the Member States that cover problems relating to the posting of workers. The website also provides the public with access to a list of contact points and monitoring bodies, which means that official bodies and individuals can find out about the appropriate contact points in the various Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I have been informed that the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has decided to draft an own-initiative report on the impact of Directive 96/71/EC on the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services. A hearing on this report will be held on 26 January 2006. I will be very interested to learn the outcome of this hearing, and I would welcome the opportunity to cooperate with Parliament on this key issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Generally speaking, I can say that in principle the Commission’s comments should not call any Member State’s social model per se into question. They should, however, unfailingly uphold the principle that the economic freedoms enshrined in the Treaty can be combined with the various social models. In other words, the directive was intended from the outset to provide protection to posted workers at a level that is appropriate for the given Member State. Interpretation may be problematic in certain cases, as I said before, but this is the principle which underpins the Directive, and which applies to all the Member States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As is outlined in the Commission communication of 25 October 2005 on the contribution of taxation and customs policies to the Lisbon Strategy, the Commission intends to carry out the necessary preparatory work towards a common consolidated tax base over the next three years, with a view to presenting a Community legislative measure by 2008. The Commission does not intend to propose a harmonised corporate tax rate, which is just part of the overall area we would like to harmonise.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards vulnerable areas of less populous Member States, it should be borne in mind that, under Community state aid rules, Member States have to respect strict conditions when providing for preferential tax regimes in favour of companies undertaking investments in assisted areas, under national regional state aid guidelines for promoting the economic development of certain disadvantaged areas of the European Union. State aid rules remain applicable to any state measures which may be enacted in the context of a common consolidated tax base initiative. The preparatory work by the Commission has not yet reached the stage of examining the impact of a common consolidated tax base on different regions within Member States. Any legislative proposal submitted by the Commission after this work has been carried out will, in any case, be accompanied by an appropriate impact assessment.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I should point out that the common consolidated tax base has been identified as an important tool for helping the Community achieve the Lisbon goals. It will help to reduce compliance costs and to encourage cross-border activities, which will lead to a higher rate of economic growth and employment and a higher level of competitiveness across the whole of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The problem in that case was that while United Kingdom law permits loss relief inside the United Kingdom market, the same is not permitted in the case of other companies or branches of Marks &amp; Spencer in different Member States – one in Germany and one in Belgium. The ECJ ruling, in compliance with the philosophy of the internal market, was in favour of Marks &amp; Spencer and the Commission fully supported that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission wants to study carefully the budgetary consequences of such rulings and try to take the initiative to have better coordination within the tax policy of the Member States: if not harmonisation, at least coordination is needed in order to avoid such problems.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I want to refer to the first question concerning the common consolidated corporate tax base, which would solve the problem. The difficulty is that, as I have already said, in the best case, if everything goes smoothly and well, we will come up with the legislative proposal no earlier than 2008, so we still have two years in which to provide some temporary solution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">No EU country is to be allowed to impose a requirement on any postal operator to charge a standard rate for postage. Pricing must be free and market-based and not publicly regulated. This means that it may become cheaper to send a letter within a city than between two towns in the same country that are far away from one another. In addition, the rules stating how often mail must be delivered are to be curtailed to a minimum of one day per week instead of five days per week, which is the case at present.</p>

<p class="contents">The views expressed in the study are those of the consultant. The study is merely one of several elements that the Commission is considering in looking at various options and their possible consequences. In addition to the regular consultation with stakeholders and notably an online public consultation currently under way, the study actually serves as a platform to engage in a transparent and open debate on the conditions for enabling the further phasing-in of competition in the postal market.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the understanding of the Commission that the approach taken by the consultancy on the issue of the uniform tariff and the frequency of delivery was an attempt to give more flexibility to the public postal operator in order to sustain a viable and efficient universal service in the long term.</p>
<p class="contents">The current Postal Directive 97/67/EC, as amended by Directive 2002/39/EC, does not impose a uniform tariff but requires a minimum frequency of delivery of five days a week.</p>

Patients would not be able to enjoy the same rights as users of other services (right of information on providers, requirement to conclude indemnity insurance). Patients have already obtained the right to have health care costs in another Member State reimbursed thanks to the European Court of Justice, meaning that Article 23 would simply incorporate case law into national legislation, as well as providing patients with a higher level of certainty on account of the definition of hospital care.</p>

The case law of the Court of Justice has established that, subject to certain conditions, patients have the right to have the cost of healthcare received in other Member States assumed by the social security system in their own Member State. Patients are, without prior authorisation, entitled to get reimbursement for non-hospital care received in other Member States. For hospital care, prior authorisation may be required before a patient can go abroad to receive health care. Authorisations must be granted when the necessary care cannot be given in the patient’s Member State within a medically justifiable time limit.</p>
<p class="contents">Before the proposal for a services directive was tabled, the Commission carried out a study on the implementation of the rights of patients in the Member States. The conclusion was that ‘European citizens are encountering unjustified or disproportionate obstacles when they apply for reimbursement, from their Member State of residence, of costs for non-hospital treatment incurred in another Member State, or for authorisation for assumption of the costs in the case of hospital treatment’.</p>
<p class="contents">For an individual citizen, the right to receive treatment in other Member States and to have the cost covered by his or her own social security system is probably one of the most important benefits of the internal market. These are the reasons for the Commission to propose the inclusion of health services in the scope of the services directive and for proposing a specific provision on the assumption of health care costs incurred in other Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also been actively involved in the work of the high-level group on cross-border healthcare and patient mobility with a view to establishing how best the framework for guaranteeing and promoting patient rights in the single market can be developed.</p>
<p class="contents">This work has shown the clear benefits of cooperation between Member States on health and healthcare related issues, of which the reimbursement of costs is just one aspect. A number of Member States are concerned about the effects cross-border care and patient mobility may have on their national health budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of a clear legal framework, we will continue to be confronted with developing ECJ case law. Pending the vote in this House on the first reading of the proposed services directive, it would be inappropriate to speculate on the position on certain articles, but I can confirm that where Member States impose disproportionate or unjustified restrictions, the Commission will act, including by launching infringement procedures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is one question I should like to ask, if I may, as a former minister for health and head of a large teaching hospital. Is the Commission aware of the fact that the Services Directive represents a key opportunity to lay down clear conditions and legal provisions concerning the reimbursement of non-urgent health care costs to citizens of the 25 Member States, without the principle of subsidiarity being violated? Furthermore, is it aware that it has already become untenable for the European Court of Justice to continue acting as the guarantor and interpreter of legislation on this issue, or for it to be possible for such a role to be performed by a high-level group that engages in ongoing discussions, yet has no legislative power and cannot provide any legal certainty?</p>

The first issue is whether the Commission intends to clarify further the criteria governing the use of Article 296 of the Treaty. The second, more specific issue is the Commission assessment on the rules to be applied to research, study and experiment contracts in the field of defence.</p>
<p class="contents">On the first issue, we recently outlined our proposals for future initiatives to improve cross-border competition in defence procurement. Our communication of 6 December announced the adoption in 2006 of an interpretative communication on Article 296 in the field of defence procurement and the start of preparatory work on a possible defence procurement directive. Those initiatives are based on the results of the consultation launched with the green paper of 2004. The contribution of Parliament to this debate, voted on 17 November, explicitly supports the Commission in its initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">The interpretative communication will give guidance on how to use Article 296 of the Treaty, which allows Member States a derogation from internal market rules and from Directive 2004/18 when their essential security interests are at stake. This provision has to be applied on a case-by-case basis and cannot be interpreted widely. It is for the Member State that seeks to rely on this provision to provide evidence that the derogation is justified and proportionate to the objective pursued.</p>
<p class="contents">A possible directive would coordinate procedures for defence procurement in cases where the derogation under Article 296 is not applicable or where a Member State chooses not to take advantage of it. It would provide new, more flexible procurement rules, better suited to the specific nature of the defence sector. The adoption by the Commission of a possible proposal for such a directive is subject to the results of the impact assessment which will be carried out in 2006.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is not in a position to give an assessment of the facts described by the honourable Member in the second part of the question. Article 296 of the Treaty has to be applied on a case-by-case basis and according to the specific circumstances of each case. However, the principles that should be taken into account when establishing the rules to apply can be briefly outlined.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, it is worth noting that public procurement in the field of research, study and experiment benefits, under certain conditions, from specific derogations within the existing directive and within the Government Procurement Agreement of the World Trade Organization. Defence contracts of this kind can also benefit from derogations within the Code of Conduct set up by the European Defence Agency for the Article 296 area.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, the question of government ownership of the share capital of potential contractors, and the consequences in terms of the rules to be applied, is not an issue to be addressed on the basis of Article 296: this is linked to the ‘in-house’ derogation, as established by the Court of Justice. However, according to this case law, the derogation only applies in cases of 100% ownership. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Most importantly, if you do not have it, will you do an estimate at Commission level of the costs of not having a single market in the defence sector, in terms of the costs of purchases from overseas that might have been purchased in-house and the costs of having a fragmented and divided defence market in Europe with batch production rather than mass production? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">László Kovács, </span></span>  <span class="italic">Member of the Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> Thank you for the question. The European Neighbourhood Policy has brought and will continue to bring Ukraine closer to the European Union. Our cooperation with Ukraine can be seen as most successful. The European Neighbourhood Policy Action Plan adopted in February 2005 has proved to be an essential and efficient tool for encouraging reform through deeper political cooperation and closer economic integration between the EU and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the Orange Revolution, a renewed willingness on the Ukrainian side to boost EU-Ukraine cooperation could be observed. The implementation of the Action Plan by Ukraine in the course of 2005 can be assessed positively. At the summit with Ukraine in December 2005, President Barroso confirmed progress by Ukraine in political and economic reform. Progress in the EU-Ukraine relationship could be registered on economic integration; granting of market economy status by the EU to Ukraine; cooperation in the key sectors of energy and transport; a memorandum of understanding on energy cooperation; justice and home affairs; the opening of visa facilitation negotiations in parallel to negotiations on a readmission agreement; as well as in the area of foreign and security policy, namely, the launching of the EU border assistance mission on the Transnistrian segment of the Ukraine-Moldova border.</p>
<p class="contents">However, important steps remain to be taken by Ukraine in the implementation of the Action Plan, in areas such as the rule of law and in particular on the economic side: the fight against corruption; adopting relevant legislation for WTO accession; and improving the business climate.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission hopes to build on the additional impetus given by the summit – the first with a Ukrainian Government fully committed to reform – to the development of our relationship with Ukraine. In February 2005 the EU committed to initiating early consultations on an enhanced agreement between the EU and Ukraine as soon as the main political priorities of the Action Plan have been addressed. That commitment remains valid; when we are able to do so depends on Ukraine and perseverance in the reform process to tackle outstanding issues. The March 2006 parliamentary elections will be an important test of Ukraine's continued commitment to democracy and will be essential in opening further perspectives in the relationship with Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The future relationship will be based on several essential conditions: the success of the political reform, respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, and WTO membership, so as to fully integrate Ukraine into the world market. This will also open up prospects for the establishment of a free trade area between the EU and Ukraine.</p>
<p class="contents">The way ahead lies in a close partnership with Ukraine, based on common values and the objective of economic integration, as well as strengthened cooperation in a number of areas. The policy of constant progress and small, continued and common steps in the EU-Ukraine relationship has proved to be successful over the past year since the Orange Revolution and will allow us to tackle the challenges ahead. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, it is still has a long way to go before it completely complies with EU norms and principles.</p>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Sri Lanka: EU's response to Sri Lanka Presidential election result and Pirapaharan statement</span></p>
<p class="contents">On 27 November 2005 Velupillai Pirapaharan, leader of the LTTE, made 'an urgent and final appeal' to the newly elected President of Sri Lanka, Mahinda Rajapaske, to reinvigorate the peace process and 'satisfy the political aspirations of the Tamil people.' Pirapaharan indicated that, if 'a reasonable political solution' was not offered soon, the LTTE would intensify its struggle for self-determination, possibly by violent means.

<p class="contents">Given the stalemate in the peace process since the LTTE withdrew in 2003, and the seemingly irreconcilable zero-sum perspectives of Rajapaske, (who campaigned with promises not to share power with the LTTE) and Pirapaharan, does the EU not feel it has an overwhelming responsibility, as a Tokyo co-chair and a key donor, to open an urgent dialogue with both parties before they return to violence, to find a solution which realises the Tamil right to self-determination within a united Sri Lanka? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are strong reasons for concern about the situation in Sri Lanka. The year 2005 was a bad one for the peace process. The assassination of Foreign Minister Kadirgamar, the electoral boycott enforced by the LTTE in the north and east, and the numerous killings in the east and in Jaffna have put the ceasefire in jeopardy.</p>
<p class="contents">The failure of the post-tsunami operations management structure, the mechanism within which the government, the LTTE and Muslim representatives were to decide jointly about tsunami reconstruction in the north and east, has also been a heavy drawback, creating huge resentment among the Tamils.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are seeing now is a dangerous spiral. The Sri Lankan military has now lost more than 60 soldiers in indirect attacks by the LTTE in Jaffna and other parts of the north and east. So far, the government has acted with a remarkable sense of restraint, but this cannot last forever.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, and the Commission in particular, plays a strong part in the peace process. Sri Lanka is a personal priority of the Commissioner responsible for external relations, Mrs Ferrero-Waldner. She went there last March and fought hard to obtain an agreement on P-TOMS. She still feels this would have made a major difference. The EU passed strong messages to both sides throughout the year. In particular, the EU declaration of September 2005 announcing that high-level delegations of the LTTE would no longer be received in EU capitals was a major signal that, while seeking a balanced approach to the conflict, the EU would not tolerate further violence from the LTTE.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also been instrumental in raising the profile of the co-chairs. The Commissioner responsible for external relations personally attended three of the four co-chair meetings held in 2005. Indeed, two of them were held in Brussels.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission continued to support Norway’s facilitation through public, as well as private, messages throughout the year. The Commission also supported the idea that the next co-chair meeting should take place in Sri Lanka close to the fourth anniversary of the ceasefire agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will intensify its efforts into the next year. Two priorities have been set for the Commission’s action. Firstly, the Commission will work towards an even stronger role for the co-chairs, including direct visits at ministerial level. The Commissioner responsible for external relations herself intends to return there in February, hopefully with all the co-chairs. She wants to be able to speak to Mr Pirapaharan in person and pass him the direct message that Europe will react very soon if the LTTE shows no sign of change.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, now that P-TOMS have failed, the Commission is working on an alternative base to deliver reconstruction to the north and east. It may seek to work more locally, say in one or two districts, to compensate for the absence of a larger consensus between the key players. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I have one issue that I wish to raise, following on from today's mine attack which resulted in the deaths of two civilians and the injury of 12 soldiers. That is the latest in a month of bloodshed. Given that both sides have agreed, in principle, to review the implementation of the ceasefire agreement, is the EU, as co-chair of the peace process, planning on taking this opportunity to push for a human rights declaration signed by both the government and the LTTE in order to put the protection of fundamental human rights at the heart of the peace process? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Colombia</span></p>
<p class="contents">We note with concern that the democratisation process in Colombia is constantly being disrupted by disturbances in the country. We are also concerned about the continuing human rights violations there. The armed conflict is escalating and drug-trafficking is continuing on a large scale. This constitutes a serious obstacle to development and peace in Colombia. A number of Swedish voluntary organisations send personnel to Colombia to work on peace projects and projects to defend the rights of local and indigenous people, including land rights. This should be seen against the background of the fact that, as in many other Latin American countries, large corporations are expanding rapidly, as, particularly, is palm oil production by them. Will the Commission propose any special measures to support the democratisation process in Colombia? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I asked this question precisely because Colombia is in the process of becoming the scene for our second largest refugee disaster. Where Colombia differs from other countries is in the fact that land there is still in the hands of local and regional landowners. That is why there is still an opportunity to help the local population and to ensure that people are allowed to retain their land. This factor will of course be what is important when we try to solve this conflict. Thank you very much for your answer, and I naturally hope that we shall jointly make progress in these peace initiatives being taken by the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
