<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Moreira da Silva (PPE-DE),</span></span>   <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(PT)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, it is no exaggeration, I feel, to state that tomorrow, when we approve the final version of the directive on emissions trading, we will have before us a new economic and environmental paradigm for the European Union: the carbon economy. Carbon will have a price per tonne on the market, and whoever can produce it with the lowest carbon dioxide emissions will reap the benefits. Approving this directive, then, has enormous political value: it lends credibility to our leadership on the world stage, which is crucial if we are to be able to convince Russia to ratify the Kyoto Protocol; from 2005 on, it will allow us to remedy the inadequate progress made by the majority of Member States towards compliance with Kyoto; and, most of all, it will reduce the financial cost of implementing Kyoto in the European Union by 35%.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Parliament has welcomed the Commission’s proposal from the start and believes it to be valuable, we also felt that its scope could have been more ambitious. I believe that this has been achieved with the recommendation for a second reading, agreed with the Greek Presidency, with the full cooperation of the Commission. We will vote on this recommendation tomorrow. This agreement brings two great advantages: firstly, it avoids conciliation, and hence the possible postponement of the launch of the scheme from 2005 until 2006; secondly, although it does not incorporate all the amendments tabled by Parliament, the compromise that was reached includes our most important proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to highlight the principal innovations introduced by this recommendation. Firstly, it defines a national ceiling for emissions allowances, in line with the Kyoto objectives. A quantified objective to be obtained by the system is thus guaranteed, and the risk of over-allocation avoided. Secondly, the temporary exclusion clause – the ‘opt-out’ – clause, will apply to installations but not to activities, thus assuring that the liquidity of the scheme and the equilibrium of the internal market will not be threatened. Thirdly, the scheme can be extended to amend the directive in other sectors, notably the transport, chemical and aluminium sectors. Fourthly, auctioning may now constitute part of the process by which emission allowances are allocated after the end of the first period, though unfortunately in a non-harmonised way. Fifthly, credits deriving from clean development projects and joint implementation of the Kyoto Protocol will be linked into this directive, but they will not replace the priority that should be given to domestic measures. Sixthly, an opt-in clause is included, permitting Member States to extend the system to other installations and activities. Seventhly, the system may be extended to greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide from the second period of the directive onwards, though on a voluntary basis. Eighthly, limits are then defined, with fixed and non-negotiable penalties for non-compliance. Lastly, I would like to draw your attention to the inclusion of benchmarking criteria for allocating emissions allowances among the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I feel, therefore, that the European emissions market has become more ambitious in environmental terms with this report. It is more effective economically, with lower risks of distortion of competition, and it is more compatible with other national policies currently in force.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to conclude, then, by thanking the Council, and the Greek Presidency in particular, for its cooperation. I would like to thank the Commission, whose arbitration between Council and Commission was exemplary. Most of all, I would like to thank my shadow rapporteurs, because I believe that without their cooperation and support, Parliament could not have remained united. And without Parliament’s unity, this agreement would not have been such a good one. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Acceptance of this package in the vote tomorrow will enable a highly ambitious and innovative policy to come into force. In addition, the pace at which this directive has been adopted enables the timetable to stay on track, meaning action will not be delayed.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me extend my personal thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Moreira Da Silva, who has worked tirelessly to reach a second reading agreement on this directive. I know that this has not been an easy task, particularly since emissions trading has been a new subject for many – if not all – of us. I congratulate him on this achievement and look forward to a successful conclusion tomorrow. I also thank the shadow rapporteurs from the different groups, Mrs Corbett, Mr Davies, Mr Sjöstedt, Mr de Roo, Mrs Lucas, Mr Blokland and Mr Nobilia, for their active support in finding an agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change is a core concern of the European Union and when we signed up to the Kyoto Protocol we knew that this commitment would have to be followed by solid action. The emissions trading scheme is a centrepiece of that action and a strong signal of that commitment. At the heart of the European climate change programme that the Commission has set up is the preparation of concrete proposals for action, several of which have already been adopted by this House.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, our approach to climate change follows three tracks: a leading role internationally in establishing the framework for global action, emissions trading within the EU, as the most cost-effective way to cut emissions and, thirdly, specific sectoral measures to reduce emissions, for example by promoting renewables, increasing energy efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions from cars.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to take serious emission reduction measures inside the European Union if we are to be credible when we call for global action to fight global warming. Therefore, the rest of the world will also eagerly anticipate Parliament's vote tomorrow on the compromise package.</p>
<p class="contents">The directive will signify a breakthrough for both climate change and emissions trading. The scheme is not only multi-sectoral but also multinational: it will cover at least 25 countries, i.e. two thirds of those countries with obligations under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission awaits the vote in a position of wholly endorsing the compromise package. It has the support of all Member States. The European Parliament has achieved significant concessions from the Council in this compromise agreement, for example in the extension of auctioning to the first trading period and additional safeguards against the over-allocation of allowances.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, I ask Parliament to conclude tomorrow by not only accepting the compromise package but by accepting it with a resolute majority. In this way the European Union will reaffirm its commitment to the Kyoto Protocol and underline the need to deliver emission reductions in the fight against climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I am every bit as happy as you are about this marvellous package that Mr Moreira da Silva has put on the table after the most enormously hard work – something that I can confirm to my own group. I think we are on the right track. The reason why the compromise is so important is that, if we do not adopt it tomorrow, we will not know for some considerable time what will emerge from the conciliation procedure. Apart from that, I am quite certain that we will then waste another year, and that is precisely what we do not want.</p>
<p class="contents">This really is about how future generations will live, and, although I am very keen on conciliation procedures, we should dispense with one and give the Council a great opportunity to follow where we lead. On this issue, the Olympic spirit is not enough; simply joining in is not on. All the Member States must make the utmost effort; even today, we can already see that some of them are having problems with this ‘trend-line’. On that, Commissioner, I am again in agreement with you. You must see to it that they all play their part. Some will be able to do more than others; there is no doubt about that, but they must all join in, and then we will get the right result. I am, however, again astonished at how, silently and overnight, other sectors have been dropped from this directive. That was a first-class demonstration of the Member States’ weakness and lack of courage when it came to developing an approach according to which both transport and personal house fires – such as we have in our own homes – would in future be covered by the Kyoto Protocol. I would very much have liked that, but it presupposes very tough politicians – of which there do not seem to be that many in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have made a good start by taking 1990 as the initial reference year, and I hope that, with joint implementation, and also with CDMs, we are on the right track. Even though we have not yet precisely defined the package, I do believe that we will, tomorrow, adopt it by a large majority. Many thanks, Mr Moreira da Silva. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has gone about his business with energy and tenacity. An energetic step to achieve the Kyoto targets is now of major importance. Uncertainty about Russian participation in Kyoto must not lead to paralysis.</p>
<p class="contents">Climate change has major economic and social consequences. We must therefore take the steps to turn the tide now. Pollution must now acquire a price and that is an important tool for the preservation of industry. The PSE Group is in complete agreement with Mr Moreira da Silva’s desire to reach an agreement in the second reading and appreciates all the efforts that have been made to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, we have to say that it has also been at the expense of our democratic procedures. Not all of the amendments have received an equal amount of attention in the negotiations with the Council. It is particularly disappointing for the PSE Group that the amendment on closures for instance failed to reach the finish line. There was very broad support for this amendment in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We saw in this amendment an important safeguard against improper closures. Kyoto must not be allowed to be a reason for closing businesses or moving them to a different part of the world and then selling the emission rights. This amendment was important for the employees in energy-intensive sectors. We cannot skate over it too lightly. Public support for a dynamic climate policy is sorely needed, because quite an effort is still going to be needed to achieve the Kyoto targets. I call on the Council and the Commission in any event to take account of closures in the allocation plans. In the event of closures the emission rights must be returned.</p>
<p class="contents">The PSE Group is entirely satisfied on other points. We have always stressed that the system must also be fair and be experienced as fair. This is why we do not want any ceiling that prejudices Member States that have expanded their industry in recent years. We do however want a ceiling that slowly but surely brings Member States to reduce the emission of CO2. Nor do we want Member States that made an early start on innovation to be disadvantaged. That too is an important point for us.</p>
<p class="contents">And finally, we do not want any superfluous bureaucracy. The allocation of emission rights is already complicated enough. We must not make it even more complicated by adding an auction for 5% on top. No one is served by an auction for 5% and in this way we would also tend to stimulate overallocation.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, we are very satisfied with the outcome across the board and on this we congratulate Mr Moreira da Silva once more. We call for attention for the social implications of this directive and the PSE Group calls on the Member States to take this into account in the allocation plans. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can claim to enclose a number of possible loopholes. Member States will not be allowed to issue allowances that exceed their previously agreed targets, and they must not use the Kyoto mechanisms to avoid taking action to reduce emissions domestically.</p>
<p class="contents">We look forward to the Commission coming back with plans to bring other greenhouse gases into the scheme and to extend its scope to include other industries. We await with keen anticipation the Commission's proposals to reduce emissions from the transport sector. Of course, we might have secured more, but speed is of the essence. We want this scheme to succeed, and if Member States are to start meeting their targets they must publish national allocation plans by March 2004.</p>
<p class="contents">Several Member States have expressed serious concern about this legislation and this has been reflected within all our political groups. All those leading on the issue have faced a degree of resistance from some colleagues, but it is a tribute to the skill of our rapporteur that we have secured all-party support for this package. It is also a reflection of our shared concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">When the Commissioner reflects on her term in office, she can take particular pride in the role she personally, and her team, played in securing support for the Kyoto Protocol. But with emissions of greenhouse gases continuing to increase in most developed countries, we hope that this scheme can make a very significant difference. I hope that it will enable the European Union to retain its credibility as the world's leading force in pressing for action to curb global warming.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope also that it will send out a very clear signal about our determination, both to the United States and to Russia – particularly to Russia – whose ratification of the Protocol is so important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They represent an administratively allocated abstract right to pollute the atmosphere. Emissions trading is not a market mechanism. It serves to reallocate emissions among the polluters, but not reduce them.</p>
<p class="contents">The most despicable way of allocating emissions is by auctioning them. Things could easily turn out the way they did when the radio spectra were auctioned off: the air space was bought and sold and all the operators ran into trouble. We must not let that happen to European industry.</p>
<p class="contents">As the system covers just carbon dioxide emissions it will be free to release other pollutants into the atmosphere. There are many questions the directive does not answer. I will mention some of them.</p>
<p class="contents">The emission allowances are to be sold on the stock market. Should an emission allowance, as a financial instrument, be regarded as being the equivalent of a share or an option? How will its sale or non-sale be taxed? How will emissions be recorded in company balance sheets? How will they be treated with regard to private individuals’ income and wealth taxation? Indeed, will private individuals also be able to buy them? We need to ask whether the EU will generally have the power to decide all these matters in a way that treats everyone in the same harmonised way.</p>
<p class="contents">Emissions trading will be done on the stock market and stock exchange activity always involves speculation. There is a danger that the price of an emission allowance will be determined by speculators having no links with industry or any other source of emissions production. Then industry in the Member States might fall victim to the mechanism proposed by the United States of America, in which US industry is not involved and profits and losses depend crucially on the first administrative allocation of emission allowances.</p>
<p class="contents">The Directive on emissions trading is a raw fruit, which should have been allowed to ripen longer. There are many Members in our group who do not believe in the trading of emission allowances on the stock market. Many Members, however, will vote in favour of the compromise amendments, because they are better than Parliament’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a very important directive, perhaps the most important one of these five years, and tomorrow it will be brought to a successful conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">The opt out that Germany was so keen to see for entire sectors is explicitly no longer possible. A heavy defeat for the Ministry for Economic Affairs and even for Chancellor Schröder. Still more important is that next year the Commission will study seriously how transport sectors, with stress on the plural, can be brought under this directive. And that is most sorely needed. Both road traffic and air traffic are going too far. All the internal air traffic within Europe will count for the achievement of the 8% reduction. Can the Commission confirm that it is working on a concrete proposal to bring air traffic within Europe under this directive?</p>
<p class="contents">It is very important that we conclude tomorrow because that, as Mr Davies has already said, will give the right signal to both the Duma in Russia and the government and the opposition in the United States that this is a serious system. This is the most efficient way of reducing CO2 and I do not therefore understand the GUE Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This was an extremely controversial proposal. There has been much weighing up of the pros and cons in many a European boardroom, in many Member States and therefore within the political groups as well. How will this impact on our business? What will the options be for new investments in production capacity? What will an expansion cost if we have to purchase rights? And finally, what will the consequences be for the competitiveness of industries that are already finding it difficult, such as the refining industry, the chemical industry and the iron and steel industry?</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, what we seemed almost to have forgotten in the discussions was that we were all there when agreements were made in Kyoto and that this directive on emission trading was simply a good way of ensuring that the reduction tasks could be implemented in a very efficient manner. That was the underlying intention of this proposal. In other words, how to use an economic tool to serve the environment. Trading in what one business has too much of and another too little.</p>
<p class="contents">The path to the compromise, which I otherwise support, was not an easy one. The economic interests for European industry as a whole were great and a European approach to the problem therefore went without saying. At the same time we had to put on record that a European approach was also very difficult because there were such great differences in starting positions, not only because the environment has been rather better implemented in one Member State than another, but also because the objectives of the Member States were so different.</p>
<p class="contents">Yet something good came out of it. The political compromise takes the existing differences into account. Agreements have been made for benchmarking and<span class="italic"> </span>I am very happy with them, likewise with the Commission’s control of them. It has also been agreed that the auctioning, in any event for the first but also for the second period, is allowed but is not compulsory.</p>

Until now, we had used direct taxation as an instrument of environmental policy, and we could have done that here by specifying CO2 threshold values for certain types of plant. Rather than do that, we have opted for indirect taxation via pricing, and, as one finds with indirect taxation, here too, our problem is that it sets off many side-effects that we had not initially wanted. That being so, Commissioner, it is the Commission’s particular responsibility to take matters in hand as regards any such side-effects.</p>
<p class="contents">I will mention just three of them. The first is that emissions trading may of course have an effect on enterprises’ balance sheets and end up being a factor in their shutting down production or moving it elsewhere. That has nothing more to do with the protection of the environment; it would be a purely commercial calculation. This is where, as a principle, climate protection must, without doubt, be given priority over factory closures and the transfer of production.</p>
<p class="contents">The second question, Commissioner, is whether there are safeguards ensuring that emissions rights are indeed issued for the sake of climate protection and not as part of individual Member States’ policies on industry. One of your core responsibilities is to check to see that they are issued in accordance with fair criteria and with the aim of reducing greenhouse gases that affect climate.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, might it not also be the case that advantages in terms of comparative costs will lead to the indirect promotion of atomic energy? Here too, it is for the Commission to take responsibility for ensuring that no indirect impact is envisaged here. I hope that you will have plenty of staff and plenty of courage to enable you, in the interests of workers, to discharge that responsibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Despite this lack of enthusiasm, I hope that the rapporteur is right when he says that this trade will correct the situation of non-compliance on the part of the majority of Member States – my own country is perhaps one of the worst offenders – and contribute to teaching European companies in preparation for 2008 when the international trade comes into effect, and, most importantly of all, may convince the United States to comply with the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the rapporteur on the need to include the six greenhouse gases, although the common position only establishes that, as of 2008, the Member States will be able to request their unilateral inclusion in the allowance trading system. We believe it to be important that projects which relate to the mechanism for clean development and joint application should not be a replacement for prioritising emissions reductions, which must be achieved within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In any event, the common position includes certain proposals from the European Parliament which we believe to be very important, such as, for example, the demand for greater transparency in the registers, in relation to the ownership of transfer and the cancellation of allowances, the obligation to publish the names of non-compliant operators and penalties imposed for non-compliance, which are now fixed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The European market in emissions allowances will provide the Member States with an effective instrument within their climate change policies to close the gap between the true situation in the field of polluting emissions and compliance with the Kyoto commitments, while creating the best possible cost-benefit relationship. The political importance of this directive is perhaps less obvious, but no less significant.</p>
<p class="contents">European environmental policy is moving on from words to actions, from rules and principles to practice, linking the economy to the environment. This always creates uncertainty, resistance to change, apparent winners and losers and there is no doubt that this can be argued over, but I believe there are many more arguments to convince us, and to convince us that we are moving in the right direction, and to confirm that Europe, by means of directives such as this, is consolidating its determination to lead the process of achieving sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">In this case we must thank the rapporteur, Mr Moreira da Silva, for the excellent work he has done. He has achieved agreements between positions which were initially very far apart and in the end we are going to avoid the need for conciliation by reaching an agreement with the Council which is satisfactory to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">Personally, as he knows, I have been very critical and I have been a great nuisance to him over some of the amendments approved at first and second readings, above all those which seemed to me to impose excessively rigid conditions on the Member States for the application of the directive and which made it difficult for each State to find and define the best way to fulfil its objectives. However, this agreement, which has been reached following long and difficult negotiations inside and outside Parliament and the Council, has lead to a much more open text, which is no less effective and is acceptable to everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">We needed a directive which was sufficiently flexible to allow the Member States to be able to adapt their requirements and operation to the characteristics of their national policies. I believe it was a complicated task which has been successful.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Moreira, I hope that tomorrow we will be able to congratulate you and take pleasure in having been able to successfully take such an important step towards practice in the environmental field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has been said several times here that after the first reading it was difficult to believe that we would get this far, that we would have a directive on emissions trading available to us whose content is sensible and rational in a way that makes it possible to be accepted from very different points of view.</p>
<p class="contents">We obviously have to remember that this is just one of the many ways we have to aim for a reduction in greenhouse gases. If this way were not available to us, we would have to find another, but it has been seen and shown that this is a cost-effective scheme and in this sense it is good that it is to be introduced.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to stress, however, that these last minute discussions and negotiations resulted in the unreasonable proposals that seemed to be included, such as a ceiling on national emission allowances, being taken out. Moreover, the fact that auctioning is to be voluntary is excellent. This way companies that have opted in will not be under strain.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, my congratulations go to the rapporteur and all the others involved. We still have a long road ahead of us in our endeavours to reach the Kyoto targets, but the compromises this report and this directive have achieved mean that we are a step further along the way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He has fought with much energy, determination and expertise for a good and practical system of greenhouse gas emissions trading. I would also like to thank the Commission for its strong support for such a system, but I have to be perfectly honest and say that I am disappointed with the Council. I think we would have achieved more and could have got a better system if the Council and my own government in particular had been more constructive. Unfortunately, some Member States, Germany among them, tried for a long time to torpedo the whole system and weaken it. The upshot is that the compromise we now have is not as good as it might have been if everyone had sought a constructive solution from the outset.</p>
<p class="contents">I think some problems are inevitable unless great care is now taken with national implementation and monitoring by the Commission. The aim of the system is to cut the costs of compliance with the Kyoto Protocol and – much more important – to create an incentive for undertakings to develop new ways of saving energy and greenhouse gases. Market economics is a powerful system; it is capable of opening up potential, if only we set the right conditions. Market economics should also therefore be brought to bear on environmental protection, which is what this system seeks to do.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said, the Commission and the Member States now carry a heavy responsibility for implementation because the compromise is not as precise as Jorge Moreira and Parliament as a whole would have liked, but was watered down somewhat by the Council. Now, some risk of over-allocation still remains and the Commission will have to watch things very carefully; there is also still a risk of allocations being made that have no regard for the technical possibilities. We all know that coal can very easily be replaced by gas or other energy sources, but it is not so easy to cut CO2 emissions for lime, cement and steel. That must be taken into account when allowances are allocated, otherwise it will not be fair. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it is also an expression of European identity, because climate policy has a good name in Europe. May it continue to do so.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to emissions trading, we must be careful not to confuse two things. Trading in emissions does not save one tonne of CO2; that is only saved by investment. But emissions trading encourages investment, that is to say it triggers a search for the cheapest way of cutting CO2. It is also sensible from an economic point of view and industry and many government leaders, many of whom still find emissions trading strange, need to see that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, Mr Seppänen – and, to some extent, Mr Lange as well – have rightly pointed out that a few questions are still unanswered. For example, are emissions rights securities? How are they treated? These are questions for which an answer will probably have to be found in the future, at either national or European level. As regards cost factors for undertakings, Mr Lange is quite right to say that undertakings’ balance sheets will probably look different in future than they do today, especially if CO2 costs more than it does today. Today it costs EUR 5 to EUR 6 a tonne. Once it costs EUR 20 to 30 a tonne, the picture will be quite different and will naturally have effects on energy policy. Let us hope that these will be the ones we are looking for, namely cuts in CO2. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Quite frankly, I do not think they believed it up to that point. I extend my sincere thanks to the rapporteur, my colleague, Mr Moreira Da Silva, for the enormous body of work that he did in bringing all of us to where we are today.</p>
<p class="contents">Ireland has one of the worst records, second only to Spain, for greenhouse gas emissions. National emissions allowance capping will ensure that quantifiable Kyoto objectives are met and that we decouple economic growth from increased greenhouse gas emissions. National allocations will have to be linearly convergent with the Kyoto Protocol. The national cap on allowances can start from the 2003 emissions level and not from that of 1990, provided that the allowances are decreased to the Kyoto figure by 2012. Amendment No 43 is very important as it allows Member States to benchmark the best available technology for allowance allocation. This should ensure that one-off, economically-vital industries can be looked after in a Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">The <span class="italic">force majeure</span> provision is also necessary until a liquid trading market emerges. It is critical to secure the viability of the emissions trading market in the short term if it is to survive in the longer term. In particular, a situation where, as a result of market design, allowance prices significantly exceeded the long-run marginal cost of abatement within the EU and approached the penalty price would be unsustainable. It is appropriate that provisions be made to deal with unforeseen circumstances during the pilot period of 2005 to 2007.</p>
<p class="contents">In the absence of market management mechanisms and taking into account the risks involved, the current <span class="italic">force majeure</span> clause could provide flexibility for Member States to cope with unforeseen events such as market failure, and avoid serious economic shocks. Definition by the Commission of the circumstances under which it may be applied is appropriate and desirable for Member States in advance of them preparing their national allocation plans.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the provision for banking 2005 to 2007 surplus allowances into the 2008 to 2012 period effectively reduces the number of allowances available for allocation in that period and will act as a constraint on Member States in applying <span class="italic">force majeure</span>. Nonetheless, given the large uncertainties and the major risks involved, the provision for <span class="italic">force majeure</span> must be retained. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Europe is now moving into unfamiliar territory. Even theoretical research on the effects of emissions trading exists in name only. When two or three years ago we had the Commission proposal before us, it started to become clear how enormous the gaps were in the proposal upon which we had been building a European strategy for the economy, competition and the environment. There was no appraisal made of the impact of enlargement, no guidance given about how emission allowances could be accounted for in companies’ books, no information regarding value added tax, not even a strategy in case of serious market problems or speculative attacks, no precise data on emissions in Member States, let alone emissions in companies, and no proposal regarding rights of appeal. It is regrettable that we had such an incomplete proposal on such a major issue. Much has been done to put things right, but whether or not we succeeded remains to be seen.</p>
<p class="contents">The ‘trendline cap’ problem in Trilog was solved with a formulation proposed by the Commission that allows Member States to approach the Kyoto targets along their own paths. In being allowed room to move, Member States are also being encouraged to embrace a transport policy that is more responsible in terms of the Kyoto Agreement. That of course is our real problem.</p>
<p class="contents">Trilog’s solution for project-based mechanisms should also be supported. There is no sense in setting more stringent criteria than was agreed at Marrakech. We need, rather, to establish EU rules concerning how converting the emission allowance credits earned from project-based mechanisms into marketable emission allowances can take place without the climate change imperative being compromised. The emission allowance credits earned from the project-based mechanisms will also have an interesting impact on development cooperation. I believe Member States will become much more interested in development cooperation, because they will see the chance to earn emission allowance credits with projects.</p>
<p class="contents">Combined heat and power production and process emissions posed a special problem in connection with emissions trading. If the causal chain associated with the nature of CHP is not taken into account, there will not be any reductions in emissions either. Now Trilog is discovering and acknowledging the special nature of CHP. Member States can take the potential for a reduction in process emissions into account, which in practice means that the best European steel factories can earn their full emission allowance quotas and they will not have to bear additional costs in a world steel market that has been fiercely competitive. That means the risk of carbon leaks will diminish and there really will be an increased chance of preventing climate change. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This issue will not go away and we will have to deal with it and find solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also convinced that we will need all the different tools we can find: legislation, as well as voluntary agreements and market-based instruments, like this one. That is also why it is important that we take the initiative and try this out. We have studied carefully the experience already gained with sulphur trading in the US and we have conducted studies. We have also prepared in a prudent way the start of an emissions trading system in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall just comment on two things that were mentioned. Firstly, the treatment of allowances. Allowances will be a tradable commodity, just like many other tradable commodities, and it is not different just because it stems from an environmental policy. It will be subject to existing taxation legislation in the Union – not different from any other area.</p>
<p class="contents">On transport, we wanted to start with large, fixed-point installations, whose emissions can be feasibly monitored. The transport sector consists of many small diffuse sources that we thought would be difficult to monitor, administer and control. This has been important in designing this proposal, but we accept that transport also has to be subject of action when it comes to reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. We are happy to look at how this area can also be covered. This is now part of this compromise package. Under the text of the directive, the Commission is committed to researching how the transport sector could be brought into the scheme. We will also come back on other issues, as you know, which are in the pipeline to link them to joint implementation and the other flexible mechanisms as well. We will also come back on these issues. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
