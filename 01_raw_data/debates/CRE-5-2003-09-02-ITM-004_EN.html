The purpose of this proposal is to ensure that foreign crews working on ships sailing under the flag of a Member State of the Union have been trained and certified in all cases in accordance with international requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal is particularly important if examined in the light of the maritime disasters involving the <span class="italic">Erika </span>and the <span class="italic">Prestige</span>. The human factor is a very serious aspect of safety at sea; at the same time, however, it safeguards the marine environment. Thus, all types of crews serving on Community ships must be adequately trained.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me to comment briefly on the main elements of the proposal. First, the proposal introduces a harmonised European system for recognising at Community level third country maritime training and certification systems which meet all the requirements of the SΤCW Convention, the Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point concerns the provision of an efficient procedure for direct action as regards changes to the training and certification system of third countries. The tactic of monitoring and possibly withdrawing recognition, where there is cause to do so, are two vital elements in the text. More importantly, the proposal makes provision for the tactic of re-evaluating all recognised countries every five years.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the key to the proposal is the new European Maritime Safety Agency, the expert opinions and professionalism of which will assist the Commission in these vitally important duties. This new legislative practice will improve the quality and efficiency of the system for recognising seafarers’ certificates under a single Community system.</p>
<p class="contents">The Ministers for Transport unanimously reached political agreement on this proposal in March. The examination on the part of the Council allowed us to introduce certain amendments which improve our initial proposal. For example, the recognition of a third country will remain in force unless there is evidence of non-compliance by that third country, in which case recognition will be withdrawn.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, this is the essence of our proposal, the primary concern of which is to ensure that third country crews are professionally competent. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Poignant (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, we have to look at this text again in the context of all the rules concerning maritime safety. It is just one element, one piece of the system of rules for the prevention of accidents at sea. The Commission’s proposal, as the Commissioner has just reminded us, is intended to make things easier, in other words to prevent overlapping and to limit administrative burdens. I can give you some figures here: the European Union has 120 000 sailors, including sailors of non-Community origin, whose numbers rose from 29 000 in 1983 to 34 500 in 2001. It is therefore a matter of legitimate concern to ensure that their training is the best possible and that it complies fully with the international convention known as the STCW Code, which is intended to safeguard human life at sea and to improve the protection of the marine environment, as well as to take action against vessels which do not comply with standards and rules on social dumping. In short, it is an example of the kind of rules that can be applied to globalisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The text is concerned with two points. The first of these simplifies things with regard to the recognition of the training of sailors from third countries. The report is favourable towards this line, which I can sum up as follows: the initiative used to come from the Member States, whereas from now on it will come from the Commission. The current procedure is very complicated and time-consuming, and for this reason it needs to be simplified.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is concerned with bringing the text into line with the language requirements of the STCW Convention. The Commission also supports your proposal to introduce a common language, whether that language is known or learned, in cases where a vessel puts to sea with sailors originating from different countries, so as to ensure that there is dialogue between the vessel and those people on land who are responsible for it. The competent committee and the committee whose opinion was sought, and which is involved in the drafting of the report, want things to proceed rapidly, rather like what happened in the case of the abolition of single-hulled vessels. Let us not delay, because we can all remember the double accident – I would even say the triple or quadruple accident – which happened off our coasts, involving the ‘<span class="italic">Tricolore</span>’, the ‘<span class="italic">Ievoli Sun</span>’, the ‘<span class="italic">Erika</span>’ and the ‘<span class="italic">Prestige</span>’. Given the fact that we are never entirely protected from accidents, we need to take our decisions rapidly, hence the spirit of compromise which, I believe, prevailed at the informal tripartite meeting on 17 June between the Commission, the Council and Parliament, of which I shall give you a rapid résumé.</p>
<p class="contents">In Amendments Nos 3, 12, 15 and 17, Parliament had proposed the recognition of individual training institutes. The Commission told us that it was impossible to inspect them individually, quoting as an example the Philippines, where there are perhaps as many as a hundred. It is therefore necessary to consider the country as a whole, even if it has only one or two institutes. We have taken note of this guideline. Parliament wants to make provision for the introduction of a certificate of compliance so as to reduce fraud to a minimum. At the meeting, the Commission gave an undertaking – and I believe that we should stick to this line – to propose a draft text on this subject during the course of the year. That would be the condition on which we would be willing to support your opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 poses a problem for Member States regarding continuing training, to the extent that such training has to be funded by the sailors’ own states and not by the European Union. We have taken note of this argument. On the other hand, our committee does not wish to drop Amendments Nos 1 and 2 which are concerned with the upgrading of the occupation of seafarer. The same thing applies to the quality guarantees and the guarantees preventing fraud. As far as Amendment No 23 is concerned, which refers to an evaluation report to be submitted after five years, I think that you agree with this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee was also asked to amend the time limit for the transposition of the legislative provisions in Member States. We had suggested 12 months, while you are proposing 18 months. We can take note of this suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Amendment No 19 has been amended by the Council, and we are able to accept the new version. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As the rapporteur rightly reminded us, a series of unfortunate events have taken place at sea. Such disasters are bound to lead us to review certain aspects of these occupations from the point of view of health and safety at work. There are implications too for the environment and for every worker’s right to working conditions which respect his or her health, safety and dignity, as provided for by Article 31 of the Charter on Fundamental Rights of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Training of seafarers is crucial to attaining the appropriate safety levels in maritime transport. It is also vital to accident prevention. This is an appropriate opportunity to remind the Commission of the need to enhance the status of nautical occupations and make them more attractive to our young people. This would help achieve a reduction in unemployment and also improve safety levels in maritime transport. Parliament has long been calling on the Commission and the Council to take action in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">It is certainly the case that the training required within the European Union may not be imparted or may be evaded when seafarers from third countries are recruited for European Union vessels Such individuals are engaged because of the shortage of Community professionals and may well lack the necessary training.</p>
<p class="contents">The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs will raise four issues in its opinion. These are the retention of the option of a selective approach to the recognition of aptitude certificates, the introduction of a European certificate of conformity for these certificates, a time limit on extension of recognition and a Community procedure for withdrawal of recognition.</p>
<p class="contents">Much good work has been done by Mr Poignant, rapporteur on the content. This has facilitated progress on some of the issues raised. They must all be retained in the spirit of the changes as ideals for the future. This is in line with the aforementioned Article 31 and also with Article 37 of the Charter. Both articles are to be enshrined in the European Constitution and will become a binding part of it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would stress, and the reasons for this have already been emphasised, the importance of being able to recognise the qualifications of seafarers from third countries on the common bases of established qualifications, without fear of fraud; the need to simplify the procedures adopted thus far and turn to account the work of the Commission and the European Maritime Safety Agency, overcoming the difficulties and unilateral aspects of the procedures underway relating to individual certificates of capability.</p>
<p class="contents">Against the backdrop of these factors and the solutions proposed, which we support – and in doing so pay tribute to the excellent work of the rapporteur and the conclusions which have, at last, been reached through consultation with the Council and the trialogues held – stands the essential need to reduce by some means the level of human error contributing to risks of disaster, of maritime accidents which, as we know, have taken place in the past. There is something else, however: we are dealing with the adoption of a proposal for a directive related to the opening up of the market in port services, for example, which is intended to regulate competition opportunities linked to this development too, while rigorously safeguarding the requirements of safety, environmental protection and social protection and, therefore, in this case too, the indispensable requirements of training and professional qualifications for crew members, requirements which must be taken as the basis for authorisation procedures and also for private supply and self-handling measures.</p>
<p class="contents">For these reasons, it is of crucial importance to be able to depend on guaranteed minimum qualification requirements for crew members, whatever their country of origin. For the same reasons, I will make just one last point regarding the proposals that have been illustrated by the rapporteur. I refer to Amendment No 10, which gives crew members from third countries employed on ships flying the flag of the individual Member States equal conditions of access to qualifications and lifelong training processes. I believe that we must not waste this opportunity and that we must insist on a solution which I feel to be appropriate, which is that proposed by the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important to pay attention to training. More and more frequently vessels flying the flag of a Member State are being manned by third country nationals. This proposal makes it easier to recruit crew members from third countries, and for that reason we have to be very careful here as it could hamper the employment of trained personnel from the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">We must now, therefore, ensure that no untrained people are taken on to do these jobs and that crews have been adequately trained. That is why I support Amendment No 1, as well as Amendment No 4: issued certificates in particular must be made fraud-proof. Just imagine a ship which has a crew with fake papers and who perhaps cannot even read those fake papers! Then there is Amendment No 6 to consider: certificates do have to be made out in several languages because this again makes them easier to check and facilitates the work of the authorities. Regarding Amendment No 7, we should intervene when countries do not do enough to prevent the falsification of these documents and certificates. It is a violation of this agreement as far as the state in question is concerned. It has indeed been noticed that there are countries which do not do enough or do nothing at all about these fake certificates. That is why this is very important.</p>
<p class="contents">Just imagine the Gulf of Finland with 20 metres of pack ice and an untrained crew with no language skills and no help from a Russian icebreaker on a single-hull ship in winter in shorts. Can this spell anything but disaster? I hope the Commission will take this matter up with the utmost seriousness. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. This revision of an existing regulation for the recognition of seafarers from countries outside the European Union is, in particular, an improvement on the current situation. The assessment of training by the European Maritime Safety Agency against the training requirements laid down in the IMO treaty, under which approval is given to the third country in question for five years, is a good thing, as it will improve maritime safety in and around European waters enormously.</p>
<p class="contents">We are making direct use of the agency that we have just set up. It is extremely important to think the same things, to have recognisable rules, to have a recognisable language as far as possible. Many of the accidents at sea are, after all, not only the result of technical defects but are often the result of inattention; human error that could have been avoided if people had been more alert.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments that will allow us to use languages other than English as languages of communication in the maritime world seem to me to be undesirable. We need to try to follow other examples of uniformity in international language use. In aviation, for example, English is the right language of communication. Language was said to have been a problem when the Tricolor sank in the Channel, for example. One of the causes of the accidents that occurred after the Tricolor sank was a breakdown in communication between an English-speaking captain and the French pilot services. It is therefore vital that we apply the same recognition in the same language and that we are dealing with the same rules throughout the European Union, and indeed throughout the entire world. Mr Poignant, I think that it is a very good thing that you have formulated your report in these general terms and it is also in general terms that I will support it.</p>

Generally, it is a good idea to do what is stated in the rapporteur’s report and simplify the procedures for recognising certificates of competency from third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">I nonetheless believe there are a number of things it is important to bear in mind. Firstly, we must be 100% certain that the certificates to be approved in the EU come from recognised training institutions. The certificate must be a guarantor of the fact that the seafarer really has in actual fact undergone practical training. It must not just be a piece of paper printed in any old vending machine in some banana state.</p>
<p class="contents">Next, we must take a thorough look at the employment situation within the EU shipping industry. We must ascertain that satisfactory capacity has been built up in the training area so that we have the opportunity to offer basic and ongoing training to our seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also be able to guarantee that there is no social dumping from outside whereby European seafarers lose their jobs because of wage pressure. In that connection, it is important for seafarers in the candidate countries quickly to be put on a level with their peers in the present Member States so that they can receive proper wages for their work and so that we can avoid unfair competition.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall give an example of the way in which the subject we are discussing might have been significant in my own country. In the area I come from, a very serious accident occurred in which a ship leaked following a collision with another ship. It emerged that the crew members could not understand each other’s languages and could not therefore communicate. All in all, a disaster for the whole area. That is something we could have avoided by means of sensible rules, so I hope my fellow MEPs are paying attention. They are busier, however, having their cosy chats and what not. That being said, they may well be able to read what is subsequently put down in the Minutes.</p>

There have been almost sixty accidents this year, something that is almost inexplicable. Last month we were shocked to hear of no fewer than three serious collisions on the River Schelde to Antwerp. This is no longer a coincidence. It is clear that one of the main ways to prevent shipping accidents is to have a well-trained crew. All steps aimed at improving the quality of crews therefore deserve the support of this Parliament. My group was extremely satisfied with the speed with which the Commission launched the proposal to create a standard system for the competencies of seafarers. My group has also urged that an aspect of equal opportunities in terms of career development on board be included in this proposal. The Commission’s proposal must ensure that non-European personnel do not become second-class personnel. Much has been said about the quality and the social standing of crews and the impact that these factors have on the safety of shipping. We hope that an assessment report after the adoption of the amendments in the directive in question will clarify the relationship between crew training and the nature and number of shipping accidents. This could be the first step on the long road towards a truly European flag. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Globalisation has increased pressure on various parts of the sector. The cost of both building and operating ships has had to come down. Because of the impact of ‘cheap’ ships’ registers in particular, flag countries in the European Community have revised their package of conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the Western fleet has had to contend with a declining number of ‘indigenous’ qualified seafarers. In order to be able to meet the need for crew, a considerable number of seafarers are being brought in from outside the European Community. Each country has been handling this separately, resulting in a great deal of duplicated effort and a burden on the official apparatus. That is why, in principle, we are in favour of this proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">Coordinating the recognition of training and the associated certificates of competency centrally is a step in the right direction. There are, however, a number of things we must not lose sight of.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is important to make proper use of the maritime knowledge and workforce that is available in Europe. A change to the current arrangements must not result in personnel from outside the European Community excluding labour from the Member States from the market, with all the consequences that brings with it for the recruitment and training of new seafarers in the European Union. This should be properly taken into account when recognising certificates of competency from a third country.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, permits should not be the be-all and end-all of the operation. Training is the work of men and is susceptible to change. At regular intervals, both before and during the recognition period, it must be determined whether all criteria for the recognition have been met. If they have not, withdrawal of the licence must follow without mercy. It seems to me that there is an important role for the European Maritime Safety Agency in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, this proposal can eliminate a great deal of superfluous work but we must proceed with caution in enforcing and developing it. We can therefore support this proposal provided the abovementioned points are adequately covered. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Not only the increasing number, in recent years, of shipwrecks caused by human error, but also the increasing numbers of fatal collisions and of failures to report accidents, reveal both serious shortcomings in crew training and the absence of the basic culture of the very highest level of solidarity between seafarers.</p>
<p class="contents">At the present time, our fishermen carry out their work in constant fear of a collision with a merchant vessel. Such collisions have unfortunately become common along our coasts. We are also finding, and I am thinking in particular of the case of the ‘<span class="italic">Cistude</span>’, a French fishing vessel ripped apart exactly one year ago by the Norwegian cargo vessel the ‘<span class="italic">Bow</span> <span class="italic">Eagle</span>’, that the families of victims of accidents at sea are experiencing difficulties in obtaining compensation for the losses that they have suffered. In the case that I am thinking of, the failure to report the accident, which resulted in the deaths of several sailors, appears to have been punished by only a short term of imprisonment.</p>
<p class="contents">In effect, the recruiting of crews from third countries, which really means recruiting through Manning Agencies, which in some cases are more concerned with charging high levels of commission on the wages of the sailors that they supply to shipping companies than with checking their qualifications, should be regarded as a last resort. Any real efforts to prevent disasters in which the human factor plays a crucial role must therefore be organised around two main aspects rather than just one.</p>
<p class="contents">The first of these is the proactive aspect of the training of crews made up of nationals of Member States of the European Union, before we encourage and facilitate the recruitment of sailors who are nationals of third countries, which is what the present directive tends to do. We must ask ourselves some serious questions about the real causes of the current shortage of qualified sailors in the Union, and we must draw up a proactive policy in order to correct this negative development. This is why I believe that Amendments Nos 1 and 2, tabled by the Parliamentary committee concerned, are extremely relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of these preventive efforts concerns the absolute necessity of surrounding ourselves with as many guarantees as possible regarding the quality of training, and the effectiveness of that training, when foreign sailors are recruited by vessels flying the flag of a Member State of the European Union. Controls applying right up to the level of training institutes would be desirable, even if this is difficult, as Amendments Nos 12 and 15 suggest. A system of ongoing control in order to prevent the provisions of the directive from becoming fixed for a long period of time, as proposed by Amendment No 23, also seems to me to be relevant. Yet why, in a field which is chiefly concerned with safety, do we want, at any price, to remove responsibility from the Member States? The European Maritime Safety Agency will certainly be able to contribute useful expertise in assessing training, but why should such assessment of third countries be restricted exclusively to the Commission and the Agency? Finally, Mr President, why should we want to deprive Member States of the right to withdraw recognitions when they believe this to be essential for their own safety? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
