<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Hernández Mollar (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I think that during our debate in the House on 14 May I stated what we perceived as the positive and negative features of the agreement now before us.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe the recommendation I am presenting today on behalf of the committee I chair gives a faithful account of our views.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, it is important that these agreements serve as instruments for broadening the scope of the protection of fundamental rights. This should be in line with the concept developed by Europe on the basis of our constitutions and the jurisprudence of the courts at Luxembourg and Strasbourg. The European Union cannot base negotiations on standards lower than those it demands of itself. This seems obvious to us and we cannot agree to extradition or to cooperation in criminal matters if the death penalty or an unfair trial might ensue. Military tribunals are an example of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, these agreements can provide an opportunity for both parties to improve their respective procedures and even their legislation. The issue of data protection to be implemented on both sides of the Atlantic should be a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, no international agreement can make sense unless a reciprocity clause applies to both sides. We therefore call for the situation of those European citizens detained at the Guantánamo base to be resolved once and for all. My group does not wish signature of the agreements to be conditional on resolution. Nonetheless, we wish to state in the strongest possible terms that this situation must be resolved immediately.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, these agreements should also provide an opportunity to strengthen our internal legislation, making it more efficient. Existing arrangements between Member States should therefore take precedence. The European arrest warrant is a good example. These agreements should not compete with other relevant treaties such as that of the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, agreements as important as those signed with the United States must be monitored by the Council and the Commission. The agreements must also be monitored at parliamentary level by a joint committee comprising Members of both the European Parliament and the United States Congress. It is in both parties’ interest to set up such a committee as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to turn to the most sensitive issue, namely the procedure announced by the Council in the course of the most recent debate in plenary. We have failed to note a positive response to our request for formal consultation between the decisions on signature and ratification of the agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the first international European Union agreements based on both the second and the third pillar. Regular consultation of Parliament is therefore required for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">One reason is because consultation must be the norm for the adoption of acts pertaining to the third pillar, including acts that fall into the category of international agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Another is that parliamentary monitoring of this type of agreement is the rule in all Member States. Such monitoring must therefore be deemed a common principle, and the European Union is bound to take account of it pursuant to Article 6 of the Treaty of European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">For all these reasons we believe that consultation with Parliament is the only procedure that would comply fully with the principles of democracy and the rule of law referred to in Article 1(6) of the Treaty on European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me put a question to you, Mr President. Now that we are drafting the a new Constitution for Europe, how could we justify to the citizens of Europe that agreements impinging directly on their human rights might come into force without being reviewed by the European Parliament?</p>
<p class="contents">We feel that a Council decision to consult the Parliament concerning ratification of the treaties based on Articles 24 to 38 would be very much in line with the Treaty. It would also be entirely appropriate from the point of view of institutional policy, as has already been suggested by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we trust the General Affairs Council will change its stance in the light of these arguments. It can only be in its interest and that of the Union as a whole for it to change its attitude and avoid creating a serious democratic deficit. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking Parliament, in particular Mr Hernández Mollar, the chairman of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, for this report on such an important and sensitive issue. I welcome the fact that the draft agreements have been declassified and that the opportunity has been given to the European Parliament to examine them in parallel with the examination by national parliaments in the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">One must recognise that these agreements under Articles 24 and 38 are negotiated by the Council. The Commission is <span class="italic">not</span> the negotiator of these agreements in the external arena. Therefore, in this debate the Commission participates as it is associated to the negotiating process, but the Council of Ministers has the final word.</p>
<p class="contents">We would like to recognise the efforts made by the Belgian, Spanish, Danish and now the Greek presidencies to launch these agreements following the decision taken by the European Council after the events of 11 September 2001. On the basis of this authorisation, and the directives for negotiations that were adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council, the Commission welcomes the fact that this consultation procedure should be concluded in time to allow for signature by the European Union and the United States of America during the summit at the end of this month.</p>
<p class="contents">Pursuant to the authorisation given by the Council to the presidency to negotiate the agreements with the United States in April last year, the Commission assisted in the negotiations from the beginning, so it is particularly well-placed to appreciate the real difficulties experienced therein.</p>
<p class="contents">We understood that the Commission's role was to help to reach a positive result. Like Parliament, in its draft recommendation, the Commission is of the opinion that stronger solutions would have been preferable on a number of points covered by these agreements. I had the opportunity to have a constructive discussion on a number of the concerns raised by Parliament in the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, together with the Greek Minister of Justice. The Greek minister also discussed a number of these concerns in the debate that took place in plenary last month on the EU-US agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me stress that the United States side did not get satisfaction on a number of points of major importance to them and which were strongly opposed by the Union, such as the extradition of European Union nationals and the limitations of the political offence exception to extradition.</p>
<p class="contents">We now need to make an overall assessment of the result of the negotiations. One of the criteria for this assessment is the added value of a Union agreement compared with the situation that currently exists on the basis of bilateral agreements between Member States and the United States of America. This assessment has to be made taking due account of the fact that this is, as the President mentioned, the very first Union agreement in the field of Justice and Home Affairs, and it will be a historical precedent.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition to the incontestable advantages that the agreements on extradition and mutual legal assistance with the United States will bring in terms of concrete judicial cooperation in criminal matters and the fight against organised crime and terrorism, I would focus on the following, trying to address some of the major concerns raised by this Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding protection against the death penalty, the draft extradition agreement compares with the strongest anti-death penalty clauses that can be found in existing bilateral treaties, whether an agreement with a Member State or one with a candidate country. This means that as far as all the other bilateral agreements are concerned, this anti-death penalty provision is stronger in the current European Union agreement than in the vast majority of others. In addition it allows the invoking of all grounds for refusal available pursuant to a bilateral extradition treaty between a Member State and the United States, and will open the possibility of consultation in the event that constitutional principles or final judicial decisions binding upon a requested state may impede the fulfilment of an extradition. This provision, combined with specific references in the recitals to individual rights, fair trial and an impartial tribunal, offers significant guarantees.</p>
<p class="contents">I would insist that Member States be bound by the European Convention on Human Rights and its protocols. Nothing in these draft agreements should lead to decreased compliance with these international obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also my deep conviction that the European Convention will conclude positively on the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the future constitution, thus giving it a legally binding and constitutional status.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards Article 10 of the draft extradition agreement, and in particular the situation of an extradition request that conflicts with a European arrest warrant, a Member State confronted with such a situation of conflicting requests shall take into account a number of criteria in order to take a decision that widely corresponds to the lists of such competing requests already provided by the framework decision creating the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">The designation of the competent authority is left to the requested Member State. This can be a judicial authority unless the existing bilateral treaty between the Member State in question and the United States foresees an executive authority.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, the final wording of the agreement drafted very recently at the last negotiation session has improved in the sense that it better underlines the fact that the framework decision on the European arrest warrant could be amended in the global context of further European Union integration. This might in turn lead to the adaptation of the agreement with the United States in line with the natural evolution of the legislation on the European arrest warrant.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding data protection provisions, the relevant provision in the draft mutual legal assistance agreement with the United States is modelled on the two most recent European texts: the European Union's Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters of 2000 and the Council of Europe's Convention on Cybercrime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As has already been mentioned, this is the first time that extradition and legal cooperation agreements have been concluded between the European Union and a third country. Closer cooperation between the United States and the European Union is also to be welcomed, since this will make the fight against international crime more effective, as well as providing appropriate protection for our democratic societies, our common values and our citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I add my voice to those critical of the secrecy surrounding the negotiations, and of the Council’s attempt to classify the text of the agreements as confidential, thus excluding Parliament. This attitude is incomprehensible, since we are dealing with something which is going to have a direct impact on the fundamental rights of our citizens. Fortunately, the Council reconsidered this absurd and unacceptable classification.</p>
<p class="contents">Overall, we support the two agreements before us, but there are certain aspects which it is essential to safeguard. Firstly, the treatment received by the United States in relation to the European arrest warrant must never be the same as the treatment given to Member States of the European Union, since the US is subject neither to Community law, nor to the Convention on Human Rights, nor even to European data protection legislation. Secondly, any request for execution of a European arrest warrant or for attendance at the International Criminal Court should take precedence over requests for extradition to the United States. Thirdly, there should be a guarantee that extradition to the United States cannot take place if the defendant could be sentenced to death, or tried in exceptional or military tribunals. Fourthly, there should be an explicit reference to Article 6(1) of the Treaty on European Union, as well as to the European Charter on Fundamental Rights. Fifthly, a demand for effective and proportionate data protection provisions, to guarantee, at the very least, the same level of protection as that provided by the Council of Europe Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope the necessary guarantees will be made in these areas when the agreements are signed at the European Union-United States Summit on 25 June. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is the first time the European Union has negotiated an agreement of this nature in its own right. A precedent is being set. In my view therefore the concerns raised by the Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs concerning the conduct of negotiations and approval of the agreement are entirely justified, and I support his views. I believe Mr Hernández Mollar has done good work. I would also like to congratulate him on his presentation, on what he was explaining to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding content, I think it would be very positive to come to an agreement with the United States. It is however impossible to disregard the differences between our two systems. In particular, it is impossible to disregard the death penalty. The reservation on extradition is therefore quite clear. I believe the situation concerning legal cooperation is less clear, and consequently find Article 9 inadequate.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not think it is reasonable either that a request submitted by a Member State should not take precedence over one submitted by a third country, as stated in Article 10. I also have problems regarding the United States position on the International Criminal Court. The same is true of other European states. I believe the text of the agreement should make it clear that a request submitted by the International Criminal Court takes precedence over one submitted by a third country. It would be ridiculous for this not to be the case when the European arrest warrant takes precedence even over a Member State’s request.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to revisit the issue of the political wisdom of signing the agreement without dealing with the situation in Guantánamo. I do not believe it would be wise to do so. Accordingly, I shall support the view that signature should be conditional on finding a solution to a problem affecting many European citizens. We are actually unaware of how many of our citizens are being held in Guantánamo together with citizens of other countries around the world. I find the situation quite unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">I very much hope that the Member States and Community institutions will really pull out all the stops. <span class="italic">Habeas corpus</span> really is a basic right. It is enshrined in all the conventions. Politically, we simply cannot enter into a special agreement with a third country that continues to hold people in these conditions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Often in the field of law enforcement and intelligence different agencies are jealous of their patches and prerogatives, reluctant to share information because knowledge is power, and bureaucratic requirements must be examined critically. However, it is another matter altogether to justify brushing aside legal safeguards, defendants' rights and privacy concerns in the name of the war against terrorism.</p>
<p class="contents">We have objections to these agreements on grounds of both procedure and content. As others have said, the degree of unwarranted secrecy imposed by the Council has been utterly scandalous. I am sorry to see that the Council is not here today. No adequate explanation has been given. The only possible explanation is the wish to avoid accountability to Parliament. The failure to consult the European Parliament formerly is a disgrace, and the justification for this democratic deficit – that the agreements fall under foreign rather than justice policy – is thin in the extreme. I very much hope the new EU Constitution will stop this ever happening again because we will have future agreements of this kind. I wish the European public could understand – and one day they will – that the real threat to their rights comes not from this Parliament or the Commission – the Community institutions – but from the arrogant, executive powers wielded in intergovernmental cabal by the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I just hope Commissioner Vitorino is right that the preamble and the text will ensure that no extradited European citizen or resident will face the death penalty, and that no European will end up in Guantánamo Bay without charge or without trial or will face a military tribunal which has the power to impose a death penalty without appeal. I also hope time will prove that the Member States' obligations to the International Court are not compromised, because otherwise there really will be outrage in the European public. We must solve the disgrace of Europeans in Guantánamo Bay before ratifying this agreement. I do not have the confidence in the Council that I have in Commissioner Vitorino. I am sorry the Council is not here today to hear our objections. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Problems arising as a result of greater police and judicial cooperation are being glossed over for political reasons. Greater cooperation does of course enable us to catch wrongdoers more effectively, and that is a good thing. However, this cooperation has to be subject to strict conditions regarding the rights of suspects, because, otherwise, people’s trust in the authorities is undermined. We must make sure that we do not shoot great holes in our rule of law in order to please the Wild West.</p>
<p class="contents">My concerns regarding the legal system of the United States extend beyond excrescences such as the death penalty and Guantánamo Bay. My concerns go to the heart of the US system. Upwards of 92% of all convictions are based on plea bargains. This means that, in more than 92% of cases, evidence is not examined, but, rather, punishments are negotiated with suspects driven by the fear of absurdly severe sentences. That is not a fair process, and indeed I welcome the reference in the resolution to the European Convention on Human Rights, because that prescribes a fair process.</p>
<p class="contents">Another positive aspect of the report by Mr Hernández Mollar is that it emphasises that there are alternatives to the extradition of European nationals to the United States, particularly with regard to crimes committed on European soil. The United States just passes the evidence against a suspect on to the competent EU Member State, then we can try our citizens according to our own traditions, with our own guarantees, and people can serve their time close to home. That is what I would call a testament to constructive cooperation between equal partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also, however, suffers from a most curious naivety.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we conclude legal agreements – or even discuss the law – with a state, the United States, which has no concept of or respect for the law, for the very notion of the law? How can we contemplate extraditing our nationals to a country, a state, which does not obey the same legal conventions as us, or does so less and less? That is the question asked by this report. For, in the final analysis, we are negotiating with a state which enforces the death penalty, and to which we are thinking of extraditing our nationals; a state which does not respect fundamental human rights, particularly in relation to anti-terrorist legislation; a state which submits ever more cases to its military tribunals, so that we may perhaps see our own nationals judged by a US military tribunal; a state whose personal data transfer legislation is in flagrant contravention of our laws. Ultimately, we might ask ourselves, in view of all this, why we pass laws on these matters, and on many more besides, if we are then to put ourselves into the hands of a state which deliberately breaks those laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly and most importantly, this state behaves like an ancient tribe, kidnapping our nationals, imprisoning them without even taking the trouble to charge them (I am thinking, of course, of Guantánamo Bay, but I believe there are other examples) and even, in all probability, indulging in a few acts of torture, sadly far from the prying eyes of any journalists.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, the state in question does not respect the law, and, in my opinion, we do not have to honour any legal ties, or at any rate judicial or penal ones, with it. I doubt, however, that the European Union will be capable of taking a firm stand, since it has sprung this trap with its own hands and behaves towards the US with a type of passivity which will sooner or later end up by leading us into ruinous situations. I might add that we are seeing the first signs of some examples of this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has not been an easy task. If we are to understand the importance and, above all, the scope of the agreement, we must remember what prompted this initiative. It was not the emotion immediately after September 11 so much as the urgent need, following those tragic events, to create a network to monitor and combat the terrorist organisations operating throughout the world. To quote the resolution adopted by Parliament in December 2001, any agreement on judicial and police cooperation signed by the European Union must respect the Convention on Human Rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The primary concern – as has already been said – is not to permit the extradition of prisoners who would be liable to face the death penalty in the United States. Now, without prejudice to this principle, I cannot see what other concerns there might be. We feel it would be excessive in any case to presume to make the implementation of this agreement conditional upon an undertaking to do something about the situation at the Guantánamo base. We can demand clarity and transparency from the United States with regard to what is happening at that base, but we must not hinder the progress of an agreement whose effect is much wider than that, which is, in other words, in the interests of world security, not just US security. That is why we voted against the amendment on Guantánamo in committee, seeing it as a separate issue which can, if necessary, be addressed on its own. As for accusing the United States of being a country which fails to respect human rights, all I can say is I would not want to be the council for the prosecution. We must remember that the United States was the first genuine democracy to be created in the world in the history of civilisation. My opinion is that some views are to be considered to be decidedly partisan.</p>
<p class="contents">The agreement is a major step forward in combating not just terrorism but financial crime, the drug trafficking multinationals, money laundering, cyber crime and the trafficking of human beings too. These may appear to be unrelated issues, but they are, in actual fact, linked by the urgent need for resolute, timely, unconditional action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

(PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, Mr Vitorino said at the beginning of this debate that it is important and sensitive legislation. Nobody would dispute that. Equally nobody would deny that in today's climate there is a need for strong international cooperation, sharing ideas, thoughts, data and intelligence. But I hope that Council will look at the report of this debate and will not use this legislation to ride roughshod over accepted values and practices in the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Hernández Mollar, the rapporteur, said that we cannot accept standards lower than those we would demand ourselves in the European Union. Mr Coûteaux a few minutes ago echoed these ideas. I believe that we are not just talking about Europeans – we are looking at the fundamental rights of people in the United States too. A number of Members in this House have serious reservations about that, and that is why we are concerned about some elements in this piece of legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">President Bush has promised that the United States will always stand firm for equal justice. If that is true, he and others must call an immediate halt to the practice of executions in the United States. Over the last 25 years over 840 people have been executed following many of the murders in the United States. Murders are carried out equally by white people and black people, and yet some 15 times as many black Americans have been executed as white people. Black people are often tried before all-white juries, so we should have great concern about any Europeans being extradited to the United States and we must question even more the whole American legal system that allows that.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point regards Guantánamo Bay, Camp Delta, a kind of US-run gulag for foreign captives held indefinitely without being charged. Mr Santini says we should leave that to another time. Mr Santini, your PPE-DE Group voted against this in committee, and you represent the Christian Democrat party. I have looked at all the details of Guantánamo Bay and I cannot see that it satisfies any Christian or democratic principles. I am surprised that you voted against it in committee. I hope you will think again when you come to vote on it in this vote today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">These questions cannot yet be answered in the affirmative, in my opinion. That is partly due to the procedure followed. Commissioner Vitorino said that this is the first Union agreement. It is a milestone, but milestones require a different procedure. Back-room discussions, confidential documents and a lack of appreciation of the European Parliament and the national parliaments – that is not the stuff milestones are made of. The fault for this lies entirely with Europe. The Justice and Home Affairs Council deserves to be graded an emphatic ‘unsatisfactory’. It beggars belief that here in Europe we have to fight for fundamental democratic rights such as parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">The subject matter of the agreement also raises a lot of questions. In itself there is nothing unusual about this, but, that being the case, one has to be able to discuss them. For example, who ultimately takes the decision on extradition: the judges or the Ministries of Foreign Affairs? Who is extradited? How do we deal with the system of plea bargains? Mrs Buitenweg went into detail about that. For example, an in-depth analysis of the impact of the recent Homeland Security Act on data provided by the Union or its agencies is lacking. There is a risk of undermining the International Criminal Court. There is still no clarity as regards legal aid or the use of data for other purposes.</p>
<p class="contents">Then there is the point about Guantánamo. Various speakers – Mr Hernández Mollar, Chairman of the Committee on Citizens’ Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, in particular – have spoken wise words on this subject. Something really has to be done about this.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, this is an agreement that cannot just be rushed through. The Council started in plenty of time, but has systematically had its back turned to both the national parliaments and the European Parliament, in contrast to the United States, which at least still consults its Congress.</p>

The agreements should provoke protests from any serious politician specialising in the law. These agreements represent the current low point in the development of the EU’s legal policy. In the Nordic countries, specialists in the field thought that the low point had been reached with the two framework decisions concerning the European arrest warrant and measures for combating terrorism, but matters are now still worse. Note that the only professional investigation implemented by the institutions of the EU concerning these crucial issues of legal policy are open to serious criticism on the grounds of principle due to the fact that, in the context of the rights that are a crucial part of our democratic basis of values, the EU’s acts violate a range of basic principles in the fields of criminal law and procedure.</p>
<p class="contents">We are concerned here with what is termed the EU network of independent experts in basic rights which, on 31 March of this year, issued a comprehensive report on, as they put it, the balance between freedom and security. Has anyone within the EU system attended to the criticism by the group of experts that the acts compromise legal certainty? Definitely not.</p>
<p class="contents">As I say, these agreements make matters still worse. The EU system and the Member States will now, in the first place, accept the extradition of citizens of the Member States for criminal prosecution and imprisonment in the United States, which is a banana republic in terms of legal policy. Quite a few speakers have referred to the scandal in Guantánamo Bay, where EU citizens are being detained and mistreated under circumstances that decisively violate international law and basic legal principles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is incomprehensible that an agreement can be entered into with a juridico-political banana republic. The American investigation services will, moreover, subsequently be permitted to operate within the Member States. A year’s secret negotiations were conducted in advance and, as the Council put it, protecting the Council’s negotiations was a more important interest than democratic scrutiny. Can we sink any deeper? I also refer to the minority opinion on the report, which I have been a party to issuing on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly there is reason to go on the offensive against internationally organised terrorism and internationally organised crime by means of cooperation. However, the question facing this Parliament at this moment is: have the conditions under which this cooperation is to take place been satisfactorily fulfilled?</p>
<p class="contents">I think that Parliament – through the voices of the Chairman of the Committee, Mr Hernández Mollar, and very large numbers of fellow Members – has indicated the minimum conditions which are required by Parliament and which really must be fulfilled. For example, there must be no cooperation with exceptional or military courts, and no extradition if this could lead to the death penalty. Parliaments must be consulted on the procedure for concluding the agreement and regarding the scrutiny of its implementation.</p>
<p class="contents">I have heard quite a few questions, and I concur fully with these, for example regarding the unilateralism which is displayed by the United States in its foreign policy and which may result in extraditions, too, displaying a unilateral aspect, and in European countries having very little to expect in return. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The report rightly supports the two agreements, but the tone of the resolution with regard to the United States is too critical. It is true that the legal systems of the EU Member States and the US are different, but the US, too, is a democratic nation that safeguards human rights. The sense of moral superiority exuded by the resolution and this debate, too, is therefore inappropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I should like to say a few words about<span class="italic"> </span>democratic scrutiny, another target of criticism in the resolution.

The European Parliament’s message is: the draft agreements must not be concluded unless the Council removes some fundamental objections on the part of Parliament. I continue to hope that the Presidency will duly take these objections into account, as, after all, it is obliged to do on the basis of the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">It is the first time that the EU as such is concluding an agreement with a third country regarding judicial cooperation in criminal matters, but it is setting a bad example. In future, the Council should involve the elected representative bodies of the Member States and the European Parliament in the negotiations at an earlier stage. The texts of the draft agreements have been kept secret for too long. That is inadmissible, especially as fundamental civil rights seem to be squandered under the pretext of the United States’s fight against crime. Stating this fact has nothing to do with a sense of moral superiority or anti-American sentiment. The administration of justice in the United States does not provide sufficient guarantees for the rights of suspects. The negotiated procedures common in criminal proceedings mean that it is not precluded that suspects may be convicted although innocent, or convicted on insufficient evidence. This situation is exacerbated by the new legislation and practices in the United States since 11 September. If the European Union wishes to take its own legal protection seriously, it must only conclude the two agreements with the United States once the guarantees called for by the vast majority in Parliament have been incorporated into them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has to redo its homework, and it is an illustration of the weakness of the democratic system in Europe that the Council has up to now been able to take the liberty of ignoring the views of the elected representative body – but of course we are not stupid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to ask two questions. Given that the death penalty still exists in the USA, even if we conclude an agreement that would prevent it from being carried out, the problem remains: the death penalty is counter to our values.</p>
<p class="contents">Given that, if crimes are committed, there is a hierarchy between US citizens, who cannot be tried before the International Criminal Court, and European citizens, who can be extradited to the USA in order to be tried before the US judiciary, such discrimination is also counter to our principles. The case of the Guantánamo Bay prisoners is the most flagrant illustration of the fact that the USA does not respect fundamental rights, insofar as it has brought these men before special courts and completely violated their right to defence. They are suffering degrading, inhumane treatment, counter to international law and to the universal declaration of human rights. In these conditions, do you truly think it possible for the Union to accept extradition to the USA of any individual, regardless of their nationality?</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, what guarantees do we have that the USA will in fact respect an agreement signed with the Union, when it does not respect its international obligations, ignores international law, and considers itself above the law and entitled to take unilateral decisions as shown in its attack on Iraq? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

No one wishes to see them repeated, but it would be almost as tragic to see them exploited for the purposes of violating fundamental human rights and guarantees of legal certainty by which, as EU citizens, we are normally protected.</p>
<p class="contents">As the minority opinion rightly points out, the agreements between the EU and the United States do not merely contain dubious measures for combating terrorism; the agreements are a slippery slope towards extradition and legal cooperation on criminal matters generally. According to the agreements, European citizens who are alleged to have committed a crime carrying a sentence of at least one year may be extradited to the United States – a country that, as many have pointed out, practises the death penalty.</p>
<p class="contents">In no way can I support the thinking behind these international agreements, and I am therefore voting against the report, but I should like to call for support for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It would be good if the Commission and the Council were to pay attention when the European Parliament gives advance warning, especially on such important issues. Perhaps the Council's only justification for not being here would be if its President-in-Office were locked away somewhere reading the Amnesty International report for 2003, which tells us that the big threat to rights today are the measures being taken by the United States at global level on the pretext of 11 September in the aim of undermining and withdrawing citizens' democratic and other rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The case we are examining now in connection with the agreements on judicial cooperation and extradition is an export from the United States of restrictions on rights, notably on the question of the death penalty. The United States are exporting them to us and we, with no shame whatsoever and, unfortunately, with a Greek Presidency, are importing them under these agreements.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask Commissioner Vitorino to give us his opinion. Commissioner, as long as you are here and are not yet Secretary General of ΝΑΤΟ, why in your opinion in Article 13, which refers to the question of a request for a person who may face the death penalty to be extradited, does the agreement read: ‘the request for extradition <span class="bold">may</span> be denied’ by the European Union to the United States of America rather than ‘<span class="bold">will</span> be denied’?

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Vitorino,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. Mr President, in this debate the Commission acted like an <span class="italic">amicus curiae </span>because it was not the negotiator, it assisted the successive Council presidencies in their negotiations. Therefore, I will just try to clarify some of the points raised and give the Commission's opinion on those points.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall begin with Article 13. I shall try to make myself clear. The US-EU agreement is a bilateral agreement that regulates the relationship between the European Union and the United States of America. It does not regulate the relationship between the Member States of the European Union among themselves or the obligations that Member States have under other international legal instruments. All the Member States have subscribed to the European Convention on Human Rights and to the specific protocol that forbids the death penalty. This means that, acting in accordance with their international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, Member States will refuse extradition where the death penalty is concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">That does not derive from an obligation between the European Union and the United States of America. It derives directly from the obligation of the Member States to be in line with the European Convention on Human Rights, with the protocol and, I hope, with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union that will have constitutional status and be legally binding after its inclusion in the new Constitutional Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the International Criminal Court, I would draw your attention to the fact that Article 10 of the agreement does not apply to the International Criminal Court because that court is not a state and Article 10 only regulates the criteria to be used when there is simultaneously, in regard to a same person, a conflicting request by a third state – like the United States of America – and by a European Union Member State. It does not deal with requests from the International Criminal Court. Therefore, nothing prevents the Member States from deciding what they want to do as far as a request from the International Criminal Court is concerned, irrespective of any bilateral agreement with the United States of America.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the European arrest warrant as such, I can even agree with Parliament. However, unfortunately, the Council did not adopt the Commission's proposal on the primacy of the European arrest warrant. Therein lies the problem. We are not talking today about a fully comprehensive primacy of the European arrest warrant over any other request for extradition. It does not exist. The framework decision on the European arrest warrant already recognises that when there is a demand under a European arrest warrant and a simultaneous demand for extradition by a third country, there are a number of criteria that will have to be taken into consideration in order to decide which demand has primacy. So we are not changing the legal system of the European Union. The Commission regrets that this primacy was not recognised in the past when the Council adopted the European arrest warrant. However, today this primacy does not exist and therefore cannot be affected by the terms of a bilateral agreement with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">What we were careful to say was that the possibility of recognising in the future the primacy of the European arrest warrant could not be undermined or limited by this kind of bilateral agreement. There is a specific provision on the revision of this kind of bilateral agreement with the United States in case we decide to recognise the primacy of the European arrest warrant in the future. I hope that sooner or later we will do that.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the matter of special courts. It must be said that the key issue for me – and I have always said this to Parliament – is not the nature of the court, it is not the question of special courts as such – even some Member States have special courts in the European Union. The question is one of due and fair process and guarantees, so that extradition is only granted where there are guarantees that the requesting Member State will follow a due and fair process. There are two recitals in the agreements that address this issue. The first one concerns due regard for the rights of individuals and the rule of law; the second one concerns the guarantees and the respective legal systems which provide for the right to a fair trial of an extradited person.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, there is Article 16a on non-derogation, which in paragraph 1 maintains all grounds for refusal relating to a matter not governed by this agreement available under a bilateral extradition treaty in force and which in paragraph 2 calls for consultation where the constitutional principles of the requested state may pose impediments to the fulfilment of its obligation to extradite. In my interpretation, everything that might be considered as a demand for extradition to a court where the rule of due process is not respected can give leverage to the application of this Article 16a on non-derogation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I sincerely hope that in the future Constitution we will have specific provisions not only on consultation of Parliament concerning these kinds of agreements, which will become more frequent in the future, but also concerning the competence of the European Court of Justice to guarantee the full compliance of these agreements with the future Constitution of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
