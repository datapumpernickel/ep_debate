In this document, the Commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in Europe. This objective deserves our total support.</p>
<p class="contents">Expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the European Union, after agriculture and the Structural Funds. The various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various Member States. Relatively few women, however, are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies. It is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the European Commission. The Commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at Community level, especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, which is quite obviously something I approve of. The goal for the years to come is to increase women’s participation to achieve a rate of 40% female participation in the Marie Curie grants, in consultative assemblies and in evaluation panels for the whole of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to do so, it will be necessary to improve discussion and the sharing of experience among the various Member States, to set up a coordinating body to implement a ‘Women and Science’ monitoring system within the fifth framework programme for research and technical development, specially responsible for gathering and disseminating statistics collected in the implementation of the framework programme for research and technical development regarding the rate of women’s participation in research activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, like the rapporteur, I think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields. Improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles.</p>
<p class="contents">We will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy. The European Parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development.</p>
<p class="contents">We must incorporate the gender factor in science, research and all other European Union policies, in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is very good, and we are pleased to see it.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the European Union. We know that we can change this situation, in which women are underrepresented in the science sector, only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and, when they have obtained their degrees, by means of positive measures at the professional level.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said this, some of our fellow Members clearly have qualms because the report by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities which we have voted on contains one point which may lead to confusion and is interpreted by some as a quota stipulating that there must be 40% female participating in research in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic. Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">To set my fellow Members’ minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women’s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal. And why should we not note that the Commission’s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women’s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes? </p>
<p class="contents">It is not a quota! It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States. The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes. People must realise this! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career.</p>
<p class="contents">This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally’s report, namely women’s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit.</p>
<p class="contents">By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the European Parliament chose to vote on a text that expressly resorted to the quota policy which my report for an opinion had attempted to denounce in no uncertain terms, and in spite of the general approach which I approve for the most part, I can do no other than abstain from the vote on Mrs McNally’s report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here, in my opinion, the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies. This cannot be a good thing in a European Union where we are ever mindful of employment.

I think that the vote has shown that although the common position of the Council has been toned down, the major groups here (and above all the German delegates of the major groups) have not, thank God, succeeded in destroying the heart of the directive, namely manufacturer responsibility. Unfortunately, there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy, i.e. through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years. We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous Community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made. Here, unfortunately, the European Parliament has bowed to the interests of industry.</p>
<p class="contents">I am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles. I found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and I am pleased that it failed, that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large Member State did not gain a majority, by which I mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the European Parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Neither can we fix what the age for a vintage car should be as there are very great differences from one country’s statutes to another’s.

<p class="contents">There are, however, two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction? We must all ensure that it is not always the same person, i.e. the vehicle owner, who pays. He or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle, which is a bottomless pit in financial terms. We have recently had cause to talk about the ‘polluter pays’ principle. We should apply this principle rationally and calmly, correctly targeted and without ideology.</p>
<p class="contents">Another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope. One might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point, but I feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts.</p>
<p class="contents">So let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry. These old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by Europe, if we are not to water down each of our specific identities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no lack of examples amongst European texts, and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision. I only need to mention the case of Directives 79/409 and 92/43. The precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not the job of the MEP to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena. That would not be fulfilling our mission. On the contrary, we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There are few things more certain in life than taxes, death and pollution. However, there is also nothing more certain than EU environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to pollution, like sin, we are all against it, but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good. In fact, this directive, like so many others addressing environmental issues, is not good. As is so often the case, it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem, which will only serve to create more jobs for officials, and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money. The one thing it will not do is solve the problem – it is a massive sledgehammer to <span class="italic">miss</span> a nut.</p>
<p class="contents">No one, not least my party, could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged, but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market, not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity. Thus, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles, to encourage private sector recycling companies, through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements, and to incentivise the use of recycled materials.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, these are areas where the EU does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction. However, in the absence of these powers, it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure. Instead, it should leave Member States to develop their own systems, and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one Member State do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the European Union. Until now, the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the Union of non-Community workers have been very harsh. </p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the European Union is being made easier, even when they are nationals of third countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another Member State when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence. This means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the Member State to which they were posted. This means that this proposal’s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services.</p>

<p class="contents">Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits.</p>
<p class="contents">The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there.</p>
<p class="contents">According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned. Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals.</p>
<p class="contents">While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion. That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading!</p>
<p class="contents">Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards. I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems. This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched? The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter.</p>
<p class="contents">Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:</p>
<p class="contents">On 1 January 1995, the Council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in Article 17 of the Accession Treaty of 24 June 1994.</p>
<p class="contents">In May 1995, during the preparatory phase of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the CFI, concerned about the persistent increase in the volume of cases, was already insisting on the need to take measures ‘without which the Court would soon cease to be able to fully satisfy the principle of the proper administration of justice and to fulfil its assigned role … in conditions likely to compromise the protection of parties subject to trial.’</p>
<p class="contents">So what was done at Amsterdam? In that respect, nothing. On the contrary, extending the Community’s legal competence within the framework of the third pillar has increased the burden. You will agree, furthermore, that the texts adopted by this House always call for Community jurisdiction, and that includes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights which is currently being drawn up.</p>
<p class="contents">The increase in the number of CFI judges from 15 to 21 and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases <a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> are not real solutions but mere decoys, grudgingly granted, which we have become aware of after the fact. </p>
<p class="contents">Consequently, these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake. They represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred. We cannot agree to this, since such a sidelong shift towards a Europe of the Judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our States. </p>
<p class="contents">The time has come, we feel, for in-depth consideration of how to put the Community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice. This question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity. Is the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference not the ideal opportunity for this?</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution. It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria.</p>
<p class="contents">The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference. The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission’s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States.</p>
<p class="contents">Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament. People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system. In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making. Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision. This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions.</p>

It is crucial for us that it should be possible for this Intergovernmental Conference to be concluded before the end of the year 2000 so that there are no remaining formalities, such as the weighting of votes in the Council of Ministers and the composition of the Commission and the European Parliament, which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the EU. We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December. An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process. That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension.

Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government. In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals. It is therefore easy to understand the public’s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them. In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets. Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda.</p>
<p class="contents">All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers’ main claims towards the highest common denominator.</p>

The text is overambitious, and Britain’s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the “Amsterdam left-overs” in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these. There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions. Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties. In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are.</p>
<p class="contents">Our priorities (i.e. the “left-overs”) must be:</p>
<p class="contents"> - the number and responsibilities of Commissioners</p>
<p class="contents"> - weighting of votes in the Council</p>
<p class="contents">- extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and <br />Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended</p>
<p class="contents">Beyond this, we have concerns that the “flexibility” or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present. The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott. What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples.</p>
<p class="contents">Whatever Jörg Haider’s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this. In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period. Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The party led by François Mitterrand, decorated with the emblem of Marshal Pétain’s Vichy government, the party whose leading lights have just been caught red-handed once again, living a life of luxury on the public funds embezzled from the students’ mutual insurance company.</p>

Finally, I abstained on the vote for a number of reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">I was in sympathy with the EDD Group amendment, talking about rejecting the interference of the EU in the formation of governments of Members States but I had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia, racism, etc. and I felt that it might be misinterpreted. However, I do wonder about the wisdom of this.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that. I also wonder about the wisdom of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the government in Austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there. At the moment it seems that the Haider Party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments. Even America has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations. We wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it. I really think that people should be extremely cautious.</p>
<p class="contents">If you want to combat xenophobia and racism, and I believe that we should, we need to look at the root causes. We need to look at the people who vote for these parties, and understand why this situation arises. It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I passionately defend Europe’s heritage of human rights and the rule of law. I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency – the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately – which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States.</p>
<p class="contents">This is not the way to fight extremism. It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good. The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered. There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties. </p>
<p class="contents">What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference? A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer? We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria.

<p class="contents">Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse. Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government. He has led efforts to end provision for Austria’s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics. They are wrong. European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights. Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections. However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy. There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition. Leopards do not change their spots. The real culprits are Austria’s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">By staunchly and speedily denouncing the participation of Jörg Haider’s xenophobic and anti-European party in the Austrian government, a situation without precedent since the second world war, the European Union has come into its political birthright and has confirmed that it is not merely an economic and financial Community, a large market, a “Europe of shopkeepers”. It is a part of its future which is at stake right now, part of its very essence, its heart and soul.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament was the first to speak up. The appeal by the European Socialists, on the initiative of Olivier Duhamel, raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation. A firm attitude which the 14 European States have demonstrated unanimously and promptly, through Mr Guterres, by condemning the risk of the Austrian political situation getting out of control.</p>
<p class="contents">This courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of Europe. A return to the roots, at last, for a Community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events. However, as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will, since the sanctions stipulated under Article 7 of the Treaties are virtually impossible to apply, will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure?</p>
<p class="contents">The whole credibility of Europe is at stake today, before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow.

<p class="contents">It is intolerable that the EU should involve itself in the formation of the government in a Member State. It has no right to do so. Instead of prematurely condemning the FPÖ and the Austrian Government which is being formed, there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition. Only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of Europe. This does <span class="underline">not</span> mean that we sympathise with Haider. The CSU European delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the FPÖ. However, as politicians we must ask the question why 27% of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPÖ at the elections in October 1999. We must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results. Only by tackling the arguments and policies of the FPÖ can we prevent a radicalisation of Austrian politics. However, the resolution of the European Parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the Austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem. For these reasons the CSU European delegates are against this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is with these phrases that Albert Camus, at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the close of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism, “the brown plague” as it was termed at the time, could not enjoy a definitive victory. That because racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and rejection of what is different, have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity, they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings.</p>
<p class="contents">In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic. For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country. Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control.</p>
<p class="contents">As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, “In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!” This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist.</p>

The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism.</p>
<p class="contents">The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism. It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further.</p>

<p class="contents">I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as “Europe's scapegoat” (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive. Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime. However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents. The EU must not do him an invaluable PR service.</p>
<p class="contents">The strength of the FPÖ can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the Austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility. It was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the FPÖ to tolerate a minority government and, obviously in vain, offered the Freedom Party ministerial posts, that the SPÖ begin its massive campaign against Haider. It turned its threatened loss of power into an “heroic battle for the preservation of values” and an imminent, pure-and-simple “decision between democracy and non-democracy”. This is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which I cannot condone.</p>
<p class="contents">We German Christian Democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them. We revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic, xenophobic and anti-minority. Today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments.</p>
<p class="contents">The German approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again. It cannot be copied arbitrarily since each Member State has its own specific conditions. The ÖVP (Austrian People's Party), whose presence at European level we have also come to take for granted, is daring to attempt a coalition for the sake of governability in Austria. It can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government. This condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the Austrian Republic.</p>
<p class="contents">Sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye. We must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left. I would have liked to see the same outrage in Europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the DDR. In the meantime, they have been forming governments in German federal states. I fully support the statements made by Commissioner Prodi in today's session. He spoke of the task of not isolating Member States but of doing everything to unite them in common European values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">– First of all because the separate votes that we requested have not been adopted. Nor have certain amendments, which taken together would make the text more consistent and meaningful.</p>
<p class="contents">– Secondly, because the resolution that has just been adopted is self-contradictory: on the one hand, in recital D, it recognises that the EU and its institutions’ insistence on promoting and defending European democratic values <span class="italic">implies</span> that it recognises the integrity of the democratic rights and constitutional prerogatives of the Austrian State and people. On the other hand, it takes the liberty of agreeing, and even congratulating itself in paragraph 4, on the political intent of the statement by the Portuguese Presidency. To our mind, this was nothing more than a hurried, ill-considered and illegal interference in the result of the free exercise by the Austrian State and people of their democratic rights and of their constitutional prerogatives.</p>
<p class="contents">– This is how we view the matter and this is the third reason for our vote, because the results of the free and democratic exercise of the Austrian people’s right to vote are not being considered or respected. At least they should not be prejudged, which is what is happening here. In fact, this resolution and all similar statements do not show the slightest consideration for the will expressed by the electorate of a Member State of the European Union. In addition to this, we are opposing – in the name of tolerance, funnily enough – the formation of the government which this result makes possible. Nor are we allowing it to <span class="italic">prove</span> the intentions and political ideas that it has repeatedly stated, in the face of the accusations to which it is being subjected.</p>
<p class="contents">This resolution still allows the positions of those we seek to condemn to be strengthened as a result of this manipulation and victimisation, and I regard this as foolish. Ultimately, this sets a very dangerous precedent within the EU itself which can only lead to further undermining the climate of confidence and mutual respect that must exist between nations and citizens who want to pursue a common path, in a spirit of equality and respect for national sovereignty. This even applies to those who, like us, are poles apart from the racist and xenophobic views which seem to be spreading across Europe, but who prefer to oppose them by decisively attacking their root causes.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party. Including Jörg Haider’s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries. The Austrian People’s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice.
