It is an area that is important not only for ourselves here in Europe but also for the rest of the world and, in particular, for our partners in the developing countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As you must be aware, the Protocol we are to debate today is linked to the European Community’s recently implemented ratification of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The overarching purpose of this UN agreement is to establish common rules for the transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms with the objective of creating global protection of biological diversity and human health.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union must fulfil its international obligations. We must therefore incorporate the provisions of the Protocol on Biosafety into our legislation. This proposal supplements the Community’s existing regulations, particularly on the issue of the export of genetically modified organisms, so that it is in greater accordance with the provisions of the Protocol on Biosafety.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal consists of the following main parts. Firstly, the obligation to give notice of exports of genetically modified organisms intended for deliberate release into the environment. Secondly, the obligation to inform our international partners about the Community’s methods, legislation and decisions concerning genetically modified organisms, as well as about any unintentional release of such organisms. Thirdly, a set of rules to be used for identifying genetically modified organisms for export. These rules are in accordance with the latest developments within Community legislation on genetically modified organisms and, in particular, with the provisions of the draft regulation on traceability and marking.</p>
<p class="contents">The present proposal contains no new special Community provisions concerning imports by one Member State from another, or movements between Member States, of genetically modified organisms. Such imports or movements will, in the future too, be covered by existing Community legislation. I would emphasise in no uncertain terms how important it is for the work on this proposal to proceed swiftly. The EU has played a key role in the international negotiations right from the beginning. We must show that there is <span class="italic">no</span> doubt that we shall fulfil <span class="italic">our</span> commitments and that we shall be able to implement the Protocol in full as soon as it comes into force. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Protocol is based on the precautionary principle and respects the right of states to have stricter national rules governing the trade in genetically modified products. The Protocol is an important example of the way in which global trade regulations can be based on environmental and consumer protection. It constitutes a positive alternative to parts of the World Trade Organisation’s practice.</p>
<p class="contents">With the adoption of the proposed law we are now debating, the Cartagena Protocol will become EU law. While existing EU rules would apply to imports, the proposed law would regulate exports from the EU. It is a matter of urgency that the rules be adopted. The number of countries ratifying the Protocol is increasing, so that it will soon be possible for it formally to come into force. By adopting this legislation, the EU can become a positive global example in this area. We in Parliament should like to cooperate closely with the Commission and the Council to ensure that these laws are made ready as swiftly as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I believe that the Commission’s proposed legislation has quite a few weaknesses. In important areas, the proposals do not go as far as the Cartagena Protocol itself, and in other areas the proposals create an unnecessary lack of clarity. I and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy therefore propose tightening up on a number of points. It must not be possible to export seeds or products not approved for use within the European Union. Only for reasons concerned, for example, with the climate, will it be possible for seeds to be exempted from this rule. We cannot have one set of safety and consumer protection measures for ourselves, and another set for others. In order for products to be approved for export, the importing country must be required expressly to have approved their importation. It must never be possible for a failure to respond to be interpreted as authorisation, as it in actual fact could be under the Commission’s proposed law. That especially applies to countries with limited technical capacity in this area, for it is crucial to ensure that they genuinely recommend the imports and are able to handle them. The actual exporter shall always be responsible for notification. That is important in order to prevent a lack of clarity where the matter of responsibility is concerned. It is also more in line with what is in actual fact prescribed by the Cartagena Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">In the continued negotiations within the framework of the Cartagena Protocol, the European Union must support proposals for international regulations explaining companies’ legal responsibilities. The public’s right to information about what is exported must be both clarified and reinforced, at the same time as respect for legitimate company secrets is maintained. EU regulations must also make it unambiguously clear that exports to other countries must always respect the stricter rules which these countries are entitled to introduce, and this in full accordance with the Cartagena Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore hope to see the adoption of as large a proportion as possible of the amendments by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as of the amendments tabled jointly by the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and the Group of the Party of European Socialists. I also wish to thank the responsible Commission officials for their very helpful cooperation. I would also thank my colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Protocol aims, by applying international rules to trade in living GMOs, to prevent effects detrimental to biodiversity and to human health. It governs the safe transfer, handling and use of genetically modified organisms, placing the emphasis on their movement across borders. For this there is to be a procedure involving the prior informed consent of the importing country. In the case of GMOs intended for immediate use as foodstuffs and feedingstuffs, or for processing, it envisages notification to the Commission or to the Biosafety Clearing House.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation's provisions will apply only to export to third countries outside the European Union. Community law already applies to imports into the European Union and to trade between its Member States. The future EU Regulation should be as strictly as possible in accordance with the Protocol's requirement, in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucracy and for uniform international standards to create legal certainty. It must, at the same time, be ensured that European export businesses do not, as a result, face formalities additional to those with which they must already comply when exporting to third countries. The report that Mr Sjöstedt has presented has, however, largely lost sight of the aim of maintaining biodiversity. Of the many demands contained in it, some, on the one hand, go far beyond what the Cartagena Protocol requires, whilst others attempt to artificially restrict trade in living GMOs.</p>
<p class="contents">I see it as inexpedient to incorporate into the Regulation requirements relating to traceability and liability, as these issues are currently being debated in the course of a separate legislative procedure and therefore do not belong in this Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Protocol takes for granted the exclusion of GMOs exported for use in closed systems from the complicated and expensive notification procedure. No such provision is present in this report, or in the Commission proposal. That is why I, along with Mrs Sommer and Mr Purvis, am reintroducing the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee's Amendment No 50, which we ask you to support. It is my conviction that GMOs used in laboratories and not released into the environment represent no danger to biodiversity or to human health, and should therefore be excluded from the notification procedure. Our Amendment No 51 calls for further derogations from the notification procedure in order to avoid unnecessary bureaucratic hurdles hampering trade in GMOs. Moreover, the Regulation must follow the Cartagena Protocol as closely as possible in order to create greater legal certainty for international trade.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted an exporter a license, and GMOs in respect of which the importing country has already granted a license for field trials, need to be capable of being exported without expensive approval procedures. Dual notifications make little sense, as they result in more bureaucracy and far from greater safety for people and the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need is sensible and practical rules in order to make good use of biotechnology's chances in third countries while maintaining biodiversity.</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sommer (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(DE)</span> Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Mr Sjöstedt, for the good work he has done on this report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on biosafety. As the Commissioner has repeatedly observed, he has obviously studied the original document with great care, and this has enabled him to add even greater precision to certain items in the Commission proposal, which is in any case essentially a good one.</p>
<p class="contents">The implementation of this Protocol has mainly to do with seeking something long overdue, namely rules for EU exports of living GMOs to third countries, and in this practicability is of the utmost necessity. We have to bring into being a realistic and usable piece of legislation. It is precisely for this reason that I consider it wrong and, indeed, damaging for us to want to use this report on the implementation of the Cartagena Protocol to intervene in ongoing legislative processes. By this I mean the proceedings relating to genetically modified foodstuffs and feedingstuffs and their labelling and traceability. It was only a few weeks ago that we debated their first reading and had a plenary vote on them. The decision was a close-run thing, in other words, there were divergent opinions, and we are at present waiting to hear what position the Council takes on this.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal for a directive on environmental liability is also only now being debated in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, with little prospect of any decision on it, which means that anything this report lays down on the issue of liability for the traceability of GMOs and additives must be emphatically rejected. These issues have nothing to do with the transposition of the Cartagena Protocol into Community law, and so I have decided to bring in a number of requests for separate voting in order to correct the result of the vote in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, which I believe to lack objectivity. Nor initially did the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development take the right approach, in that it, in its opinion, sought to extend the derogations from the documentary and information procedures for living GMOs in transit and in closed systems to organisms genetically modified for the purposes of research and development, that is, to field trials under Part B of the Release Directive 2001/18.</p>
<p class="contents">This was however, in my estimation, more of an inaccuracy, or rather a misunderstanding, as such a course of action would not be justifiable in terms of ethics or morals. This is, in any case, about living GMOs, as yet at the research stage, and thus not guaranteed to be safe. If we allow GMOs that are not permitted within the EU to be exported to third countries for the purposes of field tests – that is, for the purpose of their release into the environment – and do so without the possibility of their being monitored, then we are acting irresponsibly. I say this precisely because I am an advocate of green genetics, as I am sure will have become abundantly clear in discussions to date in this House on the Release Directive and on draft regulations, traceability and the labelling of genetically modified foodstuffs and feedingstuffs.</p>
<p class="contents">A derogation from the requirement for documentation of living GMOs intended for release in third countries would mean that we were helping to send research into a lengthy foreign exile outside Europe, whether the EU's moratorium remained in place or were lifted, as it would be, in every instance, much simpler to engage in research anywhere other than in the EU. We must see to it, though, that we make research within the European Union possible again and move it forwards, an incidental consideration being that we will then be able to monitor what it is up to.</p>
<p class="contents">I am therefore, together with my colleague Mrs Emilia Müller, introducing two new amendments on behalf of my group, namely Amendments Nos 50 and 51 to Article 4, which have already been mentioned. The first of these amendments seeks to restrict derogations from the documentary and information procedures to GMOs in transit and in closed systems. This is where we really need these derogations in order not to hamper research, and I am convinced that fear of possible mishaps in this area, such as those that might result from containers fracturing in transit, is exaggerated. Were it not so, I would not dare cross the street, get into a car, or board an aeroplane, as the possibility of an accident is always present, even if its likelihood is minimal in the extreme.</p>
<p class="contents">The second amendment has to do with a derogation from the information procedure for exports of GMOs to a third country, where this third country has already granted approval for release to another country in respect of the same GMO. These derogations are necessary, as the use of the so-called AIA – Advanced Informed Agreement – as an information procedure in this instance offers no greater security and thus makes transborder movement unnecessarily difficult. I hope you can follow my line of reasoning, and, of course, therefore ask you to support me with your votes.</p>

<p class="contents">I think it important that the developing countries in particular be protected against the harmful effects of what is often the aggressive marketing of GMOs, with their possible serious consequences for people’s health, especially if we wish to conserve biological diversity in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">Certain points in the Commission’s proposal for a regulation are not perhaps entirely clear, but that is something I think is largely remedied by Mr Sjöstedt’s report and a number of the amendments tabled. In this context, I shall just highlight the essential features.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, I think it crucial that we help the developing countries develop the administrative capacity and expertise needed if they are not to be crushed by multinational companies with unlimited marketing resources available to them.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, it is important for the precautionary principle to be established. In relation particularly to the developing countries, it is absolutely crucial that doubts about the harmful effects on biological diversity in the countries concerned should really be taken seriously, and it is also crucial that the legislation apply both to GMOs released into the environment and to genetically modified food and animal feed.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I think that Mr Sjöstedt is right to emphasise, and table proposals about, the fact that it is not enough for exporters to give notice of movements of GMOs. There should be actual approval on the part of the authorities in the recipient countries, organised in such a way that the absence of a response from these authorities could not of course be interpreted as a tacit acceptance. I think that this should apply to all movements, and not only the first, since the recipient country should have the opportunity to monitor the spread of GMO products in its territory.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also good that only products approved by the EU itself should be exported from the EU area.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would add that it is very important for the EU countries to apply tough and uniform sanctions so as to avoid a situation in which certain countries visibly get away, or almost get away, with disregarding the legislation while others do not. A state of affairs ought not to arise in which there is more incentive in some countries than in others to contravene the legislation on transboundary movement. I think that by adopting Mr Sjöstedt’s report and a number of the amendments tabled also on Mr Sjöstedt’s initiative, we shall see the Cartagena Protocol implemented fairly and consistently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Biosafety and biological diversity are crucial and it is therefore essential that we should ensure that the Protocol becomes EU law. Do we, however, assume that it is sound as it stands, or would we like to use this opportunity to make an exception and be more rigorous than the Protocol?</p>
<p class="contents">If it is the intention to implement the Protocol, that is what we should do, and it is important, in my view, for the sake of scientific research in the EU, not to close off the EU unnecessarily in one way or another from the rest of the world or make the work unnecessarily more difficult than in the rest of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Genetic engineering is a ground-breaking discipline and strikes me as very useful. As with all technologies, of course, the question is how it is employed. In addition, I believe that trade is necessary and boundaries need to be crossed so as to allow scientists to do their research. This is quite simply how science works, and as far as I can see, science hinders this research as little as possible. We must do what is needed and leave out what is not needed. Accordingly, I am of the opinion that we should implement the Protocol and that the report contains a few elements which are not conducive to this process.</p>
<p class="contents">Further to discussions on the GMO reports which were held a couple of weeks, or even months, ago, I have already pointed out that I personally have a problem with traceable and non-traceable products, in other words, things which can, and cannot, be discovered. We have no intention of re-entering the debate, as it has already been held, but my group will definitely be endorsing Amendments Nos 51 and 50. This topic has been discussed among the Christian-Democrats. When restricted use and transit are at issue, the Protocol provides for an exception. I can therefore not see why we cannot do the same.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, if the receiving country has already admitted GMOs, it is beyond me why we should re-apply for the same product to be imported and duplicate all the paperwork. These are unnecessary restrictions, in my view. It is, of course, true – and this is something I welcome – that we should provide the developing countries with as much information as possible, allowing them to be able to reach a sound verdict.</p>
<p class="contents">What matters most is that we transpose the Protocol into EU legislation, but just as important is for the European Union not to become an island where little or no research may, or can, be carried out in this technology, which could be very useful in my opinion, both to us and to the people in the developing countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

My speech will focus on what we believe to be the most important aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The report proposes stricter control of the transboundary movements of genetically modified organisms, not in order to distort trade – as has been said here – but in order to preserve biodiversity, the health of the population and the citizens’ right to choose.</p>
<p class="contents">It also proposes that the principle of caution be duly applied – and it is not always applied as it should be – and the cooperation of the Commission and the Member States with those third countries that do not offer a sufficient guarantee to be able to decide. The report supports international regulations and measures which are stricter in terms of responsibility and compensation for possible damages. It will not be possible to export genetically modified organisms unless there is written agreement from the receiving countries.</p>
<p class="contents">There is an issue which we know is controversial and which is going to cause difficulties: the export to third-world countries of genetically modified organisms which are not accepted in the European Union. We had this same problem last year with the Directive on the marketing of safe products, or unsafe products, when the amendment we requested to prevent the exportation of organisms or products to the third world which are not accepted in the European Union was not approved. I believe it is morally unacceptable that genetically modified organisms which are not accepted in the European Union can be exported to the third world.</p>
<p class="contents">We are asking for a restriction of confidential information, we demand more transparency in order to respect the citizens’ need for information.</p>
<p class="contents">There are certain amendments – as Mr Sjöstedt has said – which have been signed by three political groups in this House, which we support in particular, but I am going to refer to Amendment No 54, which we feel is important since we are in contact, above all, with the people of Latin America, and which relates to the socio-economic aspects resulting from the effects of genetically modified organisms on the protection of biological diversity and their impact on indigenous and local communities. Recently, in this very House, indigenous Mapuches from Chile defended this very notion, diversity. We cannot endanger it through exports – which are dangerous from a health point of view – of any genetically modified organisms which we do not accept here.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, we believe that the report by Mr Sjöstedt does not have any interest behind it, either economic or from any particular lobby, other than the defence of health, of biodiversity and the citizens’ right to choose. Since we were not able to prevent the more or less uncontrolled proliferation of genetically modified organisms, let us make the control of this cross-border movement and respect for the Cartagena Protocol a message from this Parliament to those people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my opinion, he has done a splendid job, above all because he has dared to go beyond the minimal standard laid down by the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">I do think that the way we vote on this in Parliament has to set a milestone, and – as the lady who spoke before me said – must make it clear that the protection of biodiversity and of the public has pride of place, but that so too does the freedom of choice of what we term third countries, to which we export. It has become clear from the latest reports from, and the latest difficulties with, the United Nations, with African States, especially Somalia – countries who have, as it were, a gun put to their heads and who are told to eat or die, countries where the hunger of people in these countries is exploited as a pretext for forcing them to buy genetically modified foodstuffs – that we are dealing here with a real lack of free choice. I cannot do other than urge the Commissioner to take a firm line with the USA, and I want to take this opportunity to beg you not to bow down before the USA's threats, but rather make it abundantly clear that we will not give way on this. Most of all, though, we must not lift the moratorium, for, as you will be aware, only one Member State has transposed the Release Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Both a rule on liability and a satisfactory rule on labelling are a long way off. We have to focus on that. By this report and this vote, we have to show that we are in a position to close the gaping loopholes that are still there in the Cartagena Protocol. I want particularly to highlight food aid and the export of foodstuffs, where we must not yield to American pressure by denying these countries what they want, but must make clear that they have to be informed about these matters as well. Here too, what matters must be our refusal to trample on the right of consumers around the world to decide what they eat; above all, our vote must send a clear message that we cannot export to other countries a risk that we are unwilling to take ourselves. That was our experience with Eastern Europe, but especially with the Third World. We cannot simply move the risk elsewhere, but must make it our concern that the standard be enforced in Europe and that we avoid research that would not even be carried out here turning these countries into hazardous areas. We must not misuse these countries for the purpose of research that is full of risks. To do so would be not just an offence against safety; we would also be trampling human rights underfoot if we were to exploit these countries for the purposes of research that we find too risky.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Sjöstedt has, though, already addressed the importance of our finding a truly satisfactory solution to the issues of liability and labelling. We have to fashion liability into a tool to get industry to deal with this issue in a more responsible manner, and so I would reiterate my plea to the Commissioner that she should, in her closing statement, enlarge on her view of UN food aid and what she plans to do about the moratorium until such time as we have sorted out these criteria, of which we would remind the Commission too, in a satisfactory way. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The argument that the development of genetically modified organisms helps solve the world food problem should very much apply in practice. The stories of the so-called terminator gene, which prevents the growth of descendants, are very worrying indeed. It is my hope that abuse and improper practices can be prevented by duly complying with the Protocol. The European Community and the Member States have already made a first step in the right direction with regard to the imports and exports of GMOs, namely by endorsing the Cartagena Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">We are now facing the next step, which is transposing the Protocol into clear-cut legislation, for which Directive 2001/18/EC and pending legislation on labelling GMOs should serve as a basis. I am therefore of the opinion that the present regulation governing the international trade in GMOs should be completely in line with this. In other countries too, people have to be aware of any safety risks before they can decide to accept a batch of GMOs. They also want to know whether the level of protection, safe use and biological diversity can be guaranteed. Moreover, I can imagine that those countries too set great store by freedom of choice, a value so cherished in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">The Treaty of Rotterdam on the imports and exports of chemical substances shows up similarities with the present legislation. Both treaties are based on the sound guiding principle that imports can only take place if the importing parties have been informed beforehand and have subsequently accepted. I consider this to be an excellent guiding principle. Another gain is the fact that developing countries can obtain help and information on GMOs. In this way, use can be made of expertise on GMOs that is present elsewhere in the world. Needless to say, it is up to those countries what they do with this information. We must also accept that countries may take more far-reaching measures in order to achieve a higher level of protection. Whether they are within the EU or outside it, countries must have the option of going further than the Cartagena Protocol.</p>
<p class="contents">The present text helps the Member States to make every effort to prevent unintentional transboundary movement of GMOs. Mr Sjöstedt's report therefore receives my warm support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today, we are discussing the transboundary movement of these goods that are quite unlike any others. Will our next step be to pass legislation on cases involving the accidental release or the unintentional risks of GMOs? I am, of course, being ironic. But this surely marks just the beginning of long series of debates which, we must admit, sometimes take on a surreal quality.</p>
<p class="contents">We approve of the direction of the proposal for a regulation on the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol, but we would like to point out the paradoxical aspect of the process. This agreement is designed to provide the necessary legal framework for the transboundary movement of GMOs, but, at the same time, it acknowledges the contradictory notion of unintentional transboundary movements. It is evident that such provisions enable situations of scientific uncertainty to be dealt with, an approach that the countries of the South do not have the resources to undertake as impartially as ourselves. Moreover, during the vote we took in July to set a threshold of 0.5% or 1% for the adventitious contamination of GMOs, did we show impartiality? Furthermore, are we not going round in circles at the moment in the Agriculture Council, with regard to the proposal on genetically modified products intended for animal feed? Which procedure should be chosen to authorise these products? Must we lay down a permitted level for non-deliberate traces of GMOs that are unauthorised but are considered to be safe?</p>
<p class="contents">The Community has decided to play a leading role in the sale of biotechnology, but the approach is entirely paradoxical: even though neither the safety nor the danger of GMOs has been established, it is already being presumed that they will be extremely successful on the market. It is also true that the Commission has started to ask that the moratorium be lifted. The protocol does indeed leave the Member States a great deal of discretion, based on the precautionary principle. Yet, the Sjöstedt report reduces this room for manoeuvre. We must remain vigilant and remember that Community law uses the precautionary principle as it sees fit and that, when the States wish to take advantage of it, it is suddenly placed well out of reach. The current French embargo on British beef is a worrying illustration of this.</p>
<p class="contents">It is up to the Member States to ensure that scientific uncertainty is not transformed into a futile problem of social uncertainty in the face of the risks, or even to lay the foundations for an acceptable co-existence of GMO and non-GMO cultures. We are not closing the door on biotechnology or their transfer, but we wish to voice our reservations concerning a text which is merely a weak link of a shaky legislation thrown together in piecemeal fashion and which shows no hesitation in putting the cart before the horse. We are therefore choosing to abstain from the vote on this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our coordinators were led to believe that there would be insufficient time to prepare an opinion before the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy finalised its report. In fact, this process took quite a lot longer than originally planned and there would have been sufficient time for the Committee on Industry to have given an opinion. An opinion from that committee ought to have been regarded as essential – in fact it is arguable that the Industry Committee should have been the committee responsible for this report.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal will have a substantial impact on the European Union's biotechnology industry, on the EU's research programme and, in particular, on the priorities of the Sixth Framework Programme for Research. It also impacts on our trade in GMOs and in genetically modified research material with both developed and less-developed countries. The Commission proposal adds undesirable restrictive requirements beyond the internationally agreed Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, but the Environment Committee's suggested amendments go drastically further. It is essential that in our vote today we radically change the direction of this report. I am only sorry that, coming late to this matter as I did, there was insufficient time to introduce all the changes and separate votes I would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">Why is it such a problem? These additional restrictions and bureaucratic requirements will only discourage investment in life science research in Europe, and further encourage the investment in research to transfer to other areas with more favourable legislation outside Europe. Our scientists will go the same way as the research investment. Have the Commissioner and the rapporteur any concept of the damage this is likely to do? Did they give any consideration to the ambition expressed at Lisbon for Europe to be the most dynamic and competitive knowledge-based economy in the world? This proposal does not restrict imports into the EU of GMOs for contained research, but exports of public and private GM research material to third countries will be subject to yet further and disproportionate regulation. This proposal runs diametrically contrary to the EU's life science and biotechnology action plan. Was there any coordination or consultation with the Commissioner for Research and the Council of Ministers for Research? It is quite appropriate that the Commission should propose, and Parliament and the Council approve, the requirements of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, but we should go no further. If we do, we will jeopardise our life science base for the future, our scientific community, the whole Lisbon strategy and Europe's future as a dynamic knowledge-based economic power in the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I call on Parliament to vote overwhelmingly against Mr Sjöstedt's report in all its critical aspects and, in particular, to support Amendments 50 and 51, which will at least mitigate the extent of the damage this proposal and report are likely to cause. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The MEPs to the right claim that we can apply the Protocol to the letter, but if we do, we must do it properly. At the same time, we must ensure that science can carry out its research unhindered. Those are the goodies. The other side of Parliament is represented by those who are always frightened of God knows what and who want to impose restrictions on everything.</p>
<p class="contents">This is the wrong way to view the situation. It should be viewed within the framework of the general debate surrounding GMOs, in terms of the consumer's right to freedom of choice and of the precautionary principle. We still have no 100% certainty about this technology. We must therefore ensure that at least the consumer has the choice. This must be included in the Protocol. This is also what we should now have the courage to vote in favour of. I therefore wholeheartedly support the rapporteur's political courage and his observations. I hope that tomorrow's plenary will adopt the same stance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to add to what colleagues have said in thanking him for his work. I also welcome the fact that the Committee on the Environment expanded the regulation to cover food and feed which have been produced from or with the aid of GMOs, as well as GMOs intended for contained use.</p>
<p class="contents">The report shows that whilst the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety is a good basic framework for regulating the transboundary movement of GMOs, this is a minimum, a base line from which parties can and should be proactive in aiming for ever higher standards of control to meet the demands of the consumer. This includes, as many colleagues have already mentioned, the right of freedom of choice. We are only too aware of the recent examples of food aid to developing countries being cynically used to force GM food on people, to promote GM food and to force countries that have declared themselves GM-free to accept GM grain. This includes countries such as Zambia, Mozambique and Zimbabwe which have all taken a stand against the untested and unproven nature of GMOs and it is totally unacceptable that these are being forced upon them by countries such as the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union, in cases such as this, buys local non-GM food, adhering to the principles and the rules of the recipient countries in a manner in keeping with the ethos of the Cartagena Protocol. On the other hand, in the past two years Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Ecuador have all been forced to accept GM food aid even though this was contrary to their national regulations.</p>
<p class="contents">I welcome the committee's report which clearly allows for countries to take more proactive steps to ensure international biosafety. It is an important step forward in the whole GM debate and the report has my full support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

He is indeed right that it would have been a good thing to have had an opinion from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, but we, the European People's Party members of the Environment Committee, whilst of course representing the interests of the environment and of consumers, also represent the interests of business. We all stand for an environmentally responsible market economy. We know that protecting only the environment while ruining the economy is no use to consumers. With us, Mr Purvis, the environmentally responsible market economy is in safe hands.</p>
<p class="contents">Austria ratified the Cartagena Protocol this year, depositing the instrument of ratification with the UN in New York on 27 August. We know that some Member States see ratification as dependent on the passing of this draft EU regulation on the implementation of this Protocol. This gives us all an interest in this draft being passed quickly.</p>
<p class="contents">Allow me, Mr Sjöstedt, to comment on some of the amendments, for example Amendment No 6. The Regulation addresses only the Community, so that it is quite unnecessary, and, I think, irrelevant, to speak of ‘any other Party’. Like some of my predecessors on the floor, I think that the Protocol should cover only living GMOs, and that anything else would be wrong. The area of liability and compensation is also, of course, very, very important and crucial, but on this we should wait for the outcome, which we expect to bring with it traceability and labelling. It would, after all, be absurd for us now to insert some provision or other, and then engage in long-winded discussions on a quite different regulation, or another directive, on traceability, labelling and liability.</p>
<p class="contents">I rejoice in the knowledge that the Danish Presidency has as one of its objectives a Common Position at the Environmental Council on 17 October, following the conclusion of the First Reading stage in plenary, which is planned for the end of September. We look forward to 17 October with great interest and wish the Danish Presidency and ourselves all the best for it.</p>

Many of our rules affect imports and exports, and this brings with it a dual responsibility. We must ensure that we do not compromise in the area of safety and at the same time, we must resist the temptation of imposing unnecessary restrictions on third countries and European exporters. I should like to thank Mr Sjöstedt for the courage with which he has negotiated this narrow path.</p>
<p class="contents">Where biotechnology is concerned, there is in this Parliament a strong need to send a message to the rest of the world. The message is that biotechnology is controversial, possibly even dangerous and undetectable. The consumer must therefore be informed of GMOs. I have no problems with sending out this message within the European Union, but we must refrain from applying it in the context of the Biosafety Protocol, which is about safety. In the case of non-detectable GMOs, safety is not an issue. If the importing country does want this notification, then this should naturally be supplied. However, this is completely unrelated to safety, and this is why we do not actually need Amendment No 30.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we continually need to send out our message, but we should realise that forced evangelisation does not work. The world is certainly not waiting to be patronised by Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In his explanatory statement, Mr Sjöstedt states that the EU must play a leading role in legislation in the field of biotechnology, but we should realise that we have long given up our pioneering role in this respect, in which we could give the world much more. Unfortunately, with regard to biotechnology, Europe is trailing behind. Hardly any GMOs are being exported, at the very most products produced by means of them. Cheese and olive oil are prime examples of this.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to ask the Commission a question. What will be the implications if this report were to be adopted? Would this increase the EU's deficit? What would be the additional administrative burden for exporters, and what would be the economic implications of this? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Cartagena Protocol is designed to create a framework for international trade involving GMOs. It is based on two important principles, firstly the precautionary principle and secondly the principle according to which countries that want stricter rules are entitled to have them. Certain speakers here today seem to believe that the Cartagena Protocol is something quite different, aimed at facilitating trade as much as possible. The Cartagena Protocol is, however, an agreement on biosafety.</p>
<p class="contents">The precautionary principle must be the guiding principle. There is no other way. It is therefore crucial for the European Parliament to vote in favour of Amendment No 52, which is also supported by the rapporteur. This states that transboundary movement of genetically modified organisms should proceed ‘in every case and at each stage on the basis of the precautionary principle’. That is something we must not go and lose.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague, Mrs Evans addressed another important point, namely the ethic that permeates the Cartagena Protocol and that is based on the requirement for countries that do not want to produce or consume GMOs in any form to be entitled to refuse them. Aid consignments containing GMOs, as discussed at the Johannesburg Summit, must not take place. We must help bring about a situation in which no compulsion is felt to receive such consignments.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Wallström explained that there is no doubt that the EU must fully comply with the Protocol. In this situation, I doubt if it would further the Cartagena Protocol if the European Parliament were to accept Amendment Nos 50 and 51, or if the content of these were to be complied with for, in that case, it would not be possible for the Protocol’s intentions to be put into practice. I therefore recommend that these amendments be rejected, for their purpose is to ensure that trade is impeded as little as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The reason that the Cartagena Protocol came about is that GMOs and trade require special precautionary measures. We can never have too much safety. On the other hand, we <span class="italic">can</span> have too little. There must be no doubt that, in Community legislation, it is the precautionary principle that applies and that it applies in full. I support this report in its entirety. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Therefore, please will you forgive me my customary digression, for I cannot stop my flights of fancy. Yesterday, I met a GMO wandering about between borders, who said to me: ‘Why have you got it in for me so badly? Yesterday, while I was wandering between borders, I went to Naples. I saw the beautiful Gulf of Naples, Vesuvius and Mergellina. It was absolutely beautiful! Then, a little further on, still by the sea, I saw a horribly ugly, uninhabited area where there was a steelworks that had been deserted for 10 years. The area was called Bagnoli. Why do you not do something in Europe to enhance the environment in this area near Naples? There you are, you see, wandering from one place to another I have been useful: I have seen an area where you, as Europe, might be able to do something to enhance the environment. Why, then, have are you so against us GMOs? Even we have our uses. Are you sure you are aware of our full potential? Therefore, be more flexible in allowing the genetic modification of organisms which are useful to the human race.’ </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, I wish to thank both my colleagues and Mrs Wallström for the viewpoints that have been put forward in this debate and that I think provide quite a clear picture of the lines of demarcation.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that there are a number of factors that should be borne in mind where this protocol is concerned. The first is, of course, that we are concerned here with minimum regulations. We <span class="italic">must</span> comply with what the protocol requires of us, but we <span class="italic">may</span>, according to the protocol, go further if we wish. That is the situation that applies. It also, of course, means that other countries around the world may go further than the protocol requires. What I state in the report is that we shall respect this. We require of our exporters that they respect the Cartagena Protocol and so, too, the legislation that other countries may adopt and that may go further than the European Union’s. If we did not, we should in practice be acting contrary to both the spirit and the letter of the Cartagena Protocol. I believe there is no question of our doing that.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, we should be aware that the Cartagena Protocol is in the process of development. Regular negotiations are under way. Quite a few areas of the Protocol have still not been clarified. It is just the general thrust of it that is being delineated. Other areas <span class="italic">have</span> been clarified. We must therefore bear in mind that we need a policy that is far-sighted and that shows the general direction in which the EU wishes to develop the Cartagena Protocol in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely this to which the regulations on liability relate. We are not concerned here with the EU’s liability legislation, which we are in the process of debating elsewhere. What is at issue is Article 27 of the Cartagena Protocol, which says that we must begin to negotiate internationally concerning liability where this type of product is concerned. As a Parliament, we support the Commission and the Member States in campaigning, in future negotiations within the framework of the Cartagena Protocol, for a global system of liability which would of course favour the serious actors in this area. It is a system of this kind that is required.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to the amendments, I believe that Amendment Nos 50 and 51 seriously weaken the report by aiming to remove important areas from it. Amendment No 50, in particular, actually goes against the Cartagena Protocol. We cannot adopt that amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to ask those who regard GMOs differently from myself to reflect for a moment. We naturally form different judgments of what is possible and different assessments of the risks that this technology may involve. Irrespective of how we regard the future of this technology, I think there is something we must bear in mind, namely that we must have a system of rules under which the companies that operate in this area are credible. Is a company credible if it exports to countries that have not given their permission? Is a company credible if it exports to a country that has not been able to respond to the request for permission? I believe that an industry that acts in this way disgraces itself. We do not stand to gain, and nor should industry stand to gain, from rules that lead to what is in actual fact the bypassing of countries’ right to say yes or no to would-be imports.</p>
<p class="contents">Next question: are we credible if we export to others what is not good enough for ourselves? Are we credible if we export what we have rejected, for example for reasons that have to do with environmental safety, biological diversity or consumer protection? Of course we are not. Even someone who takes a very positive view of this industry – complicated though it is, with both advantages and disadvantages – ought to appreciate that it is in everyone’s interests to have comprehensive, credible regulations. If the European Union accepts these regulations, they will have an effect not only upon ourselves and our exports, but also upon the world as a whole. They will show that the major global players too take this issue seriously and are prepared to assume their responsibilities. It is with this in mind that I have prepared this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I want to begin with a general comment. The Commission is, and remains, very active where the issue of biotechnology is concerned. As you know, we have presented a communication on how we should make use of biotechnology. We are actively working on our internal Community legislation in this area, partly by revising Directive 2001/18/EC on traceability and marking, and we are also working on the issue of liability for environmental damage. It is constantly a question of striking this delicate and difficult balance between, on the one hand, exploiting the advantages of a new technique, a new technology and new knowledge in this area and, on the other, preserving biological diversity and, most importantly of all, protecting people’s health. I believe that this proposal is in line with Community legislation and that we are still being ambitious. I was myself involved in the negotiations in which the EU was the party pushing to guarantee the introduction of international regulations. I believe that we are achieving that balance in this area too. It is also true, as Mr Sjöstedt points out, that there will be further negotiations and work in a number of areas with a view to shedding more light on a number of important issues.</p>
<p class="contents">If, finally, I may now offer my views on certain of the amendments in order to clarify the Commission’s attitude, I will begin by commenting on Amendment Nos 30 and 57 which cannot be approved because they go against the proposal on traceability and marking by extending the proposal also to include food and feed manufactured with the aid of GMOs. It is important for different legal acts on biotechnology to tally.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 5 and 47 deal with the important issue of capacity development in developing countries but contain no mechanisms for putting this into practice. The Commission believes that this is an important issue but that it can better be dealt with in a more suitable forum, for example the European Development Fund.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment Nos 7 and 45 relate to the issue of environmental liability, and the Commission again believes that this proposal is not the right instrument for getting to grips with this problem, to which special international negotiations are better suited. Further attention will be given to this issue in international negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 22 proposes that the export of GMOs for deliberate release into the environment should be limited to organisms already authorised within the EU. In its <span class="italic">present version</span>, the amendment could entail serious obstacles to research outside Europe comprising, for example, field trials involving GMOs not cultivated in our latitudes. The Commission is not therefore able to accept this amendment in its present form.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 29 addresses more fundamental problems. Firstly, procedures are being established that do not in their entirety correspond to Article 11 of the Protocol on Biosafety and, what is worse, are inconsistent with Article 12 of Regulation (EC) No 178/2002 laying down the general principles and requirements of food law. For that reason, the Commission cannot accept the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal in the last sentence of Amendment No 60 to the effect that an exporter should be obliged to give notice of further movement of GMOs already authorised in the recipient country would not be in accordance with Community legislation governing deliberate release or with the Protocol on Biosafety <span class="italic">per se</span>. This part of the amendment cannot therefore be approved. It is, of course, a question of not creating unduly bureaucratic rules that cannot be implemented in practice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is, on the other hand, able to accept Amendment Nos 50 and 51.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I want in conclusion to repeat that the Commission shares most of the European Parliament’s priorities and views in the problem areas. If we want it to be possible to implement the Protocol on Biosafety, we must, at the same time, be accountable for the feasibility of such implementation. International discussions on the Protocol on Biosafety are still going on. A proposal capable of being implemented will not only help make it possible for the negotiations to continue in a constructive climate but also help show that sound protection of the environment and of human health can be combined with trade.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall have to return to other issues mentioned in the course of this debate, such as the moratorium and UN food aid, for they demand both time and thorough preparations. I hope that they will lead in time to a constructive exchange of opinions, but this is not the right time and place to touch on all these different aspects.
