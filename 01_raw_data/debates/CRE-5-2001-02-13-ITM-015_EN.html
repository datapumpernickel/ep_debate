<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Mr President, I should like to begin by thanking the shadow rapporteurs from the other parties for cooperating so well on this report. I think it is to be welcomed that we can muster a broad majority for a proposal that extends Parliament’s earlier decisions. By means of this proposal, we are establishing the framework for the EU’s employment policy over the next five years. Employment policy is based, of course, upon what we call open coordination which, most recently at the Lisbon Summit, has been highlighted as a method that may be used within many other areas of policy. Open coordination means that countries may use different methods of achieving common goals. And the common goal in this case is higher employment. What we have here are recommended guidelines for the policies of the Member States. Countries must report on what they are doing to make the unemployed better able to meet the demands of the labour market. Encouragement must be given to the spirit of enterprise and to flexibility in the labour market, and countries must work to promote a better relationship between work and family life.</p>
<p class="contents">This reporting, carried out by the Member States every year, therefore forms the point of departure for the Commission’s annual report on employment in the EU which, together with the Commission’s analyses and statistics concerning development, forms the basis for the Council’s recommendation to the individual countries. The process is open. There is a free choice of policy, and if a country goes down a markedly different path than the one recommended, it can be criticised, but nothing more. Is the process too informal, then? A whole lot of reports, meetings and conferences and a whole lot of words, but no certainty that the objectives will be achieved. On the surface of it, the process is indeed perhaps not formal enough. However, this policy whereby countries measure their efforts against each other and exchange experiences – benchmarking and employment of best practices, to use the modern terminology – means that a broader public gets to see which countries are doing well and which less well. To a large extent, open coordination works by becoming a subject in the public and national debate about employment policy. In those countries where youth unemployment is high, the public is bound to ask how it can be that their politicians are not achieving the same good results as politicians in other countries. Is there anything we can learn from the efforts of other countries? Transparency, understood as openness to the public, is in actual fact a very important agent in this process.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore want to see more focus upon providing information to the public at large and upon involving the parties in the labour market, together with local and regional authorities, to a much greater extent than is contemplated in the Commission’s proposal. Article 129 provides, of course, for the possibility of introducing pilot projects. We want an exchange of information about the ways and means of involvement at local level. This could be a pilot project. There is no question of our having new projects which mimic practices with which the Social Fund has familiarised us. It is about developing analyses, knowledge and information about the whys and wherefores of local and regional involvement in employment policy. By means of its communication concerning the role of local and regional authorities, the Commission has already made a start upon work of this kind. In this year’s Budget, Parliament too has introduced a new budget line for preparative initiatives to promote local participation in employment policy. We have done this precisely to promote a broader knowledge of European employment strategy. By including in this proposal the role of local and regional authorities in employment policy, we ensure that there is a legal basis for this initiative.</p>
<p class="contents">When, in this way, we ask the Commission to do more work than is contemplated in the Commission’s own proposal, then appropriations must of course follow, and my report therefore proposes an increase in appropriations to EUR 65 million in contrast to the Commission’s proposal of EUR 55 million. To put it briefly, the open coordination method must be open in two senses. It must be open in the sense that countries retain the freedom to organise their own policies and that there must be a number of ways to achieve the same objectives. However, it must also be open in the sense that the general public is involved far more than it is at present. The policy on employment, or Luxembourg process, is to be commended, but why does it have to be a matter of such secrecy? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This demonstrates that employment programmes and work in this area can have very positive effects. I also believe that the method adopted by the Commission is the right one, that is a combination of benchmarking and promoting best practice with a view to making Europe the world leader in the knowledge-based society.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has also applied its funding very carefully. Expenditure was only 50% of commitments. So a great deal has been achieved with very limited means, which is particularly commendable. And perhaps it will also be possible to trim administrative expenditure further in future. The potential is certainly there. On the other hand, we should do everything in our power to improve and extend this programme in future. The relevant committee has made appropriate proposals to this effect, and the European Parliament would be proud if the positive achievements of the past year could be carried forward. In the field of information technology alone – the information society – we will be unable to fill around a million jobs by 2004 because of inadequate training. I believe that it is a great challenge for us to create new, interesting and good jobs in this area and also in the field of biotechnology, where we need research to solve the problems associated with BSE. In short, we specifically need to invest in these new areas. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Thus, based on the need to support and develop the European Employment Strategy, the Commission is proposing a series of measures, which include analysis, research and cooperation between Member States on employment, which will be very helpful for achieving the new strategic objective established in Lisbon, which is to make Europe the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore fully support the Commission proposal, although I feel that it could be improved on some points which, broadly speaking, are as follows: firstly, and with regard to the planned Community measures, one of them supports a more strategic approach to employment in the Union, through analysis and evaluation of the factors that explain employment tendencies, the general political framework, etc. On this point the Commission proposal does not envisage that the analysis and evaluation will be conducted in a specific way, for men and for women, something that I consider to be essential if we take into account that unemployment in Europe is largely among women. It is not excessive to say that, if employment among women were not taken into account, in some regions of the Union there would even be full employment.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, and given that employment incentive measures must be one of the key tools for developing equal opportunities, we need to consider what women’s employment needs are. We therefore need to consider which are the studies aimed at offering more childcare and social assistance in the home. In this respect, we need to ensure that there is sufficient supply of quality services, particularly when dealing with dependants, which in the majority of cases are the responsibility of women.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore need to encourage the incorporation of women into the labour market and encourage them to remain in it, with an equal distribution of family responsibilities between men and women. We need to take into account the reinsertion of women and, without any doubt, differentiating between the studies by sex would help us to understand the problems that this raises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Moreover, since 14 February, Valentine's Day is only a quarter of an hour away, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all lovers: I hope that there are some in this rough, tough, severe Parliament as well.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the document under consideration, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party calling for the scope of the directive to include an analysis of policy developments from the viewpoints of certain categories of people such as the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, this programme appropriates EUR 55 million over five years, chiefly to statistics and the drawing up of documentation on the employment strategy; we are talking mainly about aid to the Member States to achieve the above statistics. A small proportion of the amount, which I feel should be increased, is for pilot projects intended to identify new forms of employment and work. In my opinion, these should certainly include – as Commissioner Diamantopoulou said in her first speech – the new activity of caring for the ever-increasing number of elderly and disabled people carried out by young workers who are able to find work in this field and, at the same time, make life easier for the elderly.</p>
<p class="contents">I have already tabled this amendment in committee, Mr President, but I am afraid that the left-wing section of Parliament, the socialists that is, rejected it. I am tabling it again in the Chamber in the hope that, this time, the request for the scope of the directive to be extended to include this activity as well will be accepted by that section of Parliament which professes always to be sensitive to the problems of elderly and disabled people, that is the left side, and that Mrs Jensen's central section will vote for this amendment too.</p>
<p class="contents">Tomorrow morning, I shall request a vote by name on this amendment, although I am sure that this will not be necessary and that it will be accepted unanimously. I truly hope that Europe will concern itself, at last, with elderly and disabled people in the field of employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is reason for doing so, for this is Mrs Jensen’s first report, and it is also a very good piece of work she has done. As we all know, the report was, of course, adopted by a very large majority of the committee. That is gratifying, for this is a very important piece of work. This decision must ensure that the employment policy we talk so much about is not just a matter of fine words, but that these are in actual fact backed by vigorous action. Nor must there be any doubt that we in the Group of the Party of European Socialists support open coordination whenever this is the most effective tool for achieving the desired objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">Employment policy is so important because it is the test run for the open coordination method, and it is of the very greatest importance to show that this method is being taken seriously and is producing the desired results. Employment policy will simply be a model for many of the other areas – which are already part of the ambitious plan adopted in Lisbon last spring – in which we should also like to use the open coordination method. And in the next few weeks, when Heads of State and Government take the Commission’s telling-off seriously and give some impetus to the many outstanding initiatives in the wake of the Lisbon Summit, we shall hopefully also have it confirmed that the open coordination method can be used. The incentive measures must support employment policy, and that is why the incentive measures are important. I am therefore very pleased that we in the committees were able to reach agreement on a series of amendments and improvements to the Commission’s proposal.</p>
<p class="contents">These amendments relate to five different points. First of all, information must be provided about employment policy. Secondly, the parties in the labour market, together with the relevant local and regional authorities, must be involved. Thirdly, the focus must be placed upon equal opportunities for men and women, in which connection I should like to thank the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities. Fourthly, an assessment and revision of the open coordination method must be set in motion. And fifthly, the programme must be extended to include pilot projects as well. What, in other words, we are concerned with here is a quite extensive alteration to the incentive measures which, in a way, were good enough originally. In this way, we have extended their area of application, and I therefore also hope that, together, we can increase the financial resources we have for implementing the measures so that it will not in any case be possible to accuse Parliament of only producing fine words and not backing them up with genuine action. I hope that the Commission and the Council are ready to demonstrate the same drive that we have tried to demonstrate here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Despite Mrs Jensen's fine work, I feel that this report is not of great significance. I know that there is effectively a need to do what the Commission, through its proposal, and the Treaties themselves call for, namely to combine best practices with all speed, to promote innovative processes and approaches and to assess the results.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not feel, however, that, in order to do this, there is still a need in the Europe of today to invest EUR 55 million over a small number of years in order to produce more detailed analyses, to attempt to find links between the experiences of the different countries and to promote cooperation – although it is not clear what this means in terms of employment – between the individual countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we really believe that, in order to carry out benchmarking, today, we need to perform once again yet more studies, to sprinkle euro dust on a thousand small more or less nepotistic channels – some to the trade unions, some to the different business organisations, some to the non-governmental organisations – to finance new studies which will end up, covered in dust, taking up space on the shelves of libraries? Mr President, I really do not think we need this. There may be a need to coordinate the recording of statistics or to consolidate and update the Eurostat comparison methods – I can see that – but I do not feel that we need to be spending money on further studies and analyses, on information exchange, on pilot projects which, when all is said and done, artificially create jobs subsidised by European, State or local public finances and will continue to do so in the future, but which will serve no practical purpose. We waste time, we confuse the European unemployed, but we do not carry out those reforms which are truly necessary and with which we are all familiar.</p>
<p class="contents">A few minutes ago, in this Chamber, we were talking about groups of people who are disadvantaged in terms of employment. In my country, Italy, thanks to a few reforms – extremely minor reforms opposed by the trade unions – liberalising the labour market, we created hundreds of thousands of new jobs last year, mainly in the disadvantaged areas of the South, for women and young people, but we did this through structural measures, which is what is needed, and not, I regret to say, thanks to new, enormously expensive studies. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Indeed, there is much that we can support in this report, in particular the emphasis given to the proposed Community-level/local-level mixed approach to employment policy. In the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities we emphasise that the analysis and evaluation of this action in the field of employment should be carried out on a gender-specific basis, given that women are bearing the brunt of unemployment in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the Lisbon objectives of bringing up the employment rates for women, a target for 2010 of 60% can already be considered too ambitious. In the Kingdom of Spain where the employment rate of women is probably the lowest in the European Union, it hardly reaches 30% of the active population. That is why the Committee on Women's Rights asked for an analysis of the causes of this tremendous gap: part-time working, pregnancy, parental leave, household responsibilities, etc. That is why we, Euskal Herritarok, ask all the Members of this House to back all the amendments proposed by the Committee on Women's Rights and of course the actual report by Mrs Jensen. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That summit succeeded in convincing the Member States actively to do more to improve employability and adaptability, to establish a new entrepreneurial spirit and to enhance equal opportunities. Since then, model measures in the Member States have been a central plank of Europe's employment strategy. A thorough assessment and evaluation of what these have achieved is to take place: reintegration into working life, activities to promote equality of opportunities, elimination of exclusion, and targeted measures to create a suitable environment for setting up small and medium-sized businesses. Are we right in our view that European added value can be created if actions in the Member States are interlinked with Community initiatives and with Community education, training and further education programmes?</p>
<p class="contents">We want to involve local and regional stakeholders more actively by means of pilot projects and therefore call on the Commission to top up the funding it has proposed. I believe that a priority here is improved coordination of employment and economic policy, which are, after all, two sides of the same coin. We now need to have the courage to make more of our potential and not only be consulted when the employment policy guidelines are being drawn up – that is not enough. As a European Parliament we need to get involved on a more consistent basis in the employment week in Brussels in November, whilst here in Strasbourg we should at long last find time to devote a whole day to a debate on the creation of jobs of the future and the implementation of national action plans. As part of this, proper attention needs to be paid to the achievements of the social partners and the experiences of employees hit by unemployment and assisted by job creation measures. Mr President, that would be our contribution towards a good campaign on Europe's employment strategy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the Union’s objectives is to promote a high level of employment. Therefore, within the framework of the Luxembourg process, the Member States have been cooperating in the field of employment policy, and are responsible for selecting specific measures for its implementation. In fact, it could not be otherwise. More recently, the Lisbon European Council set the Union the strategic objective of becoming the most competitive and dynamic knowledge-based economy in the world, capable of sustainable economic growth generating more and better jobs and greater social cohesion.</p>
<p class="contents">This report seeks to make a contribution towards meeting this new challenge set in Lisbon, covering equal opportunities for men and women in the field of employment, an important pillar in the European Employment Strategy. The report aims to foster cooperation between Member States in analysis, research and monitoring of labour market policy, identifying best practices and promoting exchanges and transfers of information and experience. All of this will be flanked by an active information policy, so that Europe’s citizens can easily see what the strategic objectives in the field of employment are. We must ensure that the social partners and relevant local and regional authorities are involved in this effort, which must be a communal effort. Furthermore, it is equally crucial that a study should be made of infrastructures that help men and women to gain employment and to remain employed, such as crèche places and home help, a point that is made clear in the opinion of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament is already a key player within the consultation process in defining the annual employment guidelines and must now also participate in a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the effects of the European Employment Strategy in general. I wish to say a final word about the allocation of resources for employment incentive measures. The use of public funds must be dealt with in a balanced and extremely rigorous way. An increased budgetary appropriation in this domain would therefore appear to be something that is essential and to be welcomed. It must also be emphasised that the allocation of resources must meet real, specific needs and take account of the implementation of the budget for each heading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the limited time that is available it is important that, as a number of speakers have already touched upon a number of disadvantaged groups or groups who are not doing so well in employment areas, we consider a number of aspects, the three most important ones being: equality of opportunity, equality of access and equality of training. Equality of opportunity must mean that all jobs, all services that are available, are open to all equally. Equality of access means that there should be no physical impediment towards people accessing training or employment opportunities. Equality of education means that people must have the skills that are required for the jobs that are going to be available.</p>
<p class="contents">We have moved from a time when there was heavy industrialised and intensive labour areas of industry, to other smaller networks, smaller cooperation. We need to look more towards giving the skills and training to young people, middle-aged people, elderly people and those living in urban and rural areas to guarantee that they have equality of access to that training and new jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The national action plans on employment, under the Luxembourg process, are very useful to us in ensuring that we use the carrot and stick with the Member States. We can give extra resources where they are providing good jobs and meeting their targets and we can take them back when they are not doing it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This is a very good report. I say that without surprise as it is by Mrs Jensen, so of course it is a good report. However, it was a slightly better report before the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs ‘improved it’. Some of the amendments that have come through have not made it a better document. I refer to just two aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">The first aspect – taking my life in my hands – refers to some of the amendments of the Committee on Women's Rights and Equal Opportunities. I strongly support women's rights. I strongly support the rights of young people, of old people, of disabled people and many other minorities. But only the women have their own committee to speak up for them. At times, perhaps, their voice drowns out some of the other groups, in my judgment.</p>
<p class="contents">I take as an example Article 3.1(1) where the original text said: "To the maximum possible extent analysis will be gender-specific". I agree with that. It should be gender-specific to the maximum possible extent. But the Women's Committee has taken out the words "to the maximum possible extent". Apparently "maximum possible" is not quite maximum enough. I believe it was fine as it was. I use that as an example, but I am still supportive of women's rights. I have my tomato-proof suit on just in case you were thinking of doing something.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point concerns the budget. I believe the Committee on Budgets made a reference to the budget increasing from EUR 50 million to EUR 55 million, but on the basis that this should be proportionate to the implementation. Last year's budget was EUR 50 million. Only two-thirds of that was spent; 25% of that was eaten up by administrative costs. To go up from EUR 55 million to 65 million – which is the latest amendment – is, in my view, disproportionate. It is a reflection of the enthusiasm of the committee for this particular project. Sometimes it is all too common that in order to signify the importance of a subject more money is offered to it. I should like to hope that, increasingly, colleagues could recognise that money is not just a reflection of importance, and that it is possible to vote strongly for a report without increasing the money. I fear I may have to wait a long time to see that. Given my advancing years it may be my successors who see that approach first. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I very much appreciate the fact that most of the Members of Parliament have referred to the Lisbon conclusions. This is our main ambition in this proposal as well. We want to use this proposal which is based on Article 129 of the Treaty to support, deepen and develop the employment strategy and through that to achieve the goal of full employment of Lisbon.</p>
<p class="contents">Before starting my speech and my references to the amendments I would like to reply to Mr Bushill-Matthews. I would say to him that women are not a group, they are not a minority, they are not a category. They are 51% of the population. Women comprise many groups. It is a horizontal problem so do not confuse the other groups with women. This is why women have their own committee.</p>
<p class="contents">We have worked very well together and I can accept the majority of the amendments which you propose. In some cases I would like to accept the spirit of your proposal but with some rewording in order to keep the consistency of the text.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the first amendment, I agree with a slight rewording that we should further emphasise the strengths of the European employment strategy. Likewise, I accept in spirit Amendment No 2 emphasising the importance of the role which Parliament plays in European employment policy. In relation to Amendment No 3 on Article 2, I can accept it in spirit. I will accordingly propose wording which takes account of both parts of the amendment. I quote: "examining and promulgating methods of cooperation with the social partners, relevant local and regional interests and enacting an active information policy".</p>
<p class="contents">A number of amendments relate to Article 3, which deals with the activities which will be carried out under this programme. Allow me to refer specifically to Amendment No 4 regarding Article 3(1). For Amendment No 5, I accept in spirit the need to assess the ways in which all interest groupings which have a contribution to make have been involved in the implementation of national action plans.</p>
<p class="contents">I can similarly accept the call in Amendment No 6 for a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the facts of the European employment strategy and for an analysis of the relationship between that and general economic and other policy areas. However, it is not within the scope of this programme to arrive at conclusions on the transferability of the approach and method of the employment strategy to other policy areas. I very much agree that we must strengthen the Luxembourg approach. We have already extended it in other policies, for example exclusion policy, but we cannot use it here. So I cannot accept the last part of Amendment No 6.</p>
<p class="contents">Consistent with my policy approach in other legislative proposals which I have advanced, I support the advocacy of assistance for Member States in relation to equal opportunities for men and women. A number of amendments to various paragraphs in Article 3 have been put forward in relation to equal opportunities. I welcome this but to avoid the duplication and excessive detail on specific projects to be supported I am proposing a new addition to Article 3(2) so as to more explicitly take account of our mutual objectives in this context. This will cover all the issues raised in Amendments Nos 7, 8 and 9 such as analysis and monitoring, development of indicators, parental leave and part-time working and the publication of reports.</p>
<p class="contents">For similar reasons I cannot accept Amendment No 18 and I would reply to Mr Fatuzzo that the analysis of employment developments relating to the ageing of the population is already covered by Article 3(1). Other specific problems deal with policy activities relating to the elderly, disabled and vulnerable groups.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 4 also concerns equal opportunities. Article 3 of the decision indicates that the analysis to be undertaken under this programme will to the maximum extent possible be gender-specific. While I fully agree with the need for, and importance of, gender-specific analysis I am obliged to recognise that there are problems with the data and with the statistical services in many Member States. We are actively working with Eurostat and with Member States, and this is one of our main recommendations for employment strategy in the joint employment report for many Member States, but we must admit that we have big problems with many Member States as far as the data is concerned. So I regret that I cannot accept this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 10 for a new Article 3 is quite complex. I can agree to add to the existing text to emphasise the focus on the local employment dimension of the European employment strategy. However, I cannot accept the reservation of part of the appropriations for specific activities relating to local development as these will be covered by the general objectives of the programme. Similarly, I cannot accept the amendment to use this programme for local employment projects as this is covered by the other programmes such as the EQUAL Programme and those provided for under Article 6 of the European structural and social funds' regulation. So I can only accept Amendment No 10 in part.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept in spirit the proposed Amendments Nos 11 and 12 to Article 4 concerning the importance of dissemination of the results of European employment strategy. I share your concern to ensure consistency and complementarity between the activities under this decision and those in other Community programmes set out in Amendment No 13. Accordingly, I can accept in spirit the relevant amendments for this purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding the first part of Amendment No 14, there seems to be a misunderstanding. Provision for cooperation with the Employment Committee is made in Article 8. The amendment which seeks to refer to this also in Article 7 is therefore superfluous. Regarding the second part of Amendment No 14 relating to the representation of women in these committees, the Commission has already achieved a gender balance in committees and we have a goal of a participation of at least 40% of each gender in every committee and expert group. This specific target concerning committees and expert groups is laid down very clearly in the Commission's decision of 19 June 2000. This is part of a wider effort to increase the number of women in decision-making positions in economics and in policy. The inclusion of a specific provision regarding the representation in a number of employment-related committees is however beyond the scope of the decision in question. Parliament could play an important role in the nomination of men and women in these committees.</p>
<p class="contents">So, I cannot accept Amendment No 14. Amendment No 15 relating to creating linkages with the competent specialist committee of the European Parliament has to be rejected on institutional grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the budget is concerned, the budget of EUR 55 million which has been proposed for implementation of this decision and the staff resources necessary for the Commission to implement it effectively have been carefully calculated. They reflect the amount foreseen in the financial programming of the Commission within Category III expenditure. Accordingly, I cannot accept a significant increase in the budget as this would inhibit effective and efficient implementation of the programme. I therefore cannot accept Amendments Nos 16 and 17.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, I can accept in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12 and 13. I can also accept parts of Amendments Nos 6 and 10. For the reasons I have already put forward I must reject Amendments Nos 4, 14, 15, 16, 17 and 18.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mrs Jensen, for the considerable and valuable contribution which she has made. I had to refer in detail to the amendments which is why I had to speak for such a long time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
