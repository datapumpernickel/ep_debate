It is very simple, but in this world the simplest things are very often the hardest things to achieve. The goal of my colleagues who joined me in tabling this question to the Commission is this: the correct application of the EC-Israel trade agreement, which – we not only have reason to believe but, together with several Member States, have concrete proof – is being blatantly violated by Israel. At the same time, we also have reason to believe that the Commission is failing to attend to one of its primary functions: guardianship of the Community Treaties. I refer to Article 38 of the territorial requirement which restricts the scope to the territory of the State of Israel and thus does not grant special customs arrangements for products coming from the territories which were occupied by Israeli armed forces in June 1967 and upon which, in breach of all the international rules, from the fourth Geneva Convention onwards, the different Israeli governments have built settlements, confiscating Palestinian land and water and installing their own people. </p>
<p class="contents">This is not the first time that the Commission and Parliament have tackled this issue: I will only cite here the Commission’s report to the Council and Parliament, published in May 1998, which did not accept Israel’s refusal to apply the protocol of the rules of origin as laid down in Article 38. In spite of this, the Commission was not able to induce Israel to respect these agreements, and only gave vague responses to parliamentary questions, maintaining that it was difficult to obtain reliable proof of the provenance of products, although it has consistently, and quite rightly, made the legal obligations imposed by the agreement clear to Israel. In order to make it easier for the Commission and the Member States to get hold of reliable evidence, an Israeli peace movement published a list of companies established in the settlements, and a Palestinian NGO prepared and presented the customs services of the various Member States with unequivocal proof attesting to the State of origin of a range of products coming from the occupied territories and traded on domestic Community markets. I will mention but a few, which are produced in the Golan Heights and the occupied territories: wine and other products.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a time of peace in Palestine and Israel: right now the credibility and observance of the legal effect of treaties and agreements is important if the European Union and Parliament want to play an active political role. Israel can be certain that Europe is in favour of its security and stability, but it cannot ask us to be party to such grave violations. The Palestinians know that the European Union is in favour of the consolidation of their State and their rights, but they have no proof of this. Peace cannot be founded on the violation of rights – Israelis such as the soldier Igal Moshe, who refused to go to the Lebanon four days ago and who is now in prison, are proof of this; Palestinians who still want peace, despite the fact that their houses have been levelled and that, 50 years on, they are still refugees, are proof of this; above all, respect for ourselves and for the democratic principles which we have laid down for ourselves demand it. Allow me to say, however, on a more practical level, that, for the same Member States and the Union, this also concerns the loss of economic resources taken from European citizens in violation of human and economic rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(PT)</span> We have repeatedly stated this position to the Israeli authorities at every official meeting between the Commission and the relevant Israeli minister, the most recent of which was held on 21 January. On that occasion, the Prime Minister, Shimon Peres, attended a meeting with Romano Prodi, the President of the Commission, and with Commissioner Patten. It was furthermore widely known, as you have just said, Mrs Morgantini, that Israel’s interpretation of the territory to which the agreement applies does not match our own. The Commission believes, however, that our interpretation is completely unambiguous.</p>
<p class="contents">Hence, the relevance of your second question on the effectiveness of the verification system. The procedure for verifying the origin of products enables us to determine if a product may be benefiting from the right to preferential treatment, even if there is no cooperation on the part of the third country involved in determining the product’s origin. In our written answer to you, the Commission mentioned simplifying the procedure for determining the origins of a product. Of course, this does not mean that this alone will solve the problem or, in other words, that simplifying this procedure would automatically lead to a clearer indication of the product’s origin. As long as the customs services of the various Member States identify consignments which may not have originated in Israel, and as long as this is done by the national customs authorities, the Commission, for its part, will – to the extent that it is empowered to do so – maintain its dialogue with the Israeli authorities. In so doing, it will seek to ensure that the protocol on the rules of origin is properly applied in accordance with the only interpretation which the Commission can accept. In the event that these initiatives, which are currently under way, do not enable the origin of a product to be determined, the Commission may have to look at the possibility of calling a meeting of the Customs Cooperation Committee, in which the differences of opinion on verification procedures in this kind of agreement could be resolved.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the new measures, the Commission has, at official meetings with the Israeli authorities, discussed in great detail the issue of the application of the agreement, for which there are clearly defined procedures. In January of this year, the Israeli authorities suggested setting up a tripartite working group comprising representatives of the Palestinian authorities, of the Israeli Government and of the Commission. The aim of this working group would be to find mutually acceptable solutions for the transition period, without prejudice to the final outcome of the discussions currently taking place. Nor would they contravene the agreements which will remain in force until a final agreement is reached. President Arafat accepted this proposal at a meeting on 24 January with Commissioner Patten. The Commission is therefore seeking to confirm to both the Israeli Government and the Palestinian authorities that we are willing to accept this proposal, which we feel will allay the concerns that you have raised here, Mrs Morgantini.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In economic terms, this means that according to the existing agreement, Europe’s markets are open to products from Israel and from the Palestinians’ autonomous area. Furthermore, exports from the territory of the State of Israel and the current Palestinian territories to the European Union receive preferential treatment from the European Union. </p>
<p class="contents">Provision has not yet been made in the strictly legal sense for preferential arrangements of this kind to be enjoyed by occupied areas which have yet to be assigned definitively to the national territory of one country or the other, under the terms of the peace process and a new border settlement, and these arrangements have yet to be specified in detail. We agree with the Commission on this. Therefore, it would make good sense now for Israel to guarantee the legally irreproachable application of this concrete preferential arrangement on its national territory, and for the Palestinians to do the same in respect of their interim territory. However, we are also in favour of allowing the direct representatives of these occupied territories enough time to reach a negotiated settlement, which is something you mentioned Commissioner.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Ultimately, all producers, be they Israeli or Palestinian, should be afforded easier access to the European Union market once the territorial issues have been conclusively resolved, which will come step-by-step with the construction of a future Palestinian state. Therefore, the European Union should help to move the process on, and not behave in such a way as to exacerbate the situation, i.e. by apportioning blame to one party, which achieves nothing. And so, on behalf of the vast majority of the PPE-DE Group, I urge Israel, the Palestinians – and President Arafat’s stance is an encouraging sign in this respect – and the Commission, to step up the direct exploratory talks, so as to settle this as yet unresolved trade issue between the European Union, on the one hand, and Israel and the Palestinian autonomous authorities, on the other.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, with your permission, I would like to encourage the Commission – Mr Vitorino and Mr Lamy – to continue to support the peace process by taking a discreet but cooperation-orientated line, supporting the legitimate interests of Palestinian producers – as Parliament has done for ten years now – and, at the same time, building on our close trade ties with Israel and its producers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As for the political obstacles to be tackled, these are all too apparent. The weight of the political problem is in fact so great that it could discourage us when considering an obstacle such as the incorrect application of this trade agreement, which in principle is only a legal problem. Some might therefore consider it reasonable to argue that, since the irregular exports to Europe from the Israeli settlements in the occupied territories are not regarded as a priority political problem, these should be halted until a final peace agreement is achieved. However, I believe that the repeated failure to comply with previously concluded legal agreements, combined with the accumulated frustration at non-compliances in other areas, could become a political issue which might prejudice the peace process itself.</p>
<p class="contents">Specifically and regrettably, in a conflict like the Israeli or Palestinian conflict, everything ends up being politicised if appropriate measures are not taken in time to prevent this happening. In this respect, the answer given by Mr Prodi, at the beginning of his trip to the Middle East just two days ago, to a journalist’s question on this issue, is nonsense. He said that this issue was not on the agenda as this only concerned political issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Frankly, I believe that the Commission must act if it is proven that preferential access to Community markets is being gained by products originating from these settlements. As the Commission itself states and international law determines, these settlements are not part of the territory of the State of Israel. The fact that Europe is basing its actions on international law in its relations with the parties to the peace process can only benefit Israel.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to ask the Commission, which I am sure intends to apply the current agreement, if it has planned any special additional effort or mechanism to make this application more effective in this particular case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The Union has played an invaluable part in this process, in its capacity as the primary source of economic aid to the region. The main reason for the problems of implementing trade agreements between the European Union and Israel, as has already been said, is the intractable problem of frontiers. The Israeli interpretation is not the same as the Union’s, as the Commissioner mentioned. At all events, it is a process currently under negotiation, a difficult one, but one that we all wish to see succeed.</p>
<p class="contents">This is essentially a political process and the Union would be ill advised to look for a merely technical solution which would only be temporary, given the lack of legal frontiers between the two States. The settlement process must proceed by the only possible avenue, i.e. that of dialogue. A tripartite working group, comprising Palestinian and Israeli specialists as well as those of the Commission, should thus be set up. In this context, we may hope that the parties involved will manage to settle their differences and establish a creative solution for this transitional period.</p>
<p class="contents">As was the case in Europe fifty years ago, the social and economic development of the Middle East is an essential condition for peace. We therefore have some expertise to bring to bear on the subject and we are particularly well placed to gauge the extent of what has already been achieved. Hopefully the Israelis and Palestinians will demonstrate the same optimistic faith in goodwill. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It will only be possible for the exact borders of the state of Israel, the only democracy in that region, to be universally recognised once these negotiations have proved to be a success. The trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, which equally fails to define the territory of the state of Israel, should be implemented against this background. </p>
<p class="contents">In addition, there is a significant connection between the economic activities within Israel and those on Palestinian territory. With this in mind, the Paris Protocol to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs “envelope” comprising the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore, the Commission and said parties have agreed to set up a joint working party to discuss issues concerning products’ countries of origin. The Palestinian economy in particular is said to suffer under unilateral EU measures. Potential investors in this area have already indicated that they would withdraw if joint ventures were no longer given preference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I agree that we must emphasise the importance, for the European Union and therefore, from an executive point of view, for the Commission, of encouraging tripartite activities, particularly as regards levels of economic/financial and scientific cooperation. In this way, our financial involvement could be converted rather more often into a more significant political presence in the Middle East. This, in my opinion, is the lesson to be learned from such a long-drawn-out affair.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the subject under discussion, I have just heard Mr Galeote and Mr Menéndez del Valle refer, respectively, to the visit of our President and that of President Prodi to Israel and other countries in the Middle East. I feel that the two Presidents were right not to include this point in their agendas: there is a time and place for everything and, of course, the priorities are different at different levels. I feel that it was right for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to tackle the most sensitive issues of the peace process which, as we are aware, is still running into difficulties. We need to lend this peace process our full support, and our concern over the issues described in the question put by Mrs Morgantini is not preconceived, nor is it indicative of a negative attitude towards any of the parties concerned. We are being cruel to be kind. We are being strict with our friend, the Israeli Government, to prevent repetition of these illegal occurrences and irregularities, as they are damaging to everyone involved. Seen in this perspective, this initiative should also be viewed as positive, and as an initiative intended to further the Middle East peace process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question. I can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon. </p>
<p class="contents">There are, nonetheless, a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration. Indeed, we are all agreed that the recent revival of the peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered. </p>
<p class="contents">Israel and the Palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders. Any attempt by anyone, including by any third party, to define – let alone impose – the territorial area to be adopted for trading purposes is therefore premature. In my opinion, it seems preferable to await the findings of the tripartite working group, to be convened on the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and also the Palestinians for the purpose of examining the origin rules.</p>
<p class="contents">I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view. Hopefully, this working party will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing legal framework without jeopardising the peace process. For this peace process deserves absolute priority, and we in the European Community and in Europe should not put any obstacle whatsoever in the way of this process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint. We are major donors but we have, unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively, as many speakers have said today, just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland.</p>
<p class="contents">We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories, indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement. Borders are being shut down, sometimes arbitrarily, and sometimes following a terrorist attack. On one of my many visits to the area, I have seen flowers and strawberries rotting, lying in the streets of Gaza and being eaten by the donkeys while their Palestinian producers look on helplessly in despair.</p>
<p class="contents">But it is not just an issue of closed borders. Goods do flow freely from these territories, goods produced in Israeli settlements in the occupied territories. We have an international agreement and it is being transgressed. It is our responsibility to ensure that the terms of the agreement are respected and upheld by all.</p>
<p class="contents">Under the circumstances, when Israel does not clearly discharge its duty to apply the origin rules and the territorial clause of the agreement as it should, the Commission is encouraging Member States to resort to the import verification procedures which can be dilatory and evasive. Israeli customs can be given a very long time, up to ten months, to reply to any queries and the import verification procedure can be totally unproductive. We should be requiring deposits on all goods imported from Israel until we are able to ensure that Israel will stop abusing the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I have a couple of questions, Commissioner. Has the Commission received from any Member States’ customs services documents certified by Israeli customs that represent specific settlement locations in the occupied territories falling within the scope of the agreement? Has it directly asked the Israeli officials responsible whether its customs service applies the territorial clause so as to exclude the occupied territories from the agreement and has it determined that Israel correctly understands and interprets that territorial clause? And is the Commission aware whether they apply that territorial clause correctly or not?</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, the Commission has already stated that action to uphold international agreements with the EU, and I am quoting, “does not represent a sanction against Israel but demands correct implementation of existing agreements freely entered into by the parties”. In short, Commissioner, this is not an issue which should be treated as a matter for peace-process-related political debate. It is, in fact, an international agreement and a trade agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Could I just finally express my great hopes for the peace process in that area – a part of the world that so desperately needs it – so that it can re-group and re-form and help its millions of under-privileged and poverty-stricken citizens.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules. Everyone understands that there is concern about this today, but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable. Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment.</p>
<p class="contents">Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel. And because the Commission’s investigation is not, and must not be perceived as, an indictment, I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine, including joint ventures, Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined. The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers. Any attempt on the part of the European Union to impose its own idea of the territorial limits of the State of Israel would be, at the very least, lacking in tact and detrimental to these talks and to the idea of the role which we feel Europe should have in this region. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is complicated; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from. No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians, where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things, they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East, then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement. Therefore, because it is not an easy and simple issue, we have to be cautious and we have to be careful.</p>
<p class="contents">The second reason why the Commission is right to proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a part in the area in securing peace then it must be seen to be fair and evenhanded. It would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is, both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and, as I say, in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time.</p>
<p class="contents">There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported. We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement. You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement. You cannot cherrypick in negotiations, this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

By giving de facto preferential treatment to products from the occupied settlements under the trade agreement with Israel, the EU is contravening two important principles of international law. It is contravening both the fourth Geneva Convention from 1949 and international norms in force concerning the unilateral incorporation of occupied territories.</p>
<p class="contents">Because the world’s and the EU’s respect for these two international principles forms the basis for the peace process which has been instituted, violations of these principles undermine the very basis of the peace process. The EU must now choose between basing its relations with Israel and Palestine on the standards of international law, thereby strengthening the basis of the peace process, and showing disdain for international law. The choice ought to be simple. International law prescribes that trade agreements should be established with countries and regions which we recognise and not with disputed territories. </p>
<p class="contents">Customs duties must be claimed back, and the EU’s Member States and Israel must respect the trade agreement’s rules concerning strict monitoring of the way in which products are labelled to show their country of origin. The Commission must guarantee that these things will be done. Commissioner Vitorino’s contribution offered some hope that they would be. </p>
<p class="contents">The peace process in the Middle East must be given a chance. It can only be founded upon international law. It is the EU’s responsibility to contribute to this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have urged Israel to exercise supervision accordingly. The Commission is in touch with Israel about this and the Commissioner has made a statement on this. According to the information I have received, however, there are no serious cases at present, and we are only talking small amounts in the context of the total volume of trade.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">What should our policy be? I will start at the end and work back. Surely it should be our common goal, once the internationally-recognised State of Palestine is in place, for there to be an agreement between the State of Palestine and the EU which is identical in content to that between Israel and the EU. This would constitute an important and practical contribution on our part towards facilitating cooperation between Israel and its immediate environs. Therefore it does not make sense, and benefits no one, to break up evolved interweavings in the infrastructure, in the labour market and in the marketing structures. The Commission has not stirred up the matter for good reason. We do not need any more secondary theatres of war in this complicated peace process.</p>

<p class="contents">Therefore, in my view, all existing agreements and practices should be respected by all parties in a transition period. This is something that is best left to the main protagonists – Israel and the Palestinian autonomous authorities – to sort out amongst themselves, with an appropriate amount of good will. One of the implications of this is that Israel must stop ignoring and blocking the interim agreement between the EU and the Palestinian autonomous authorities. But I also have an appeal to make to the critics of the Israelis’ former practice: what good does it do a Palestinian, if his Israeli employer, who grows a few oranges in the Gaza Strip or on the Left Bank, shuts up shop there and goes back into the heartland? None at all! He is out of a job. At the end of the day, the only people to profit from this on all sides are those who are not interested in reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians, rather they have goals of their own which they seek to achieve by radicalising the situation. EU fruit producers might also stand to benefit indirectly. However, I assume this was not an ulterior motive for pushing the issue here in Parliament. Therefore, my advice to everyone is this: let us not break anything up during this transition period that we would have to rebuild at great expense further down the line. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If the Commission is able to draw any conclusions from this debate, I would say that it seems to us that in broad terms Parliament is looking favourably on the strategy that the Commission has followed to address this issue. It is true that this strategy may be cautious, but it is also quite unambiguous.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of how politically sensitive this subject is and does not doubt for a minute that progress towards finding real solutions for the proper application of this trade agreement is closely linked to the development of the Middle East peace process. The Commission is also aware that the political importance attributed to the peace process by the European Union is reflected in Parliament and in the Commission, as has been said here by various Members and is a result of the recent visit to the region by President Nicole Fontaine as well as President Romano Prodi’s very recent visit last week. We are therefore fully aware of the fact that we are at a very delicate stage in the peace process, which must not be endangered by positions that would result from blindly applying legal rules, because applying the law requires that we should endeavour to find a solution on which all parties can agree. The truth of the situation is that the approach adopted by the Commission on this subject is to seek to obtain the support and agreement of all parties involved in the process. In response to various Members’ questions, I therefore think that the proposal put forward by the Israeli authorities, which is to set up a tripartite working group to consider the implications of this transition period in applying the trade agreement, which has already been accepted by the Palestinian authorities, deserves not only our acceptance, but also a statement of our confidence that through this kind of dialogue, through this kind of mutual vigilance over the correct application of the trade agreement, we will be able to achieve positive results in the interests of the population of the region. And what the population of the region is interested in, above all, is peace, and their own economic prosperity.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I would like to say that we feel this approach remains true to the principles and the values of the agreement, which we feel is sufficiently clear in legal terms. We are also convinced that we are taking positive steps to create an atmosphere of mutual trust which is always the best basis on which to build peace, because the Middle East has no alternative but to achieve peaceful coexistence between all of the peoples living there.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
