The leaders of the Khmer Rouge’s reign of terror are being brought before an “international” tribunal. We are pleased that the Cambodian National Assembly has decided on this unanimously and would like the court rulings to be carried out as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">After all, it is intolerable, certainly for the friends and relatives of the victims, that so far, not one single Khmer Rouge leader has been punished for his or her crimes and that the protagonists of years gone by are still free citizens in Cambodia, not to mention the former Khmer Rouge members’ involvement in the government.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the content of the adopted legislative draft has forced us to make a number of critical comments. After years of tug-of-war between the United Nations and Cambodia, it is becoming clear that a shaky compromise has been reached. It is precisely those legal affairs against which UN experts expressed their veto in a recommendation three years ago, that have now been included in the model adopted. The country’s regime, which is also culpable, has managed to squeeze every last drop out of the negotiations in this matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Dubious statements from Cambodian government leaders seem to suggest that they are attempting to delay the fair course of justice. The minister in charge, Mr Sok An, recently claimed that the guiding principle behind this thinking was to maintain stability and peace in the country In other words, former Khmer Rouge members whose testimony could jeopardise current stability, need not be brought to trial. King Sihanouk too is taking the unwilling authorities under his wing by pretending that “stability is more important than revenge”.</p>
<p class="contents">By way of conclusion, Mr President, we call on the international community and Cambodia to ensure that the Khmer Rouge killers are brought to justice in a speedy, fair and comprehensive trial, and to prevent the tribunal from degenerating into a charade. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Of course it is positive that this trial is now actually about to take place. It is important for Cambodia to deal with the ghosts from the past which are still haunting the country. However, we are not wild about what is about to happen there. It is a matter of better some of a pudding than none of a pie. We cannot do much else other than go along with it. Cambodia’s parliament has given its consent. Who are we then to criticise what is happening now, but we do have grave doubts about the way in which this has been organised.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, every court in Cambodia will have difficulty guaranteeing its own neutrality. In this case, the Cambodian judges will be appointed by the Cambodian Supreme Council of Magistracy,<span class="italic"> </span>which is ruled by the governing party. How neutral can those judges be? It is, of course, possible to appoint international judges, and they will certainly play a role in this, but will this role be so manifest that it will be clear to the Khmer Rouge victims that the judgments passed will actually be neutral and do justice to the situation as it was then? It is, of course, extremely odd that people such as Mr Ieng Sary, who played a key role under Pol Pot, have already been released from the trial because the Prime Minister dismissed them from that trial, and that was not done by a court of justice but by Mr Hun Sen.</p>
<p class="contents">We are pleased that this trial is now going to take place, but we will monitor its progress with considerable suspicion. We will only be able to reach a conclusion as to whether what is happening here is a positive step once the court cases are over. We therefore hope things will go well, but we have major doubts. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important so that Cambodia can move forward into the future that those responsible for heinous crimes against the Cambodian population be brought to justice.</p>
<p class="contents">The Khmer Rouge regime was one of the worst human rights abusers of the twentieth century, being responsible for an estimated 1.72 million deaths in a short, four-year rule. Although I welcome the establishment of the courts I have a number of reservations. We have to remember that the members of the ruling Cambodian People's Party, including the prime minister, Hun Sen, were once activists of the Khmer Rouge, serving under the dictator Pol Pot. Hun Sen has already decided who can and cannot be taken before a tribunal, thus challenging the powers of any court. There have been genuine fears that several senior members of the regime might escape justice, in particular the former Khmer Rouge foreign secretary, Ieng Sary. He was given partial amnesty after he defected with about 10,000 supporters in 1996.</p>
<p class="contents">Ieng Sary and other Khmer Rouge leaders were sentenced to death in absentia in 1997 by the People's Court, which was organised by the Vietnamese army occupying Cambodia at the time. The amnesty granted by King Sihanouk refers only to this conviction and makes no reference to future convictions and therefore it is important that he is tried.</p>
<p class="contents">No Khmer Rouge leaders has ever been tried and only two are in detention, one being the person who ran a notorious torture centre in Phnom Penh from which only seven out of more than fourteen thousand inmates emerged alive.</p>
<p class="contents">The tribunal has an unusual framework for participation of both international and Cambodian judges and prosecutors. Normally, in other war crime courts, there are only foreign judges and prosecutors. This becomes ever more worrying when we see that while the UN-nominated judges will be screened by the Cambodian Supreme Council of the Magistrate, a body controlled by the ruling party of Phnom Penh, the UN has no power whatsoever to screen the judges appointed by Cambodia.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we also need to look at the involvement of China in all of this. Although it has always maintained that it only provided the Khmer Rouge with technical expertise in agriculture, the Cambodian documentation centre recently unearthed evidence to show that it was directly involved in the setting up of the interrogation and torture centre in Phnom Penh where thousands of Cambodians died. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The sick were dragged from the hospitals or left to die. What followed was to shock the world. The human rights abuses of Bosnia, Kosovo, Sierra Leone, Chile, Angola are dwarfed by the sheer scale of the atrocities that took place under the Khmer Rouge. The deliberate deaths of between one and two million people constituted a real genocide. Perhaps, to be accurate, we should call it a sectocide for the intention was not to wipe out a race but an entire class, with victims selected on the basis of whether they were educated, whether their hands showed signs of manual work, or even whether they wore spectacles.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising therefore that following Pol Pot's death and the defeat of the Khmer Rouge, there should be a need for some kind of national catharsis through the application of justice and a calling to account of those responsible. Personally I hope that the prosecutions will not be restricted to the top 20 leaders but be extended to those who daily brutalised and executed their victims. If the Cambodian people want these trials to proceed, and the political situation is sufficiently stable to permit them, then it is only natural that the international community, through the UN, should wish to support them in that aim. We should beware, however, of imposing justice on other states, especially if such proceedings might unravel a political truce or accommodation that has brought peace or stability to the region and promises a better future.</p>
<p class="contents">Amnesties are sometimes necessary if unpalatable. In Cambodia, though, it looks as though the people and government are ready to take the risk of overturning previous amnesties in order to secure justice. If that proves to be the case we should wish them well in this venture. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The form the trials will take has been agreed between the UN and the Cambodian government. As the Cambodian judicial system is still frail, the trials are to be organised in such a way that both international and local judges will be presiding. During the time of the Khmer Rouge, nearly all those in the country’s legal profession were killed, and the country has not had time to evolve a new professionally run judicial system.</p>
<p class="contents">The international community has been concerned that many of those found guilty of genocide will not receive sentences, despite the law that supports the trial. This concern is well-founded. Those who caused the Cambodian state so much damage and its people so much unspeakable suffering must be held legally responsible for their actions. In addition to this, however, account must be taken of the requirements of stability and the country’s future. Last spring I myself was able to see how ordinary people were aiming at forgiveness, so that life could go on. It is not always easy to distinguish clearly between the victims and the persecutors. Restarting a spiral of large-scale revenge is to be avoided.</p>
<p class="contents">Although Cambodia’s problems and its bloody history are still close to us in terms of time, the country has been able to build the foundations of democracy. Cambodia is the only country in Southeast Asia to have abolished the death penalty. A friend of mine who works in the region said that at present Cambodia is the only multi-party system in the former French Indo-China, although there is still much to do to strengthen democracy and the rule of law. While we joyfully welcome the legislation on a trial, we must give our dedicated support to the positive developments that have started in the country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, I would like to say that the subject of Cambodia very much demonstrates the importance of our topical and urgent debates.</p>
<p class="contents">As Mr Tannock has quite rightly said, the genocide which took place in Cambodia was often hushed up during the 1980s. No one cared about Cambodia. It was this House which, following its first direct election in 1979, was the first to give repressed peoples a moral voice, although it had virtually no powers at that time. And this House took a very special interest in the fate of the people of Cambodia. I recall that in the 1980s our colleague Otto von Habsburg, who I was working with at the time, regularly got the subject of Cambodia onto the agenda. And if the Cambodians wanted to communicate with the peoples of Europe, they did it through the European Parliament's debates on topical and urgent subjects of major importance, here in Strasbourg. A politician who recently died, Son San, a Democrat who trod the difficult path between the Khmer Rouge on the one hand and the pro-Vietnamese puppet regime on the other, gradually pushed ahead the re-establishment of a democratic Cambodia, chiefly with the help of the European Union and of the European Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we have an opportunity to build on this, and I am very pleased that the horrifying genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge will now be properly punished. But it is also very positive – and I would like to say that Mrs Iivari is quite right here – that we as the European Union have a chance to actively support democracy, the rule of law and plurality in modern Cambodia. However, this example should make us aware that it is not always a question of absolute power or authority. This House, thank goodness, now has greater powers as regards external policy than it had 20 years ago. It is a question of giving those who are deprived of their rights a moral voice and that is one of the primary duties of this House. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the past year, the Commission bilaterally, and together with the EU Member States, has called on the Cambodian government to express its support for the process leading up to the agreement on the Tribunal and has recalled that the Tribunal should meet international standards of justice, fairness and due process.</p>
<p class="contents">After some delays in the passing of the legislation, the draft law was adopted by the National Assembly on 2 January and by the Senate on 15 January. It is now due to be ratified by the Constitutional Council and King Norodom Sihanouk.</p>
<p class="contents">While we welcome the adoption of the legislation regarding the Khmer Rouge Tribunal, both by the National Assembly and by the Senate, it should be borne in mind that we are still awaiting the official statement from the United Nations on the draft text. There are indications that the text is not completely in line with what had been agreed with the United Nations. Nevertheless, the first reaction from the UN after receiving an unofficial translation, has been cautiously positive, and the Commission hopes, therefore, that the remaining outstanding issues can be resolved so that the UN can improve the new court and the agreement between the Cambodian government and the United Nations can be implemented expeditiously.</p>
<p class="contents">One other outstanding issue which the Commission will follow closely is the question of which Khmer Rouge leader will be put on trial. Although Prime Minister Hun Sen has given assurances that nobody would be immune from prosecution, he has also indicated that this is a very sensitive issue for parts of the Cambodian population. In particular, Hun Sen has warned that "war could break out" if the Khmer Rouge deputy premier Ieng Sary is put on trial. So there are very good reasons why we should follow this closely. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
