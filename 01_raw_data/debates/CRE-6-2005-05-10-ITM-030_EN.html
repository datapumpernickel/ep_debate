<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lapo Pistelli (ALDE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">author</span>. – <span class="italic">(IT)</span> Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am frankly unhappy about beginning my speech, as we would have preferred to have Commissioner Michel answer, because he is an attentive observer who has a thorough understanding of the situation. I am not detracting in any way from the presence of Commissioner Fischer Boel, however.</p>
<p class="contents">The last time that Parliament addressed this issue was last September, at the time of the visit by the delegation headed by Mrs Morgantini. Much has happened in Sudan since then, however: above all, there has been a successful conclusion to the negotiations which led to the signing of the comprehensive peace agreement on 25 January, putting an end to 21 years of civil war between the north and the south of the country, even though the set of protocols included in the agreement is very demanding and requires good will on both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, international attention has mounted over the ongoing tragedy in Darfur. It is a complex tragedy with many implications, and one that is difficult to summarise in a few minutes. Apart from the considerable attention it has received from the international community, it has also seen a remarkable humanitarian effort, particularly from the European Union, and recently also some significant pronouncements from the United Nations Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">What in our opinion lies at the heart of the problem, and therefore needs to be examined by this House, is understanding whether the positive agreement between the north and the south of the country, between Ali Osman Taha and John Garang, can be a good omen and thus have a positive influence on the Darfur conflict, or whether in fact the international community is running the risk that the unresolved problem in Darfur may instead destabilise the north-south peace agreement. The two issues are thus separate but closely connected, because they are occurring in the same country.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union is deeply committed because, on the one hand, it has contributed about EUR 400 million in humanitarian aid and, on the other, it is directly paying part of the costs of the AMIS mission, which is aimed at somehow maintaining relative stability in Darfur. In addition, there have been strong calls for the mission’s mandate to be considerably expanded and its strength greatly increased. It is worth remembering that Darfur covers a vast area about the size of France: it is particularly difficult to imagine that a military mission can carry out the important tasks assigned to it with a little under 3 000 men until recently, and now with 7 000 to 8 000 men.</p>
<p class="contents">Even so, we are aware that the situation in Darfur remains complex; there is not the violence of a year and a half ago, but abuses are still happening. If we cannot stop the violence, we cannot return the displaced people and refugees to their villages. Paradoxically, though, we are achieving the effect that the humanitarian machinery is working, the camps are working, but they are attracting new refugees, even from Chad, because they are oases of relative peace in a country which in contrast remains highly unstable and very violent.</p>
<p class="contents">With this oral question, which will also be followed up during this part session by a compromise resolution by the main political groups, we want to ask the Commission how much humanitarian aid there is and what it intends to do with it over the course of this year, and what schedule of commitments the Commission intends to promote for Darfur and for Sudan in general. We should also like to know whether we can work in conjunction with the Organisation for African Unity to set up a no-fly zone in Darfur, which will be the only way to stop the violence to any serious and credible degree.</p>
<p class="contents">Even though there was no room for my next point in the compromise resolution, I also want to ask whether the Commission considers it worthwhile to try to raise Europe’s level of political involvement by appointing a special representative for Darfur and Sudan – as we did for the Great Lakes and for Kosovo. Essentially, if the European Union is investing such great political and material resources to solve the problems in that area – it is the largest donor – it seems fair to ask whether it now intends to raise its presence politically. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In conjunction with the Member States, it has promoted intensive diplomatic activity in Sudan and international fora with a view to fostering tangible progress in the North-South peace negotiations that led to the signing of the overall peace agreement on 9 January, and to finding a solution to the Darfur crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is determined to support the implementation of the January peace agreement and to back the reforms planned for the six-year transitional period. In line with the international community, the European Union feels that these agreements offer an initial platform for tackling the various crises besetting Sudan, thereby providing a comprehensive and lasting solution to Sudan’s various crises, Darfur among them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission and the Member States therefore provided political and financial support for the negotiations that led to the ceasefire agreement of April 2004 between the Sudanese Government and the rebel movements. The EU has also been the main contributor, especially in financial terms, to the two African Union operations to monitor the ceasefire in Darfur. Though it recognises the benefits of the African Union’s operations in Darfur and the need to reinforce its mission, the Commission sees the immediate priority as being to make the African Union mission fully operational. At present it is operating at only 50% of its capacity. That calls for increased cooperation between the African Union, the European Union and other organisations, in particular those of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has repeatedly shown its support for the African Union’s efforts to find a political solution in Darfur and is attending the Abudja negotiations as an observer. The presidency has sent a special envoy to monitor the negotiations closely. The parties could also be offered technical support to facilitate the progress of the negotiations.</p>
<p class="contents">As for humanitarian aid, the European Union, through its Member States and the Commission, is one of Sudan’s biggest donors. The European Union has earmarked more than EUR 370 million in humanitarian aid for 2005, more than EUR 120 million of it in the form of food aid. The Commission has also earmarked EUR 60 million to support the African Union mission in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">Since the Darfur crisis figures among the international community’s main concerns, the European Union has targeted a substantial share of its humanitarian aid into that region. Since 1994, the Commission has granted Sudan approximately EUR 700 million in humanitarian aid. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, we are glad when things go in the right direction, and the conclusion of the peace treaty with the south in January is one example of this. All the parties to it must implement it without delay, and the 10 000 UNMIS soldiers deployed by the UN Security Council will help them do this. We thank those in Darfur who are helping the displaced persons, the injured and the victims of rape in their hour of need, and welcome the African Union’s reinforced presence there. Nor should we forget to mention the support we have given, enabling them to receive logistical help and other facilities from the European Union and individual Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Security Council has brought the situation in Darfur to the attention of the International Criminal Court. I see this as sending a clear message to everyone in Sudan, and also to those beyond its borders, that they cannot – contrary to what they evidently believe – go about doing the things that they are doing in Darfur without being punished for them.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has – as the Commissioner has just said – earmarked some EUR 400 million in resources for Sudan, and I do hope that this will be paid out only when the peace treaty is implemented in the south and when there have been objective improvements in the situation in Darfur. I have to say that I still regard the Sudanese Government as part of the problem rather than part of the solution.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, we heard yesterday that a human rights activist had been arrested shortly before he was due to travel to Dublin in order to receive a human rights prize. I therefore call for him, and the other persons arrested with him, to be released without delay.</p>
<p class="contents">It is with this sort of contradictory behaviour on the part of the Sudanese Government in mind that I ask the Commission whether there are safeguards to ensure that none of the EUR 400 million can under any circumstances be paid out as budget support and that the resources are not, in so far as possible, distributed through governmental structures or taking them as a basis; instead, the attempt should, if at all possible, make use of the aid organisations from abroad that are present in Darfur and elsewhere. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As Mr Gahler said, Dr Mudawi, a brave defender of human rights in Sudan was once again arrested by the Sudanese Government, by its National Security and Intelligence Agency. He was about to board a plane, ready to go to be presented with an award by the President of Ireland. That is continuing evidence – as if we needed it – of the determination of the Sudanese Government to harass human rights defenders and arbitrarily arrest, without trial, people who have the audacity to speak out. That evidence needs to be taken into account in the attitudes we take in terms of the EUR 4 billion of budgetary spending that has been allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">We need to be absolutely clear that we reject and are prepared to speak out about the attitude of the Sudanese Government to anyone who wishes to fight against oppression and for rights and freedoms. The suffering and agony of the Sudanese people demands a renewed and much more determined international effort on their behalf.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are talking about in Sudan is the real tragedy of our time. It is the failure of the international community to deal with ethnic cleansing, with mass rape and killings in that country.</p>
<p class="contents">I was looking only this morning at recent reports by NGOs about how banditry continues and how the difficulties of delivering humanitarian aid are exacerbated by this situation. The IDPs in Sudan are reporting very clearly to NGOs – and British NGOs are reporting to me – that they are identifying Arab militias that are now being absorbed into the army of the Government of Sudan and trained as soldiers.</p>
<p class="contents">The NGOs have reported continuing attacks, again this week, on women collecting firewood. Those women are now so desperate that they are selling part of their food rations in order to buy wood in the markets to try to avoid the attacks they experience as they leave the camps to get firewood.</p>
<p class="contents">We understand that ethnic cleansing has virtually now stopped. However, if you ask the African Union, they will tell you that it has largely stopped because ethnic cleansing is largely complete in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">Two million people are homeless, and they are still being terrorised by the Janjaweed militias. It is estimated that 197 000 people are seeking refuge in the inhospitable deserts of Chad, which we visited last December. Those people have lost everything but are still prepared, in desperation, to leave their country to go to Chad. The desperation of those people in Sudan puts into perspective some of the debates that we have in our countries in Europe about asylum and immigration.</p>
<p class="contents">Peacekeeping remains the key issue. The African Union is hopelessly stretched at this time and cannot fulfil its mandate unless we see much more concerted efforts to beef up the military support that they need in that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Much has been said about the tragedy, horror and suffering of the Sudanese people because of the war in Darfur. The United Nations commission of inquiry was rigorous in detailing the crimes committed and the responsibility of the various actors in the conflict, who must be judged by the International Criminal Court. Such crimes, and the criminals who perpetrated them, must not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, however, to talk about the positive things that I saw during the visit by the European Parliament-ACP delegation in March. Aniala Fatima, a displaced person, still frightened, who had been driven out of her ruined village, was waiting with thousands of other displaced people for her turn to tell the commission set up by the government what she had lost so she could receive compensation. In Fashr, during the meeting with the heads of families and tribes who together were deciding on a reconciliation pact, there were the fathers of the controlling militia and the fathers of rebel sons who were saying: ‘They are our sons; we have to make peace!’</p>
<p class="contents">In Juba, in the south ravaged by war, which is, however, experiencing hope because of that amazing, vital agreement, members of parliament and NGOs told us of the need to work fast, to clear the roads of landmines, to reunite divided families and to open the university under the watchful eye of UNMIS.</p>
<p class="contents">In Khartoum, the SPLM, which is no longer in hiding or is trying to develop a political movement and no longer a military one, has its offices open, and they told us that it was not a problem for them to be in Khartoum, and the African Union is also there, talking to both the rebels and the army and learning what to do to resolve the situation.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot say any more because I only have two minutes, but I think it is essential that the role of our Parliament and of the European Union should be not to condemn, but to seek solutions to the conflict, poverty, injustice and lack of democracy that are still ravaging that country. In that respect, the financial aid promised at the Oslo conference of donor countries is decisive, as is the aid from the European Union. We need to work fast because peace needs to be nurtured and, in Darfur, in addition to the desertification and poverty, thousands and thousands of people are waiting to be able to return home in safety. I therefore believe that we must act as I have suggested and work for peace. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In all our peace initiatives, we must be constantly aware that, for the perpetrators of terror, peace is a threat that they will resist with all their might because peace will mean eventual conviction in the war crimes courts.

It will allow the EU to do a great deal to stabilise the situation in Sudan, but Mr Pistelli is right to ask how humanitarian aid for Sudan is actually being distributed. The EU must not dole out money indiscriminately, without asking whether the authorities in Khartoum are ensuring that basic standards are met. We are still waiting for a clear answer to the question of whether the rights of religious minorities in the country are observed. The concern is that Christians are being persecuted, as they previously were in a number of other African countries. This issue was raised by the European Union and by the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries during the Parliamentary Assembly. Neither Sudan nor Africa said anything in reply, but I hope that the EU will not follow their example. It would be a mistake for us to donate money without investigating the situation regarding human rights, and in particular that regarding the rights of religious minorities. This issue should be and needs to be considered as part of the equation. Present and future relations between the European Union and the African Union must be built on the basis of respect for human rights standards. In my opinion, this is the main point to emerge from the current debate. I share the reservations voiced earlier in this Chamber by Mrs Kinnock. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A recent estimate by the British House of Commons Select Committee put the casualty figures as high as 300 000, with 10 000 people dying each month from disease, starvation and atrocities, and two million people homeless and displaced, destabilising neighbouring Chad. Whether one calls it genocide or not, it still amounts to the most serious systematic violation of fundamental rights probably anywhere on the globe.</p>
<p class="contents">The African Union urgently needs to help stop the killing in Darfur, where whole villages have been bombed and torched, where mass executions and rape are common and where an Aids crisis is now looming. Millions have fallen victim to a scorched earth struggle between Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir’s Arab-dominated regime, and its Janjaweed militias, and ethnic African secessionists in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">At last, the United Nations is acting, under Security Council Resolution 1593, with a referral of those accused of war crimes to the ICC. China, a traditional ally of Sudan because it has oil investments there, and the United States, which opposes the ICC, have both acquiesced and abstained in the Security Council.</p>
<p class="contents">While the fighting has cooled off, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan this week appealed for an African force of 12 000 troops, up from the 7 500 expected by August and the 2 500 African Union troops who are already in the region. Kofi Annan also wants non-African states to supply more troops, and Canada has been one of the first to agree.</p>

As has already been said, this House exists not only to analyse and criticise – very important though I believe these things are in this case – but also to supply answers and to help secure justice. It is for this reason that I echo our motion for a resolution in saying that I welcome the UN Security Council’s decision to mandate the International Criminal Court to examine the situation in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">The conflict in Darfur has made refugees of over a million men, women and children. The UNHCR is working on the assumption that there are over 200 000 refugees from Darfur in Sudan’s neighbour, Chad. While there are frequent reports of attacks on refugees, the UNHCR is also very concerned about those on internally displaced persons in Darfur, where women tell how they are raped when they go in search of firewood or water. This makes it important that those traumatised by being displaced within their own country should be spared the further trauma of being forced to return to their homes. Any movement on the part of persons displaced within their own country must be purely of their own free will. That, too, is something for which we call in our motion for a resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We also call on the Sudanese Government to cooperate with the International Criminal Court, ensuring that those charged with crimes against humanity are brought before it. Only when these people stop getting off scot-free will there be a chance of stability and peace. The culture of impunity must be brought to an end; that will do a great deal to help establish justice.</p>
<p class="contents">We have also been told that, following the signature of the peace treaty, the Commission and the Sudanese Government together hammered out a country strategy paper. As the object of such country strategy papers is the promotion of peace, democracy and human rights, the recent arrest of the human rights activist Dr Mudawi is more than disturbing, and gives cause to question the willingness of the Sudanese Government to pursue these goals. This House must send out a clear message by demanding that Dr Mudawi be released without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is important for the EU’s actions to take place within the framework of UN cooperation and for the EU’s efforts to be made in cooperation with institutions that have extensive experience and legitimacy such as the WHO or the UN World Food Programme. I welcome the UN’s efforts in the Sudan conflict, such as the recent creation of the 10 000-man strong UN mission, UMIS. I am also well disposed towards the proposal to increase the African Union’s presence in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">For my part, it has always been important that it should be the UN that, in the first place, acts in this conflict. The UN should act in cooperation with the African Union. Possible EU actions need to be focused upon humanitarian aid following consultation with the UN. The UN plans to contribute aid totalling USD 1.5 billion during 2005. That is the single largest UN appeal of this year. It is important that the EU’s aid efforts be coordinated with those of the UN and that they take place in consultation with the UN. In that way, the world’s total efforts in Sudan will achieve their maximum effect. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

After 21 years of civil war and raging ethnic conflicts between north and south, a peace treaty has been signed between the government and the Sudan People’s Liberation Army. For this country – the largest in Africa – this is a great opportunity. What is vital now is that millions of refugees should be helped to return to living conditions worthy of human beings, to provide themselves with the basic necessities of life, which means not just food and drinking water, demining and the return of land to its owners, but most of all ensuring their physical security. Although the European Union’s strategy, which involves supporting the Sudan to the tune of EUR 400 million, is the right response, it is necessary, above all, that the release of these resources be made conditional upon the implementation of the peace treaty and, in particular, on the improvement of the situation in the south-western province of Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of things have been happening in this province since our debate last September. The UN Security Council has handed over the grave violations of human rights in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. The UN’s commission of inquiry into the war crimes in this province has unequivocally described them as no less serious in their cruelty than genocide. The fly in the ointment, in terms of what is happening in Sudan, is that the situation in Darfur remains extremely precarious and is capable of dragging Sudan as a whole headlong into the abyss again. It is alarming that the human rights activist Dr Mudawi has been arrested along with a colleague and his driver, and I can do no other than endorse the call for his immediate release.</p>
<p class="contents">A third element that is having a positive impact is the role played by the African Union, which has built up its forces to a significant degree, although the size of Darfur makes its 7 700 men no more than a drop in the ocean. Both the EU and Nato should, though, be cautious about committing themselves militarily to peacemaking operations. The European strategy, which is founded upon the secure supply of food and education, repatriation and the building-up of administrative and governmental capacities, whilst also planning demobilisation, disarmament and the training of security forces, is surely the right way to stabilise the situation in the long term. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe, however, that even if desirable in absolute terms, peace in Darfur alone would not be sustainable and that it should be part and parcel of a political solution for the entire country.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be stressed that nothing short of full compliance with the ceasefire agreement by all the warring parties will facilitate resumption of the political dialogue between the Sudanese Government and the rebels in Abuja. It is important that these negotiations resume as soon as possible and that all the parties stop insisting on unrealistic preconditions that block the whole process.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission also considers that the post-Naivasha political agenda is the right framework for reaching a lasting political solution for the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission favours a balanced approach towards the Sudanese Government and the main political actors in Sudan. This balanced approach consists of positive and negative measures, depending on the course of action taken by the government and the other main political actors.</p>
<p class="contents">Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement, the Commission has decided gradually to resume its development cooperation with a contribution of EUR 400 million. The Commission is also ready to support the parties seeking a peaceful solution for Darfur and other regions of Sudan through the political framework of the Naivasha process.</p>
<p class="contents">However, as the Commission stated at the recent Oslo Donors’ Conference on Sudan, the speed at which it resumes its cooperation will depend largely on the degree of progress in effective CPA implementation and a real improvement in the situation in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, the Commission supports the recent UN resolutions, including the threat of sanctions and the referral of cases of perpetrators of crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court as a necessary means of putting an end to impunity and to violence in Darfur.</p>
<p class="contents">An AU evaluation mission carried out from 10 to 22 March, with the participation of the United Nations and the European Union, assessed the need for enhancing peace-support efforts in Darfur, including exploring ways of strengthening AMIS 2. The mission’s findings acknowledged the positive role of AMIS in the areas where it has been deployed. However, as I mentioned previously, it estimates that AMIS is currently operating at only about 50% of its operational capacity. It is important to bring AMIS up to full operational capacity before deciding on its reinforcement.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is ready to contribute to meeting the challenges in Darfur, together with the AU and its partners. The sustainable reinforcement of African capabilities could be fast-tracked if the lessons learned from this operation were applied to the security sector as well. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
