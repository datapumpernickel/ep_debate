<p class="contents">It is indeed correct that Member States may exempt from VAT small-value commercial consignments from third countries, but these <span class="italic">de minimis </span>thresholds, which may be set at either EUR 10 or EUR 22, are not determined by the Commission but rather have been laid down in Article 22 of Council Directive 83/181/EEC. Moreover, these relief thresholds are optional. Member States may therefore choose to apply VAT on the importation of goods which have been purchased by mail order. Some Member States, such as Belgium, do so.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is aware of the potentially competitive distortions that may arise from commercial third-country <span class="italic">de minimis</span> supplies of goods. A technical working group, chaired by my services, has established that an increasing range of products such as DVDs, video games, flowers, contact lenses, books, other printed matter and CDs are imported regularly from third countries. The level of economic distortions cannot be established without further economic analysis.</p>
<p class="contents">On the Commission's initiative Member States have agreed to carry out detailed economic surveys to analyse the economic dimension of this problem. In particular it is necessary to establish whether the potential competitive distortions arising from the application of the EUR 10 or EUR 22 tax relief pose a serious threat to business and employment inside the European Union. Further initiatives at Community level will depend on the outcome of these surveys. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is quite clear that you have identified the situation and are taking some action. However, could you not take action more rapidly? This problem was brought to my attention by a constituent in the city of Leeds who has a small company selling DVDs – the kind of materials you mentioned – and employs 31 people. A company based in the Channel Islands, which operates a lot of its activities quite legitimately from the UK mainland, is seriously threatening his business. This is a serious problem. By setting up a task force you have recognised that it is a serious problem across the Union. Given how long this has been going on – you mentioned the directive going back to 1983 – how long will it be before your task force produces proposals for action? Whilst I accept that Member States may have an interim option to adopt measures which would save companies from this unfair competition, please could you tell us when you are going to save everybody in the Union from it and take some action through the task force? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In itself it is a welcome phenomenon of the internal market and therefore we should try to further such commerce. The problem then arises of the payment of VAT and excise duties, and thus the problem to which Mr Bowe referred. As I said earlier, we cannot really propose a useful course of action until and unless we have analysed the situation and that analysis is based on the investigations of Member States into the size of the problem. Only then, when we have that analysis, can we propose something useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Bowe will be interested to know that Member States will be gathering details until July of this year, so in a few months' time the intelligence ought to have been gathered and then the Commission can propose a useful course of action – but only if it is decided that there is a distortion of the internal market; and secondly, of course, we want to target only those commercial consignments which really present a problem. After all, if one asks people to comply with certain requirements, it needs to be checked that these are correct and this implies a cost for the governments concerned; that is basically the reason for the <span class="italic">de minimis</span> rule. There may be exceptions and it may quite possibly be that Mr Bowe's constituents form such an exception, but I would ask Mr Bowe to give us until the end of June or July of this year, and then we will come back to the matter if Mr Bowe so desires. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Abolition of the scheme of generalised tariff preferences for some sectors in Central America and the Andean Community, through graduation</span></p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission take the view that abolishing tariff preferences (through the adoption by the EC of proposal (COM/2003/0045 final) for a Council regulation implementing Article 12 of Council Regulation (EC) 2501/2001<a href="#def_1_1" name="ref_1_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>) for the sector live plants, flowers, edible vegetables and fruit in Colombia, as a consequence of applying the graduation mechanism, will help a country in which there are around 26 million people living in poverty, almost 30 000 violent deaths each year and around 10 kidnappings per day, in its fight against drug production and trafficking?</p>
<p class="contents">Does the Commission not take the view that this measure may jeopardise the fragile economic, social and environmental progress made by Costa Rica in a sector which is concentrated in disadvantaged areas of the country that are highly susceptible to natural disasters, and which provides employment above all for women breadwinners and for immigrants from Nicaragua?</p>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Lamy,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(FR)</span> I would remind you that the graduation mechanism, which is the subject of Mr Salafranca's question, has been part of our Generalised System of Preferences since 1995. This system seeks to encourage the economic development of the countries benefiting from these preferences by enabling them to increase their exports to the Community and by targeting these tariff preferences at the countries that need them most.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective of this system is to encourage the development of exports from the countries that benefit from the preferences, with the corollary that the preferential treatment has to stop once this objective is reached. This system of trade preferences cannot go on forever; it has to have a time limit, which is why we have the graduation mechanism. This enables limits to be imposed, based on the fact that only some sectors need the GSP. This graduation is determined by objective and neutral criteria, which are included in our legislation and are directly linked to the export specialisation in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission understands the concerns expressed by Mr Salafranca, which moreover coincide with those expressed by some of the beneficiary countries. Nevertheless, we feel that, overall, fears about the impact of this graduation are exaggerated, even if we are prepared to show a little flexibility in this case.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Colombia, which is the subject of the first part of your question, most of the exports concerned are cut flowers and the exports mainly go to the American market. It is therefore not very likely that a slight increase in European customs duties will affect the general level of exports of cut flowers from Colombia.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of Costa Rica, where it is both plants and cut flowers that are affected, we do not share the concerns that have been expressed in various quarters either. Costa Rica is a country that is developing relatively well. Its overall economic situation has improved and in terms of specialisation, which defines as it were the competitiveness of a sector in the country compared with this same sector in other countries, it is clear that Costa Rica remains competitive.</p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to your question about the impact of the graduation mechanism on countries that benefit from the specific system of preferences fighting against the cultivation of drugs, it is true that when it was first set up the graduation mechanism did not apply to the 'Drugs' GSP. The situation was changed in 2001 with a Council regulation applying the new scheme of preferences up to 2005 and bringing the 'Drugs' GSP into line as it were with the standard scheme. Why this change? Because we wanted to avoid this 'Drugs' GSP being challenged at the WTO on the grounds of its discriminatory nature. Incidentally it did not escape the attention of India, which has opened a dispute against us before the WTO on this matter. I think that we should be able to defend ourselves.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us take a look at the results of applying the graduation mechanism in the past. We see that the withdrawal of preferences has generally not hindered exports of the products concerned from the beneficiary countries. If we look at what has happened in the region mentioned in the question, and in particular in Chile and Mexico, we see that applying graduation has not stopped exports from these countries continuing to grow. It is also true that multilateral negotiations are yielding regular cuts in customs duties, with the result that both duties and preferences are less and less significant as time goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us remember finally that if this preferential treatment is withdrawn, it is the European importer that has to pay the duty in question, perhaps by cutting his margin slightly, and we all know that in the case of an importer this is usually comfortable.</p>
<p class="contents">Colombia and Costa Rica therefore meet the objective conditions in our legislation for having the graduation mechanism applied and we do not agree with the analysis according to which this would be a considerable blow to their economies. Graduation is not a sanction; quite the opposite. It means that the exports of the country concerned have reached a level that is self-sustaining without the support of the preferences system and that the objectives of economic competitiveness and maturity that we wanted to foster have been reached.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, and to respond to the concerns that have been expressed both by several Members of Parliament and by some of our Member States, as well as by some traders and, obviously, by the countries in question, the Commission has agreed to show a degree of flexibility. The graduation mechanism, which was supposed to enter into force at the end of 2002 as provided for in the regulation, has not yet entered into force and the countries have therefore been able to continue to benefit from the GSP. The final date is still under discussion and should be decided on shortly by the Council of Ministers. So, even though we do not share all of the concerns that have been expressed, in this case we have started to show flexibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Commissioner, I have listened very carefully to your reply for 6 minutes, but I would like to ask, from a political point of view, whether it can seriously be argued that the removal of these preferences, through the modulation mechanism, is going to benefit a country such as Colombia which has 26 million people living in poverty and in which 30 000 people die as a result of violence each year? Or a country such as Costa Rica, where these products are cultivated in sensitive areas, where there are immigrants, heads of families and women? I frankly believe, Commissioner, that they are not going to benefit these countries, and that no comparison can be made with Mexico or with Chile. You avoided answering the fourth and fifth aspects of my question and I am not going to ask you to reply, but you spoke of flexibility and I would like to know how the Commission measures its flexibility. By being able to hold talks in relation to the entry into force of these measures? Would the Commission be prepared to remove agricultural substitute products from this system? And finally, what does the Commission intend to do when the Drugs system of generalised preferences expires in 2004? Does the Commission intend to renew it? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nevertheless, as political as it may be, its objective is to apply the treaties, rules and legislation that the European Union has adopted for itself. If we do not do so then we are failing in our duties, and that is a political matter, not a technical one.</p>
<p class="contents">Is this modest reduction in customs duties on cut flowers going to have a serious and lasting impact on Costa Rica and Colombia? We do not think so. You can express a contrary view. The only thing that can decide between us for the time being are precedents. And the precedents have shown us that there were no major risks.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, it is because it is sensitive to the political situation that the Commission has agreed to delay implementation of this graduation. Until when? We are in the process of discussing this with the Council of Ministers, which, as is so often the case where trade policy is concerned, has the last word on this matter. Would a specific derogation for agricultural products be welcome? We do not think so, for one simple reason: that it would further weaken the compatibility with WTO rules of our generalised system of preferences, which, as you know, has been challenged by India on the grounds, I might add, that it does not benefit from the 'Drugs' GSP itself. We do not therefore wish to bring grist to the mill of those who, as it were, want to see the back of this scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, what will happen in 2004? The scheme expires at the end of 2004 and we will decide next year between two options which currently seem to be possibilities: either to modify the scheme as from 1 January 2005 or to extend it for a certain period of time. The choice between these two hypotheses will depend on how far the round of negotiations has advanced, because it would be good to know the general trend in tariff levels before determining the exact preferences. This decision will be made by the Commission during the course of next year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The ECHO office in Amman is the regional hub for the Iraq crisis. This office has recently expanded and now has seven expatriate technical assistants and 10 local staff positions. It covers Iraq and the rest of the Middle East. There is also an antenna in Jerusalem consisting of one expatriate technical assistant and three local-official positions.</p>
<p class="contents">Amman was selected as regional hub for this crisis because this office has adequate human and logistic resources to respond immediately to the new needs in the field. The Technical Assistant's role is to assess the situation on the ground, analyse the needs and make recommendations to ECHO. Once aid is approved, the Technical Assistant monitors its implementation on the ground. The Technical Assistant also coordinates with other donors and humanitarian stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">It must, however, be emphasised that ECHO is not an implementing organisation. The actual delivery of humanitarian aid is undertaken by ECHO's partners. These are international humanitarian organisations, such as the Red Cross, UN agencies and European humanitarian NGOs.</p>
<p class="contents">Regular monitoring visits were carried out before the crisis. Three missions from headquarters and the field have visited Iraq since January this year. The main aim of these visits was to prepare for the consequences of what was then a potential crisis. Such visits have now been suspended. ECHO Technical Assistants are currently following the crisis from Amman.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO will restart needs assessment and monitoring missions as soon as security conditions allow. ECHO will then reassess the need to further strengthen its presence on the ground. For the time being, however, ECHO sees its presence as adequate.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the viability of a permanent structure in Iraq and in the region, I can already say that, as was done with Afghanistan, ECHO intends to open an office in Baghdad as soon as the security situation improves. This office will be answerable to the regional office in Amman. It is possible that some personnel will be transferred from Amman to Baghdad. ECHO also envisages opening an office in Iran if there are large movements of refugees there.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO Amman is ready to provide operational, logistic and administrative back-up for the future ECHO antenna in Baghdad in the form of staff, equipment, assistance and so on at the outset of a presence there.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the evaluation of ECHO's activities, I would like to recall, in the first place, that an independent broader evaluation of ECHO's functioning carried out in 1999 stated that 'ECHO is currently financing the delivery of humanitarian assistance at least as well as any other organisation, and probably better and in a more cost-efficient manner than any other comparable international organisation'.</p>
<p class="contents">There were also a number of recommendations and specific critical points in this evaluation and we have followed up very actively on the evaluation. We do this with a view to improving the overall quality of ECHO's management of activities, also including the verification of the results. I would like to mention the main ones.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, ECHO has introduced the logical framework approach and promoted the use of standardised performance indicators, to better measure the results and evaluate the impact of its activities wherever possible. This will also stimulate an improvement of the project proposals we get from our implementing partners and we can already see clearly this effect.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO has in parallel increased the supervision and the technical coordination of all the financed activities, notably at field level, by increasing the technical assistance capacity and creating regional support offices, as I just explained regarding the situation in Amman, and also working towards a more standardised basic approach in each sector of intervention, especially in the area of health support.</p>
<p class="contents">Another step forward in the improvement of our performance based on lessons learned was the establishment of Strategic Programming Dialogues in order to strengthen cooperation and strategies at operational and policy level. Since 2000, an extensive ever-improving strategic dialogue has been taking place with all major ECHO partners: UN agencies, NGOs and other international organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO has furthermore given increased priority and now prepares better for the interfaces of linking rehabilitation, relief, development and so on, playing a more proactive role, calling for coordination meetings with relevant Commission services and other donors, both at field and headquarters levels. Projects are earmarked with aid phases identifying those operations which can possibly be handed over to development donors, and this whole effort has been quite successful. If we look at East Timor, Kosovo and even Afghanistan, this gradual handing over has been better than in the case of previous conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">In parallel with the introduction of these key elements for improving performance, every year ECHO now presents an evaluation plan by the start of the new budgetary year. Evaluations are thus synchronised with the planning and implementation of all stages of ECHO's operations. Evaluations focus on country operations, on partners and thematic issues. The evaluation plan ensures, on a two-yearly basis, that all major operations are now being evaluated.</p>
<p class="contents">A programme of evaluation using external consultants, and focused on ECHO operations, partners' capacity as well as on specific thematic issues, is therefore ongoing. Of particular relevance are the recent evaluations of the UNHCR and the World Food Programme, major international partners which also play a major role in the present crisis in Iraq. The evaluation reports are periodically published on ECHO's website, once Member States have been informed.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, it should be mentioned that ECHO has also undertaken the implementation of the Commission reform programme. This has positively influenced all administrative and financial aspects of the Commission's work.</p>
<p class="contents">ECHO is today in a totally different situation compared to the situation when this Commission came into office. A recent article in <span class="italic">European Voice </span>made me think that what was promised by me in the hearing in Parliament in August 1999 has been delivered. ECHO is today, for good reason, a respected player in the game of international humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">Coming to the last part of the question, as regards the existence of an agreement with the United Nations for tackling 'the day after' in Iraq, I recall what the European Council stated on 21 March, that the UN should play a central role during and after the current crisis. My view here is simply that the UN system has a unique – I repeat: unique – legitimacy, mandate, capacity and practical experience in coordinating assistance in post-conflict situations. That is where that discussion should start. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They deal with these reports in accordance with established procedures and pass them on as appropriate to police, Internet service providers and other hotlines.</p>
<p class="contents">The awareness projects funded under the Safer Internet Action Plan have as one of their tasks to spread awareness of hotlines. The expenditure in the period 1999 to 2002 totalled EUR 9.869 million. The Commission considers this to be the most cost-effective approach. This task will therefore continue for awareness notes under the new European Awareness Network which will be set up in the second phase of the Safer Internet Action Plan 2003-2004 where the honourable Member acted as rapporteur.</p>
<p class="contents">The Safer Internet Action Plan currently funds hotlines in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Spain, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Finland, the United Kingdom and Iceland, as well as the European Association of Hotlines.</p>
<p class="contents">Expenditure from the Community budget in the period 1999 to 2002 totalled EUR 3.9 million. The average annual contribution per hotline is EUR 76 500. The main method of contacting the hotlines is not via the telephone but through forms on web-pages and email. The hotlines have used a variety of methods to inform the public about how to contact them. For instance, in Spain, the national hotline has a hyperlink on the homepage of <span class="italic">Terra</span>, the main Spanish portal.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission does not currently have figures on the visibility of hotlines in terms of recognition by the general public, but a question about hotline visibility will be included in a Europe-wide Eurobarometer survey planned for later this year. I am sure that then we will have more accurate information.</p>
<p class="contents">Statistics show a steadily increasing number of reports to all hotlines. Over a six-month period, hotlines funded under the Safer Internet Action Plan processed more than 35 000 reports, of which almost 19 000 were reports on child pornography. The Commission considers this to be a significant number and that the hotlines give good value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation underlying this number of reports is a matter of gravest concern. The Commission has been an active participant in further action to deal with it, including proposing a framework decision on child pornography. We are happy to supply further details on the actions and events provided by the hotlines directly to the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Endocrine disrupting chemicals and test methods</span></p>
<p class="contents">In its opinion of 26 October 2000<a href="#def_1_2" name="ref_1_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, Parliament called on the Commission to apply the cautionary principle in relation to endocrine disrupting chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">According to COM/2001/0262 final: 'The availability of agreed test strategies/methods to identify and assess endocrine disrupting chemicals is a basic requirement for comprehensive legislative action aimed at protecting people and the environment from the potential dangers posed by these chemicals.' The test methods are to be determined by the OECD's Endocrine Disrupters Testing and Assessment Task Force (EDTA) set up in 1998. At that point, the Commission expected that recognised methods for testing the effects on health would be available during 2002, while methods for testing the effects on the environment would be developed between 2003 and 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">Against this background, will the Commission provide details of the results of the EDTA's work and will it confirm that endocrine disrupters will be covered by the legislation on chemicals on a par with other hazardous substances? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This communication set out the actions that would be undertaken to address the potential environmental and health impacts of endocrine disruption, in line with the Commission's obligation to protect the human health and the environment within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, the availability of agreed test strategies and methods to identify and assess endocrine-disrupting chemicals is a basic requirement for comprehensive legislative action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission participates in the OECD Endocrine Disrupters Testing and Assessment Task Force (EDTA) which was set up in 1998. The main duties of this task force are to develop an internationally harmonised testing strategy and to coordinate and oversee the work of different sub-groups charged with developing new test guidelines, or revise existing ones to assess the potential endocrine-disrupting properties of chemicals.</p>
<p class="contents">The task force has reached a consensus on the development of a conceptual framework. This will provide the opportunity for sorting and prioritisation of chemicals of concern based upon existing information rather than on new data to be generated as part of the assessment process. This framework generates information on mechanistic data <span class="italic">in vitro</span>, <span class="italic">in vivo</span>, and/or on other adverse effects from endocrine and other mechanisms.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition the task force has defined a set of methods to be developed and validated: a comparison of sensitivity, relevance and reliability of the tests for testing the effects of endocrine disrupters on human health and/or the environment.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest estimates are that agreed test methods for some environmental effects are expected from this year to 2005 while some test methods relevant for human health risk assessment are expected to be finalised between this year and 2004. New validated and agreed tests for endocrine disruption will help a clearer identification of endocrine disrupters and allow informed judgements to be made on the likelihood of adverse effects.</p>
<p class="contents">As part of the Community strategy for endocrine disrupters the Commission launched a dedicated call for research proposals in 2001. A total of EUR 20 million was allocated to this initiative and, together with further funding under the Fifth European Research and Development Framework Programme, approximately EUR 59 million is currently being spent on research into the potential impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on human health and the environment. This research includes the development of novel testing methods.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recognise that endocrine disruption is not a toxicological end point <span class="italic">per se</span>, as is cancer or allergy, but that it is a mechanism of action that may lead to adverse toxic effects. By the nature of their effects most of the endocrine disrupters would normally qualify as CMRs – carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic to reproduction. Such chemicals will have to undergo authorisation under the REACH system foreseen in the White Paper on the Future Chemicals Policy. Furthermore, adverse affects on the endocrine system of wildlife species have been causally linked to certain persistent biocumulative and toxic substances which will also be subject to authorisation.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is currently considering whether to include in the draft proposal for the REACH regulation a provision to the effect that substances characterised as persistent biocumulative and toxic, or very persistent and very biocumulative – and, on a case-by-case basis, those substances of equivalent level of concern, such as endocrine disrupters not already caught by the CMR criteria – should be subject to authorisation. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would like to thank Commissioner Wallström for a very full answer. The reason for my question is, of course, that it is taking time to find these recognised test methods. We should have had a method for the effects on health last year, and for the effects on the environment now in 2003–2005. Now I understand that the methods for health effects will not be produced until 2004; these test strategies that are to be developed through OECD systems have become something of a perpetual motion machine. I find this very alarming, since it means that nothing can be done. Unless the substances are also toxic or hazardous for other reasons, we cannot even start to apply the precautionary principle, since there are no recognised test methods.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to ask about the last thing that Commissioner Wallström mentioned, namely the issue of getting hormone-disturbing substances included in the category of ‘hazardous substances’ in new chemicals legislation and as an independent hazard criterion, on a par with what may be carcinogenic or mutagenic substances. Surely it is important to take the step now and say that this is something that is so risky for us that there is a need for us to include it as an independent hazard criterion? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, it is important for the EU to participate in an international context. This is clearly a cross-border problem. It is important for us to remain within the framework of the OECD’s activities and to try to develop these methods. I do not believe that there is anyone who wants to delay this work. On the contrary, we all feel a need to press on and ensure that we as quickly as possible obtain test methods and systems for working with these hormone-disturbing substances. We can only promise that we shall do everything we can to ensure that the work produces good results.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are now discussing in connection with the new chemicals legislation is the fact that, as long as we lack clear definitions and clear test methods, together with agreed systems for using these, we must act on a case-by-case basis. The fact that, in the discussions we have had so far, specific mention has been made of the group of endocrine-disrupting substances is a factor pointing in the direction of future clarity. The next stage is just to work as quickly as we can to come up with agreed methods of dealing with such substances. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, to my knowledge, there is no specific proposal on the table. We must be aware that, according to the Treaties, civil protection measures fall under the competence of the Member States. Therefore, any such measures at Community level must strictly respect the principle of subsidiarity.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, many different sectors are involved in civil protection. The ways in which they cooperate are organised differently in different Member States. Therefore the practical implications of establishing an EU-wide civil protection corps would require thorough analysis. However, the idea of creating such a corps is certainly interesting and I shall follow with interest the discussions on this issue in the European Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Independently from these discussions, I can inform you that the Commission is already active in this field, although this seems to be little known. At the Commission's initiative, a Community mechanism to facilitate and reinforce cooperation in the field of civil protection has been set up. At present, all Member States, eleven candidate countries and the three EEA countries participate in this EU framework, which can provide a method for better civil protection coordination inside as well as outside the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">One of the key elements in this context has been the establishment, within the Commission, of the EU Civil Protection Response Centre. This centre has been in place since 1 January 2002 and is available on a permanent basis, 24 hours a day. Once activated by a request from one of the participating countries, the centre can immediately call upon Member States' civil protection resources, as already pre-identified for all types of major emergencies. If you wish, I can also mention when this response centre has been used and where we have intervened.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission considers that the EU Response Centre, which builds on all available national capacities, represents an effective tool that responds to the concerns expressed by the honourable Member. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

What happens if a Member State does not appeal to it and is not itself able to act? I was in Galicia ten days after the disaster. The Belgian civil protection service arrived, but nothing was organised. If there were, for example, to be a disaster off the Latvian coast in two years’ time, that would be a problem. I think that we do need to have at our disposal a corps that can take immediate action.</p>

<p class="contents">Immediately after the accident on 13 November 2002, the Centre was first activated by the Spanish authorities and subsequently by the Portuguese and French authorities as well. Altogether, eight requests for assistance were registered and their immediate treatment through the Response Centre made it possible to organise and channel the offers made by all the other European countries. Thus, following the accident, an impressive range and quantity of resources – including 15 oil-combating vessels, more than 20 kilometres of booms and several specialised surveillance aircraft – were put at the disposal of the national competent authorities affected.</p>
<p class="contents">The Response Centre also coordinated the assistance offered to the three countries, it sent a group of Community experts immediately following the accident and has offered to co-finance, with Spain, an environmental study on the consequences of the accident.</p>
<p class="contents">What if one of the new Member States requests our assistance? Of course the Response Centre will be used in the same way and we will offer assistance from all Member States. Now we can mobilise and coordinate the help and assistance of all Member States. In addition, we are cooperating on a regular basis with those national authorities and services that deal with civil protection, so we can learn from each other.</p>
<p class="contents">We also have exercises whereby we can actually simulate a major accident, even with biological or chemical weapons. This has improved our capacity considerably, but it is perhaps not so well known. It is time to make it more visible and time to ensure that we actually intervene immediately after accidents. All the new Member States know about our Response Centre and we offer the support of all Member States in cases like this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Between 1997 and 2002, the candidate countries received an allocation of more than EUR 300 million from the PHARE programme for external border management. Romania and Bulgaria continue to benefit from PHARE assistance and will see their national budget under the programme increase between 2004 and 2006. For its part, Turkey will also receive more European funds for the same objective.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Article 35 of the draft treaty of accession provides for the creation of a temporary financial instrument comprising EUR 858 million for seven new Member States. Between 2004 and 2006, the Schengen mechanism will cover the cost of the investment necessary to increase the level of security and protection along the European Union's external borders after enlargement. Priority will be given to investment in infrastructure, equipment, training of border guards, logistics and operations. All of this is necessary to guarantee compliance with Schengen standards for protecting the future external borders and thus to ensure an appropriate level of security within the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As regards the prospect of a European corps of border guards being created, I would draw your attention to the fact that the action plan that was proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 13 June 2002 provides for cooperation to be gradually stepped up and for joint teams to be gradually put in place to police the external borders, leading, eventually, to the creation of a corps of European border guards. This means that the political decision has not been taken and that the Council has said that this will come later, after cooperative operations have been developed.</p>
<p class="contents">What I can say to Mr Posselt is that cooperative operations already started during 2002, both to police internal borders, with a centre for the control of land borders being set up in Germany, and on the southern maritime border, in the Mediterranean, with operations being undertaken jointly by Spain, Italy, France, Portugal and the United Kingdom. All of these specific examples of joint operations were funded by the ARGO programme. The natural development of these centres for border control and the joint operations should raise the question of the formal creation of a border police. But the Council has not set a date. I hope that the need for such a border police will be demonstrated and that the Convention on the Future of Europe will give impetus to this project.</p>
<p class="contents">The police academy does exist virtually. We continue to support the idea that it should be a formal institution with a formal headquarters. As you know, this issue is part of the 'agencies' package that is under scrutiny by the European Council. Unfortunately, we do not yet have a response from the Council. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Several Member States are working with Slovakia and Poland to police the external land borders. In this respect, I can say that the Commission is insisting that the candidate countries take their commitment to police these borders seriously and that the Council working group tasked with assessing border controls and the centre for land borders, based in Germany, are monitoring all issues relating to the future external land border very carefully, and that includes the Slovak green border, but also the Polish green border, which is quite extensive.</p>
<p class="contents">I can therefore say that although the Commission cannot provide border guards itself, we are supporting all of the joint operations carried out by Slovakia and the Member States that seek to improve the policing of this border.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps I might also add in this regard that I believe it is right to acknowledge that all of these countries have made very significant progress on border policing. They have not yet reached the standard required by the Schengen Agreement. That is precisely why accession to Schengen will take place in stages and in accordance with a method based on assessing each country's actual ability to guarantee the security of the European Union's external borders after enlargement. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In the communication that the Commission issued a few months ago on immigration and development policy, it tried to give you a picture of everything it is doing in the field of development policy that is relevant for migratory flows, not only fighting poverty but also guaranteeing the rule of law and respect for human rights, and guaranteeing there are no 'pull' factors inducing people to leave their own country and travel, sometimes illegally, to the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Such an approach has been not only a balanced but also a realistic approach. We are developing all the elements of the action plan, not only the operational part, but also the legislative one, and in several areas that you have mentioned, such as asylum legislation, we have been adopting the necessary rules that were provided for by the Tampere programme.

<p class="contents"><span class="bold">Subject: Crime: EU-wide measures to prevent mobile phone theft</span></p>
<p class="contents">The number of mobile phones stolen in the EU, often by international gangs, is probably in the millions every year, and a recent Eurobarometer survey showed that one-fifth to one-third of people in most Member States fear being the victim of such a theft. In the UK reprogramming of a stolen mobile has been made illegal and there is now cooperation among UK operators through the GSM Association, with a shared database of IMEI numbers of stolen handsets so they can be immobilised. Continental operators have also joined but only around 20 out of a total of some 500 European operators are signed up.</p>
<p class="contents">What steps is the Commission taking to encourage the setting up of an EU-wide industry IMEI database equivalent to the UK scheme, so the crime can be tackled through barring of stolen handsets on an EU basis? Will the Commission consider putting forward a proposal, under Article 34 TEU, for an EU decision on a common offence of mobile phone reprogramming? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Since then, the Commission has also drawn the attention of the European Crime Prevention Network to the possible usefulness of EU-wide measures to prevent mobile phone theft. The European Crime Prevention Network is now discussing the issue. Nevertheless, the Commission does not foresee tabling a proposal on this subject under Article 34 of the Treaty on European Union, as it has not been identified, for now, as being one of the priority areas for approximation of substantive criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">All Member States' criminal justice systems contain provisions criminalising theft, which would, of course, be applicable to the theft of mobile phones. Therefore, for the time being, in terms of the principle of subsidiarity, we consider that those legal provisions in the Member States are sufficient to tackle this particular kind of increasing criminality. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am aware that it is being discussed in the crime prevention network, but it seems to me that there is scope for further action. Millions of mobile phones are stolen every year. Eurobarometer shows that up to one-third of people in Member States fear that they could be a victim. Also, with all the travel around the European Union, it has a cross-border dimension. Although, as you say, theft is an offence in all Member States, I am talking specifically of the offence of reprogramming the mobile phones. As far as I am aware that is only illegal in the UK. There is justification for an EU proposal to make that a crime everywhere.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a data protection problem. We must have consistent interpretation by data protection commissioners that the IMEI number is not personal data – which it is regarded as in Germany. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why I told you that the discussion is still going on in the Crime Prevention Network.

I would like to ask the Commissioner to expand on a genuine cross-border problem in the theft of mobile phones: their extensive use in a form of carousel fraud on the VAT authorities in different Member States. This is being used by sophisticated organised criminals and is therefore something that, I hope, he will be taking a serious interest in.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of using the IMEI numbers is clearly a first step, in that bulk transactions of mobile phones should only be authorised if the IMEI numbers are checked to make sure those phones have not already been subject to a previous fraudulent transaction. Second, I suggest that measures should be taken that would allow VAT on mobile phones to be paid directly to the tax authorities so that criminals cannot get their hands on the proceeds.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I am happy to send the Commissioner documentation from a major mobile phone trader in my region. This undertaking is being discriminated against by the German VAT authorities. This is actively discouraging legitimate business and will simply be handing this business to fraudulent traders. I hope that he will be able, with the assistance of DG Tax, to take some serious action to stop the German authorities penalising legitimate trade in this area. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I recognise that the figures are impressive: I recognise that 48% of all robberies in central London involve mobile phones and that the rate in Paris is about 40%. I am very much aware of the fact that last year approximately 700 000 phones were stolen in the UK, 150 000 in France and 130 000 in Spain. I do not deny that there is an important cross-border dimension to this kind of criminal activity. The issue is how to prioritise the actions that should be taken. My view is that priority should go to operational cooperation. I do not see any need for harmonisation of legislation. Therefore we will go on discussing a European network of crime prevention and what concrete operational activities should be developed to fight this kind of crime. The IMEI approach has already been discussed. We can only decide by unanimity and the Member States are split on this issue.

<p class="contents">Legally speaking, these joint charter flights currently mean two or more national removal operations carried out at the same time in one and the same aircraft. These joint charter flights have nothing to do with collective expulsions, which are prohibited by the European Convention on Human Rights and the European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights. Joint repatriation flights, with a certain number of people on board, are organised for logistical reasons, but the underlying expulsion decisions are always made individually. Each case is examined individually according to the personal circumstances and legal situation of each person. In other words, everybody on board a flight of this kind has been the subject of an individual procedure that has led to an individual rejection of any application or appeal to obtain legal residency. Therefore, the decisions are based on individual grounds and not collective grounds.</p>
<p class="contents">In connection with the case mentioned by Mr Krivin, the Commission has received no indication and has no reason to suppose that the specific circumstances of each of the people on this flight was subject to an infringement of any instrument of international law, or, in other words, that the people on this flight had not had their applications examined individually and effectively by the Member States that adopted the expulsion measures. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It seems to me that this is a very serious problem, because since I asked this question five joint flights – as you call them – have departed from France. They were carrying groups of people of the same nationality leaving under the same conditions, often handcuffed, sometimes gagged, so effectively that two immigrants even died of suffocation. The government has, I might add, decided that from now on there will be a Red Cross doctor on board these so-called joint flights to ensure that everything runs smoothly.</p>
<p class="contents">My question then is as follows: what is the difference between a joint flight and a group flight? By definition a group is a number of individuals. When you have 42 Senegalese together, who is going to decide what criterion should be used to determine whether they constitute a group or a number of individuals? I am not aware of a group that is not a number of individuals. But it is my misfortune to believe that when you have 42 Senegalese or 20 Ivorians together – Ivorians, I would point out, whose lives are in danger in their own country – it is more or less the same thing.</p>
<p class="contents">So my question is as follows: who determines the difference in meaning between a joint flight and a group flight? Explain to me what a collective expulsion is, that is what is forbidden. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, a joint flight is a flight that has been organised by at least two Member States. It is at this level that the intention is a joint one, in this case the intention of France and Germany. These two countries assembled a certain number of people in one place who were to be deported and they left on the same flight. It is a joint flight from an organisational point of view.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards collective expulsion, which is prohibited by the European Convention on Human Rights, the question is: when does collective expulsion arise? A collective deportation order is not made for each of the individuals that make up the group; there is just one order that applies to a whole group of people and that does not take account of the specific situation of each of the individuals in the group. That is the difference.</p>
<p class="contents">Collective expulsion is prohibited. It is not permitted in the European Union in any shape or form. On the other hand, if you have ten individual deportation orders and if you see these ten people together, there is no doubt that they form a group, but, whether they go on a joint flight or not, it is not a collective expulsion. That is the essential difference in my opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
