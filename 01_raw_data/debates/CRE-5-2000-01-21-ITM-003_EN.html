<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sauquillo Pérez del Arco (PSE).</span></span>   <span class="italic">– (ES)</span> Mr� President, I do not want to over-dramatise the situation as there are many civilians suffering violence in armed conflicts around the world. However, between 1992 and 1997, 131 volunteer and humanitarian workers and human rights activists working for the United Nations in areas of conflict were murdered.</p>
<p class="contents">Between 1� January 1994 and 17� March 1997, 119 volunteer and humanitarian workers were kidnapped in 35 separate incidents. In 1992, one United Nations representative died violently every month. In 1993, one died every two weeks and, in 1994, one died every week.</p>
<p class="contents">In the first two months of 1997, 9 volunteers died. In 1996, 153 delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross were subject to security incidents, including murders and kidnappings. I must, in particular, mention the deaths of three members of <span class="italic">Médecins du Monde</span>-Spain in Rwanda in 1997.</p>
<p class="contents">In short, as stated by the joint motion for a resolution with which we want to close this debate, the murders of Iñigo Eguiluz and Jorge Luis Mazo are simply the latest in a long line of attacks. These two men were volunteers for the organisation <span class="italic">Paz y Tercer Mundo</span>. They were murdered on 18� November in Quibdó on the Atrato river, 500 kilometres north of Bogotá, Colombia. These attacks strike not only at the integrity of these individuals but also at human rights, international humanitarian law and, within this, the right of victims of conflicts to be helped, to see the perpetrators of these acts tried and to receive the necessary reparation so that these crimes do not go unpunished.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent insecurity for humanitarian workers is due to the increase in conflicts, the exponential growth of humanitarian organisations and, in particular, the nature of current conflicts. These are no longer between regular armed forces, subject to political control, and guerrilla movements with a defined command structure and ideologies. Conflicts in which the warring parties are responsible, to some extent, for the protection of humanitarian workers, from whose actions the people benefit, no longer exist.</p>
<p class="contents">Volunteer and humanitarian workers are now exposed to banditry. The civilian population is regarded as just another element in the conflict and as part of the political and military strategy. Humanitarian action has therefore become an obstacle to the warring parties in the achievement of their objectives which often involve the elimination of part of the civilian population for ethnic, religious or cultural reasons.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of this situation, the security of humanitarian workers is a widespread problem which is of concern to Parliament. The Commission should be concerned as it finances over 180 NGOs working in areas of conflict. The Council should also be concerned as it is engaged in advancing an external policy in accordance with the Treaties, in promoting human rights and a security policy which, at the moment, is specifically confined to humanitarian actions.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we ask for Parliament’s concerns to be echoed by the other institutions. The Commission should act by preparing a communication on the security conditions of volunteer and humanitarian workers and by adopting measures which guarantee this security. Before applying the measures proposed by some governments, such as military protection of their volunteers, we must examine other measures which may be more effective in situations of conflict. The Council should act through the promotion, from within the CFSP, of international humanitarian law and perhaps through the creation of a European civilian peace corps.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1999, we commemorated the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions on International Humanitarian Law, which protect the civilian population in armed conflicts, and which guarantee their access to international aid. These are instruments which impose a legal obligation on countries but which are systematically being breached.</p>
<p class="contents">We ask the Secretary-General of the Council to use the European Union’s incipient capacity for external action to promote these EU principles. The Secretary-General of the United Nations recently asked the Security Council to impose international humanitarian law, even by applying Chapters 5, 6 and 7 of the Charter of the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">Here today, we simply ask that we start to acquire a conscience and that measures are taken to tackle a problem which affects not only the NGOs but also the very foundations of our concept of world order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is one of those events happening all over the world on a daily basis to which Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco referred. In addition, the Commission would like, once again, to point to the courage and dedication of the humanitarian aid workers who are working in such dangerous regions all over the world. </p>
<p class="contents">In Colombia’s case in particular, the Commission has let its concerns on the matter be known to the Colombian authorities on numerous occasions. We are continuing to monitor the situation and are in constant cooperation with the Member State embassies in Bogota. As for the murders of Iñigo Eguiluz, who was working on ECHO’s plans, and the priest, the Commission and the Member States have put pressure on the Colombian authorities to hold an inquiry. The European Commission and the Spanish ambassador met with the Colombian Deputy Prime Minister, insisting that those responsible for the crime be brought to justice. Saving and safeguarding lives in these extraordinary cases constitute an integral part of humanitarian legislation. </p>
<p class="contents">ECHO’s role in Colombia and in other countries is to monitor the humanitarian situation in the country and, in Colombia’s case in particular, to monitor the situation of persons who are being displaced against their will. There are also continuous efforts to monitor the implementation of humanitarian laws. Mrs Sauquillo Pérez del Arco emphasised the need for specific measures and action on the part of the Commission to ensure the safety of those aid workers. You referred to the existing Commission document from May 1998 on the security of aid workers, which sets out priorities and specific action to be taken. On account of the fact that the situation had worsened, the Commission’s ECHO office, together with the International Red Cross organisation, organised a seminar in Bogota on the question of security in April 1999, where all the organisations in Colombia were asked to have a Security Charter and to inform the Red Cross in advance of their movements. This was to ensure that those carrying arms were informed as to the humanitarian nature of any particular mission. </p>
<p class="contents">I would also point out that, in addition to careful planning, action measures and training for aid workers, there is still a need for funding. Applying humanitarian aid is by no means a costless operation. For this reason, the Commission is not only urging that this humanitarian aid be put into practice but it is also funding activities to train those who take part in these missions and to increase their awareness of the dangers involved. Allow me, if I may, to mention some recent and previous examples of initiatives which have been undertaken for this purpose: they include the presentation of documents on humanitarian aid, the seminar on security between the partners in Lisbon, the workshop on security issues for staff in Brussels, the inclusion of staff security issues in ECHO’s guidelines and a conference of ECHO correspondents to be held in February-March 2000 on that matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, the European Parliament proposals will be taken into account, and because this is a matter which presents particular difficulties and has so many different aspects, close cooperation and innovative ideas and proposals are very important for Commission action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We can only add this to the list of violent deaths suffered in recent years by volunteers who have dedicated their lives to the achievement of peace and who have also brought education to the most disadvantaged people.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore logical that this Group and this House should be speaking out and sending a message of understanding and condolence to the families of these victims and of support and courage to their companions who are continuing to work in these places. At the same time, we call on the institutions responsible for ensuring justice, the Commission, the Secretary-General of the Council and the Colombian Government, to make every effort to ensure that justice prevails and that these events are punished in accordance with the law.</p>
<p class="contents">The imprisonment of a suspect is a positive sign which we congratulate. We also welcome the willingness shown by the Colombian President, Mr� Pastrana, on his recent visit to this House. However, while understanding the complexity of the problem, we would remind the Colombian Government that support for the Red Cross and the United Nations Commission for Refugees is a measure which will always receive our backing, as will efforts to rigorously apply the rules laid down in 1998 and other previous rules establishing the real, legal protection of these groups.</p>
<p class="contents">We also recognise that the systems of detection and legal protection of volunteer workers need to be improved. These volunteers necessarily work in areas of conflict, in places characterised by violence and poverty and in areas of darkness, into which the gaze of justice cannot penetrate. We therefore need to find other measures and devise new systems. Precisely for this reason, we who live in prosperity, together with the European institutions and governments, are obliged by a code of honour to establish a range of protection measures for humanitarian workers, with full support for justice. For while we try to help from the outside, these volunteers are building peace and solidarity from within. They are the ones entering shadowy places to bring healthcare and solve problems. They are the most noble side of a self-indulgent society, which is why our response must be effective and responsible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mrs� Sauquillo has highlighted, in both her oral question and her intervention, that this problem is not specific to one country. While Colombia is certainly one of the countries whose situation does not allow the security of volunteers to be guaranteed, this is also true of many other countries in Africa, Asia and other places.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution asks the Commission to draw up a communication in this respect. I am not sure if this is the most appropriate instrument but it seems that the Commission is ready to work in this direction. It would probably be useful to look at preparing a document.</p>
<p class="contents">The aspect which does not make much sense to me is the singling out of Colombia and the support for some of the amendments tabled which are aimed, for example, at suspending cooperation. The suspension of cooperation with these countries causes great harm to their people. We must not curtail this cooperation when this is unselfishly provided by people who know the risks to which they are exposed.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, to suggest that we might stop governmental participation in the channelling of aid is to ignore the real situation. I have visited many areas of Colombia and, apart from the natural factors – it is difficult terrain – there is the added problem of the existence of several movements of different types. We never know which one may end someone’s life. Without a minimum amount of governmental aid, cooperation would be absolutely impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that this debate is very useful as a reminder to the Commission of what is happening. To a certain extent, the Commission has reassured us by indicating that this is an issue of concern to it but we must look at the situation calmly. International cooperation must continue. This European Community has to continue setting an example in international cooperation. We have to support our volunteers and it would therefore be desirable for the Community institutions, the governments of the Member States and the governments of the recipient countries to guarantee the security of these workers. This protection could be provided firstly through prevention and secondly through legal action. The Colombian authorities assure me that they have already initiated legal proceedings based on the detention of one person. Colombia is a country in which the judiciary enjoys great independence and the executive does not have the power to judge criminals. The standard legal channels must therefore be followed.</p>
<p class="contents">So, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, I encourage you to follow the course which has been set. In this way we hope that the security of our volunteer workers can be improved. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They apologise for being unable to be present themselves. Although I have less expertise, I am happy for this opportunity to speak on their behalf and on behalf of the Green/European Free Alliance.</p>
<p class="contents">As Parliamentarians we are often guilty of complaining about the privations of our life, travelling between two, three or four cities, occupying cramped offices and so forth. So it is a humbling moment to rise in this House to speak on this topic and contemplate the problems and dangers faced by brave people who go out as humanitarian workers in Third World countries. We can only pause and reflect upon the conditions of their lives and sometimes, alas, of their deaths. That said, my Group and I are disappointed that our colleagues in the Socialist Party – although rightly saying that this is a general problem – seem to be losing sight – in our opinion – of the need to concentrate on Columbia.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important to recall that President Pastrana visited this place as recently as October and gave assurances about safeguarding human rights and about the prosecution of crime and the dismantling of the paramilitary forces. These assurances have turned out to be almost worthless. Not enough has been done. The motion on behalf of my Group says that the Commission should insist, as a condition of its presence and its work in the country, on the enforcement of laws relating to the protection of displaced workers and on the provision of guarantees from the Colombian Government relating to their physical safety and material wellbeing. It is right that the Commission should insist on these requirements.</p>
<p class="contents">In the next clause the motion says that we oppose the continuing of aid to the Colombian Government, but not to the Colombian people because the next clause says that we should continue aid through other channels and direct it to make sure that the paramilitary forces are discountenanced and that civil order returns as fast as reasonably possible to Columbia.</p>
<p class="contents">Human rights workers are a critical part of the problem, but not the whole problem. The only way to stop the killing will be by dismantling the paramilitary troops and providing adequate bodyguards for human rights workers. ECHO and the Commission have to put pressure on the governments to do this. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Sjöstedt (GUE/NGL).</span></span>   – <span class="italic">(SV)</span> Mr President, on 26 October of last year, Colombia’s President, Mr Pastrana, spoke here in the European Parliament. He maintained that he wanted to work for human rights in his country and for a situation in which activists involved in issues affecting human rights are offered protection and in which those responsible for murders and crimes of violence, which are mainly committed by paramilitary groups, are not granted immunity from prosecution but are held responsible. </p>
<p class="contents">Less than a month later, the murders that form the backdrop to today’s debate took place. A paramilitary group attacked the organisation Peace and the Third World, an organisation which, with the support of the ECHO programme, works to provide humanitarian aid to farmers driven off their land. A Colombian priest and a Spanish aid worker were killed. The latter worked for the peace brigades whose presence is supposed to protect human rights activists against violence. These murders are just a few in the long list of excesses in Colombia, but this time a citizen of an EU country was also killed. </p>
<p class="contents">Murders and disappearances are part of everyday life in Colombia. Just recently, for example, two prominent spokespersons for the peasants’ movement disappeared. They had been carried off by a paramilitary group and they have not been found. </p>
<p class="contents">Behind the greater part of this terror are paramilitary groups with more or less obvious links to the country’s own military and power structures. It has been repeatedly demonstrated how the country’s military has been directly implicated in various acts of violence. The victims are the civilian population in areas where the guerrillas have support, the political Left, union activists and those who work for human rights. The legal Left in the country has been hit hard. Thousands of its representatives, including mayors and parliamentarians, have quite simply been murdered. Very seldom have the perpetrators been punished. </p>
<p class="contents">In a country like that, it is not surprising that many people turn to the guerrilla movement and the armed struggle. It should be emphasised, however, that the guerrillas too are responsible for acts of violence which it is impossible to defend. Achieving better respect for human rights in Colombia is absolutely crucial if a peaceful solution to the country’s civil war is going to be possible. The peace efforts must be supported, at the same time as the Colombian government must be put under constant pressure, especially from the European Union, when it comes to the issue of human rights. Foreign, that is to say American, military involvement must be rejected. </p>
<p class="contents">Our Group, the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, has not been able to subscribe to the compromise resolution which has been negotiated. We think it is quite inadequate in its criticism of the Colombian government. It is striking that paragraph D of the resolution refers to the occupation of a Red Cross office by farmers, while the thousands of political murders which have taken place in Colombia are not discussed in any clear way. </p>
<p class="contents">We have tabled two amendments together with the Group of the Greens. In the first amendment, we want aid to the Colombian government to be made dependent upon respect for human rights, and those who work with these questions to be protected. </p>
<p class="contents">In the second amendment, we want to increase humanitarian aid through organisations which are independent of the Colombian government, for example the various civilian peace corps. If these amendments are adopted, the present resolution will be somewhat better and clearer. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the beginning of the 21st century, we are experiencing, however, an ever greater proliferation of new forms of war in the shape of ethnic conflicts. Militias clash, or the opposing sides in civil wars or simply criminal gangs. Governments are either implicated in the conflicts or else they are completely, or largely, powerless to resolve them. Naturally, this also greatly jeopardises humanitarian and development aid. It is therefore our task as the European Parliament to focus very strongly upon this issue. We may well admire the contributions which people are making here in the fields of humanitarian and development aid, but we must also ensure that their living and working conditions improve. </p>
<p class="contents">I believe that we have quite a lot of catching up to do in this regard. We must see to it that the European Union in actual fact provides aid in every place where, for example, NGOs are doing so in an exemplary way. It is not only in South America that we have this set of problems. This week, we had the debate about Chechnya and, some time ago, the debate about Central Asia. Then, Mr Madelin addressed us on the subject of Afghanistan. And, again and again, we observe the same phenomenon: the withdrawal of humanitarian aid because safety is not being guaranteed. A number of NGOs demonstrate to us how, in spite of this, aid can be supplied, albeit under very perilous conditions. However, the European Union as well as other large organisations, such as the Red Cross, are all too often on the retreat. </p>
<p class="contents">We must be careful that this trend does not continue, for it is shamelessly exploited by some governments which then say that aid may only be provided to themselves and not directly, through the NGOs, at the coalface. That is dangerous because these governments are in fact not the solution to the problem but a part of it, and even the cause. We must therefore remain very firmly in control of the situation. For this reason, we are beginning, as a Parliament, to be very disappointed in our Commissioner responsible for this area, Mr Nielson.</p>
<p class="contents">I would ask you, Commissioner, to also convey this to Mr Nielson. For some weeks, dissatisfaction has been growing in this House. We had criticisms to make of Mrs Bonino in the administrative area, but Mrs Bonino was present. She was not only present in Parliament but had also visited the regions in crisis. The European Union had a human face where humanitarian and development aid were concerned. The Commission has a considerable amount of catching up to do in this area. We are slowly beginning here – I can detect this in all Groups – to develop a very critical attitude. I believe that we ought to move early to a situation in which we are again developing joint initiatives in this area for the purpose of stabilising the political sphere and supporting NGOs, but also of making the European Union’s presence felt, where necessary, at the coalface. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The role of the European Parliament is also very important. </p>
<p class="contents">However, I rise to speak as I would like to refer to the comments made about Commissioner Nielson. Firstly, he is not present today as he is on a trip to South Africa. Secondly, over the past three months he has become involved in many crises. And thirdly, he has worked hard and has already submitted plans to the Commission for total restructuring and for new regulations on administering humanitarian aid as well as for innovative ways of cooperating with non-governmental organisations. I understand and I empathise with many of the comments of the honourable Members on the problems that exist, but I think it is a bit much to criticise a Commissioner who has only been in office for three months and who has already carried out some important work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
