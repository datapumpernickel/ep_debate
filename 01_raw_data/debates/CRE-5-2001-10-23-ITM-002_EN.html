<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Jensen (ELDR), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur.</span> – <span class="italic">(DA)</span> Madam Commissioner, the EU’s employment policy is one of open cooperation in which the Member States set common goals, exchange experiences and evaluate each other’s results and employment policies. It is an open process in which the individual country itself chooses which funds it will use in order to achieve the common goals. We, in Parliament, should also like to see the process become more open by involving and engaging the general public more. The report we are debating today is about the implementation of Article 129 of the Treaty of Amsterdam concerning employment policy incentives. It is about appropriations to the work on employment policy over the next five years and about money for analyses, statistics, conferences and reports etc. Employment policy is to be evaluated in 2003. It will be the first open coordination to be evaluated, and the money for employment policy is also to be used for this evaluation.</p>
<p class="contents">At Parliament’s first reading, we adopted 17 amendments to the Commission’s proposal, covering the following themes. We should like to see the social partners and local and regional authorities more involved in the process, and we should like to see greater focus placed upon the ways in which information and employment policy affects a broader public. We should like to see more focus on the equal treatment of women in employment policy; we should like to receive some further proposals concerning Parliament’s involvement; and we should like to look at the connection with other Community activities. Last but not least, we should like to see pilot projects to increase information about employment policy at local and regional levels and help develop relevant strategies. As a result, Parliament proposed an increase in the budget.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council thereupon accepted a number of Parliament’s amendments, including those aimed at involving the local and regional levels and at involving the social partners more. Some of the proposals concerning greater focus on equality have also been accepted, but the Council did not want to accept some very central proposals from Parliament. Against that background, there was a great deal of support in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for Parliament’s re-tabling those proposals from the first reading that the Council did not accept. A majority of Parliament has campaigned for a long time for local and regional efforts to be incorporated into employment policy, and we have pointed out that the exchange of experiences and methods with those operating at local level and working in a voluntary capacity could be financed via Article 129. That is because it is clearly characteristic of unemployment in the EU to be focused in regions and local areas and in pockets of poverty where there are islands of unemployment. Local efforts are central when it comes to getting people into work. That is why it makes good sense to talk about local action plans and about the exchange of experiences and information from this work.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite convinced that greater focus on local efforts will make all of us much wiser about the new avenues that might be explored in employment policy. We have supported local employment initiatives by means of preparatory action, for which there has been a budget line called B5-503, and it is Parliament’s desire that this initiative should be followed up and continued via pilot projects under Article 129. Perhaps the expression ‘projects’ is misleading, for we want, of course, to see a development of the methodical work carried out, that is to say analyses and studies and the development of statistics and methods. We do not wish, under Article 129, to finance projects with the project-oriented and experimental character of projects financed under Article 6 of the Social Fund. There is therefore no question of our wanting to duplicate things that are already happening under the aegis of the Social Fund. On the contrary. There are many of us who are happy about the open coordination method of employment policy, for it enables the Member States to improve their results in employment policy, learn from each other’s experiences and actually compete to obtain better results. There will not, however, be very much of that healthy competition as long as employment policy and the ‘Luxembourg process’ are as unfamiliar to people as they are at present.</p>
<p class="contents">In many countries’ national parliaments, there is no debate on national employment plans. Nor are there any other activities that might make the process and the results better known and create more grassroots support. Is political coordination based on analyses and statistics debated by the same politicians, officials and experts at conferences around the EU really binding enough? No, let us obtain a much greater awareness of results and objectives, so that governments encounter much greater commitment and a desire for everyone to achieve the results obtained in those countries which have most success in employment policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I mention this because, during its twelve years in power, the Fraga government has been constantly concerned about the issues and problems arising from the lack of employment in Galicia, and for this reason, during the latest election campaign, it made a commitment to providing jobs for the young unemployed under the age of 30 consisting of a one-year contract for those who have been out of work or unemployed for six consecutive years.</p>
<p class="contents">This concern about employment, as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty and which takes the form of a European Community action for promoting the coordination of employment policies in Member States, confirmed by the special European Councils on employment in Luxembourg and Lisbon, which resolutely advocate a global employment strategy, implies and demands a systematic mobilisation of all Community employment policies, whether these be framework policies or support policies.</p>
<p class="contents">If we want to become a knowledge-based economy that is both competitive and dynamic, able to grow economically in a sustainable fashion, with more and better jobs and with greater social cohesion, so that we can once again meet the conditions necessary for full employment, we should encourage the coordination of employment policies between Member States, upholding, of course, the right to make decisions that correspond to the particular circumstances of each Member State, the exchange of good practices, including the aforementioned forms of participation for social partners and also local and regional authorities, without forgetting the need for the coordination of policies directed towards the creation of employment.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore think that the commitment made by Mr Fraga Iribarne is good practice that could be exported or exchanged with others. It will provide Galician youth with the chance to become integrated into the labour market, make it easier for them to gain the necessary training and experience, both in their quest for a first job as well as subsequently being able to keep that job or to move on to other jobs. I think that this is good practice, in the same way that the practice for the conciliation of family life with professional life was also good, another initiative of the Galician government.</p>

It is a good day today, for today’s vote should show that we are now all endorsing the fact that employment policy is not just something made behind desks at meetings of the Council of Ministers, but is something that must be rolled out among the people. Information must be provided about it, and the local authorities that are to help set these things in motion must also be involved. That is what we are voting on today. There are many good things in Mrs Jensen’s report. I would emphasise what we have agreed concerning the local dimension of employment policy. Gradually, we have got the Commission and the Council to realise that local and regional authorities, the social partners and non-profit organisations are important in the context of employment initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Practical work aimed at getting people into employment is done locally. That is why room must be made for local players. However, support for local initiatives is required, for example, in the form of better information about what the common European employment policy is and what the objectives are. That is why it is important for us to put incentive measures in place and for us to appropriate some money to enable us to learn from each other’s methods and experiences. That, moreover, is what we are trying to do here today. That is why it is also disappointing that it has been difficult to get the Commission to agree to increasing the budget so that we might appropriate this money, and that is why we, in the Group of the Party of European Socialists, have naturally endorsed the need to increase the amount to EUR 55 million, and not EUR 50 million. I hope that we obtain broad support today and that the Commission and the Council are alert to the signal from Parliament today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is true, in my opinion, that she has managed to get the entire committee behind her – as well as the entire Parliament, I assume – for her proposals. Naturally, I should also like to congratulate Mr Pérez on the victory in Galicia.</p>
<p class="contents">I endorse everything that has been said, that this is a sound report and that there are a number of amendments that could considerably improve the proposal. However, I am also a little pessimistic. I see little evidence of any inclination to examine our proposals in the Council or in the Commission. If anything, they are more inclined to dig their heels in and say: well, the employment policy as we have designed it works, and we refuse to make any changes. We want to involve Parliament to some extent but preferably as little as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">That is actually rather the impression I get, especially in the Council but also partly in the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">In a different report on social protection, we managed – in fact, under your presidency – to break out of this. I hope that this will be the case here too, but I am far more pessimistic this time round. We are dealing with a Council which seeks even less direct contact with Parliament. We are faced with even more difficulties, which adds to my sense of pessimism.</p>
<p class="contents">I am delighted that the rapporteur drafted this report. In my opinion, it pinpoints very accurately what we are agreed on in this Parliament, but I am pessimistic about the outcome. Maybe my pessimism could be transformed into optimism. However, if all signals are red – and that is the case here – then that should be voiced in this House.</p>
<p class="contents">That is the main reason why I have taken the floor today. I hope that I come across as being rather gloomy. We will hear from the Commissioner and particularly the Council whether they will at long last leave behind their old ways and perhaps are really willing to enter into a dialogue with this Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To start with, we need to make sure the citizens of the Union know what the European Employment Strategy is. That is the only way they can perceive our common objectives and add their ideas to the Luxembourg process and it is the only way to ensure the relevant national, regional and local authorities benefit from the best practices which have proven to be efficient in other areas of the Union, such as those which the honourable Mr Pérez Álvarez has just mentioned.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Jensen's other proposal concerns the role of local society in both planning and implementing employment policies. We must make ensure that all the Member States understand that it is crucial for the social partners and civil society to be involved if this effort to increase employment is to be effective. And the Member States must change their structures and implement measures to create institutions and resources which will allow local employment pacts to be applied. On the other hand, the European Union also needs to back these structures with its policies, advice and resources. We already have experience of numerous countries, including Greece, in which local employment pacts have failed to work. In some cases, they were policies applied by the central administration to encourage a few additional measures in areas with problems; they did not mobilise local society and they did not have the required results.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure other areas in the Union have had similar bad experiences, which is why we believe that the measures proposed by the honourable Member and other policies in this sector of the European Union should be coordinated and dealt with at European and national level in order to give new impetus to employment planning and implementation at local level. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This programme gives effect to Article 129 of the Treaty which provides that incentive measures may be adopted in order to encourage cooperation between Member States and support their action in the field of employment. Here I very much agree with what Mrs Thorning-Schmidt has already said: it is not a matter of employment or a matter of Council meetings, it is a matter of real cooperation between the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The programme underpins the European Employment Strategy and provides for activities to ensure its continuing effectiveness. It is important that it is going to be adopted in the near future and I am hopeful that outstanding concerns expressed in the 14 amendments submitted can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p class="contents">In its amended proposal the Commission, after the first reading, accepted in full or in part 12 of the 17 amendments tabled by Parliament. The common position which you have been considering, while significantly different in format and presentation from the amended proposal, contains resonances of the ten amendments.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to the amendments which are now under consideration, the Commission can accept nine of them in full or in part. Those are Amendments Nos 1-8 and 14.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to specify exactly what I accept. Amendments Nos 1-3 I accept in full. In Amendment No 4, I very much welcome the reference to special attention to groups subject to multiple discrimination in their access to the labour market and I share your concerns that we should be able to understand, monitor and analyse developments in mainstreaming by establishing indicators. I do not consider it appropriate, however, to enter into details on specific studies to be carried out and cannot accept this part of the amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">On Amendment No 5, I am very pleased with the emphasis you introduce with regard to the importance of promoting public knowledge of the European Employment Strategy and further encouraging individuals and organisations at all levels to contribute to enhancing its impact and effectiveness. This programme should and will assist in the realisation of those objectives. However, assigning funding for the ‘projects’ in this context is not appropriate, and I have to reject that part of Amendment No 5. Our diverging views on Amendment No 5 may lie more in the wording used than in any disagreement on its intent.</p>
<p class="contents">Local projects involving local actors are funded through Article 6 and the European Social Fund regulation, as well as through another budget line – B5-503. The latter is available exclusively for the funding of local development projects. The analysis, research and evaluation work which it incorporates will include measures, informed by the outcomes of the projects delivered under other budget lines, to assess how knowledge of the European Employment Strategy, and local level involvement in its delivery, might be further improved. I hope that this approach will meet your concerns.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to Amendment No 8, I again fully subscribe to the principle of consistency and accept this part but I cannot agree to specify each linked programme.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendments Nos 6 and 7 are taken on board in spirit by the inclusion of Amendment No 1, and Amendment No 14, I can fully support.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I am not in a position to accept Amendments Nos 9-13. I will briefly explain why: Amendments Nos 9 and 10 concern the committee. While I am grateful for your support for the Commission's role and the re-institution of an advisory committee, this is a lost fight with the Council. Looking at the legal framework and recent precedents, a mixed committee is a fair compromise. We could look at the mandate in future discussions to see if this could be adopted to meet your concerns as part of a global compromise.</p>
<p class="contents">On the annual plans in Amendment No 11, this is an internal Commission question which has no place in a Parliament and Council decision. Amendment No 12 also has to be rejected on institutional grounds and more specifically with reference to the framework agreement on interinstitutional relationships.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, regarding Amendment No 13, we maintain the EUR 55 million initially proposed. We have made a thorough analysis and this is an adequate figure for the activities envisaged.</p>
<p class="contents">To sum up, the Commission can accept in full or in spirit Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 14; it can accept in part Amendments Nos 4, 5 and 8; it rejects Amendments Nos 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13.</p>
<p class="contents">It is clear that some issues have to be resolved; some of them are more sensitive than others. I have, however, taken the most positive approach possible to the amendments which you have tabled. Accordingly, I am hopeful that, with your cooperation and that of the Council, we can soon identify a compromise which is acceptable to all. I once again reiterate the urgency of this matter and the Commission's resolve to help find workable compromises. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
