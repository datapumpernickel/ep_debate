<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Watts </span> <span class="bold">(PSE), </span> <span class="italic">rapporteur. ‐</span> Mr President, the history of ferry safety can only be described as scandal: despite the tragic events in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, next to nothing was done. Literally thousands of lives were lost before the basic, fundamental, and in some cases outrageous shortcomings in ferry design and operations were addressed, despite repeated warnings from the unions, consumer groups and indeed this Parliament. In particular, it took the loss of the<span class="italic"> Herald of Free Enterprise</span> , the <span class="italic">Scandinavian Star</span> and, most tragic of all, the <span class="italic">Estonia</span> , before ferry companies and governments started to come to terms with the consequences of their negligence. However, since 1994 we have all at last seen both words and action from the Commission – action this Parliament has welcomed and I believe, as rapporteur, sought at every turn to facilitate.</p>
<p class="contents">The latest measure from the Commission seeks to submit regular Ro‐ro passenger ferries and high‐speed passenger craft to mandatory survey regimes by host states before entry into service and then at regular intervals. The unique feature is that this will apply irrespective of the flag state. These measures therefore also close the loop‐hole which currently prevents Member States from investigating accidents involving their own citizens. For the purpose of facilitating the investigation the proposal includes a carriage requirement of a voyage data recorder – a black box.</p>
<p class="contents">However, on first reading, the Parliament highlighted the weak wording which would in effect, in my view and that of the Parliament, allow certain ferries to either carry a sub‐ standard black box or not carry a black box at all. Hence our reasonable demand that black boxes meeting the latest standards must be fitted to all ferries within five years. This unfortunately was rejected by both the Council and the Commission. The Commission commented in its communication to this Parliament that it could not accept this because, in its words, it would render the further operation of the ferry or craft ‘economically non‐viable".</p>
<p class="contents">I am, as your rapporteur, informed that to retro‐fit a black box to a ferry undergoing a refit would cost a lot less than new carpets or curtains. I invite the Commission tonight to join with me in putting safety first by supporting our amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">On first reading, we also welcome the desire on the part of the Commission to require the data relating to compliance to be made available to the Commission in order to establish a new transparent system accessible to all parties concerned. However, our demands for public access were rejected. The Commission commented in its communication that neither the Commission nor the Council could accept the request by the European Parliament that information on the ferries and craft should be made publicly available. We would point out that such a view flies in the face of the Commission's own quality shipping initiative, which says: ‘exposure of the sub‐standard players to public knowledge is essential to the objective of the quality shipping initiative."</p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, the Commission itself is already establishing a European quality shipping information system available to the public. What better way to shift the initiative and the campaign away from a mere list of nice intentions towards real action? After all, what has the industry to hide? Of all the interested parties, do the travelling public not have a particular right of access to information about the safety of the vessel to which they entrust their lives and those of their families?</p>
<p class="contents">It is time to make black boxes a mandatory requirement on all ferries and high‐speed craft in the interests of passenger safety and confidence. It is time that ferry safety data be made publicly available so that we can name and shame sub‐standard ships and operators. It is time to put ferry safety first.</p>

<img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis">Kinnock, Neil, </span>  <span class="italic">Commission. ‐</span> Mr President, I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Transport and Tourism and, in particular, Mr Watts, for the quick and thorough work on the Council's common position on this important proposal. As the report acknowledges, most of the amendments adopted at first reading were accepted by the Commission in its amended proposal and incorporated in the Council's common position. That obviously signifies a very useful consensus on the main features of the legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">For reasons which I well understand and which he has again articulated very effectively, Mr Watts is resubmitting two amendments which the Commission could not accept at first reading, and I should like to respond further to those amendments tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">The first amendment deals with the issue of granting derogation from the technical specifications for voyage‐data recorders to be installed on board existing ferries and high‐speed craft. When the Commission tabled this proposal, we took due account of the technical difficulties that could arise from fitting these instruments on board existing ships and craft and we therefore made the provision that the committee could agree on exemptions from some of the technical requirements that VDRs have to comply with.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand that Mr Watts agrees with this approach in principle but that he wishes to see this derogation limited in time so that after the proposed five‐year period, existing ferries and high‐speed craft should be equipped with VDRs that comply fully with all the technical specifications that are applicable for new ships.</p>
<p class="contents">I understand the principle but it must be said that a provision of this kind would require the replacement of the voyage‐data recorder and, in almost all cases, the replacement of navigation and engine‐control equipment in order to ensure the availability of the right communication protocols for feeding information into the VDR. In many cases that would also entail extensive recabling between the VDR and the equipment from which it has to retrieve its information. Obviously, the cost associated with this re‐engineering work would greatly exceed the purchase cost of the voyage‐data recorder. In my view, that would not be justified or proportionate, when we recall that the envisaged objective of the proposal is to make possible the collection of information for the purposes of accident investigation.</p>
<p class="contents">In addition, I must also say that ferry companies which have already voluntarily installed VDRs on board their vessels should not be penalised by being forced to replace such equipment, with all the re‐engineering that implies. So, for all those reasons – practical reasons, not reasons of principle – I cannot accept the five‐year limitation period that is proposed in Amendment No 1.</p>
<p class="contents">Amendment No 2 repeats the request made at first reading for the information on the particulars of roll‐on/roll‐off ferries and high‐speed craft permitted to operate on regular services, including information about any operational limitation. It asks for that information to be made public and available by the Commission. In response, I have to say that the House may recall that at first reading I cautioned about the risk of making public all data on the inspected ships and craft, particularly so far as reliability, security and the possibility of commercial abuse were concerned. It is that concern which prompted the Commission to propose that it is for the committee, established for the purposes of this directive, to determine the conditions for access to such data. So there is no question of closing down, there is a question of the practical discretion of the committee. I hope that honourable Members can accept the validity of that approach.</p>
<p class="contents">The ferry survey database proposed in this directive should be considered as a specialised instrument that is designed primarily to assist Member States and the Commission in monitoring and enforcing the implementation of the directive by providing detailed information on the application of this survey regime.</p>
<p class="contents">Having said that, I wholeheartedly share Mr Watts' opinion that any relevant information on matters relating to the safety of passengers should be disseminated to the public as widely and clearly as possible. On that basis, as Mr Watts stressed in his report, the Commission has undertaken to develop a database on the quality performance of shipping called Equasis, in the context of our quality shipping campaign, and in order to greatly improve transparency of information about the safety performance of shipping in general. We will meet that commitment. The Equasis database will be widely accessible to the shipping community <span class="italic">and</span> to the general public. I consider that it will provide the most appropriate means of disseminating all relevant information on the safety performance of ferries, the issue which rightly excites the particular interest and indeed missionary zeal of Mr Watts.</p>
<p class="contents">When the conditions of access to the ferry survey database are elaborated in the committee, my services will give full attention to the need to feed as much information as possible from that database into the Equasis database. I am convinced that, in practice, this approach will ensure the level of transparency that Mr Watts and his colleagues in this House quite rightly are asking for, without having to amend the text of the common position.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I can inform honourable Members that I support the objectives of Amendment No 3, since it clarifies the exact scope and extent of inspections for life‐saving appliances and equipment in line with the requirements of the Safety of Life at Sea Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">I conclude by thanking Mr Watts and his colleagues for facilitating the adoption of this directive, which, together with other measures already enacted and implemented in recent years, will have a direct and beneficial effect on the safety of people travelling on conventional and high‐speed passenger vessels in European Union waters. Mr Watts rightly reminded us of the passenger ship tragedies of recent years. Let us hope that by the implementation of these measures we will make it almost impossible – as impossible as travel by sea can allow – for any repetition of such tragedies to take place. When we can say that, I must say that the useful work and the dedication shown by Members of this House will have played a significant part in reaching that desirable standard.</p>
