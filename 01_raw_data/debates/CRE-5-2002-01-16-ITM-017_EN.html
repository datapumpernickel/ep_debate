<p class="contents">The signing of the Cotonou Agreement was not initially accepted. Although the ACP countries had always shown they were willing to continue their cooperation with the European Union, Europe was becoming involved in other matters. European interests on the international stage changed and Africa became a marginal continent. There are no ACP countries among the 10 leading beneficiaries of European aid. A genuine political assessment of Lomé was never carried out but the same foundations have been used for Cotonou. However, we have doubts regarding the ability of the Cotonou Agreement to provide a dynamic for sustainable development if we do not have a more balanced international economic order, in which the developing countries will finally have rights. The structural causes which have undermined the success of the Lomé Conventions are still present: the burden of debt which is strangling the budgets of the ACP countries and their potential to invest in sustainable development, the continued deterioration of trade terms to the detriment of the ACP countries, in the absence of an international system for trade regulation of primary products, a structural adjustments policy which imposes budgetary restrictions on ACP countries and, lastly, an inconsistent European policy which, like its development policy, not only subsidises agricultural production and exports its surplus to developing countries, thus destabilising the local markets, but also authorises industrial fishing vessels to fish the territorial waters of the ACP countries, which adversely affects the local people’s means of subsistence and compromises the protection of biodiversity. Furthermore, do not underestimate the internal working problems of the ACP group, the democratic shortcomings in certain countries and the misuse of funds by corrupt regimes.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cotonou Agreement is not groundbreaking. It perpetuates and accentuates the transition towards liberalisation initiated by Lomé IV and continued by the international institutions: that is, the liberalisation of trade, coupled with the withdrawal of the non-reciprocal trade system, as well as Stabex and Sysmin, in favour of the future trade regime which is likely to take the form of Regional Economic Partnership Agreements (REPS) that are compatible with WTO rules. But can the ACP countries contend with global competition? By differentiating them from the least developed countries (LDCs), which benefit from the ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative, is there not a danger that this will undermine the cohesion of the ACP group? There is economic liberalisation as well, within the framework of the general agreement on the commercialisation of services. Privatisation of this economic sector is a very dangerous process in the ACP countries where the basic public services such as education, health and justice are already fragile, even non-existent. Equally, the reference to the TRIPS agreements is a danger for the people of the South who are at risk of being denied access to their own natural resources. Biodiversity is under threat. Furthermore, in the Cotonou Agreement, the environment is relegated to the background and the sole aim is to limit the environmental impact of development policies, which runs counter to a sustainable development strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">However, the Cotonou Agreement contains some interesting aspects that we must put to good use. Acknowledging civil society as an actor in the partnership is a major step forward. Its representatives must take part in the dialogue on development strategies and policies at an early stage, be involved in the implementation of programmes and directly benefit from the funds. We must define civil society and ensure that it is not exploited by any party. The civil society in each ACP country must therefore be organised at national as well as at regional level, in order to actively participate in its country’s development. This process has been launched with the ACP Civil Society Forum. The European Union must support this process, as it did under the Belgian Presidency.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is thus strengthened in that it must monitor the participation of civil society as well as, and in particular, the implementation of democratic processes. But it has no binding instrument to do this. Political dialogue is another essential element. It must also be reciprocal and effectively implemented. The ‘Everything but Arms’ initiative was undertaken without consulting the ACP countries and penalties are still random. Lastly, since the European Commission wishes to make considerable investments in several key sectors, the National Indicative Programmes should give priority to strengthening public services and administrative and institutional capacities. In reality, everything depends on how the Cotonou Agreement is applied. For example, the new Cotonou Agreement provides for flexible aid planning, in other words, according to how each country performs. But who will define the performance criteria? Will we assess the ability of each country to re-gain some balance in macro-economic affairs or the impact of aid on eradicating poverty? It does not seem likely that the new distribution of competences between the Commission services will provide greater consistency in the development policy. To what extent will the Directorate-General for Trade be able to encourage a more favourable trade model in the ACP countries, whilst also protecting European trade interests? Lastly, the fact that the Directorate-General for Development is gradually being stripped of its prerogatives in this area does not bode well.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as we, the Members of the European Parliament, are concerned – and this will be my final point, Mr President – after tomorrow’s vote, our task is finished in theory. Since the European Development Fund has no budget, we are no longer responsible for monitoring and achieving the objectives of the ACP-EU cooperation. This is unacceptable and we must work together to implement this agreement so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health and educational requirements. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I realise that there are probably some that are on the way to doing so in the course of the spring, but it is still not too satisfactory. At least it is good that our approval is being put in place tomorrow, even if I agree with the rapporteur that it is only the beginning. However, I should like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot has undeniably happened in the world since the agreement was signed in June 2000, but that does not of course make it any the less important. I think it can be said that the fact that foreign policy is bound up with development policy has, since then, been heavily underlined, and I am also pleased that I am today speaking on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, for this shows the connection between foreign policy and development policy. In a speech in December 2001 in Berlin with the title, ‘From Afghanistan to Zimbabwe’, Commissioner Nielson made these words his own. Which form of policy comes first may be immaterial. However, 11 September made this connection and, in particular, the importance of foreign policy, abundantly clear. 11 September showed what can happen if we do not ensure development in all parts of the world. It is now our task to pursue such development. The same applies to our continuing work in Kosovo. In connection with Zimbabwe too, the link between foreign policy and development policy is clear, as too is the fact that, in spite of everything, the EU has succeeded in obtaining an agreement, which means that we can operate in Zimbabwe in the hope of achieving good results. I agree with the Commissioner, whose speech contained the concluding remarks – which I would certainly echo – to the effect that the C in CFP ‘...stands for common, not convenient and colonial’. I agree that we therefore still have work to do, as we also have here in Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Corrie (PPE-DE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I would firstly like to thank the rapporteur for the enormous amount of work he has put into this document and for the information that is in it. However, I am disappointed that he is so pessimistic, both looking back to the past and forward to the future. Of course I support some of his criticisms: too much paperwork, a lack of decision-making, slow delivery times and a lack of capacity in developing countries. This has given rise to frustration, but Commissioner Nielson is tackling these problems with some vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">I am much more optimistic than the rapporteur. I believe the Cotonou Accord is the right path. Lomé had its faults. But it was a unique concept and much good work was done. The new Partnership Agreement is based on the right principles, enhancing the old Lomé Convention. The theme of poverty alleviation must be right. The only question is how best to implement it. There is much discussion on project finance versus budget support. Should we be using multilateral aid or bilateral aid? I strongly support multilateral aid backed up by bilateral aid where it can complement a project.</p>
<p class="contents">I do not believe that project aid has failed. The problem has been the under-capacity of countries to continue projects once they were completed by the European Union. I am equally not yet convinced that budget support can be controlled tightly enough in many developing countries and fear that it will open the door to corruption.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe it is the new factors in the Cotonou Accord that will have the most influence: the political dimension, the emphasis on good governance, conflict prevention and resolution, the interaction with civil society, the regional approach to strengthen trade and the Parliamentary element of the Joint Assembly. All these are elements that should strengthen the partnership.</p>
<p class="contents">All this has changed my role as co-president in the last year. I certainly have played a more political role in the past year, discussing, for instance, conflict resolution and good governance with President Taylor in Liberia, or having discussions on the Zimbabwe situation with the Presidents of Botswana, Malawi and Mozambique, and hearing and seeing the effects on their countries.</p>
<p class="contents">All this depends on an effective Commission, with properly funded and staffed delegations. Most of the ones I have seen are extremely badly serviced at the moment for lack of funds and the petty paperwork they have to handle. This is Parliament's fault. We must urge all countries to ratify the agreement, as Mrs Dybkjær has said, to allow the ninth EDF to come into force.</p>
<p class="contents">This partnership has to work. If we really wish to see an end to economic migration and terrorism in the world, we must provide a standard of living in developing countries which persuades people to stay and work there. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The tightly allocated speaking time unfortunately does not permit a comprehensive appreciation of the Agreement, and I am therefore obliged to limit myself to a few aspects of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The Cotonou Agreement represents the unbroken continuation of European cooperation with the developing states of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, which began with the Yaoundé Agreement and has since 1975 been expanded by a total of four Lomé Agreements. The parties to Lomé I were just 46 ACP countries and nine Member States of the then European Community. The Cotonou Agreement now joins together 77 ACP States and 15 countries of the EU. Even more important, though, than the geographical expansion is the broader basis with regard to content. The collapse of the blocs and the associated political upheavals across the world, including in the ACP States, meant that the political dimension became more significant, as did trade policy. The treaty comprises such important matters as the safeguarding of human rights and the application of the principles of democracy and the rule of law, responsible governance and the strengthening of civil society, failure to observe which may be met with sanctions.</p>
<p class="contents">The political dialogue established by the Cotonou Agreement and the obligation, equally embedded in the Agreement, to work for the consolidation of peace and the prevention and settlement of conflict, along with the declared aim of combating poverty, are important instruments of ACP cooperation, although unfortunately not a guarantee of its success. To demonstrate this, it is enough to refer to Sudan, the Horn of Africa, the Congo, Zimbabwe, Islamic fundamentalism and HIV/AIDS. Parliament's monitoring of ACP cooperation is an example to the world. The Cotonou Agreement has given it a new value, enhancing both its parliamentary character and its role as an open forum for discussion and a monitoring institution. This, too, is part of the new quality of the Cotonou Agreement, and it, too, makes it easy for us, as a Group, to support this Agreement.</p>

The new cooperation agreement with the ACP countries has drawn on the experience gathered to date, and bears witness to new insights in the field of trade, good governance, aid and the role of civil organisations. There is naturally room for criticism but, in my view, Mr Rod is taking things too far in his comprehensive report. In his analysis, Europe is the devil personified while the ACP countries have been elevated to the status of saints. The disastrous, violent conflicts are caused by poverty, and poverty is caused by the rich West. Unfortunately, things are not as simple as that. It is unfair to claim that Cotonou will only lead to unbridled liberalism. However, the agreement does stress with good reason the importance of the participation of players other than the local government, such as NGOs and the private sector. Not only donors have to draw lessons, but also the developing countries themselves. It is therefore to be welcomed that Cotonou reminds the ACP countries of their own responsibilities. It is right that aid should be provided according to the achievements of the receiving countries. Success in the longer term does not only depend on us but also, and above all, on the partners’ own continuous efforts. Would Commissioner Nielsen agree with me on this?</p>
<p class="contents">Administrative capacity is crucial if results are to be achieved. At least as important is preventing the abuse of power and human rights violations. I therefore consider the planned, broad dialogue to be at the heart of the Cotonou Agreement. It is vital that the EU and the ACP partners should not stop at good intentions. Europe must drastically reform its own development, trade and agricultural policy and the ACP countries must put all their efforts into democratisation, political stability and conflict prevention so as to allow their countries to develop socially and to make them fully-fledged trading partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I shall, therefore, limit myself to a few brief observations. I wish to say, first of all, that, to my mind, the greatest success of this new Convention lies in the very fact that its moment has actually arrived, given the long and difficult obstacles that we have had to overcome. These difficulties and obstacles began with the recommendation to end our partnerships with the ACP countries and culminated in the untimely and rather inconvenient problem of migration, already in the final stage of negotiations. The final outcome of these negotiations, in addition to the establishment of a new Convention for a period of twenty years, is therefore, to my mind, to be considered one of the more positive aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">There are also other, more substantial reasons for the Convention, however. For example, a greater call for the participation of civil society, especially if this is given a broad meaning and if it is not at variance with the cooperation and support deserved by the central administrations of the ACP States, which suffer, as a rule, from considerable structural weakness. This also applies to the regionalisation that has been planned, if this is undertaken carefully, if it is not imposed and if it does not represent an undesirable fragmentation of the ACP countries.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be pointed out, however, that there are also aspects of this new Convention that make us rather apprehensive. Firstly, the systematic call for the imposition of unilateral conditions and objectives which, apart from having the potential to destroy a partnership that we want to be of equals, could also undermine the choices made by the ACP countries themselves on their own development policies. Secondly, the rapid move towards enshrining the liberalising rationale of the WTO which, as we know, has been particularly damaging to the least-developed countries. These are aspects which we cannot sweep under the carpet and which, like the clear change of direction towards the East of the European Union – I would remind you that none of the ACP countries is yet on the list of the ten countries that benefit most from European cooperation – may compromise a partnership that we would like to be beneficial, mutually advantageous and capable of ending the cycle of underdevelopment and the enormous poverty that affects those countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is nearly two years ago that the negotiations about the Cotonou Agreement were completed. Despite this, I hope that the Council will take the report by Mr Rod seriously. I would compliment the rapporteur on the sharp analysis in his report. The fact that a number of inconsistencies have survived in the Cotonou Agreement and the unwillingness to reduce underdevelopment if this means abandoning self-interest put the rapporteur in a sombre mood regarding the outcome of the development project. I share his concerns on this. I can only partly subscribe to the shift towards integration in the world trade system instead of a change of that system to benefit the poorest. Admittedly, aid without trade is not very effective, but trade is no panacea for underdevelopment.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to finish off with a word on the future regional trade agreements. From the WTO’s perspective, there is little choice other than continuing with Lomé in the same vein. However, I should like to draw your attention to another perspective, namely that of development. I am not so certain that the regional economic partnership agreements will benefit all our partners. Specifically, the least developed countries will not find them very useful. Furthermore, conflicts of interest may arise between the various countries in their more or less artificially divided regions. This is diametrically opposed to the EU’s conflict prevention policy which is high on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is an agreement that we emphatically support, one in which the significant improvements in terms of content and policy originated in proposals by Parliament. We do not, therefore, share either the rapporteur's highly critical assessment or his reasons for it. Indeed, we take the view that it is something of a caricature.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me, in response to the rapporteur's analysis, list three points in favour. Firstly, the establishment of a parliamentary assembly represents genuine progress, in that, after an appropriate preparatory period, ACP States will be represented only by freely elected parliamentarians, rather than by ambassadors, as is still to some extent the case. This principle must not only be incorporated into the new rules of procedure of our Joint Assembly, but also put into practice. We will vote against the admittance of any ACP ambassador if, for example, he displaces freely elected African delegates.</p>
<p class="contents">The second is the regional approach to cooperation, also originating in proposals by this Parliament, which puts an end to economic parochialism in Africa. Our cooperative effort must in future be focused on regional free trade and cooperation agreements. We insist that our regional parliamentary cooperation should begin on the ground this very year, for example subsequent to our Southern African meeting in Cape Town in March or our meeting with ECOWAS in the course of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we support the reinforcement of the clause on democracy and human rights, which we believe must be speedily implemented. Let me mention only Nigeria, Togo and Zimbabwe as examples of why this is so. We hope that this will bring about genuine parliamentary partnership with our fellow parliamentarians in Africa and elsewhere in the ACP countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This does not prevent us, however, from supporting it and encouraging its ratification.</p>
<p class="contents">This agreement was drawn up in a world significantly different to that of the first Lomé Convention. Under current global conditions, economic instruments are no longer sufficient in themselves to steer globalisation towards the goals of justice. We must also have instruments of political cooperation. For this reason, even with all the shortcomings, this agreement should be welcomed so that we can get the best out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">The role of the European Parliament in this agreement cannot be limited to controlling the European Development Fund. I think that we can achieve a great deal with this agreement. At the moment, we can publicise its positive aspects and attempt to have it ratified by our national parliaments. It is scandalous that a year and a half after it was signed, only three of the fifteen Member States appear to have ratified it.</p>
<p class="contents">Another important action that we can encourage is the consolidation and effective operation of the national parliaments in ACP countries. Mr Rod highlights the participation of civil society as something new in the agreement and recognises the ever-important role of the State but, within States themselves, efficient parliaments are the best guarantee of preventing poverty, fighting corruption and of making our cooperation more effective, which is the underlying objective of the Cotonou Agreement. We support our partners’ parliaments and also the ACP-EU Joint Assembly, which will be able to carry out the function of democratic control conferred on it by the agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Rod asks us the million-dollar question: does our cooperation in the context of the Cotonou agreement aid the development of our ACP partners or does it simply seek to impose the liberal model on these countries? And does the liberal model actually guarantee fair development in these countries? I think that, on its own, it does not work. For this reason, we should make an effort to ensure that this Cotonou agreement is apart from being merely a framework for trade relations, an instrument for decent and equitable political and economic relations with the ACP States and to ensure that our cooperation with them is one of the pillars of a supportive and democratic world order that we need and which we are committed to, at least, as far as my group is concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Howitt (PSE).</span></span>   – Mr President, I welcome the report by Mr Rod and I agree with him that the renewal of the framework agreement governing cooperation between the EU and ACP States is best considered against the backdrop of the challenges posed by globalisation, economic liberalisation and the European Commission's reform of external assistance. Indeed, over 18 months after the signing at Cotonou, we can now begin to assess the agreement by looking at the actual progress made in bringing it to life.</p>
<p class="contents">First, despite its strengths, in one particular aspect at least the previous Lomé agreement fell short, that is in the fight against poverty. I very much welcome the promotion of poverty eradication as one of the core aims of the new partnership agreement, but we must ensure that this is also reflected in the Commission's programming through its country strategy papers.</p>
<p class="contents">I regret to say that the strategy papers reviewed so far show the transport sector receiving 35% and macroeconomic support 25% of all programmable resources. In the Committee on Development and Cooperation we have on countless occasions stressed the need to plough resources into basic health and basic education if we are serious about poverty reduction. It is right to stress this point again tonight.</p>
<p class="contents">The second crucial change from Lomé concerns civil society participation. What sort of results can we expect after hearing reports that civil society has not yet been involved in a genuine and meaningful way? I am disappointed to see that out of a possible 15%, only 2% of resources have been allocated to capacity building in the country strategy papers drawn up so far. Was this because civil society organisations were not consulted or because civil society has such a low absorption rate?</p>
<p class="contents">The Cotonou agreement stipulates that civil society participation should come from the bottom up, yet without the capacity this is impossible.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, in pointing out some of the practical challenges that lie ahead, I would not and do not want to denigrate the huge achievement of the negotiation and signing of the agreement in the first place. The EU-ACP partnership remains a model for North-South cooperation in our world and one which we celebrate properly in our vote for ratification in the European Parliament this week. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">You all know how important it is to complete the ratification process in order to be able to implement the agreement fully, including its financial component. You also know how important the ACP-EC relationship is in the framework of the Community’s development policy.</p>
<p class="contents">One very important aspect is that the text of the Cotonou Agreement is a negotiated text. This is also indirectly reflected in the comments from many in this debate about the fact that having the agreement is quite an achievement. The way we obtained it was through real negotiations. This is what Mr Howitt pointed out in presenting this as a model for a more global relationship between north and south. There are many deficiencies in it and much of the criticism comes from the fact that it is still very ambitious and it is difficult to implement. This has to do with the expectations we have as to what our partner countries actually put into the programming process. This is not for us alone to decide, which is partly my response to Mr Howitt's comments.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall now make some brief comments on the report as such. I find the report’s approach towards the trade dimension of Cotonou interesting, although I cannot agree with all of it. Certainly, the report’s evaluation of the economic and trade regime under Cotonou is based on a political view of development and North-South relations. For example, we do not agree with the report that the Cotonou Agreement is in favour of "development only through market laws". In our view, the Cotonou Agreement provides a comprehensive framework, integrating trade as one instrument among others to promote sustainable development. The core element of future trade relations will be the Economic Partnership Agreements which aim to create favourable conditions to enhance both the volume and the benefits of trade.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, negotiations of regional economic partnership agreements will aim at the progressive and flexible liberalisation of trade flows and at the integration of ACP countries into the world economy. But this will be in line with their level of development and will take into account the socio-economic impact of trade measures. REPAs will be based on regional integration, strengthening and deepening the existing regional integration initiatives. This is also why I do not share the view expressed by Mr Belder that these initiatives could be some sort of risk, in relation to conflict prevention. We clearly have the expectation that this regional cooperation will be part of conflict prevention and strengthen it. This is what experience tells us.</p>
<p class="contents">REPAs will also be linked to comprehensive economic and social measures which can be financed through the EDF. This is not sufficiently reflected in the report.</p>
<p class="contents">Some statements in the report could, in our view, be more precise. For example, the reference to EU beef exports to Western Africa is highly critical of substituting local beef by subsidised EU beef. However, this argument is based on EU exports from 1981 to 1991. We are now in 2002 and the Community’s export policy to developing countries has changed in recent years. In particular, since the early 1990s we have considerably reduced the export refunds for beef exports to Western Africa, precisely to avoid any substitution of local beef by subsidised EU beef. As a consequence, there has been a progressive decrease of EU beef exports to ECOWAS countries from a level of 54 000 tonnes in 1991 to only 1600 tonnes in 2000. This is a classical case. We have had a number of them in the debate about coherence. Most of these cases are historical cases and they have all been solved. But there are other very real, meaningful important problems to discuss within the framework of the debate on coherence, so I would strongly advise everybody in this debate to put the finger on the real problems instead of providing only archaeological material.</p>
<p class="contents">There is also a certain confusion in the report when it comes to trade relations with LDCs. It is stated that LDCs would automatically opt for the Everything but Arms regime, whereas non-LDCs had the choice between Economic Partnership Agreements and the normal GSP regime. This is not the case. On the contrary, it is important to stress that LDCs will be part of the regional economic partnership agreements process. REPAs will tackle all barriers to trade, including issues such as sanitary and phytosanitary measures or technical barriers to trade and will build on the existing regional integration initiatives. Both are highly relevant for LDCs.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let me emphasise that REPAs need to be integrated into the development strategies of the ACP and the EC. It will therefore be essential that negotiations on the REPAs and implementation on the one hand, development policies on the other, are mutually supportive and that appropriate EU support measures are included in regular EDF financing. REPAs will set a trade policy framework which will need to be fully coherent with development policies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true that the objectives of the Cotonou trade agenda are ambitious but doing nothing and continuing with our past approach would incur major risks and would probably not reverse the economic marginalisation of ACP countries. When we look at what has happened so far on the basis of the instruments of the past, this is quite obvious. The Cotonou Agreement provides the instruments to help ACP countries to integrate in the world economy and to reduce poverty. We have to use them in the best possible way. It would be a misunderstanding to think that our agreement here and our instruments can do the trick. There are very good basic reasons why these poor countries are not well integrated into the world economy. There are real problems there.</p>
<p class="contents">The report is written as if it were a realistic assumption that as part of the engineering and the negotiations underlying the Cotonou Agreement we could easily have confronted and changed many of the underlying global issues. I hope I am not shocking anyone by saying that it is not as easy as that. It never was an option to offer the ACP countries a framework of economic development that was not based on the fact that the market economy is here to stay. But this is not the same as saying that the market is the only method. The Commission disagrees with that statement. In fact the whole endeavour of our ACP-EU cooperation, as well as the rest of our global development cooperation effort, is proof of the fact that we are trying to do something that could never have been done if development was left to the market as such. This is why we do it. Let me end on a more conciliatory note by quoting from the conclusion of the report, which I strongly support. "In effect the existence of a new ACP-EU cooperation agreement is a victory in itself. Furthermore, it contains innovative aspects that will have to be interpreted and used constructively. As the European Parliament has no powers to amend this text, it is essential to work to get the most out of it, so that aid can make a real contribution to the well-being of the people of the ACP countries, as regards their food, health, educational requirements, etc." This is the kind of language I can identify with. We welcome this conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to conclude by expressing deep satisfaction on behalf of the Commission that the European Parliament has now concluded its part of this process and we hope to see it concluded in general as soon as possible. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
