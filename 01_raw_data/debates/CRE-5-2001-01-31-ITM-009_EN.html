<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">McNally (PSE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – Mr President, this report concerns the proposed adoption by the European Union of the United States’ energy star programme as it applies to office and communication technology equipment. This, colleagues, is not the sexiest title on this week’s agenda, perhaps, but it is directly linked to the future of our planet and to the possibility of even more devastating weather events, mass movements of people and crop failure.</p>
<p class="contents">Our irresponsible and profligate use of energy, with its consequential emissions of C02 and other environmental hazards must stop. Ironically enough, it is in the United States, where the energy star scheme originated, that we have recently seen the absurd spectacle of power cuts in California, largely because of the incredible increase in the use of computers and other office equipment with the accompanying need for air-conditioning within a framework of quite bizarre and unwise deregulation. Things would have been even worse without the energy star programme.</p>
<p class="contents">This scheme, which is voluntary, was introduced in 1992 and is now very widespread. It has been officially adopted in Australia and Japan for example. Members may in fact have seen the energy star logo on computers bought in the EU, although this means nothing yet since the technology has to be specially activated, which is done only in the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">This evening we are discussing the draft regulation which will implement the US/EU agreement on which we shall vote in the next session. It is a voluntary scheme and it is hoped that between now and 2015 savings of 10 terawatt hours and 5 million tonnes of C02 emissions will be achieved in the EU through this scheme.</p>
<p class="contents">I now enter the world of science fiction and explain that to be energy-efficient, computers must go to sleep, but they must wake up instantly when they are required to do so. When they are asleep their electricity consumption is cut on average from 100 watts to 5 watts. Given the number of computers in homes, schools, workplaces, etc., you can see how the savings mount up from the good sleeping habits of those machines. Until now, the European Union has produced its own energy efficient standards, often mandatory and the European Parliament has taken seriously its responsibility as a co-legislator to see that such standards are sufficiently stringent. That is why there would be very serious reservations from Parliament about adopting this US energy star scheme if that were to be our only measure and especially if there were no provisions in the agreement for regular review of the results, with the objective, of course, of always being at the leading edge of the relevant technologies.</p>
<p class="contents">Luckily that is not the case however, and the Commission is to be given powers to negotiate improvements in the technical specifications. And it has been made quite clear to the US authorities in a side letter to the agreement that the European Parliament, which would have been a co-legislator with the Council for similar measures at European level, will be consulted by the Commission on matters concerning technical specifications.</p>
<p class="contents">In the amendments to my report, we make it clear that further measures are certainly needed, including the glaringly obvious one of switching the machines off sometimes and withdrawing particularly inefficient machines from the market, either voluntarily or, if necessary, with legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">I am quite sure that the Council will see the wisdom of these amendments and of the regular and earlier monitoring of the energy star scheme as one, but only one, component of our energy efficient action plan. We believe the current legal base is the correct one and we join the Commission in their suggestions.</p>
<p class="contents">As rapporteur, I would like to thank the Commission for their cooperation and help and of course thank my colleagues, especially Mrs Müller, who drafted a very useful opinion from the Environment Committee. We all hope that the energy star scheme is a success and we look forward to watching computers throughout Europe going to sleep at the correct time. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Consumption labelling is, in my view, an important free-market instrument for promoting the use of energy-efficient equipment. The energy-star label should help to promote energy efficient standby equipment. The energy-saving potential of this equipment cannot be underestimated, and by introducing such a label the European Union will be providing the impetus needed to encourage people to use energy more sparingly.</p>
<p class="contents">Saving energy goes hand in hand with reducing carbon dioxide emissions, as agreed under the Climate Protection Agreement. I think it is all the more likely to succeed if applied just about globally to office equipment. This would give us a joint labelling scheme, not only with the USA but also, indirectly, with Japan and some other countries. In this way, we would be taking account of the global market, which would help remove barriers to trade. The fields of telecommunications and information technology would seem to be particularly important in this respect.</p>
<p class="contents">I think it is of the utmost importance for national experts on energy policy, as well as other interested parties, to be involved in setting up the European Union Energy Star Board, so that national interests can be properly represented. The Energy Star Board will be required to draw up a report on the market penetration of products bearing the Energy Star logo. Given the rapid pace of technological development in office and telecommunications equipment, I think yearly intervals would be appropriate. That is the only way to ensure that the label is only used to distinguish those products which consume markedly less energy than the average for all similar equipment on the market. Against this background, I urge you to support my opinion, which is appended to this report and which was adopted in the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Saving energy and reducing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide are important EU goals. It is not always possible to achieve these goals without effort and without sacrificing certain comforts, but sometimes it is quite a simple matter. Sometimes, all it takes is to deploy the technical means, which are already in existence, yet people do not always have the political will to do this with any vigour.</p>
<p class="contents">Eleven per cent of electricity consumption in private households in the country I come from, Germany, is caused by standby losses. Add to that the private and public spheres and the losses total 20 TWh per year, which corresponds to the output of two large power stations that we are simply running for no purpose. So although no demands are made on the capacity of the piece of equipment, it still consumes energy. Now of course the easiest thing to do – as Mrs McNally has already said – would be to switch the piece of equipment off when it is not in use. That would be one way of resolving the problem in many spheres, for example, we should simply do more to encourage the public to get into this habit with their television sets. But in quite a few spheres, it is no longer possible to switch equipment off at all, and it is particularly important for computers, by their very nature, to quickly fall into ‘sleep mode’, as Mrs McNally puts it, and also ‘wake up’ instantaneously, because you sometimes need to be able to log onto a computer straightaway, and do not want to have to slowly coax it into life.</p>
<p class="contents">There are technical problems to be dealt with, but they can in fact be solved by technical means, without wasting energy. There are new and innovative techniques designed to reduce the no-load losses almost to zero; they just have to be incorporated. None of this is problematic from a technical viewpoint any longer. That is why it is a positive thing to be discussing the Energy Star scheme and to label equipment that incorporates these new technical possibilities and is highly energy-efficient. It is the right way to go, which is why the PPE-DE Group supports the Commission’s proposal, as well as the report by Mrs McNally.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I feel we need to go further still. When I took on the responsibility as shadow rapporteur for the PPE-DE Group, I made enquiries of experts in the various organisations, non-governmental organisations, Ministries and in the Commission, but I also asked people who are confronted with this issue on a daily basis, for example a computer dealer who is a friend of mine. I asked him what he thought of Energy Star and he replied that he thought it was a good thing. He said there were technical problems to begin with, because the computers went into ‘sleep mode’ alright, but failed to ‘wake up’ again quickly enough. He felt that although we have now solved all the technical problems, no one is interested in whether or not a computer has an Energy Star, and he did not think it was a selling point. That is why I think we should consider whether or not we should just apply the principle we are advocating here, i.e. giving highly efficient equipment a positive label, or whether we should also aim to rid the market of the worst offending products, which are highly inefficient, and simply refuse to allow them access to the market after a transitional period. I feel that is something else to think about – Mrs McNally’s report makes the same point – and then we would have a comprehensive energy efficiency programme in this sphere. Hence my appeal to you to adopt these amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are all agreed on this matter. The present trend in matters of energy efficiency is not always the best possible alternative, however. For example, the aim for household appliances should be that all power-consuming circuits should be switched off. But this is not possible in all cases: modern equipment often lacks an on/off button, as was mentioned here earlier on, making it utterly impossible to switch it off, even if the consumer wants to. Many machines have a small red lamp that glows constantly to show that the equipment is still on and that it is consuming energy to some extent. If we imagine the infinitesimally small amount of one watt per hour per appliance in a household this volume of energy consumption is multiplied very quickly. With just a thousand appliances the figure reaches one kilowatt per hour, and with a million, one megawatt per hour, at which point we are talking about much larger volumes of energy consumption. On the other hand, a quiescent current has its positive side, when, for example, the air in the room has to be heated. In the northern regions of the Union, rooms, houses and buildings are heated and the heat produced from appliances and bulbs cuts heating costs. But then again, in warm conditions, especially in the southernmost countries of the Union, where rooms must be kept cool with air-conditioning, the costs resulting from quiescent currents are doubled.</p>
<p class="contents">The general aim must be to promote the use of technology that consumes less energy; for example, the use of glow bulbs in equipment should always be avoided when they can be replaced with LEDs. Furthermore, there must be more focus on consumer information than is the case at present. It is difficult for the consumer to appreciate that equipment that is cheap to buy but an ‘energy guzzler’ will prove expensive in the course of time. Energy efficiency labelling must be standardised in such a way that all consumers of any age, including children and the elderly, understand how much energy a piece of equipment consumes. The information must be easily intelligible to all. Merely to mention wattage means nothing to many people. The manufacturers of equipment must explain, for example, in the instructions for use, how to save energy using the equipment in question. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, I must first thank Mrs McNally for her excellent report. I would also like to thank Parliament for its broad support for this proposal. In the Commission’s view this proposal will make a significant contribution to improving energy efficiency and therefore to controlling demand, which the Green Paper identifies as crucial to assuring a reliable supply. We are also called upon to reduce consumption and spend less, making better use of what we have available. In addition, I should like to thank Mrs Müller for her opinion on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">A substantial improvement in the efficiency of end use of electricity is required if we are to meet the European Union’s commitment to reduce CO2 emissions by the year 2010. Office technology equipment represents a significant percentage of energy consumption in the service sector and offers wide scope for energy saving. The Commission has therefore put forward the Energy Star Programme as a key measure to reduce the consumption of energy by office technology equipment. It completes the measures adopted by other end use sectors such as domestic electrical appliances and lighting.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1994 the Commission has been working on the introduction of this programme with the full support of Community industry and independent experts. The Energy Star Programme is voluntary and makes use of a marketing device: a quality label enabling buyers to identify products which consume energy most efficiently.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, thanks to the adoption of the programme the Community will be doing more than introducing a programme for labelling office equipment – which has proved very successful where it has been implemented – and putting in place a viable measure to reduce CO2 emissions. We shall be able to seize the opportunity of applying a standard which is in practice acquiring international significance. What we are engaged in is important not only for us but because of its impact in other parts of the world. In this context, I believe it is essential for us to become joint leaders at international level together with the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I am aware that Parliament was not very happy with the procedures followed in connection with the conclusion and signature of this agreement. However, we were bound by the procedures laid down in Article 300 of the Treaty, and I am delighted to note that Parliament feels that the advantages of the agreement outweigh such differences of opinion. Furthermore, at Parliament’s request, in a letter annexed to the agreement, we have informed the other party, namely the United States. We shall ensure that Parliament is kept informed of the review of the technical specifications, a point raised by Mrs McNally and with which we totally agree.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the amendments, I am in a position to say that we can accept all the amendments tabled by Parliament, with the exception of Amendment No 9. The Commission agrees that the energy efficiency of office equipment must be monitored, but it does not feel that we should call for a special unit to be set up, as stated in the aforementioned amendment, if only because the necessary resources will not be forthcoming. I therefore ask you to reconsider the matter, ladies and gentlemen. If this amendment were omitted, I think we could adopt the proposal at first reading and make faster progress. The final decision rests with Parliament of course. Please take this into account. I can assure you that no further resources will be made available, so in the end it will not serve any useful purpose.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, we do in principle accept Amendments Nos 5, 11, and 15. Concerning Amendments Nos 11 and 15, we accept that the Commission should present a report to the Council and to Parliament. However, the Commission feels that the best time to do so would be after three years had elapsed, as was the case for the first assessment of the Energy Star Programme</p>
<p class="contents">That concludes my summary of our position. Once again, I should like to express my thanks to the honourable Members who have taken the floor, and especially to Mrs McNally for her splendid work. I trust we shall all reach agreement at the earliest opportunity, if possible at first reading. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
