<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">García-Orcoyen Tormo (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. – <span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, I must confess I was pleased to see you come in, because I was practically under the impression that I was going to be the only person in the Chamber. I would also like to thank the Commissioner, who, after a hard day, is here with us this evening.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper on an integrated product policy should, in my opinion, be the framework for the formulation of a series of guidelines and proposals that will enable both producers and consumers to make full use of the instruments and opportunities offered by the market to be able to make it function in a way that is better adapted to the practice of sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">This new approach needs to be an improvement on the traditional approach that the European Union has been following up to now, which is essentially based on encouraging environmental improvement in the production sector through standards that establish limits for pollution and also through voluntary instruments that promote the differentiation of companies and products that incorporate environmental improvements.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to admit, with regard to these voluntary methods, which have been implemented since the early nineties, such as the co-determination regulation, European eco-audits and the ecolabel, that these have not been as successful as had been hoped and, above all, have not been implemented in a similar fashion in all Member States. Only 3 200 companies throughout Europe have obtained EMAS certification and only 350 products from 70 companies have these European ‘ecolabels’.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, the main cause of this situation lies in the rigidity of the system and the still weak consumer demand for ‘green’ products. The Commission, aware of this problem, has presented this Green Paper on integrated product policy, with varying degrees of wisdom and balance. It has been widely discussed in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, but I, naturally, maintain that the Commission has shown considerable dedication to the matter.</p>
<p class="contents">Various mechanisms have been proposed with the aim of stimulating the necessary environmental improvement of products and their consumption. The proposal contains a series of suggestions that would facilitate the implementation of different policies and market instruments that go further than those that focus exclusively on the environment and that, I think, will make it easier for a future White Paper to be more detailed and better developed.</p>
<p class="contents">We are faced with the need to adopt a decisive approach to stimulate environmental improvement in the EU market, which will allow products to be given prices that are fairer from an environmental point of view, to stimulate demand that is more appropriate and to make the use of instruments for clean production more widespread. Furthermore, I believe that this approach will give greater impetus to the integration of environmental policy in other areas, such as the economic or social areas, and with this we will be better able to fulfil the mandates of Cardiff and Gothenburg.</p>
<p class="contents">Though the amendments that Parliament has tabled, it has brought a greater degree of precision and clarity to the Commission proposal with regard to the orientation of the IPP and also to the role of each of the actors – companies, public authorities and consumers – and has given very clear consideration to the issue of shared responsibility without this involving a decrease in producers’ responsibility, but instead taking into account and also putting an emphasis on the responsibility of both public authorities and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Public authorities, for example, can provide a very important boost for a more environmentally friendly market though public procurement. They can also point out useful market instruments to put the IPP into practice: economic instruments, such as tax incentives, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the Parliament text highlights the importance of an improved and enhanced eco-label, the need to improve European standardisation processes, the need to set parameters and indicators that are simple to apply and similar in all Member States for the lifecycle of products, not forgetting the need not to endanger free competition in the market or in European companies. The text also highlights the crucial role of information, which should be clearer, more truthful and easy to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that I have accounted for the majority of amendments tabled in Plenary. I have accepted them and I have only rejected those that I feel do not fit into the framework or context of a Green Paper. In my opinion, this is a good proposal that deserves all our support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Commission has strong institutional powers, which it could use to actively drive the IPP process. Too often we are left with the impression of a Commission that is a spectator rather than a powerful actor.</p>
<p class="contents">We also need more joined-up thinking, more explicit connections between the IPP project, the Sixth Environmental Action Programme and the Strategy for Sustainable Development. We would like to see those links made much more explicit.</p>
<p class="contents">To summarise a number of the other concerns raised by the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, we believe that the strategy tends to rely too heavily on voluntary agreements. They clearly have a role to play, but they are not a substitute for regulation; they should be seen as complementary to it. At the very least we need very clear benchmarks, objectives and timetables for any voluntary agreements so that we can ensure that they are working.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper also focuses almost exclusively on products rather than services and therefore misses another whole raft of potential opportunities to green an increasingly large area of our economies.</p>
<p class="contents">Perhaps one of the major shortcomings of the Paper is its insufficient awareness of the broader international trade context, under which, unfortunately, some of its proposals would have questionable legality. The effectiveness of the IPP strategy will be severely curtailed unless the Commission explicitly recognises the reforms that would be needed to the World Trade Organisation in particular, to enable its measures to be set out.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, with respect to public procurement, greening public procurement is vitally important but there are currently obstacles in achieving that which should have been acknowledged more explicitly in the Paper, along with strategies to address the problem.</p>
<p class="contents">It is very significant that in its opinion the Committee of the Regions specifically refers to the restricted scope of local and regional authorities for action when it comes to green procurement and notes that legal action has already been taken against a number of towns and cities which have tried to implement a green procurement policy. Those are the kinds of areas that need to be changed. We look forward to an ambitious new White Paper in the near future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome the Commission’s proposal and the rapporteur’s tough, practical, calm handling of the subject.</p>
<p class="contents">Each product has a life cycle, which starts when it is made available to the consumer. When the consumer uses it, the product’s environmental sustainability – a rather complex term although now universally understood – immediately becomes part of the equation. The relationship is delicate and it does not end with the use or end, so to speak, of the product’s life. Indeed, the most serious problems often arise when the product ceases to perform its function and needs to be disposed of, pensioned off, in other words eliminated from the world in which it has performed its function.</p>
<p class="contents">It is at this point that the most critical environmental implications come into play, for not all products can be disposed of using the same technology, nor are they all hazardous to the same degree or all biodegradable to the same degree. That is why the Commission is proposing an initiative which deals with the problem at source: if a product is to be easy to dispose of at the end of its lifecycle, this must be taken into consideration right from the design stage, and this is where the greatest merit of the report lies. Here, then, is the proposal to create incentives to encourage initial research on how to keep manufacturers better informed of the technologies and raw materials available to this end.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal does not overlook a factor which could give rise to opposition from manufacturers: cost. The text states in quite practical terms that, in addition to encouraging the provision of aid to producers who will face greater costs if they supply these biodegradable goods, a pricing policy also needs to be established allowing manufacturers to set different prices on the market and, moreover, why not, allowing variable taxation to be introduced as well.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, those involved in protecting the environment, who are therefore helping us, deserve some support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Green Paper is about answering this question from an ecological point of view. So far, in my opinion, we have been giving inadequate answers to this question, with well-known consequences: substantial detriment to the environment by production and the use to which products are put, with associated detriment to the health of workers and consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Rather than carry on with this policy, we should get serious about one that is integrated. In that way, we shall be able to make financial savings and will not need to eliminate environmental damage. For these reasons, too, we need a strategy for the development of more environmentally friendly products and services. The report before us, completed by the amendments adopted in Committee, provides a good framework for a product policy on ecological lines. The Commission proposal for the discussion process in Committee was of little help, though. The statements made in this text were couched in vague terms, there were no evident structures for further action, nor was there any evidence of a coordinated discussion process. I do not think that any entrepreneur or consumer is going to be won over to an environmentally friendly product by such a hotchpotch of proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission must see to it that the statements made in its forthcoming texts are of greater clarity. What is important to my group is that the environmental costs as a whole should be reflected in the prices of products. Tax incentives should also be guaranteed so that disadvantaged consumers can also buy environmentally friendly products.</p>
<p class="contents">European product standardisation must be involved to a greater extent, and services should also be made subject to environmental criteria. Another option for the creation of a market for environmentally friendly products would be, for example, the use of economic guidance instruments. We should monitor their use and the effect they have, and it is vitally important that we should ensure that EU environmental legislation is not neutralised.</p>
<p class="contents">In view of the unsatisfactory text produced by the Commission, the rapporteur has done a good job, but further action must not be limited to contributions to discussion. We urgently need definite proposals for the promotion of environmentally friendly products. Producers and consumers must be made sensitive to the various aspects of environmental quality. This report is a start, but the real work on its content remains to be done. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Within the safe food sector, where most of my work is done, a ‘farm to fork’ principle, which is very effective when attempts are made to legislate and to try to see the connections, has now finally been arrived at following a host of scandals and disasters. I should like the White Paper to be based on approximately the same principle so that each product can be traced and seen in its context: finite or renewable raw materials, the supply of energy, what form of energy is used, chemicals, the flow chart for the product, logistics etc. This is especially important for very large volumes of products, consisting in actual fact of food, water and household chemicals. These account for more than half of the consignments transported on our roads and consume an incredible amount in terms of resources, despite our perhaps not even thinking of them as products. I am therefore looking for a strategy in which everything is traceable and in which we can track a product’s history, and for principles that are valid whether we are talking about a car or a packet of sausages for lunch. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In particular I would like to thank Mrs García-Orcoyen Tormo being such a committed rapporteur on this challenging and difficult issue. I would also like to thank you for your speeches. I would agree with a lot of what has been said during this short debate.</p>
<p class="contents">In reducing the environmental impact of products throughout their life cycle, the objective of IPP is fundamental to addressing our environmental problems. For this reason IPP is a key measure within the Sixth Environment Action Programme and the Sustainable Development Strategy also underlines its importance. The difficulty we face is that there are so many products on the market today, products that often have long supply chains involving many different actors. Because of this it is impossible to develop a "one size fits all" instrument. Instead we need a variety of instruments and exactly which ones depends on what is most effective at each point in the supply chain. They can be both voluntary and mandatory. I agree that voluntary measures should be complementary and we should make sure that they are not the only instrument used.</p>
<p class="contents">When thinking about IPP at European level, we should also recognise the experience gained in several Member States – Denmark, Germany, Sweden and Italy, to name but a few- over the last few years. There is, therefore, widespread acceptance of the concept and interest in it. In 1999 the informal Environment Council asked the Commission to come forward with a Green Paper on the issue. I therefore delivered this paper to start the debate on what form the European IPP should take. The reactions to it from the 130 stakeholders who submitted comments were generally positive, but what came back was what has been reflected here, namely that it is sometimes seen as being too fluffy and not really an understandable concept. But it sounds nice, as they say, and in general the opinions of the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions were favourable as well.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper suggested a strategy and tools for making a European IPP a reality. Many such tools already exist – public procurement legislation, European eco-labels and EMAS, to name but a few. In other areas we will have to be innovative and think of new instruments. The Green Paper sought to canvas the views of stakeholders on the way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission did this not just because it wanted to develop the best possible policy, but also because IPP needs the active involvement of all stakeholders to succeed. Your resolution concludes this stakeholder consultation process and will enable us to develop the White Paper. From your resolution and the comments from stakeholders it is clear that the White Paper needs to start with concrete environmental problems. This is what we have learnt from this discussion. Issues such as climate change, hazardous chemicals and biodiversity affect us all. If we take environmental problems rather than instruments as our point of departure, we can better convey the idea that IPP is more than just a collection of tools, something that we perhaps did not do sufficiently in the Green Paper. We have to link it to concrete environmental problems to describe how to use these instruments. This is also what Mrs Paulsen referred to.</p>
<p class="contents">These tools will still be important. We need to continue developing them because we cannot address millions of products individually. However, I too am coming to the conclusion that we need to focus our actions on particular products and sectors. You rightly make this suggestion in paragraphs 24 and 25 of your resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">We will also need to set out the strategy for implementing IPP and its advantages and the Commission will need to consider carefully the measures within IPP's scope as well as how it relates to other policies. It is my intention to ask the Commission to adopt this paper during the second quarter of this year. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
