We were surprised yesterday to be presented with a new and very lengthy set of amendments. These were tabled as compromise amendments, but they are not in fact compromise amendments, since no compromise was reached on any of the amendments tabled in Parliament. They represent a whole new approach, which we know to be the clear result of the last Council meeting.</p>
<p class="contents">When there are more than 50 amendments, Rule 130a of our Rules of Procedure gives the President the right to request that the committee meet to consider the matter. We believe, then, that this would be the correct procedure if we are to operate democratically and openly. Given the number of amendments tabled, we should discuss the matter again in committee. We could then vote on the report during the July part-session. We cannot understand why we are due to work under the conditions anticipated for this evening and tomorrow. They are difficult for us to accept. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">De Palacio, Loyola,</span></span>   <span class="italic">Commission</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(ES)</span> Mr President, the aim of this proposal is to implement once and for all the aims set out in Amsterdam in Article 191 of the Treaty on European Union. This article was supplemented by the Treaty of Nice when the latter added a legal basis for adopting the necessary legislative measures through the codecision procedure and qualified majority voting.</p>
<p class="contents">Political parties at European level are an important part of the democratic structure of the Union. They are a factor for integration. They contribute to forming a European awareness, to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union and to promoting political debate at European level. To be able to do this they must have resources. It is therefore appropriate and necessary that they should be helped to carry out the tasks conferred on them by the Treaty and that they should consequently receive at least partial financing from the Community budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The Regulation seeks to establish a solid and transparent legislative framework for the recognition and financing of European political parties. We are not starting from scratch, ladies and gentlemen; this new proposal is based on the constructive work undertaken by Parliament and the Council in 2001, particularly during the Belgian Presidency. I wish, in this regard, to congratulate Mrs Schleicher, who served as rapporteur at the time.</p>
<p class="contents">We have taken advantage of the new opportunities provided by majority voting in comparison to the 2001compromise to propose higher thresholds for obtaining financing.</p>
<p class="contents">Our basic proposal has sought to avoid political requirements that are too restrictive for European political parties for two main reasons: firstly, we want an open and plural system in which all shades of opinion can be represented in the European debate; secondly, if things were done otherwise, the debate in Council and in Parliament would be drawn out unnecessarily, perhaps even beyond the 2004 European elections.</p>
<p class="contents">All three institutions agree that a European political party that wishes to be recognised as such and to obtain financing from the Community budget must fulfil certain minimum conditions.</p>
<p class="contents">We have sought to establish conditions that are not too restrictive but which are coherent and fundamental. Parties must be representative, must have a statute and aims, they must prove their intention to stand in European elections, they must have clear rules for their financial management and above all respect the democratic principles established in Articles 6(1) and 6(2) of the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. At the same time, there must be a reliable verification system. Parliament must be able to verify whether all of these conditions are met before registering a party. Furthermore, there is a special verification procedure for cases in which a minority in Parliament rejects the initial decision.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to receive financing, we propose that the parties have representatives elected at European, national and regional level in one third of the Union’s States, because these are supposed to be European parties and this is the European arena and, therefore, the arena that needs to be boosted.</p>
<p class="contents">In line with Declaration No 11 annexed to the Treaty of Nice, the Commission proposal prohibits the cross-financing of national political parties. It also prohibits political groups from raising financing by providing services, unless these are paid for in a verifiable and documented way, in other words, through bills.</p>
<p class="contents">Article 8 sets out strict control and auditing measures to strengthen the transparency and legitimacy of the system; we consider that parties should not depend completely on public financing and we therefore propose that they should raise at least 25% of their budget themselves.</p>
<p class="contents">We have made a balanced proposal on the controversial issue of donations in line with the 2001 compromise and consequently propose that donations should be permitted, although only if they satisfy strict conditions of transparency.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, Mr President, I wish to congratulate the Greek Presidency on the results it has achieved, on the compromise reached between Council and Parliament, in which the Commission played a part and which should, we hope, enable this dossier to be concluded at first reading.</p>
<p class="contents">I congratulate Mr Leinen and the Presidency, and on behalf of the Commission I wish to express our full acceptance of and support for this compromise, which we consider to be appropriate and which will meet the needs of the various players involved in this complex matter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is why it is vitally important that this House should, tomorrow, approve this act on the statute and financing of European political parties, for then, as soon as this summer, something that is, in particular, a corner-stone of greater transparency in European politics can become effective, and the parties will have enough time, between now and the elections in June 2004, to adjust themselves to the new arrangements that this law makes necessary.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this act tomorrow, Parliament will also be honouring a promise, made to the Court of Auditors, that it would, within the life of this Parliament, submit a new basis for the financing of European political work and put an end to the cross-subsidisation of party work via this House and the political groups within it. The fact is that, in all our countries, the functions of parties and parliaments are kept separate, and this law will give us the opportunity to both distinguish between the different functions and roles of parties on the one hand and parliamentary groups on the other, and also to make them a reality, at EU level as is the case elsewhere, by means of the new basis on which they are funded. Thanks are due to the political groups for having, so to speak, acted as midwives at the birth of the European political parties. Without them, there would have been nobody capable of funding them.</p>
<p class="contents">The draft now before you is something we regard as an acceptable compromise. It complies with the conditions imposed by the majority on the committee, and minor changes have been made to it. There are compromise motions that we are putting forward, which we can vote on tomorrow, and indeed we are meant to.</p>
<p class="contents">The reduction of the threshold for a European political party’s representation in the European Parliament from one third to one quarter of the Member States enables smaller political parties to participate in this system of financing. One quarter is, however, a necessary threshold even if we want to prevent the fragmentation of the party political landscape while taking into account the fact that we are also incorporating the regional parliaments and also the regional assemblies into the system. I believe that one quarter makes for a sensible compromise on which to agree.</p>
<p class="contents">Donations to political parties differ widely from one country to another and are another sensitive and highly controversial issue. The draft act has, I believe, come down decisively on one side of the line. Donations to the European political parties are to be made as transparent as possible. We have compromised on a ceiling of EUR 12 000 per annum for each donor; although some find it too high, and others too low, no political party can be bought for EUR 12 000. It is my belief that support must also be given if political work is fostered by society rather than only by the State – that is right and proper, provided that transparency exists and controls are in place.</p>
<p class="contents">The way is now open for the European political parties to expand their activities in the run-up to the European elections. There had at first been some doubts about this, and those who jeopardise this are also putting in question the reason and purpose for European political parties’ existence. I believe that this document makes proper provision for such matters, and it will be important even after the draft Constitution has been produced, as the European Parliament of the future is to elect the President of the Commission. The parties will of course be very important in this regard.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me also point out that there is a fly in the ointment. This statute does not yet confer European legal personality, but the financing sees us taking the first step, with the second step, in the form of an actual European statute, perhaps yet to come. I have always maintained that the European law on political parties must be to politics what the European Company is to business. We will get back to the subject when Parliament draws up a report in two years’ time.</p>
<p class="contents">I also have to thank the Commission for having come up with the proposal, and Mrs de Palacio and Mr Fitzmaurice many times over for their constant active involvement. I congratulate the Greek Presidency of the Council and all the governments who were ready to accept this compromise; Mr Nikos Matthioudakis was my constant partner in the truest sense of the word, and he and I were able to hammer out this compromise together. Let me also thank my fellow-Members: Mr Dimitri Tsatsos, whose report many years ago laid the foundations for this whole topic; Mrs Schleicher for her report two years ago; and also the political groups, the shadow rapporteurs, and the secretariat, which has done outstanding work on this. Tomorrow, we can vote in favour. I hope that we will. We will then have taken an important step for political work at EU level, and thus also for European democracy. Thank you, all those who have helped in this!</p>

That is one reason why I am sure that by far most of our committee can live with the fact that this compromise takes no account of a number of our important points; this is, though, a parliament and not a meeting of diplomats, and that is why a certain number of things remain to be said.</p>
<p class="contents">In the committee, we favoured putting the financing of European political parties under the Commission’s budget rather than Parliament’s. In this afternoon’s debate in this Chamber on the outcome of the Convention, Mr Hänsch told us: ‘The nation-state of the nineteenth century is not the blueprint for Europe's architecture in the twenty-first century.’ We have to remind ourselves of this when discussing the question: what about the requirement that parties be independent of the state? If we take that as being fundamental, we may well get different answers to that question at European and at national level. It may be that the reasoning underlying the imperative that states should be at arms’ length from political parties and their financial arrangements, is best satisfied if, at European level, they are linked to the Commission rather than to Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">Our committee was in favour of incorporating tougher sanctions in the event of political parties failing to comply with the requirements of financial transparency. We wanted the money not merely to be repaid; we wanted it to repay twice the amount. If there is not to be too great a temptation to do this, then sanctions must really hurt. That is why it is regrettable that it was not possible to negotiate this with the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two further comments I would like to make on the questions that have cropped up. The way the Commission said that the doubling of the amount was not on, because there was no provision for it in the Financial Regulation, reminded me of encounters with people who say such things as, ‘that is how we have always done it’, ‘we have never done it like that before’, and ‘who knows what would come of it?’ Those are the sort of archetypal experiences that you get with bureaucracies. Or what was said on the subject of the question raised in the original draft, to the effect that ‘you in the political parties can do anything except fund election campaigns’; if that was the line taken over a long period of time by the national governments and the Commission, then that is another reason why the bureaucracies of the Council and the Commission were known and feared throughout Europe for their capacity for innovation, and I think we should not forget that, when it comes to taking decisions, a bit more awareness of real life would do us all some good. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is in fact Parliament that is the heart of the European parties, for it was in Parliament that the need arose to develop commonalities within Europe, and, if you bear in mind that 133 political parties are represented today in this House, united in seven political families, that alone shows how there are no limits to the work done for Europe, in this House, by the political groups, which, in the European Parliament, bring together the states whose political parties are elected to the European Parliament. That is, in itself, unbelievably laborious work, and I believe that we sometimes undervalue it.</p>
<p class="contents">Why has this been a never-ending story? It was Mr Tsatsos – and let me say that I believe this has been his life’s work – who produced the first report to this House aimed at fostering awareness of how necessary European political parties are. Then we had Amsterdam, which made it possible to get an initiative going, but, as the Council at that time was unable to come to an agreement, Parliament’s report was left high and dry in the Council.</p>
<p class="contents">I would now like to extend warm thanks to the Commission. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Nice on 1 February this year, the Commission presented a proposal in the shortest conceivable time; now that we have considered it, I can tell you that they made a very quick job of it. The end result has been that we have not only considered it, but will – it is to be hoped – be finalising it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to thank Mr Leinen for his considerable efforts, and I can say on behalf of all of us that, even though we have not got everything we wanted, we still want a solution, and, as I see it, we need one in view of the fact that the Court of Auditors has ended up presenting us with the prospect of having, at the end of this year, to abandon the current practice, which gives the parties stability, and if we do not find a solution, we will then be facing oblivion. That is why, yet again, I would like to ask all those among you who still have doubts, to lend a hand in the completion of a work and in finding an eventual solution, one that is clear and open to scrutiny and, therefore, one that has to work.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to thank not only Mr Leinen, but also the Greek Presidency of the Council, which, with all the work it has to do – and there are many other matters to deal with –made a real effort and did everything possible to get the Council to come up with a joint resolution. I do think that we in this House should not only express our appreciation of this, but should also say that it is because everyone has done their bit that we are now coming to a conclusion.</p>
<p class="contents">In every democratic state the world over, this political order, which secures for the people freedom and co-determination, is founded upon political parties and guaranteed by them. We simply have to see that, as the European Economic Community developed and expanded into the European Union, it was therefore hardly surprising that European political parties should undergo a parallel development. It is for that reason that I am appealing to all those who may perhaps still harbour doubts to play their part in helping us, tomorrow, to achieve a result that will lay a foundation, one on the basis of which political parties can be funded, one that will make the future continuation of this work possible. So, again, I thank all those involved and all those who will, tomorrow, help us to achieve this outcome.</p>

I would like to congratulate those involved on having worked so hard to make it possible for us to reach a first reading agreement so that this legislation can be adopted in good time before the next European elections. I would like to pay tribute to the work of the rapporteur, Jo Leinen, in this respect, and indeed to all those who came before him in preparing the way, notably Professor Tsatsos in his report a number of years ago.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an exercise in transparency, no more, no less. It puts on a clear and transparent footing the method by which the Union will finance trans-national European political parties. Up to now it has been done indirectly via the political groups in the European Parliament, henceforth it will be done directly according to clear criteria and clear procedures set out in this legislation. That is why we welcome it.</p>
<p class="contents">My group also accepts the various compromises that have been made as regards the detail. Frankly, we would have preferred a higher threshold in Article 3, as regards the representativity of European political parties, but we are happy to accept, in the spirit of compromise that is necessary in the European Union, that this somewhat lower threshold will apply. We are particularly pleased that the issue of donations has been settled, and that a clear, transparent and limited system where any donation to a political party is limited in level and also has to be registered on a register is laid down in the text.</p>
<p class="contents">There are a few strange little things in the text where I think the lawyer-linguists need to look at some of the translation versions. It is not a matter of amending the text formally in the plenary, but when the <span class="italic">toilettage</span> of the text is done I would like them to look notably at Article 5(2), where the English version specifies that Parliament verifies that a party meets the necessary conditions by a majority of its Members. Is that a majority of Members needing to accept that a party meets the conditions, or a majority of Members needing to challenge that a party no longer meets the necessary conditions? The text in the English version is not clear and it would be useful if that were tidied up when the translations are verified.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, that Article makes no mention – it may just be a typing error – of the verification of Article 3d. It mentions 3a, 3b and 3c, but 3d seems to be missing. No doubt this can easily be corrected.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on Article 6, point (c), the fourth and last indent in the English version reads as if it almost contradicts the previous indent. I think it is clear what the intention was in drafting it this way, but it has not been very well rendered in the English language version and it would be useful to correct it. Those conclude my comments on behalf of the PSE Group. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his work. I would also like to congratulate the Council for having finally seen sense, assisted, it must be said, by the introduction of qualified majority voting. There are great lessons there for us in the Convention and in the IGC.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council has finally moved to a common position which the large majority of Liberals are able to accept fully. The first draft sought – absurdly – to outlaw political party campaigning with public money. What on earth are political parties for if they are not for campaigning? The new draft, however, has corrected this and is allowing sufficient possibility for political parties to receive modest private donations. The question of the threshold is settled quite reasonably in favour of small political movements with real and serious European objectives. Certain other officious bureaucratic provisions have been removed. This is good news for parliamentary democracy in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">Trans-national political parties are a vital sinew of democracy, articulating the anxieties and the aspirations of the citizen on a European scale. The constitutionalisation process in which the Union is presently involved requires the engagement of mature European political parties. This report is a breakthrough and should be supported by all those who wish this institution well and who subscribe to the principles of transparency and accountability. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, myself, in favour of them. I am convinced that, as integration continues to progress, they will be able to help our continent to continue to grow together and also help, progressively, to foster European awareness in every Member State. That is why I also think it a good thing that this overriding idea should be incorporated in the Convention’s draft for the Constitution, where it is enshrined in law in Article 45(4) in the section on ‘Democratic Life in the European Union’.</p>
<p class="contents">I wish to add my gratitude to that expressed by Members of this House to the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, to the Greek Presidency of the Council and also to the Commission, for enabling an acceptable compromise to be worked out yesterday. I see this as being very important in terms of this House’s political credibility. As those who spoke before me have pointed out, this problem has been pursuing us for a long time, and it must now be sorted out once and for all, as it is, above all, in the public’s interest that there should be nothing that the Court of Auditors might criticise in future. It is for that reason that I support the text of the regulation. In particular, the provisions in Article 3 on the 3% threshold and on the parties being represented in at least one quarter of the Member States are really important, especially to the smaller political parties. Commissioner De Palacio is of course quite right to say that it is an absolute requirement that the regulation should take political pluralism into account.</p>
<p class="contents">I regard the proposed rules on donations as clear and unambiguous. Above all, they safeguard the transparency of party finances, which is indispensable and – as you will be aware – a sensitive point, perhaps the most sensitive of all. This House should, in my view, speak out in favour of all information relating to donations being accessible to the public at any time. It would be for the best if, when the regulation takes effect, the political parties themselves were to undertake to post on the Internet all data relating to income from donations. With this in mind, I wish to express my endorsement of this proposal for a regulation.</p>

Undoubtedly, unlike Mr Ribeiro e Castro, I think that what has been produced is a genuine attempt at a compromise and one which I believe a majority of my Group will be happy to accept, although other colleagues who will speak in the debate will draw attention to particular points of concern.</p>
<p class="contents">From the point of view of the European Free Alliance which I particularly represent here, there are, however, genuine concerns about the way in which the criteria are chosen: the way in which one specifies what counts. Currently in this Parliament, the European Free Alliance represents a wide range of what we would think of as distinct countries within the European Union – Andalusia, the Basque Country, Catalonia, Flanders, Galicia, Scotland and Wales, to take them in alphabetical order in the English language – but of course, from the point of view of a criterion based upon States, that is only three States.</p>
<p class="contents">When I look at the new flags beautifully adorning the podium there, I see that there are flags of many countries which are present or future Member States and which are actually, in terms of either territory or population or both, considerably smaller than the countries I have mentioned. So the kind of movement in thought – and it is a European movement in thought – which the European Free Alliance represents is actively discriminated against by a criterion specified simply in terms of a proportion of the total number of Member States. That really is something that needs to be reflected upon.</p>
<p class="contents">A Parliament of this kind and a Union of this kind must have a very particular regard for the interests of minorities and for fairness to minorities and the rights of smaller groups. I know that the compromise has aimed to move in our direction and I appreciate that very much, but the fact of the matter is that there is still a serious difficulty from the point of view of this genuine European tide of opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Free Alliance has been recognised for a long time as one of the original Europe-wide political families, and yet we will stand on the margins of being excluded and de-recognised under these proposals. I am afraid we cannot support them in this form. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

They must, therefore, instead receive contributions from big business and trade unions and be able to dip into EU funds. Those who are to use the money can themselves decide how much they want. Under the new constitution, 13 countries will be able to vote down 12. The large parties will be able to use their majorities to prohibit subsidies for the smaller parties. They can also declare parties supported by the electorate to be un-European and take their subsidies.</p>
<p class="contents">The Council meeting also removed a ban on involvement in national elections. The supranational parties can thus turn the national parties into their compliant subsidiaries. The proposal has totalitarian features.</p>
<p class="contents">Let us put together a coalition to bring the matter before the Court of Justice. The proposal before us contravenes the principle of equality. In my opinion, the legislation is unlawful and should therefore be tested by the Court of Justice. For example, it is impossible for national minorities to obtain subsidies, even if they carry on appropriately cross-border activities. This makes matters impossible for new movements and parties, and difficult for others. There is a lack of equality across the board, and there needs to be such equality, in accordance with my own constitution, the existing treaties and the draft constitution that is now on the way. They all contain a principle of equality that also applies to this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is the first condition for encouraging a living democracy instead of creating an artificial democracy from scratch. The second condition would be to reject the idea of a statute for political parties, which was introduced by the Treaty of Nice; it seems to have more to do with bureaucracy than with a free society. Apart from this objection of principle, we also have a strong objection concerning the details, because the Commission’s proposal does not seem to us to be in conformity with the treaties. It wants in fact to finance European political parties, whereas the treaty uses a much broader expression, ‘political parties at European level’, which includes action at European level by national political parties. In our opinion, that constitutes real discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Mr President, I support Mr Ribeiro e Castro’s request that this text be referred back to the committee pursuant to Rule 130a of the Rules of Procedure, since 75 amendments have been tabled, which is far more than the limit of 50. I have heard Mr Leinen’s reply that some of those amendments are compromise amendments, but that concept does not in fact exist in the Rules of Procedure. Whether they are simple or compromise amendments, the text must be referred back to the committee if there are more than 50 amendments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Many of us see this as having been an historic day. This draft, which brought the Convention’s labours to an end, is meant to make Europe more transparent, efficient and democratic, and to bring it closer to the people. In our own time, parliamentary democracy is characterised by political parties campaigning in elections and by parliamentary deputies – nominated by these parties and directly elected by the citizens – joining together in political groups in the parliaments. The Convention is strengthening the European Parliament by extending the codecision procedure, conferring upon Parliament full budgetary powers and giving it the right to elect the President of the Commission after the results of the elections to the European Parliament have been taken into account.</p>
<p class="contents">Although we have spent the past few days applauding that this is so, and rejoicing that we have at last reached our destination, we have had, to date, no legally binding statute for Members of the European Parliament, because the Council is blocking it. Up to now, there has been no regulation on the legal status and financing of European political parties. We have no uniform right to vote. There are no European lists on which we can vote for candidates. Parliament’s adoption, during the last part-session in Strasbourg, of a Statute for its Members, closed a loophole. When, as I hope we will do tomorrow, we adopt the resolution on the legal status of European political parties – and especially following the Council’s decision on Monday, which we very much welcome – we will be closing a second loophole in democratic politics.</p>
<p class="contents">My group supports the document before us and the compromise motions, having vigorously campaigned to get this loophole in democratic politics closed. In doing so, we have done what Amsterdam and Nice have required of us. We are fulfilling our promise to the Court of Auditors by putting a stop to cross-subsidies between groups and parties, where such a thing still exists. By doing this, we are creating greater transparency, openness and clarity in political work and in the way in which political parties’ activities are funded. By doing this, we are helping to make the national political parties more European and the work at European level more democratic. We are, then, creating the conditions for European lists and for a uniform European right to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats is glad that a distinction has been drawn between the work of the Groups in this House and that of the political parties, as also between the functions of national parties and the work of European ones. We rejoice at the clear demarcation between European election campaigns and those in the nation-states. We welcome the clear rules on what donors can do. We welcome the clear qualitative and quantitative criteria and the requirement for democratic legitimacy, both of which must be provided for and complied with if a party is to have European status. This does not amount to discrimination against small groups, for a party is European only if it operates not only at national level, but also in a specified number of Member States in which it enjoys democratic legitimacy and has partners. This leads me to ask you all, tomorrow, to close the continuing loophole in democratic politics and thereby to ensure greater transparency and clarity.</p>

In his report, Mr Leinen explores the history of the institution of political parties. We owe him our thanks. With this proposal for a vote in favour tomorrow, the European political parties will acquire a legal basis and will strengthen the democratic character of the European Union. Again, my warmest thanks to Mr Leinen, as well as to Mrs Schleicher and Mr Corbett for their courteous reference to my somewhat older contributions. I will not conceal my personal satisfaction. I must also praise the work carried out by Mrs Schleicher during the previous stage. The European Parliament should be satisfied with the Council of Ministers' wording on both the questions at issue, both on the minimum number of Member States in which the party is active and on the sensitive issue of funding. Besides, the compromise amendments submitted resolve any problems there may be.</p>
<p class="contents">The democratic benefits of giving European political parties a legal status are many. I would refer to the following: there will be a deepening of the legitimacy of the European institutions. Giving the European political parties a legal status is a valuable complement to the constitutionalisation of the Treaties. In the field of the European political parties, the principle of solidarity between peoples at social level will be implemented via the substantial political rally of the national parties of the Member States. The role of the European citizen will no longer finish when he votes in elections to the European Parliament; it will extend to his mobilisation within the framework of the European political parties. The European citizen will turn from a citizen into an active citizen. On the question of funding, it brings transparency and protection of the party institution from unknown or questionable financial sources. Only with the institution of the European political parties can the process of unification in Europe finally become our affair, by which I mean the affair of the European citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to finish by congratulating the Greek Presidency, the excellent diplomats Messrs Mathioudakis and Venizelos, and also by informing the House of the personal interest of President Kostas Simitis who, both as a politician and as a specialist, had paid a great deal of attention to the institution of political parties. It was his particular wish to be able to count this law among the successes and work of the Greek Presidency. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am, however, opposed on principle to the use of taxpayers’ money for political parties. It is quite simply a question of whether parties are to be supported by public funds or by members of the individual parties. I believe they should be supported by the latter. In this matter, it is not the people, or the electorate, that have created a need for publicly financed political parties. The need that has arisen in this case has been created by professional politicians, and that is, as I see it, an artificial need. For what is a European party? For the individual taxpayer, it exists solely on paper and is a mere mirage, devoid of substance. In financial terms, there are no large amounts involved – as yet. This is the thin end of the wedge, however. I anticipate the aid increasing all the time, and it would grow at a rate in excess of the general rate of inflation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think a question mark can be placed over the democratic element in this proposal. The principle must be that, if we absolutely must give taxpayers’ money to European parties, all parties should be given it, and that would not be the case under the proposal. I am in favour of clear transparent rules, but I am not in favour of aid for European parties, and that is why I also reject this proposal. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The result of our debates is, then, that the taxpayer will have to finance and pay for all manner of banquets held by European political parties. It is annoying, but there is no altering matters. It is therefore our most important task to ensure that the aid is transparent. It needs to be possible for any citizen to check all donations to the parties on the Internet and, in the same way, the European parties’ accounts must be accessible to anyone curious about them.</p>
<p class="contents">Matters are not very satisfactory at present. For example, the accounts of the three big political parties are closed and opaque affairs. This is something we need, of course, to sort out, and I should therefore like to call for detailed monitoring of, and clear rules governing, what the money is used for. Allow me therefore to call upon everyone to take a look at the parties’ accounts in order to see whether they can in actual fact deduce anything from them. I can tell you now that they will not be able to. All they will be able to do is hope that party members will have had some really good junkets and beanfeasts around Europe at the taxpayers’ expense. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will explain why when I have finished what I have to say. I would also like to congratulate my friend Mr Jo Leinen on the quality of his work. It is almost faultless. He was right to draw attention to the importance of European parties, which are a vital structural tool in our continental debate. I think the representativeness threshold is right, with the reference to regional parliaments and setting a 3% threshold for European elections. The clause on checking conformity with the Charter of Fundamental Rights also seems a good one to me.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, I am still waiting for just one fellow Member to explain to me why a company would spontaneously give money to a political party. It seems to me that when you have to render account to shareholders and you give money, it is in return for a service. It also seems to me, as a mere democrat, that when an elected representative receives money for a service to be rendered, that is called corruption. Then people say to me: yes, but it will be transparent. I am not sure that transparency in corruption is a great step forward. They also tell me it will be very, very little money, the amounts will be tiny. If they will be so very small, why not none at all? If it is as little as that, let us do without that little and let us not prime the pump. Especially since the pump will be directed essentially at the parties in power, who will be able to return the favour. It will then be even easier for them to hold on to power because they will have money. They will be able to render more services and then we will be back where we started.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me back to my envelopes. Like those I have in my hand, the envelopes will multiply, fill with money and circulate, because it will be so easy to break amounts down to avoid all the ceilings and evade all the transparencies. I therefore give you due warning this evening: a day will come, ladies and gentlemen, when the newspaper headlines and the courts will be full of scandals involving the hidden financing of European political parties. I know that democracy, which serves the public sphere, has a cost, but that cost must be borne by the public sphere and by it alone. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">On the other hand, European political parties simply do not exist in any coherent form except in the minds of enthusiastic integrationists. The proposed European Union Constitution prohibits ‘any discrimination based on any grounds such as sex, race, colour, political or any other opinion’. It also says that political parties at Union level contribute to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Two recent opinion polls in the UK gave figures of 92% and 96% as wanting to leave the European Union, and yet this proposal would deny funding to any party who should dare to represent the views of that very large proportion of its citizens. It therefore goes against not only the spirit but the very letter of your Constitution. It does not promote democracy, it reduces it.

Moreover, it is not by chance that this debate is taking place at 10 p.m. and in secret. EUR 8 million are being shared out among us and it is clearly being done with the utmost discretion. Sharing among us is of course a manner of speaking. There are about 20 Members present and at least six or seven of those 20 Members are not destined to get any. It is not clear why. We are all Members of the European Parliament, we have all been elected, but we are not worthy of this party funding. Mr Karas has presented a democratic argument in favour of this great European project and it is a pity that the party he belongs to in his country will not get that money. Perhaps you know that, Mr Karas. Is that democracy? They are elected representatives and they are denied the means of survival. But they exist, Mr Karas, they are even your allies at Austrian level, but at European level they do not exist, they have no right to funding. This Leinen report and the consequences that flow from it are quite bizarre. What is more, we are discussing it in secret.</p>
<p class="contents">That being the case, my dear Mr Onesta, where are these European political parties? Do you know them? Can anyone join one of these European political parties we are talking about? In my country, I can join my national parties, you can join your national parties, the French Greens. We can join the trans-national radical party, and some Members have done so, but we cannot join these so-called European political parties that are going to receive a pile of cash for what are really meetings of amalgamations of European political parties. We saw clearly enough, during the Gulf crisis, for example, how these European political parties behaved. The Group of the Party of European Socialists, I take my hat off to you! Bravo for your united stance on the Gulf! The same goes for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Is there a single activist in these parties?</p>
<p class="contents">That is still all very unsound, ladies and gentlemen. I do not mind a bit of an effort being made to bail out the confederations of parties, but in the light of the European ideal it is not very fair, not very worthy. Incidentally, together with other colleagues from parties which – for reasons unknown – will not be getting any money, even though they are represented in Parliament, defend ideas here, are elected by millions of people, we intend bringing an action before the Court of Justice and we will see who wins!</p>
<p class="contents">I will end with a final word to Mr Leinen. You were very passionate in insisting that it should be the Commission that manages this money, that a directorate general should look after the parties’ statute. The Council said <span class="italic">niet</span>, and it seems you have tabled an amendment with the result that we no longer know who is going to give the money to the European political parties you are so fond of. It is not Parliament and it is not the Commission. Your compromise amendment is somewhat bizarre. I wonder who will give the money? Perhaps the Court of Justice when we bring our action and perhaps we will also claim damages. I am joking when I say that, but I also want you to know that the battle is not over. I think this report is seriously flawed and does merit recourse to the Court of Justice, and we will see then whether we are right to say, regardless of the contents, that it is quite wrong to propose financing two thirds or three quarters of this Chamber while disregarding the other third or quarter. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We think it is wrong in principle to take people’s money through taxation in order to synthesise an artificial sense of European identity. Many of my constituents, and, I dare say, even some of the constituents of the honourable Members who will be voting for the resolution tomorrow, would be horrified to learn that their taxes were subsidising European political parties whose programmes they might fundamentally oppose.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we believe that the bill introduces a dangerous principle of political discrimination. It discriminates overtly against some parties on the basis of their beliefs and covertly against all parties which see themselves principally in national terms and are accordingly reluctant to form trans-European blocks. So much, perhaps, will not surprise you.</p>
<p class="contents">I accept that the British Conservative Party is in a minority in this Chamber in championing the primacy of national democracy. I know that most Members of this House believe that a working democracy at European Union level is feasible and desirable: that is a perfectly honourable position, but I would appeal to such Members to ask themselves whether these proposals are truly democratic. In a pure democracy there should be as few restrictions as possible on how people choose their representatives.</p>
<p class="contents">Having been elected, politicians should be free to associate in any combinations they wish. They should be able to express their opinions openly and they should be allowed to raise funds through any method that their voters will tolerate. Laying down legal criteria for recognition dilutes democracy and infantilises the voter. If a politician expresses noxious views, it should be up to his constituents to remove him, not the courts, let alone his political opponents. If he is thought to be financially dependent on some vested interest, then that too should be a matter for his voters, not the authorities. The bill before the House tonight traduces these principles. It goes so far as to introduce a mechanism where parties which are at odds with the political convictions of the majority may be disqualified, a measure surely more in keeping with the old Warsaw Pact than with the democratic Europe to which we are notionally devoted.</p>
<p class="contents">In a free political market place, good ideas will triumph, not because bad ones are suppressed, but because people are able to distinguish between truth and falsehood. If our constituents are not able to make that choice for themselves, their moral capacity is diminished and a measure of their freedom is lost.</p>
<p class="contents">Democracy is not just a slogan, a trite word to attach to any idea of which we happen to approve. It has a very specific meaning and it is incompatible with the measure before us tonight. True Europeans, honest democrats and sincere lovers of freedom should vote against it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A new legal basis was created and qualified majority voting came into force. This is the background to our current debate on the new proposal for a Regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">This proposal does in fact signal some progress in Europe, but I cannot forbear registering my disapproval – consternation, even – on noticing that the recognition of European political parties as legal persons has not yet been confirmed. Furthermore, we have only just reached the stage of dealing with their funding … These are the reasons why this report, and the perseverance and tenacity it reveals on the part of the rapporteur, Mr Leinen, has earned my full support for the clarity and even-handedness with which the original proposal is explored. I am referring particularly to the report’s discussion of recognition of the parties’ legal personality, clarification of the scale of the resources available to them, and openness regarding their Community funding, which should be subject to normal audit inspections. The report holds the Commission responsible for administering financial resources, relieving the European Parliament of that burden in order to avoid giving rise to unnecessary suspicions. Unlike the proposed Regulation, the report permits European political parties to use their funds to subsidise the activities of national parties and conduct European election campaigns.</p>
<p class="contents">The approval of this Regulation will be the first great achievement of the institutional framework on which European democracy rests. It paves the way for the urgent completion of the Statute for Members and the essential uniform electoral law for the European Parliament. I hope that the institutions involved in the legislative process will now assume responsibility for their actions. Mr President, a statute for European political parties, with transparency of financing as its principal theme, is urgent and essential. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that is absolute nonsense, because we are at present in a situation in which we have no financial aid for European parties and yet we do in actual fact have European parties. It is not up to the Commission or the Council or the European Parliament whether or not we are to have European parties. It is up to those who are politically active in Europe. It is, moreover, up to the people of Europe whether we are to have European parties. Now, we are talking about whether they are to be given money into the bargain.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the view being taken, namely the belief that a European democracy or a European public can be brought about through European parties, is quite wrong in a democratic perspective. In my view, it is the other way around. The presence of European democracy and a European public gives rise to European parties. It is the ‘bottom-up’, rather than the ‘top-down’, mentality we should be adopting in this case. This proposal is unfortunately an expression of the ‘top-down’ mentality, and I shall not support it.</p>

We know that women are still very much under-represented, even though they make up half of Europe’s population. If women are not adequately represented in political life, this also shows how little progress the political parties have made as regards gender equality. The political parties now have the task of making the principle of equality a political reality, and parties funded with European money also have the task of representing the public in an appropriate way. We therefore want the Statute on European political parties to make the allocation of funds conditional upon a balanced male/female ratio.</p>
<p class="contents">The parity that we are proposing should be an obvious thing, and it is indeed regarded as such in a number of Member States, France being an example. The French National Assembly unanimously adopted a law on parity. We should not merely be paying lip-service by stressing how important equality is. Today, we have again made this clear in the Convention, where equality of treatment has been set down, once and for all, as a fundamental value. Nor must we merely appeal to the business world and demand that it should refrain from discrimination, if we ourselves are not willing to do so. That would lose us our credibility. I therefore appeal to you to adopt our proposals as a matter of urgency.</p>

Even though I would endorse the report in the light of the undeniable need for the European dimension of political parties at the very moment the Convention is launching the Constitutional draft for the European Union, the system actually proposed can hardly hide the inner tendency to transfer the American way of doing politics to the European landscape. It is more than evident that even the most acute analysts cannot distinguish the main differences between Democrats and Republicans, as is highlighted by issues such as the recent occupation of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The proposal we are dealing with shows a clear will on the part of the European Union's lobbies to abandon the historical European arena and to embrace political confrontation in its stead, following the American model. The financing scheme leaves no doubt about it.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we should not ignore the fact that the proposed rules discriminate against political parties of its stateless nations, such as the Basque Country, as Mr MacCormick mentioned just a few minutes ago. Moreover, if amendments such as that proposed by Mr Gil-Robles go through, the question remains: has he asked for respect for the laws of the Member State in which those parties operate?</p>

There is no doubt that all the evidence of history indicates that we have to regulate the funding of political parties. There is no other way of ensuring that parties are not corrupted. We have far too many examples right across Europe of private money corrupting politics and the regulators.</p>
<p class="contents">A lot of people, certainly in my own country, are shocked that some of the money they have paid for buying a house has been used to corrupt the planning laws. They will be quite happy to have their tax money used to ensure that the political system remains uncorrupted or becomes corruption-free. There have been a lot of spurious arguments here tonight, particularly about thresholds for receiving funding. I am not aware of a single Member State in the European Union that does not have a regulation with regard to thresholds for the funding of political parties. Indeed, there are thresholds for getting elected to Parliament, never mind getting money for political parties.</p>
<p class="contents">The Statute we are dealing with, taken together with the Statute of Members of Parliament and with the very positive outcome of the Convention, indicates a coming-of-age for the European Union. I hope that the summit this week takes its courage in its hands, approves this Statute and approves the outcome of the Convention. We can really say that we are on the way to creating a European demos, a real public space for the citizens of Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Funds from European taxpayers are deployed to accelerate and facilitate the setting up of such parties. This makes those parties particularly artificial. The <span class="italic">raison d'être</span> is not the common goals and activities of the associated members, but the need for a state administration at European level.</p>
<p class="contents">My party, the Dutch Socialist Party, is quite happy to work with like-minded Left Socialists in other countries, provided it can do this from the bottom up instead of from the top down. In our opinion, these arrangements are not the right way forward. In fact, our objection would be much greater if, modelled on the German system, party structures and the drafting of lists of candidates were prescribed in detail, or if a distinction were drawn between parties which support a Europe that is governed in a centralist and uniform manner and those opposed to this, between centrally organised parties of individuals and loose associations of cooperating national parties or between large and small political movements.

<p class="contents">I do appreciate the point raised by Mr Corbett on the need for the anomalies in some of the translations to be corrected, but I believe that what we can infer from the various speeches that have been made is that – although some Members have certain reservations about the text or even objections to it – most of you, ladies and gentlemen, agree that this is a balanced text and one that will enable us to regulate a specific situation and which indicates the support that should be given precisely to those political parties that shape and promote the idea of Europe, in a transparent and responsible way.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we can achieve a text that is adopted at first reading and avoid a debate that, as you all know very well, honourable Members and representatives of the Council, has been pursued at great length. I also hope that, thanks to this debate and to measures that have been adopted recently, we are finally going to be able to resolve the matter and move ahead with constructing the Europe that we all want to see: a Europe that is transparent, responsible and at the service of the citizens. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>
