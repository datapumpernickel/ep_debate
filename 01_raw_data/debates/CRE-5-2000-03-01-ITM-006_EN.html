Celebrating this day should involve bringing together two basic aspects: first, the aspect which makes us remember our ability to relate to the history of this cause and of everyone associated with it, and amongst these I would like to highlight, in order to be completely fair, non-governmental organisations. There is also the symbolic aspect, which has the potential to take the cause of equal opportunities for men and women into the future.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">By eliminating something that has always been sidelined, this celebration will contribute to men and women seeing themselves as both the origin and the purpose of their own dignity, in a process which is concerned not so much with sanctifying time, but with purifying it of prejudice. This kind of celebration makes sense because, by discussing the past, we give ourselves the opportunity to free ourselves of the stigma which has, throughout history, affected women because they have been forced to live in poverty, because they have had to accept second place in terms of education, and because they are naturally weaker, which exposes them to gratuitous violence, and to being forcibly excluded from positions of power and from the decision-making process. Furthermore, women have suffered because of their health, which is affected by motherhood, by violence, and even by sexual exploitation. They have also suffered from the burden society imposes on them in terms of family responsibility, a weak economic position and, as regards employment, from lack of time for themselves, and also, from the whole complex process of treating women as sexual objects, from which they suffer as regards the media, trafficking in women and sexual exploitation. The list of human rights which are abused where women are concerned simply goes on and on.</p>
<p class="contents">The scholars of ancient Greece bequeathed to us the assumption that there is a natural link between equality and justice. Aristotle was unequivocal in stating that “the just man complies with the law, adheres to equality and makes us comply with the law and equality, whereas the unjust man leads us to illegality and inequality”. In contrast with the apparent simplicity of this philosophy, however, Voltaire warned us two thousand years later that “equality is the most natural cause and at the same time the most utopian. As man is given to excess in everything, when he can be, he is excessive in his inequality”. Modernity and the system of democracy in which it exists is based on the idea of a social contract, a form of association which, in the words of Rousseau, “defends and protects the person and property of each member with all common force and according to which each member, in association with the others, nevertheless only obeys himself and remains as free as before. As a result of each person committing himself completely, the conditions are the same for everyone. Because the conditions are the same for everyone, it is in no one’s interests to make the conditions more difficult for anyone else”. We know however, that these conditions of equality and universality did not include women. In post-modern society, now that we have declared that Rousseau’s social contract is no longer sufficient, we must call for a new form of contract, one which is richer and more enriching because it is more in tune with human nature, with its natural polarity between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">We must seek a new kind of social contract between men and women, but this proposal is a result of democracy itself. We are living in an era in which politics has become debased and in which democracies suffer from a lack of political commitment on the part of their citizens. We must look at this fact in the light of the implications of the combination of citizenship and democracy, concepts which mutually define each other. To my mind, preventing women from fully exercising their rights as citizens is one of the determining factors in the crisis of democracy, which only an integrated policy on gender equality can help to reverse. This highlights the goal of parity, which will take shape when a democracy of equals emerges, a new model which will bring about a new social contract between men and women, a path or short-cut towards an inclusive society. Globalisation has various implications for democracy. It accordingly highlights the need for a new ethic, as the shortcomings of personal and social ethics have been demonstrated time and time again. The concepts of fluidity, mobility and speed are taking hold on a hitherto unseen scale: a world-wide scale. Concepts and realities such as transnationalism, regionalism and tribalism have established a permanent place for themselves in our daily lives, causing problems and dilemmas, often in very drastic ways. Whilst progress towards democracy being irreversibly established throughout the world appears to have become an accepted fact, we are discovering at the same time the extent of the social suffering caused by the effect of globalisation on the weakest sectors of society and therefore on women, as poverty insists on being a feminine word and on having a feminine face.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the accumulation of wealth and power has led to a rise in the number of socially excluded people. Technological progress has brought with it an increase in unemployment. The globalisation of the economy and of financial systems has stripped the state of powers it previously had, and the state has now been relegated to the position of a parallel state. At the same time and as a result of this, we are seeing the emergence of nomadism, which is making social inclusion more difficult to achieve – another point to add to the factors I have already mentioned. In short, exclusion certainly takes many forms, but it is a constant source of shame within our system, which is coming to be defined as the “democracy of our discontent”, in other words, a process of exclusion, disaffection, stigmatisation and disqualification unparalleled in history or in any part of the world. </p>
<p class="contents">Under the Portuguese presidency, and bearing in mind the efforts and the contributions made by the various Member States, the Lisbon Special Summit, which will be held on the theme ‘Employment, economic reform and social cohesion: towards a new Europe of innovation and knowledge’, seeks to counter these risks, which have historically always been more serious for women, particularly in those areas most directly related to the specific theme proposed. </p>
<p class="contents">So the summit is intended to adopt measures which will establish conditions for access to knowledge, to lifelong training and to overcoming the constraints that make people shy away from technological advances with all the implications that this may have. We are therefore seeking to overhaul the European social model and at the same time to increase employment and social cohesion. We are seeking to adopt a position which will reverse the traditional exclusion of women, which is determined by the responsibilities traditionally assumed by women. This will only be possible if there is a new social contract in which reconciling family life and professional life is given strategic importance and in which “sharing” is the key word.</p>
<p class="contents">It is, however, in the world of politics that the exclusion of women can be seen most vividly. That is why the choice of today’s subject shows such good judgement, as it will be a determining factor in the future, once equality is established in legal terms. Introducing the feminine approach is crucial if we are to deal with the complexities of modern life. It is obvious that the lack of real equality betrays a lack of legitimacy in our political structures and demonstrates how unrepresentative they are. All of this reveals the inadequacy of simply establishing legal equality which, although it was intended to guarantee equality from the outset, has not been able to guarantee this in practice. The supposed universality of the writings of the founders of modern democracy, whom I mentioned earlier, did not involve treating women as citizens. Women were not thought of as having rights. Given that real democracy presupposes and implies the equal participation of all citizens, on this evidence the difference between the sexes leads to a significant strengthening of the democratic system. Humanity is divided into two sexes, and we need a system in which discussions and decisions are undertaken by men and women on an equal basis.</p>
<p class="contents">Parity means a balance between men and women in the way social and political representation are structured. Being a woman is one of the two fundamental ways of being human. Women and men are aspects of humankind that separate as much as they unite and these two sides are therefore brought into constant competition with each other. A balanced democracy, if we accept this observation, derives benefit from the creativity this generates and uses it to make decisions which are the most correct, fair and appropriate to the problems that they are seeking to solve. That is why I believe in parity, the new face of sexual equality, which gives universality back its true meaning and its rightful place in a politically organised society. </p>
<p class="contents">The Beijing Action Platform represents an historic point in the long journey that we are talking about today. Therefore, the assessment of it which is now under way must not be an excuse for taking a step backwards. It is not a new declaration, merely an assessment of how the Member States that have signed up to it are actually complying with it. Its principles, the values it enshrines and the objectives it seeks to achieve must be upheld. It is true that it could go further, but it should never be disparaged. This is the position that the EU must adopt. </p>
<p class="contents">The conclusions of the European assessment procedure carried out in January in Geneva are in line with this and confirm once again the need to fully implement the twelve areas identified. The process leading up to the launch of the Fifth Community Programme for Gender Equality 2001-2005 is also under way. From what we know of this process, it seems obvious that it is crucial to pursue and strengthen the policy of equality between men and women at Community level because, despite all the progress made and all the work done, we still see significant examples of disparity between men and women in economic, political, social and civil terms. In its capacity as the current holder of the presidency of the Union, Portugal welcomes this programme and wishes it success so that we can build a Europe of equal opportunities for all.</p>
<p class="contents">Women and men shape and structure the societies in which they live through the interplay of the differences between them. This proposal offers a new way of viewing public and private life; it is designed to combat the public’s suspicion of politicians and of their behaviour, an alternative designed to overcome distrust about the way in which democratic structures function and about their transparency. Furthermore, this is a process designed to minimise the disaffection felt by sections of the public towards the traditional political parties and their approach to politics.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of gender equality brings a certain added value to society by benefiting women as well as men in terms of helping them to fulfil their personal, social and professional potential. It will furthermore contribute considerably to social progress, by acknowledging and fostering each gender’s own resources, by helping to strengthen democracy, by bringing the decision-making process closer to the voting public, by introducing new approaches to the political scene which take specific account of women, and by helping to improve the quality of life and to strengthen democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">A Portuguese thinker, reflecting on the issue of equality in 1922, stressed that “a prerequisite for equality is equality of rights and power.” I am sure that no one could deny the wisdom of his attitude, and that no one who recognises the truth of it would deny that it is a fundamental part of democracy. So let us build that democracy! This is the only way in which we will be able truthfully to state that humanity is a form of solidarity that has continued throughout history.</p>

Two centuries later, we have achieved a great deal in Europe. The last century was marked by three periods. The first period was a period of institutional change, change in the legislative framework and huge constitutional victories in all the Member States as a result of the fight by the women’s movement, as a result of major decisions by progressive parties and as the result of action by enlightened men and women. This was followed by a second period, in which the worth of female models was recognised. There were women everywhere. Prime ministers, members of parliament, ministers, in the professional arena, doctors, lawyers, pilots, generals. We are now in a third period: in this third period, the composition of the bodies which wield political and economic power needs to be changed. The composition, or rather the change in composition, will also bring about changes in policies – policies which need to take account of the merits and experience of both sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, the first few months of the new millennium have been marked by two important events: the first was the election of the President of Finland, Mrs Halοnen. For the first time in Finland, the women candidates outnumbered the men. And a woman was elected. The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the ‘Women and Men in Power’ conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio. We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States. But the figures tell the true story. And the figures still give Europe cause for concern. 24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others. The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small. Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%. What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies. We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively. We need organisation and statistical monitoring. We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area. And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth.</p>
<p class="contents">Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important. These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State. I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool. The programme which I shall present for the fifth women’s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring.</p>
<p class="contents">Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector. My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light. There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women. Nor must we underestimate the representation of women in economic decision-making centres. Here too, specific efforts will be made of course; naturally they cannot be of a legislative nature, but they can operate on the basis of an exchange of best practices; in all cases, my initial contact with the chairmen and directors of these large companies has had positive results.</p>
<p class="contents">As you know, Europe is endeavouring to solve the problem from within. A decision has already been taken on quotas of 40% for each sex on all teams and on all research and technological development programmes. It was approved by the House in May 1999, when the need for women in research and technology was stressed. We in the Commission are obliged to set a specific and clear example and all the Commissioners are working together, as can be seen from the reform of the Commission, to achieve 40% representation of women on all the committees of the European Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, crypto-progressive objections, as to whether there should be a binding undertaking on the representation of women at the centres of power. No one ever asks in a federal state if all the members of the federation should have their say. And at the level of the European Union, the question of whether the 15 Member States need to be represented on every committee will never be asked. Why then is it curious and why do we have reservations when it comes to a legislative commitment on the representation of half the population. I should like to be absolutely categorical. There should be no reservation, no reservation whatsoever about a legislative commitment on the representation of women at the centres of power.</p>
<p class="contents"><span class="italic">(Applause)</span></p>
<p class="contents">Women make up half the population, half the strength of the planet. Excluding women from the centres of power means, first, democratic failure and, secondly, under-exploitation of human resources. We face a unique challenge and the time is ripe for combining economic and political expediency with respect for basic democratic principles. I am optimistic that we shall succeed. The bet before us is a bet with time. Future generations of women must not be sidelined. If need be, we must use all possible means to force the situation.</p>

I must also thank the Commissioner for being here and for her words.</p>
<p class="contents">The various political groups generally agree on the easily verifiable observation that women are under-represented in the decision-making process, in both the political and the economic and social spheres. Nobody nowadays disputes that women should participate in political life, in the parties and in the institutions but it is not easy to agree on how this participation should be achieved. The equality between men and women which most affects the lives of women and therefore society in general is equality in work. This involves both equality in accessing work, which implies equality in training, and equal pay for the same work, so often defended and yet far from being achieved. We are convinced that the participation of women in the decision-making process will be beneficial to society as a whole. Women always have a different viewpoint from men. This serves to enrich and complete the picture of the best solutions to the problems in daily life which people like us, who are dedicated to active politics, undertake to solve. The difficulty lies in finding the right solution to allow women to have a greater presence in positions of responsibility and therefore in decision making. In some countries of the European Union a compulsory quota formula has been adopted which immediately produces a more equal presence of women. However, this is not always the best solution as there are not always enough women ready to enter a difficult and competitive world which they regard as essentially masculine because it has traditionally been reserved for men. Women are not participating in political parties and in the working and social world at a level of fifty per cent. The real percentage is much lower and it is this participation at the grassroots which we must promote in order to ensure a greater presence of women. There must also be a clear and real will to allow more women, who are ready and able, to assume responsibilities and commitments in political life and therefore in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no clear agreement within the PPE-DE Group in support of the compulsory quota system. Some Members have even come out against this. Personally, I would not want to feel like a quota, to think that I was in a particular job because I was a woman. This is a feeling which men will never have and it is an important difference. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the beginning of this century, the French government sent out a beacon, a bombshell on the equality of opportunity policy front. For the first time, there must be equal representation of men and women on electoral lists. In taking this step, the Head of Government, Lionel Jospin, has also set down a marker for the European Union. It happens to be today that Finland’s newly elected President, Tarja Halonen, takes up office. And so the women in Finland have also set down a marker, for this is the first time they have had a female Head of State. Unfortunately, the same does not hold true everywhere. Sadly, less than 7% of the contenders for the next elections in Greece will be women. There, too, there is certainly a lot of catching up to be done. They did not follow the Council recommendation of 1996 on equal involvement for women and overcoming the under-representation of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Although women form the majority of the European population, they are still largely on the sidelines. When they aspire to higher office they soon hit the glass ceiling. We should fight to break through this glass ceiling. Unlike the previous speaker, it is my belief – and my Group is united on this – that we should set quotas, and binding quotas at that, for women have worked hard. Women have an outstanding profile in the European Union; we have demonstrated team spirit and have acquired decision-making powers and social competences. Binding quotas also require reliable statistics and must not be excluded from any sector of society. </p>
<p class="contents">We need this new social treaty, we need the fight for power, money and distribution of work, which must favour women. Looking back, I would say that the men could have given us solid support in this fight. Unfortunately, they have made little effort in this regard as well.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">It is my hope that we will continue to work on the Beijing Action Platform and that we will have the vision to progress from having a Women’s Day to a Women’s Millennium.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think it was an excellent example the Commissioner gave when she said that no one would have dreamed of having a situation in which the fifteen countries of the European Union were not equally represented but that it was a different matter when it came to equal representation for women. It could hardly have been made more abundantly clear, what we are concerned with here. I do hope that the Commissioner will have the necessary perseverance to also produce the necessary reforms within the Commission – but then, of course, she is young and full of energy. I am convinced that it will be hard work, when all is said and done. If the Commissioner asks for support from Parliament, she can in any case count upon the support of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. We have a very strong interest in seeing equality introduced to the Commission and in seeing the necessary basis for decision making secured so that the Commissioner can implement her views on equality. </p>
<p class="contents">I would say to the Portuguese minister that I completely agree with her that what is at issue here is the fact that you cannot obtain equal rights without equal power. That is absolutely crucial. It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women. Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children. Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves. What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides’ surrendering power. </p>
<p class="contents">The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark. And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark. In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland. We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing. </p>
<p class="contents">I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources. It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term. In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated. The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures. One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments. I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures. In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up. </p>
<p class="contents">There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally. The first is the issue of the media’s influence. I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish. Do we have a special problem in this regard? I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question. I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain. The second point is the enlargement of the Union. I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all know to what extent women are under-represented in decision making at all levels because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves. I agree that accurate statistics too are essential because it is only when we see the figures changing that we will know we are beginning to overcome the problems. It is systematic monitoring which will reveal this.</p>
<p class="contents">Mainstreaming is a long-term commitment and process. In the meantime, we need positive action and this means the use of quotas and other measures. We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual numbers of women that were elected, but the effect that has had on the nature of government to illustrate that everyone benefits from a truly representative system. I am pleased to say that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our national assembly members are women as the result of positive action by the political parties but, on the other hand, we have only 4 women MPs from Wales in the House of Commons which is only 10% of the total; so statements of principle, of support in principle, are not enough because they have not worked. If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is also worth noting that International Women’s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years. In 1910, a woman’s right to vote was on the agenda. Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process. </p>
<p class="contents">Women are no homogenous collective. Women belong to different social classes. Women have different individual needs and interests. Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add). </p>
<p class="contents">In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run. This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research. What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making? What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed – and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made. </p>
<p class="contents">When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word “qualifications”<span class="italic"> </span>also crops up. What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined. It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications. Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence. This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today’s decision makers. </p>
<p class="contents">Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday. In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the “Women’s World Marches” which are to begin this spring on International Women’s Day. This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world. </p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother. We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics. It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible. In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors. The vast majority of them are not members of any party. In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories. In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected. But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates.</p>
<p class="contents">Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system.</p>
<p class="contents">On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses. The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women. With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions. It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation. The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs.</p>
<p class="contents">On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women. A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota? Women deserve more than a quota. It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The same applies to human rights: they are often formulated and written down, yet still they are not upheld in many areas. Therefore, I have nothing but criticism for many such documents when it comes to women’s rights. In principle, I believe that, as in other areas, it is only possible to reach solutions in the sphere of women’s policy on the basis of partnership and mutual understanding. Women’s policy should not be formulated in such a way that it is as if women are working against men, rather women and men must join forces in order to seek and arrive at socio-political solutions.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Turning now to the motion for a resolution tabled by the Committee on Women’s Rights and Equal Opportunities: demands are being made to the effect that a balanced distribution of men and women within the EU institutions should be guaranteed. Does that mean that a regulation on quotas is to be introduced? Although a woman, I myself am against quotas, for I do not want to be a token woman. Rather, I want to be assessed on the basis of my performance and not on the basis of my gender. I know from experience that many women share this view.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers.</p>
<p class="contents">But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, – if they are not applied blindly, without distinction – have increased the number of women in the decision-making process. That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women’s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women. According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically. Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, Commissioner, you can go ahead. You do not need to wait for a new amendment to the Treaty.</p>
<p class="contents">May I just remind you once again of our request for an amendment to the 1976 directive which has been watered down and misapplied with regard to the equal treatment of self-employed people, including assistant spouses.

<p class="contents">The presence of women in decision-making bodies, in particular, is a question of democracy. All citizens, both men and women, should be able to see, to feel that they are genuinely represented by those they have elected and those who rule. If we consider the fact that more than half the population is made up of women but that that there are many more men than women present in these decision-making bodies, it is clear that we are still far from true democracy. However, it is also a question of political agendas. In addition to making up the majority of the population, women are also the most dynamic element in society: it is women who have made the greatest contribution to the creation of new enterprises in Europe in recent years; a greater percentage of young women obtain irregular work contracts than men, and in many of our regions, they are the main feature of the innovation, training, performance and flexibility development model. Out of a sample of women who work in and around Milan, where I live, 90% said that they do not have enough time to do all they need to in a day. Women work an average of 60 hours a week, which is 20 hours longer than men. The price paid by women for following their desire to be protagonists in all spheres is that they never have enough time. If this is true, and it is, any appropriate policy which aims to find positive solutions to these problems must start from this point. Laws, programmes and interventions must be implemented which are well-constructed, coordinated and audacious, in order to encourage the formation of new cultural, economic, social, institutional and political ruling classes whose modernity is characterised by the involvement of women.</p>
<p class="contents">Much has been achieved on many issues in Europe, but we are still far from resolving the question of equal representation. I agree with the Commissioner that it is time for the European political sphere – the entire European political sphere – to represent women and men on an equal footing, and for decisive action to be taken in this matter.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I urge you all, women of the Right, to listen to Mrs Lulling, because she told us why quotas were needed and, if any of us has sufficient experience of political life, it is she. Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we also raise this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference.

This means that we need to amend policies in various areas if we are to guarantee that women can participate on equal terms in the decision-making process.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that this area is proving more difficult to resolve, both because women still bear the main responsibilities in family life and because there is still prejudice and personal interest standing in the way of genuine participation by women in various areas which involve greater responsibility. The truth is that the scant participation of women in centres of political representation and decision making demonstrates a democratic deficit which is incompatible with genuine democracy. It is therefore essential for the various directives on equality to be complied with and for the Council, the Commission and each Member State strictly to respect the commitments they have made, particularly at the Beijing Conference.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Quite simply, I would say that there are several ways in which to attain positions of power and I am particularly against the system of quotas, because I believe it is especially contemptuous of women and I come from a country where parity has just been achieved. It is quite logical, it is consistent! It should have existed for a long time because women represent more than half of society and it seems quite clear to me that it is natural for them to represent at least 50%, if not more, of those within decision-making bodies and, inter alia, in the political arena.</p>
<p class="contents">So, there should be no positive discrimination to include women. Woman are capable of getting themselves included because they are pragmatic and full of common sense. When I see that we are asking for training for women in politics, I want to say – no, definitely not. Let us impose training for male and female candidates in politics – but why especially compel women to undergo training? That simply amounts to acknowledging their inferiority. But I do know that we have never felt inferior to men, particularly in politics. So I believe that we are conducting this battle to assist our fellow countrywomen to achieve decision-making power, to gain responsible posts in the political arena, but I believe that it will only be achieved if we completely change the way people think. We shall all have to be sufficiently strong to force our political leaders to voluntarily impose women’s participation in the political decision-making process.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women’s voices. Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields. That is unacceptable in a democracy. </p>
<p class="contents">Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making. If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required. An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women’s full participation in power structures and decision making. I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind. </p>
<p class="contents">I propose that the EU’s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated. </p>
<p class="contents">Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes. The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted. Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work. In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping. </p>
<p class="contents">The call for women’s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women’s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full. Not to use women’s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste. Women should not only be “half of heaven” but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have high hopes for what you will achieve.</p>
<p class="contents">We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions. We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today. Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world. In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values.</p>
<p class="contents">We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for. Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women. We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies. The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women. The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased. We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece. I think this is a very sad state of affairs. </p>
<p class="contents">I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda. This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution. I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result. It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance. </p>
<p class="contents">It is true that a number of countries in the European Union have already introduced quotas, and you yourself made reference to Belgium, Commissioner, where it has not really taken off. Hardly surprising, would you not agree, Mrs Avilés Perea, not because we failed to find the necessary candidates, but because recent scientific research, instigated by the Commission, has shown that quotas are, in fact, only useful if women are placed in the appropriate safe seats. This is why we need to be sensible about applying quotas. </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, Minister, we should strive for a democracy based on equal representation as a new social contract. But we should draw the necessary conclusions from this. The electoral system which corresponds most closely to this model is the one-for-one system, as is being applied in Sweden on a voluntary basis. I would suggest the following: where possible, apply it on a voluntary basis, where there is reluctance, impose it. I hope that in the fifth action programme, Minister and Commissioner, benchmarking will enable the best practices of those countries to be carried through, for it is time that our groups gained an understanding of this.</p>

<p class="contents">Because it has been said that men do not usually get involved in discussions on women’s rights, I thought I might contribute the views of a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama, to today’s debate. In an article entitled “If women ruled the world”, he maintains that if women were more involved in politics, the world would certainly not be so wedded to violence. Athena, the goddess of wisdom and war, may have been a female model in Ancient Greece, but the influence exercised by women today can act as a catalyst to stop militarisation and promote peace. There are, therefore, serious grounds, over and above justice between the sexes, for distributing public offices and political and economic power fairly and evenly between men and women.</p>
<p class="contents">Women devote their entire lives to the endeavour to protect life and the environment through dialogue, reconciliation, an understanding of different views and resolving differences by peaceful means. These female virtues can offer an alternative to today’s culture of violence and institute a new political culture and a fairer and more prosperous society for everyone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the Intergovernmental Conference must introduce into the Treaty the principle of balanced representation of women and men in all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decision-making centres throughout the Community. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

And how should we achieve this? We all agree on the fact that it needs to be done and why it is necessary. It is a demand for simple justice and for democracy and, as such, a condition for political legitimacy. But if we look into how to achieve this, the opinions are greatly divided. Is it sufficient to provide information and training and to create practical conditions or should we give preferential treatment, much like the quota system for the electoral lists of the political parties? And is it then up to the state, in other words the legislative, to impose such measures on political parties? Or should we even consider a system in which 50% of seats are reserved for women in elected bodies? </p>
<p class="contents">This discussion, which is being held in some parts of Europe and here too under the French banner of <span class="italic">parité,</span> touches the very core of democracy, and is also about the political significance which we are prepared to accord to being a woman. In my opinion, the political battle should be fought at a political concept level rather than at a gender level. I am a great fan of voluntary quotas on electoral lists, without which, in fact, I would not be here today. Like Mrs Van Lancker, I am a product of such a measure. In my opinion, though, the state should not and must not use coercion to interfere in the internal affairs of political parties, at the risk of jeopardising democracy itself. In other words, the means which we employ to give women their rightful place within the political democracy should not lead to a system of gender apartheid. We would, in this way, violate democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Members were prepared to discuss rather than simply raise questions and we have heard some valuable insights into the topic being discussed. We have all recognised that if democracy is to be strengthened, it is crucial for women to have greater decision-making powers and to participate more in the decision-making process. This was universally acknowledged. The differences of opinion were about how this objective can be achieved. When quotas were being discussed, I had the impression that in certain statements made by women Members, the quotas themselves were the objective, and as such, should therefore be opposed. To my mind, quotas will – as was stated here, moreover – be merely a provisional instrument.</p>
<p class="contents">I can tell you what happened in Portugal last year when a law on quotas for party lists was discussed. This government bill was rejected by our parliament, and all our political leaders stated that quotas were unnecessary because, of course, women and their skills were essential in strengthening the democratic process, so in the imminent elections the lists would reflect the need to take advantage of women’s skills. The lists were published, the elections were held, Parliament was convened and only one group, the Greens, which has just two women MPs, fulfilled the commitment that they had all given, and exceeded it at that. This is the reality of the situation. I do not think that anyone in this House feels that quotas are a positive thing, but they are perhaps a necessary stage in the process, not because men do not acknowledge women’s competence, but because positions that women deserve to hold have, for a long time, been occupied by men. Furthermore, it is difficult to take people off the final lists in cases where a certain personal fondness may be involved. This is one problem. </p>
<p class="contents">Another problem is the fact that women are not generally interested in participating in politics. Women obviously find it hard to be interested in taking part in politics as they have much less time available to them than men and as the organisation of the political parties, which is thoroughly male-oriented, serves as an excuse for time continuing to mean different things for men and women. If a political party holds a meeting in the evening and the man cannot go home because he has to attend as he is a member of the party’s executive, that is seen as a good reason for the man not to go home to play his part in the household chores, which are also his responsibility. Therefore, until there is a change in this idea of sharing, sharing the responsibilities that the right to have a family implies, obviously nothing will change in terms of women being able to participate in the political process.</p>
<p class="contents"> </p>
<p class="contents">Indeed, we are still suffering from problems whose causes we have not yet resolved. However, in order to find these solutions, we need measures for positive action which contribute to them. One woman Member of this Parliament said that this problem must not become a battle of the sexes. I too agree that it should not be a question of war between men and women, because thinking men and women who are genuine democrats agree that we would be justified in considering that the present situation does not reflect a genuine, representative democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore fail to understand what the problem with quotas is, given that in principle, they will only be used as an instrument in countries where women are under-represented and where these draft laws have been approved in parliaments where, by definition, men are in the majority. If they approve these laws, it is because this process is about consensus, not imposition, nor is it a battle of the sexes.</p>
<p class="contents">So I think that all this needs to be studied and debated. We need to know whether it is worth continuing to wait for decades until this process resolves itself naturally by means of an increase in the numbers of women in higher education, at universities, and in their economic and social power. This might finally happen unaided in approximately the third millennium. Or perhaps, on the other hand, we are already in a position today, thanks to the use of procedures such as benchmarking and statistical information gathering, for assessing how positive the results are in terms of good practice, and we have what we need to build the very thing we all claim to believe in: a democratic and pluralist society based on balanced participation by men and women. These measures for positive and balanced action respecting people’s dignity must be adopted in various areas. At the moment, we are not taking advantage of women’s dignity, usefulness, competence, their vision of the world, their knowledge, their ways of being, knowing and acting, and these qualities are being completely wasted across all social, institutional, economic and political processes.</p>

<p class="contents">The presidency is therefore extremely keen to support initiatives designed to radically change this situation, even if it has to use transitional instruments which have already proved to be the only way to achieve the objective of balanced representation in decision-making processes. The presidency is extremely anxious and entirely committed to support these methods, not as objectives in themselves but as a means to an end. Today, figures are available which show us the reality, which reveal the enormous disparities in this area between the various countries that constitute the EU and we are therefore fully briefed about the situation. It seems to be a universally acknowledged fact that greater involvement of women is essential. Instruments are available to us which can provide a more balanced division of tasks between men and women, so that they can reconcile their private and professional lives. We must therefore make use of whatever instruments for positive action we may need in order to change the current state of affairs.</p>

We have entered a new period in which there is a fairly full institutional framework and in which women are well represented in all sectors, education, work, culture. The problem which we have to deal with is how to change the composition of the decision-making centres. The debate is a deeply political one.</p>
<p class="contents">There are two approaches. The first is a policy of persuasion. Gradually everyone will be persuaded that women can become involved. Three comments: the first is based on the fact that women are able. I can, therefore all women can. How do we respond therefore to the fact that women are excluded? We are able but the rest of the female population is not? Here lies the danger of female arrogance in politics. Because women have to deal with different realities. Because they have fewer opportunities. Because they have a different level of education. Because they have to face social obstacles. Because they never have time to deal with matters of public interest.</p>
<p class="contents">The second comment is that we need to persuade the political leaders. Not necessary! They have all been persuaded! There is not one male politician who does not agree to the involvement of women. There is not one party, from the far left to the far right, which does not stress the need for women to take part. On paper!</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, we must expect things to change gradually. The women’s conference in Beijing brought an important point to light. With the rate at which the representation of women is developing at international level, it will take 2,300 years to achieve a balance between men and women. As far as Europe is concerned, as far as the European Parliament is concerned, where there is a quota for the involvement of women, it will take 25 years to achieve balanced representation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second approach is a compulsory legislative commitment on the representation of women. Quotas alone are not enough. If only a legislative decree were all it took to change centuries of history. On this we are clear. Quotas are one<span class="bold"> </span>of the ways, one of the policies needed to bring about change.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, on the question of whether, as the product of quotas, we can be proud, I would reply categorically that I would be very proud to be the product of a quota because it would mean that I had managed to impose quotas on Greece, where the level of representation of women is 5%.</p>
